0.73 2.11 A: (( hello )) 

1.67 3.63 B: hello there you are 

3.35 6.12 A: howdy my my name's ed 

5.74 8.82 B: hi ed i'm jeff from oregon where are you from 

8.10 12.35 A: i'm in nevada in the middle of nowhere [laughter] 

11.02 13.99 B: [laughter] the middle of nevada nowhere huh 

13.22 17.74 A: at least we're on the same time huh [laughter] south pacific time 

15.06 22.03 B: yeah [laughter] you sound like you're from the south or something huh just a nevada accent oh 

21.70 29.59 A: no no i just ah utah and nevada all my life so i guess i w- i guess we are cowboys here though 

25.66 26.80 B: okay 

28.75 32.78 B: yeah so this is ah new to me have you done these before 

29.94 31.70 A: [laughter] 

32.79 36.32 A: no you're my first call [laughter] so like 

34.25 35.27 B: okay 

35.42 38.83 B: w- what was our topic we're talking about computers in education 

38.21 43.35 A: computers in education yeah [laughter] sounded pretty cool i guess so 

43.48 55.39 B: well i'll go first i guess ah i think it's kind of a double edged sword about whether they're beneficial or harmful um certainly they're beneficial in the sense that ah technology has made things um [lipsmack] 

55.44 59.67 B: speedier and ah more efficient and um 

59.69 66.37 B: certainly a ah good tool whole lot better than the calculators we had in when i was growing up and going to school [laughter] 

66.30 69.56 B: but um i also think that ah the 

69.50 83.46 B: kids can depend on 'em too much and if if they become a crutch rather than a learning aid that ah it can be something that can actually ah stunt learning would me my though about all that 

83.31 89.51 A: [lipsmack] yeah ah i guess i'll go with that i guess ah since i've been a computer freak for thirty years 

89.04 90.75 B: yeah 

89.68 98.09 A: i might be a little biased [laughter] b because i li- so ah i'll be forty four next saturday so 

91.32 94.35 B: well i'm a computer freak too so how old are you 

96.64 99.39 B: okay i was i just turned forty eight 

97.99 109.73 A: and ah and ah so you know i love you know i learned over the years how much it you know brings people together and how much you can communicate and stuff like that and 

107.50 108.41 B: uh-huh 

108.73 119.25 B: well you sound like you have a lot of similar computer background to me i started when the p._c.s first came out in the mid eighties and before that was doing punch cards with fortran on mainframes and whatnot in school 

119.02 121.97 A: yeah we're a lot alike then yeah 

120.78 128.60 B: yeah and then when the computers came out i was using them for socializing too with the whole bulletin board systems long before the internet w- came along 

128.31 130.35 A: yeah three hundred baud 

130.00 132.04 B: yeah oh absolutely 

130.49 131.21 A: and 

131.78 135.23 A: (( dual baud and computers was one of my first ones )) 

133.38 136.27 B: [laughter] those were the days weren't they 

135.72 142.55 A: people don't even remember the old clico adam that was a pretty cool computer [laughter] and 

138.76 139.68 B: yeah 

140.10 141.12 B: yeah 

141.44 144.91 B: three hundred baud modems you got to love 'em [laughter] 

142.83 150.32 A: just ah yeah they kind of ah f- as far as education goes ah i kind of feel the same way i kind of feel that ah 

150.51 159.43 A: that it it's amazing you know what what the kids can get get now as far as information and stuff like that okay ah 

154.50 156.20 B: yeah 

157.57 159.40 B: mhm 

159.38 169.13 A: a good example though is you know and i have some i don't have any children myself but my partner here has a a young boy and he's pretty much he's sixteen now 

168.83 170.52 B: yeah 

169.54 173.16 A: and whatever but ah i watched him he came over he 

173.40 176.80 A: ah had been in on the wrestling team [lipsmack] 

176.62 189.88 A: and he needed a paper and it was really due because he hadn't had time you know much to do it and so i ki- i let him get on the internet and i can't remember exactly what the topic was that he had to 

180.26 182.03 B: mhm 

189.99 194.63 A: i think it was a health issue or something like the croup or something you know 

193.71 195.03 B: yeah 

194.74 199.40 A: and ah i kind of just sat back and kind of watched him and ah 

199.52 201.81 A: he pretty much copy and pasted 

201.52 203.45 B: [laughter] 

202.49 207.19 A: you know what i mean and and in less than about twenty minutes ah 

203.52 204.45 B: yeah 

207.40 210.70 A: ah he had him a nice little paper and ah 

209.42 213.20 B: [laughter] that someone else essentially wrote 

212.36 218.31 A: and i i was curious you know the next day i had to ask him well how'd you do and he said i got an a 

217.90 219.21 B: yeah 

218.66 224.45 A: and ah it kind of disturbed me and i thought you know there's a lot of information out there 

224.62 228.51 A: and there's a lot of stuff but it's kind of hard to replace a book when you 

227.92 230.94 B: yeah at least when we had books ah 

229.38 233.35 A: have to read it yeah [laughter] 

231.05 240.67 B: and we had to do reports and if we copied things ah even word for word we will still have retype the darn thing [laughter] we couldn't just cut and paste it 

237.64 239.51 A: (( yeah )) 

239.97 243.22 A: yeah yeah yeah well we we we used to have to reword it ah 

242.57 244.14 B: yeah 

243.24 246.78 A: make it not sound like a textbook or something and ah 

245.12 246.28 B: exactly 

246.97 252.78 A: but i i kind of felt i kind of feel the same way that that that if it's used in the right way 

252.99 257.87 A: ah maybe as information where they read it and learn from it 

256.86 258.63 B: mhm 

257.93 262.28 A: and stuff like that that that it's good but i think that ah 

262.50 268.10 A: that it offers a a little bit too many ah shortcuts to to the kids nowadays 

267.44 278.78 B: yeah yeah well i agree i think that you know when you're talking about things like excel and spreadsheets that those are obviously very useful tools but if you're going to pick up somebody else's format 

268.44 269.81 A: (( and ah )) 

279.11 280.19 B: (( um )) 

280.42 291.93 B: i mean i suppose if you adapt it to your own particular situation whether it's a business paper that you have to write or or whatnot then at least you're having to do some thinking and formulations on your own but 

291.81 300.44 B: um but you know if you're just copying word for word something or a template word for word then you know what what possible things can you learn 

297.50 300.00 A: so yeah then it 

300.59 312.12 A: and another thing too i i've always loved to read i'm a avid reader and i can do it very fast so i could read a book in a couple of days or something and it's very 

303.83 304.92 B: mhm 

307.07 308.78 B: yeah 

310.83 318.71 B: i don't know i'm not in touch with what the schools teach these days but i know that a lot of schools even have computers on every desk and what not and ah 

318.51 328.41 B: i don't know do they even still teach teach say times your basic times multiplication tables in school anymore are they just skipped all that and say use the computer or the calculator you know 

328.72 340.52 A: and that's and i kind of laughed when it said the topic because i thought of what happened the other day and i thought hm well yeah i have an opinion on that now i might not have until a couple of days ago 

336.66 338.09 B: mhm mhm 

340.24 341.25 B: yeah 

340.52 350.60 A: i really hadn't thought about it much but i kind of kicked back and watched him and i it really did bother me and i thought he didn't he didn't learn anything at all d- he didn't ah 

342.49 343.44 B: yeah 

349.15 362.64 B: yeah and at least when you and i were learning computers we were actually having to learn as we went along and 'cause there weren't necessarily things to copy from we would have to use our brains basically to figure things out 

360.26 361.66 A: yeah 

361.99 375.45 A: and then that's another thing you you can understand that because you go way back like me ah you know now we got the you know x._p. and all of that and ah you don't really have to think too much to use the computer either ah 

366.09 367.93 B: mhm 

374.77 380.02 B: yeah well i suppose you still have to learn how to navigate it but even that if you're 

375.68 376.99 A: um pretty much 

380.05 383.32 B: there's so many tutorial programs out there that ah 

383.95 395.55 B: [sigh] that you know there's something to be said about learning through tutorials but if you just say oh i don't even want to bother doing that and somebody'll just show me or or whatnot then how much learning can you do on that 

394.70 409.03 A: and then of course i go to look at you know i have what got me into it many years ago and stuff and and stuff but it was games you know i have a i am a gamer [laughter] got to have our you know i've got my hundred and twenty eight megabyte 

403.52 404.31 B: sure 

404.46 405.33 B: yeah 

409.36 421.08 A: you know g. force fifty six hundred card you know [laughter] everything and and all of that and you saw the news reports the other day that the the you know that indicates that it does 

412.69 413.55 B: sure 

413.80 414.83 B: yeah 

421.35 427.75 A: that those games do help children i- improve their reflexes and their concentration so 

427.05 428.60 B: yeah 

428.09 432.18 A: so ah so [lipsmack] you know maybe they should be playing 

430.60 443.04 B: well i'm sure there's also studies that say quite the opposite too though that that they're overly addictive or ah distracting so you know for every positive game study there's probably going to be a negative one out there too 

442.75 449.85 A: and yeah and i bet you there's a lot of negative because you you know a kid that spends ten hours on the game isn't reading a book 

446.03 447.90 B: mhm 

448.90 450.12 B: yeah 

450.28 453.94 B: well i it's our t._v. generation ah what are we going to do 

450.41 451.17 A: (( you know )) 

452.41 463.85 A: [laughter] yeah and so he's not reading a book if he's he's spending ten hours playing the game yeah he's going to have good concentration and i guess great reflexes but ah 

459.04 460.96 B: mhm 

464.16 469.11 A: ah he might not be able to read too well [laughter] 

466.16 472.66 B: [laughter] i don't know i'm no- not a big v- video gamer when i play games i'm usually trying to 

472.65 477.27 B: games that at least have some thinking or even if it's just a simple game of freecell or ah 

477.23 488.01 B: or ah hangman or something or at least i'm challenging or chess or whatever backgammon on the computer something that i can at least ah use my brain to think about as i'm playing the game you know 

486.82 490.64 A: so yeah and i'm pretty much the same way you know the ah 

490.80 496.05 A: ah myst and and those type of games where you have to solve a lot of problems and 

495.33 498.11 B: right right those those are fun 

496.15 499.68 A: and ah and to learn so ah maybe if 

498.63 504.35 B: yeah the seventh guess was one of my favorites in that thing with all the puzzles that they had involved in it 

501.76 502.71 A: more 

504.26 510.86 A: if more games were like that i think that that would be a great ah a great learning tool but ah 

510.93 516.81 A: it seems to me the trend nowadays is ah they're not those games aren't as popular as they used to 

515.75 518.91 B: no the shoot 'em up games are the popular ones [laughter] 

517.50 520.90 A: be for pretty much pretty much and ah 

519.97 520.79 B: (( you know )) 

521.11 522.62 A: i know the ones 

521.24 536.16 B: which i think is a statement of our society in general with ah [lipsmack] shoot 'em upping ah what what most of the movies i mean we went and saw a whole bunch of movies this weekend because we got some free passes and i couldn't believe it you know all the kids are are flocking into matrix and ah 

536.15 547.56 B: and x. men and i mean yeah the x. men was okay matrix i didn't really care for but i mean there's the whole genre of the type of movies that's just another extension of what they're doing on the computers you know 

546.93 553.71 A: yeah it's just the it's pretty much a movie turned into or a video game turned into a movie 

552.98 555.32 B: yeah [laughter] 

554.38 559.65 A: and ah that doesn't definitely doesn't appeal to me [laughter] and so ah 

557.73 559.31 B: [laughter] 

559.92 561.09 A: (( and ah [lipsmack] )) 

561.44 563.01 A: so i i 

563.21 571.38 A: and then you get a look at you know the the information on there there is a vast amount of information that that's available 

571.85 575.65 A: and then then also there's there's literacy of ah 

575.89 578.81 A: of kids nowadays you know you remember i mean 

579.25 584.23 A: back you know when i was there like i had to the time i lived in salt lake city utah 

583.77 585.56 B: mhm 

584.70 597.61 A: and stuff and there was about twenty of us in that whole city and we'd meet in a certain place and it's called sugarhouse up there it's a part of salt lake city and we'd all meet and learn about our computers together 

597.28 598.34 B: mhm 

597.88 599.89 A: and stuff and it was a great learning
