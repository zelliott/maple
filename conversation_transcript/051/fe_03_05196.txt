78.42 79.70 A: (( but ah )) 

82.12 84.40 A: i'm a pretty good cook myself 

84.55 90.82 A: and the whole idea of cooking just brings out how much time it takes and and all of that and so 

91.42 92.30 A: (( [noise] faster )) 

91.43 96.40 B: so you don't exactly get a whole lot of joy out of the preparation process then

98.48 107.23 B: i'm beginning to learn more about enjoying the preparation process my wife seems to be very indulgent in it she she likes 

107.81 110.49 B: the whole process of cooking 

110.90 112.64 B: and the mild 

112.93 114.13 B: ah some

144.89 146.87 A: yeah 

147.01 150.41 B: just fast and simple and something to just get it out of the way 

149.95 153.11 A: (( yeah [mn] well i ah [mn] )) 

153.55 168.18 A: i'm in this this work out programme where i'm supposed to eat six times a day and three of the meals are these protein shakes but the other three meals are a handful of carbohydrates and a handful of protein [mn] 

168.19 176.60 A: so um a chicken thigh and a couple of pieces of bread counts or a piece of fish and a apple and things like that 

176.85 178.05 A: so 

178.44 189.60 A: it's real it's real straight forward it's real simple it's real easy i cook on sundays [mn] and it's thirty six portions [laughter] so that i can get through this 

190.03 192.95 A: so eating ah 

193.48 195.83 A: is is not really a 

197.27 198.84 A: a big deal

215.45 217.28 A: [mn] ah i have 

217.71 228.16 B: we like those a lot for when we like to dine out simply because we find we tend to be very ruddish when we do out we'll find some place that we like 

227.95 229.83 A: yeah 

228.69 234.99 B: and our list of where we like to eat is very short so unless we

238.33 248.77 B: for us we'll we'll we'll just get into a rut and then the next thing you know we're just not going there anymore because it's the same old same old don't even bother with anything else o- on the menu

307.60 313.72 B: if i would have to have a top ten list then i would say that sushi would definitely fall within the top 

313.98 315.59 A: (( oh )) 

316.31 319.36 B: ten yeah and i'm i'm just a very very big fan 

319.63 323.72 B: of i lived in japan for a year when i was in high school 

323.80 326.60 B: and i just fell in love with the cuisine there you 

326.53 328.39 A: (( [noise] [noise] [mn] i see )) 

329.09 338.89 B: know on your on your diet it sounds very much like a a similar diet that my folks were on to remove some free radicals from their diet 

340.24 347.18 B: where they're keeping a close eye on their on their protein intakes and even more so on their 

341.46 342.36 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

347.20 349.09 B: carbohydrate intake 

348.95 350.19 A: (( mhm [cough] )) 

349.51 353.37 B: um partic- particularly starches and things of that nature 

354.28 355.79 B: [mn] i was kind of curious 

355.97 358.76 B: does ah your diet fall into a particular um 

359.91 361.14 B: overall 

360.34 360.95 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

361.78 369.88 B: plan behind it ah is it just is it mainly ah weight reduction or is it a health consciousness style diet 

369.77 375.62 A: well it [mn] i i stumbled into this as as part of um 

375.72 383.13 A: um a muscle building build muscle burn up fat programme that i did about three years ago 

383.78 388.33 A: but ah what they don't tell you is that once you start this 

388.76 394.83 A: your body tends to like it i get hungry six times a day [laughter] 

393.79 397.42 B: [laughter] 

396.09 402.21 A: and what will handle the hunger is a handful of protein and a handful of carbs 

402.25 403.65 A: and um 

404.53 411.53 A: it's it's not for any particular purpose at this point other than ah it just tends to ah 

412.42 413.61 A: i i 

413.82 416.20 A: i function better that way [mn] 

416.27 417.79 A: (( so ah )) 

419.82 425.41 A: [mn] when i was ah going to the gym six times a week and you know um 

426.19 438.12 A: constantly striving to improve and really conc- being concerned of whether i've lost enough inches off my waist and all of that it was a a major thing to be rigorous about 

438.22 441.64 A: right now it's like oh i'm hungry [noise] 

441.76 447.86 A: [mn] so you know this is what it'll take to to handle it and i almost don't even think about it 

449.01 450.02 A: the 

451.05 458.38 A: the real time that my attention goes to food is as part of a date situation or something like that 

457.71 466.41 B: now what are some of the elements you do look at when you're dining out what are some key features that you find are quintessential 

466.06 467.85 A: well um 

468.57 483.39 A: first of all [noise] it's got to be a place that gives you something to talk about so i i really like interesting places that have interesting art work or ah good music or 

483.71 485.64 A: um you know 

486.07 489.12 A: there's a steak house that ah 

490.48 492.92 A: [mn] ah is kind of ah 

493.41 498.55 A: texan in in style and so you know once an hour 

498.57 505.34 A: ah all of the waiters and waitresses kind of line up and do this texas line dance stomp kind of thing 

505.22 506.55 B: [laughter] 

505.48 507.68 A: and that's [laughter] 

507.83 521.53 A: now they have absolutely the the best prime rib the best steak you know in the state that that doesn't hurt it but you know that's always a always fun to have people what are they doing and kind of wake up to 

521.87 525.23 A: there's a an indian restaurant where 

526.47 541.47 A: [mn] ah you don't realize it at first but a lot of ah the artifacts that they have in these glass cages are solid gold very very expensive very very ah rare very very beautiful 

541.52 546.56 A: and that's always nice to you know as a conversation opener 

546.95 552.00 A: but the food has to be has to be really good i think um [cough] 

552.58 558.45 A: in this part of the country the food has to be really good if you're going to survive as a restaurant because 

558.65 559.53 A: (( ah )) 

559.70 563.46 A: a lot of ah tourists are are looking for 

563.49 571.90 A: new experiences and the regulars are so jaded that unless it's exceptional we're not coming back [laughter] 

570.54 572.21 B: [laughter] 

574.25 576.60 A: ah the other place ah 

577.64 580.54 A: that had a a similar kind of um 

581.68 584.36 A: restaurant standard was um 

585.52 586.96 A: [lipsmack] san francisco 

588.02 593.18 A: there you know the food was excellent just about any place you went 

595.66 599.84 B: [noise] i think one of the things we look for is we're certainly
