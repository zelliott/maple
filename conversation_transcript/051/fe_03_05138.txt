428.92 430.40 A: so i mean he never 

429.32 431.02 B: so he doesn't need a computer 

430.82 438.03 A: no he never he never did get there i mean he never did you know he didn't learn anything i guess you know he's probably not going to i mean 

437.89 450.52 B: but in those inspection jobs isn't there aren't there things to input and and ah computers that that you have to record all of the what's gone in what's got out what you've done 

450.64 457.84 A: well i where where he's working now i don't know but ah where he worked before as a model maker ah down in that shop

488.64 498.46 A: right he kept ah he kept a pad of paper right there at his desk and you know and for all his calculations and and he could figure radiuses of circles and diameters and you know i mean he could do it he could do it all 

498.55 504.20 A: and um but he but you know computers were something that he just just never had 

504.22 508.73 B: and maybe didn't like maybe there was something about it that was ah 

509.20 514.11 B: i dunno dehumanizing or just impersonal so impersonal you don't feel like you're 

514.51 524.53 B: or you know there's all kinds of ah rats on on the internet ah ah for completely innocent adults it's not not about children

562.59 567.19 B: business and that was all on a computer banks of computers 

567.09 579.57 B: and one of the other guys was well into his fifties i'd say he was almost fif- sixty and still wanted to work and learned the computer and became a consultant and knew how 

577.96 578.81 A: wow 

579.50 588.54 B: to do so much because he sounds like the kinda guy that you were talking about very very bright able to do it in his head anyway maybe it would take a little longer 

588.58 591.35 B: but because he was that bright he had a real 

591.77 592.92 B: um 

593.26 598.68 B: high interest in learning and he made the learning curve very low he kept on
