39.53 40.30 A: (( okay )) 

40.68 46.33 A: um yeah we're going in and what do you think about all the soldiers that have been dying 

46.51 50.43 A: already what is it a little over a hundred now or a little under two hundred 

50.48 53.51 B: oh um i mean it's 

54.03 60.73 B: it's kinda unfortunate you know that there were lives lost but at the same time i guess 

58.51 59.42 A: mhm 

61.02 61.93 B: it's 

62.49 67.28 B: i guess it's kinda necessary uh i guess um 

67.14 70.85 A: do you know why we're over there and why we're fighting 

71.44 78.91 B: um well basically from you know from the news and the t._v. um i guess they say that it is to 

79.00 83.91 B: liberate iraq you know from saddam hussein's power 

83.56 85.15 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

84.75 92.86 B: so it's really i guess you can say we're kind of doing a favor for the iraqi people but at the same time 

91.69 92.44 A: yeah 

93.00 94.75 B: removing a uh 

94.97 97.41 B: [mn] i guess a threat for us 

97.05 104.72 A: mhm i just hope we don't um because you know one of the major things in the u._s. is the oil and how we get our um 

103.12 103.93 B: (( mhm )) 

104.80 106.37 A: gas from over there 

105.96 107.19 B: mhm 

106.54 110.03 A: i just hope it you know it's for them you know what i mean 

109.68 111.02 B: mhm 

110.42 111.50 A: um 

111.54 119.08 A: bush with some of his tactics i find him okay at some times and not so okay at others 

118.82 119.74 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

119.47 131.81 A: um one time you know i thought he was really good they're talking about how people were protesting the u._s. in the streets over there in iraq and everything and his comment was to that it was um 

128.66 129.57 B: (( mhm )) 

131.76 139.77 A: that's good you know now they're free and they can finally do that whereas if they did that before they'd be killed which is good you know um 

137.10 138.01 B: mhm 

138.71 139.60 B: right 

140.03 142.61 A: yeah i think it is eliminating a threat 

142.71 150.36 A: in some way um i just hope we don't try to take over their economy and it is for them 

148.28 149.19 B: yeah 

149.99 152.61 B: yeah well yeah i think um 

152.94 158.63 B: in some way i i don't want to see iraq to be a like a colony of u._s. or something 

157.94 159.42 A: mhm exactly 

159.17 169.78 B: because uh they they should have their own government and they should have their own people who who will be their government in their country so 

167.19 168.68 A: agreed definitely 

170.03 177.64 B: yeah i also heard about that theory you know that where we're we're going to iraq because of the oil and stuff 

177.61 185.14 A: yeah yeah i mean there have been i know that we have taken over some but i just hope it's all given back at the end you know what i mean 

184.78 186.11 B: mhm 

185.49 190.24 A: yeah i don't i haven't heard much more about it lately but 

189.25 190.69 B: yeah 

190.30 192.23 A: yeah 

190.98 193.36 B: yeah haven't heard much about it either 

194.02 195.28 B: so uh 

195.35 197.02 B: (( mhm )) 

196.48 198.70 A: do you think because you know um 

199.56 203.14 A: all the kids growing up in the middle east you know they 

203.18 212.25 A: kinda come like oh we hate the u._s. we hate you know because of the propaganda or when they grow up do you thing that'll ever diminish or what 

212.05 215.29 B: hm i don't know that's hard to say i mean 

215.99 227.64 B: some certainly from like a t._v. and stuff whenever the u._s. troops like i guess take control of a a town or something you see the p- the the kids 

228.68 232.41 B: and the young people always like you know crowing to the camera 

232.54 234.43 B: smiling and staff you know 

233.96 235.35 A: (( mhm )) 

234.98 239.15 B: and so from that perspective seems like they were 

239.19 250.50 B: glad in a sense i don't know and i don't know if it's are they really glad or do they just want to be on t._v. [laughter] or something [laughter] but um yeah but it seems like the 

245.35 248.25 A: (( mhm yeah [laughter] yeah )) 

250.50 261.67 B: the the impression they got is it's good regarding you know the u._s. troops and stuff it it seems like the older people are the ones that may have naked 

255.88 256.69 A: yeah 

260.98 262.08 A: yeah 

261.63 265.52 B: feeling you know they think well this is our home you know and 

262.17 263.21 A: mhm 

264.94 266.88 A: yeah 

265.68 269.29 B: (( whatever i don't know so i don't know what do you think )) 

269.47 273.77 A: um we think we got six minutes out of the way [laughter] uh 

274.71 276.08 B: i'm sorry 

275.48 280.30 A: nothing um yeah i don't know i 

276.49 277.63 B: [laughter] 

280.50 287.69 A: i i hope that that goes away you know but with the stereotypes all over the world with different people you know 

287.38 288.75 B: mhm 

288.14 295.81 A: um in every case you'll get the person who they just hate the person or country whatever or they don't 

295.15 296.49 B: (( mhm )) 

295.87 303.28 A: um i hope it dies down i think one of the big thing is the harboring of terrorists at this time 

303.05 303.91 B: (( mhm )) 

303.57 309.72 A: going in and capturing them that's great i think that's what we need to focus on right now 

306.02 306.85 B: (( mhm )) 

309.80 310.87 B: yeah 

310.26 312.96 A: but i don't think we should be uh 

313.52 317.47 A: uh [mn] how would you put it like taking places over you know 

317.32 318.15 B: right 

317.78 325.91 A: turning over every single stone in a way we'd be blowing it up um so that's my feeling on it mhm 

320.22 321.07 B: mhm 

322.23 323.18 B: mhm 

325.60 335.78 B: yeah yeah i mean i totally agree you know you you should let the people return to a their normal life as as quick as they can you know 

335.91 337.16 B: rather than 

337.31 341.32 B: making their environment still like a war zone or something 

340.66 345.54 A: yeah but then again i don't want the u._s. to turn into war zone myself 

345.42 346.77 B: right 

346.13 359.59 A: and i you know after the nine eleven and all of that you just hey you think before that you know you would think oh this could never happen but now that it has happened then it makes you think twice 

349.94 351.27 B: mhm 

356.94 358.13 B: mhm 

359.42 365.14 B: mhm mhm yeah do you know any um any 

365.18 366.78 B: i guess uh 

367.09 370.00 B: people who actually went to iraq

493.58 494.52 A: wow 

493.97 502.35 B: and then uh he he told me once that he was you know driving around and then he found this pizza place
