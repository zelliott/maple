186.55 199.65 A: i may i may try that but i i ah my experience shows [laughter] that it's ah it's hardly ah it's hardly possible and tell me about y- y- your your best best friend i mean what what is it you are looking 

199.65 207.95 A: ah for ah in in in a best friend i mean that makes him special what are the [noise] qu- the qualities th- that you're looking for

234.68 235.27 A: (( [noise] )) 

238.84 242.15 B: we chat via the internet but i probably speak with him on the phone 

241.46 255.82 A: [mn] yeah i i know with with with the internet and stuff i mean it's [noise] ah it's it's you know this virtual reality it it makes ah reality pale in comparison sometimes so but i still prefer i mean a a 

256.03 265.09 A: it's it's ah you know in real life it's ah real time it's it's much better with do do you do you do you think so or 

265.32 268.14 A: or it's not you do 

265.54 275.20 B: yeah i i do but um i i still think there's a lot of of friendships can transpire um via you know non face to face contact 'cause i- 

275.13 286.73 B: it's simply communication and actually when you speak with somebody on the phone they almost have no choice but to sit there and listen to you but when you're actually interacting with them in person it's generally during another activity [laughter] 

286.50 297.14 A: yeah but y- y- you know sometimes it's so important i mean to to you know to see the ah the look in in his or her eyes ah to hear their 

297.40 298.89 A: (( ah [noise] you know to to s- )) 

298.97 307.92 A: to see the the and the tone of voice it's it is those those little things but they do mean a mean a lot see 

308.06 312.52 A: and it's i i still ah stick to you know to the 

312.67 313.91 A: but 

314.07 324.07 A: [noise] of course maybe it's old fashioned but ah it's um but it's true and ah be- because you you were if you only um 

324.23 328.49 A: ah speak to a person you know through um 

328.89 331.41 A: [lipsmack] through the web and and it's ah 

331.43 334.84 A: it's kind of gets kinda webby right [laughter] 

335.44 337.73 B: well i i can understand what you mean 

337.13 338.95 A: (( you can understand that )) 

338.27 342.68 B: emphatic but but what about your best friend how would you describe him 

343.07 344.80 A: what is it 

343.99 346.16 B: so how would you describe your best friend mhm 

345.18 353.00 A: [noise] ah my best friend ah described as a a like i told you you know it's it's a person first of all 

353.09 367.65 A: who i'd listen to his ah particularly when ah ah when he is in trouble he is he goes through hard times i i i'd listen to him and and not only listen but i i i 

367.77 373.18 A: i i i feel i feel the same i'm on the on the money with him a- always 

373.25 385.51 A: and the same is true about him like this friend jimmy that i told you about um then ah that's number one that's number one number two is that when i 

385.45 397.32 A: you know there are moments in life when you are not understood even by your v- very very um close er family members and this is when 

397.43 403.48 A: ah you know your friend [noise] comes into the picture but and and it's ah 

403.58 416.55 A: it's it's so important because you know there are moments when you you can you you can despair you can you can do even you know worse things but but having a good friend having a friend that you can rely on 

416.84 419.42 A: ah it makes you feel 

419.45 426.19 A: like you're not alone that that that there are some other people who can understand you 'cause they feel the same way [noise] 

426.26 430.05 A: that's that's number two do do do you ah is it the same with you 

430.16 436.32 B: yeah i i i agree totally i mean even if they don't agree with you they can still understand you and i think that's important 

436.25 443.81 A: yeah it it is extremely important because you know it's again it's one of those things in in in life that ah 

444.17 448.52 A: (( are not always they're rare [noise] they're rare )) 

448.64 451.53 A: [mn] particularly these days you know and and ah 

451.86 457.32 A: and hard times are they do happen you know [laughter] it it just happens 

457.77 471.56 A: um and number three things ah ah number three you know among the things that i'm looking for in in in a friend is is and real friend i mean not just an acquaintance and that um a- and number three is ah 

472.62 480.71 A: [mn] it's not ah necessarily ah ah true of of all the all the friends but in most of my close friends i 

480.79 488.68 A: um [mn] i i find that they like or even love the things that i do 

488.82 497.95 A: and it's important too because ah [mn] the it it it just shows you that that your tastes your your 

498.01 501.80 A: (( ah understanding are are ju- )) 

501.87 508.40 A: they may be unique but they are not ah they do not make you just a you know a 

509.25 512.84 A: [mn] [noise] [mn] a white crow right 

512.99 514.68 A: do do you ah do 

514.40 516.65 B: (( mm )) 

515.00 525.18 A: you feel the same way or or is it is it not this quality is not necessary for it i mean in a friend 

522.72 529.34 B: mhm mhm i i think init- yes i mean that's how you actually initiate friendships is you know through shared interests 

529.43 537.20 B: and then i think it kinda be- grows beyond that but i i definitely think that it's important in in the foundation of a friendship 

537.47 544.96 A: yeah it it is it is um ah you know ah friendship i mean so much is written about it but it's ah 

544.96 554.10 A: it's ah it's what ah every everyone discovers it as if as if it it was something new something that that you 

554.84 562.43 A: [mn] ah i mean [mn] all all the stuff you read ah may be may be good but you have to ah 

563.33 567.66 A: to actually experience it yourself and and then ah 

567.70 572.57 A: these things er become important [noise] and and understandable understandable 

572.37 577.01 B: mhm i mean just like love i mean how many songs are about love and friendship is 

576.86 580.18 A: love ah love is ah [laughter] [noise] 

580.29 588.69 A: love is something love is something different [noise] l- l- l- l- friendship friendship comes to me friendship friendship comes ah 

588.99 599.95 A: comes first in m- and and in many ways it's it's superior to love 'cause love is maybe tainted by some other things you know and and you know
