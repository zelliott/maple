0.00 1.18 A: (( hello )) 

0.03 1.50 B: (( this is james )) 

1.64 2.48 A: who 

2.42 3.63 B: uh this is james 

3.31 4.60 A: hi this is don 

4.53 5.97 B: hey don how're you doing 

5.62 7.54 A: i'm i'm pretty good how are you 

7.37 8.89 B: not too bad 

8.37 10.60 A: good 

9.04 13.08 B: so who do you feel is a a a a continuing threat to the u._s. 

13.15 21.14 A: i don't know i mean i think that's that's gonna continue to shift and i don't think it's necessarily based on national boundaries as much as it is on ideology 

21.02 21.80 B: yeah 

21.21 31.45 A: uh i i think it continues to shift depending on you know especially in the last like year and a half two years with sort of the continuing uh chest thumping that we've been doing that 

31.40 38.17 A: more and more groups are you know people of certain ideologies are becoming a threat because of we're threatening them 

37.08 39.46 B: exactly i mean it is i mean you know 

39.56 43.65 B: political states come and go and it's gonna come down to you know whatever 

44.09 51.39 B: whatever historical veins run through it for for more but you know because most of these countries the history of them lasts so much longer than the actual governments you know 

51.23 53.64 A: oh yeah absolutely 

52.15 53.84 B: that's with iraq because you know 

54.24 60.11 B: before like the baath party and all that stuff you know there was it's you know it's changed hands so many different times and things like that so 

60.06 62.73 A: well so have we i mean in a certain sense 

62.83 73.00 A: which i always think is interesting with uh with the bush administration pulling out of so many treaties and stuff like that and the way it's collaring perceptions of the u._s. and the world's gotta be thinking like i wonder 

73.10 79.26 A: you know depending on who the who is elected in two thousand and four like is this sort of thing irreparable or 

79.38 84.69 A: would it be viewed by the countries as like okay a fresh administration is a fresh start 

83.82 85.49 B: right 

84.98 88.10 A: whereas i'm inclined to think they probably wouldn't [laughter] 

88.03 98.26 B: ex- exactly i mean and how far can it actually and you you know just like just 'cause there's a new person in power it's like he's just one small cog in getting everything changed and everything like that so 

98.75 101.19 B: (( i don't know if anything will ever get done you know )) 

100.65 101.55 A: [laughter] 

101.39 105.84 B: until until they can get rid of more the corporate influence and all that stuff in the government 

105.09 107.07 A: oh yeah 

106.11 108.57 B: in fact that's probably more of a threat to the uh 

108.58 110.22 B: to the u._s. than uh 

110.24 111.72 B: than some of these countries 

111.35 116.13 A: oh in so many ways i agree well you know the big f._c._c. vote is tomorrow 

116.06 117.40 B: yeah that's right 

117.62 126.99 A: i uh i feel kinda bad i should have i'm on this email list that sort of sends out alerts about those and i had the numbers of my representatives i meant to call 'em about it 

127.43 130.79 A: i guess even ted turner is against it 

130.47 131.39 B: really 

131.25 145.64 A: of all people right he had some quote about like uh if if these rules had existed uh when i was starting turner broadcasting and c._n._n. i never could have done it and it's so important to allow you know local businesses to flourish because uh 

132.56 133.83 B: yeah exactly 

145.78 153.82 A: they're you know they don't have a lot of money so they're gonna be forced to innovate and that's you know really valuable and more important than money [laughter] ted turner said that 

153.83 162.08 B: that's amazing and yeah him saying it must say that there's some- gotta be some merit to it the fact that he's annoyed some in favor of the big almighty dollar so 

161.66 163.65 A: yeah it's amazing 

164.16 170.48 A: well app- apparently they're trying to craft some sort of legislation to um like if the rules do go through 

164.54 165.24 B: (( yeah but )) 

170.60 177.11 A: like some i i assume democratic senators are trying to write something to counteract them but 

177.42 179.73 A: i wouldn't have a lot of faith in that getting put through 

179.49 181.86 B: yeah probably with the amount of time too that 

182.79 185.38 B: won't probably won't take effect [mn] 

183.04 184.74 A: yeah 

185.33 187.51 A: probably won't what 

186.47 191.86 B: probably won't take effect in time if anything happens it it just probably wouldn't be able to get in there in time 

191.63 196.37 A: oh oh you mean [laughter] you mean before v._i._a._c._o._m. buys each and every outlet in the world 

195.70 197.20 B: (( ex- exactly )) 

196.98 198.95 A: well i suppose clear channel now 

198.90 201.62 B: yeah so 

200.78 201.61 A: what's 

201.78 202.97 B: go ahead 

202.64 204.38 A: oh no go ahead 

203.78 208.29 B: i was just gonna say just trying to i was trying out this thing in the topic so that making sure that we're 

208.23 222.07 B: not getting too far off it but try to think who else would be you know beside the the typical what they're making all they're all they're saying about iran and north korea too you know whether countries actually that are a threat that actually we're not talking about 'cause it's not what the media wants to talk about that day 

216.22 217.88 A: yeah 

222.33 224.53 A: well jesus i don't know um 

224.96 225.78 B: (( yeah )) 

224.98 227.39 A: i guess you know how do we define threat 

227.19 237.12 B: yeah 'cause it's right now seems like the threat ends up being who's in in in in our economic in our economic paths or anything but really 

235.65 236.77 A: (( right [mn] )) 

237.23 250.44 B: for the most part there are the only threats would probably be if all of a sudden the russian nuclear weapons all were lost and we can't find them and they're all all discovered in these other fac- factions but for the most part terrorism's 

248.26 250.09 A: yeah 

250.29 252.40 B: you know it's like an annoying gnat 

252.43 259.33 B: you know for the most part it doesn't really it they they they hit you but it's not like they're wiping out it's like a major war it's just annoying 

252.63 254.38 A: yeah 

259.23 261.01 A: yeah 

259.61 268.93 B: um and so the fact is that no-one really is a huge threat unless like nuclear weapons get out or biological weapons get out but nobody is to be doing that [noise] 

266.82 268.43 A: that's probably true 

269.11 271.62 A: although you know bombing campaigns do have a lot of 

269.35 270.16 B: (( mhm )) 

271.56 273.79 A: i guess that's sort of it's interesting the way that 

273.80 286.99 A: i think you're absolutely right like in israel and palestine the way that it's been like one little bit you know twelve people die at a time and you you become almost numb to it really you know like twelve people killed in the bomb blast in tel aviv it's like well that just happened yesterday you know 

287.10 296.92 B: oh and you then you to you and then you try to think well did did i miss that one is it the same one i heard yesterday and then after a while you think okay been another one just stay off the bus type thing 

296.71 300.41 A: [laughter] right [laughter] 

299.13 303.59 B: this this this would be my thing i would never travel on the bus this was i was 

303.01 304.90 A: yeah 

303.96 305.51 B: but you know it's like uh 

305.08 307.81 A: i'll just ride my bike [laughter] 

306.40 311.68 B: yeah ride your bike but you know the things you really and then the threat becomes more 

311.99 322.63 B: you know things targeted at destroying the economy and that would probably be the one thing to if you if you really wanted to be a small person making a huge threat is to hit economical targets that would put us into a far 

315.96 318.03 A: mhm 

323.43 329.33 B: far gaping hole of a recession or whatever that we couldn't get out of it that would probably be the only thing 

329.43 336.21 A: well although i do have to say biological warfare or any sort of attack on a on a nuclear facility 

335.40 344.25 B: yeah exactly then but sometime i mean in in a sense though if you if you had certain amount of resources and money it would almost be better easier and cheaper to go after the economical things 

344.27 351.37 A: [mn] that's true but it seems like that's that's reparable you know what i mean like that that could right itself and there's no 

347.73 348.53 B: yeah 

351.47 366.25 A: i don't know i guess that brings to to mind you know what exactly would the aim of i suppose the aim would depend on the group but is it to cause a massive amount of life or is it just to stabilize the government i'm not sure our government can be destabilized beyond a certain point right now 

365.89 367.06 B: right exactly 

367.39 370.97 A: i mean if it was gonna be it would have been [laughter] by now wouldn't you say 

370.79 380.40 B: yeah you'd think it just makes you wonder if you look at all the history and there's like every you know major empire whatever you know you look at the roman empire the british empire 

380.51 386.04 B: it's like they only they were only really around for a certain amount of you know a couple of hundred a few hundred years each 

385.42 387.29 A: mhm 

386.18 396.47 B: so it's worth it's you know how how how much longer does the u._s. have at being being a number one power [mn] you know it's good you know and the balance of power's probably gonna shift i mean 

392.84 394.63 A: mhm 

396.15 409.08 A: well that reminds me of what you said a minute ago though like in in a lot of ways let's say the corporate influence now is probably a bigger threat to the u._s. than anything like if anything could upset the u._s. as the major world power it would be just corporations you know 

409.35 418.21 B: oh exactly it's like it's not some it's not the majority of what the people want to do it's a matter of whether you know what what's in the interests of the small couple of countries uh companies 

418.03 421.77 A: mhm countries companies what- at this point really whatever 

420.87 423.46 B: well yeah now they're the same thing at this point 

423.40 425.13 A: yeah 

423.80 426.64 B: (( it's kinda funny i was have you ever seen the show globe trekkers )) 

426.53 428.79 A: uh-uh never heard of it 

427.36 442.31 B: travel it's a travel show on p._b._s. it's really funny because it's kinda more like you know there are all the people that do the sh- they're changing host every time and they're usually in their you know mid early twenties and they and they do they don't just do all the boring same stuff they just go off and they do all these random things with you know 

436.87 438.60 A: mhm 

441.61 443.30 A: mhm 

442.24 451.27 B: mixing with the people they did a thing on china yesterday and it was amazing seeing in the last i mean i've seen shows of you know seen china over the last twen- fifteen twenty years and how 

451.56 459.58 B: it's completely it's so it looks like the u._s. now it's so commercialized and you know it's more cap- it almost looks more capitalistic than the u._s. 

459.13 461.10 A: mhm 

459.97 462.49 B: and it's pretty funny it's like it's it's 

461.97 464.68 A: you mean just in the number like chain stores and shit or what 

464.47 477.58 B: just yeah chain stores the fact that it that you know once upon a time you you'd see everybody in in the old mao type shirt you know the the the same dress now they're all wearing like polo and d._k._n._y. and every you know it's it's more 

472.22 473.04 A: [laughter] 

478.27 479.93 B: you know it's more um 

480.54 489.92 B: so anti the communist ideology it's kinda funny but it it it shows how like you now there's another company or country will eventually probably become 

490.16 493.27 B: you know the a strong issue but i mean it's like you get 

495.23 501.74 B: that's probably what you have to look for more is the fact that who's gonna have the stronger economical base you know these people make you know try to make 

501.98 508.45 B: everything for us everything in our houses tend to be from china it's pretty funny yet some days we're mad at them some days we're not 

503.88 505.80 A: yeah 

508.83 511.12 B: i don't know it's just kinda funny just looking at 

510.73 514.83 A: but they've always got that massive consumer base that we love 

514.49 515.95 B: exactly 

515.40 516.86 A: oh the cheap labor too 

516.80 525.60 B: oh yeah exactly it would be fun to see though i mean i i i can see china being on top in like a hundred two hundred years you know easily if you know the rate they're going right now so 

525.37 526.69 A: oh absolutely 

527.32 535.10 A: i'll tell you the conflict too between this you know between um what their status and need for national security and so this unchecked greed like 

534.94 546.81 A: when they were guarding the borders so heavily during memorial day it's like there was some senator who was talking about our our borders are porous this is ridiculous like well yeah man you shouldn't have signed nafta if you were that worried about it 

546.33 547.47 B: exactly 

547.34 552.77 A: like you want to keep all the immigrants out but as long as the money sloughing make up your mind you know 

552.52 556.91 B: exactly yeah it's at at this point now they're you know they're caught between 

556.95 561.27 B: two different thoughts the safety or more money and it's still gonna be more money i mean 

561.18 562.38 A: (( yeah that all )) 

561.66 568.20 B: as far as as far as they know there's enough you know there's enough people in the country that they probably won't be the ones that get hit 

568.16 581.38 A: yeah yeah right well that's that's sort of the you know was the the statistic about like of all the people in congress during vietnam like maybe one of their kids went or something like 

568.47 569.03 B: (( [cough] )) 

581.43 585.06 A: (( that surprise surprise )) 

581.44 583.21 B: yeah probably yeah 

584.98 588.88 B: yeah exactly so i well we'll see we'll see go 

587.91 597.76 A: well apparently well apparently bush and putin just held um a press a press conference today and talking about iran and uh north korea 

589.09 590.19 B: ahead 

597.02 599.95 B: yeah i was i was reading that this morning as i woke up and just watching
