0.16 1.21 A: hello 

0.76 1.83 B: hi 

1.65 3.59 A: hi my name's trent 

2.99 4.31 B: oh my name's doug 

4.19 9.02 A: oh good to meet you doug [noise] so what do you think computers in education 

5.43 6.44 B: (( nice to meet you )) 

9.03 12.94 B: well we're supposed to say do they um are they helpful or do they hurt 

12.31 14.03 A: [mn] yeah i 

14.04 17.57 A: i can't give a good answer to that because computers have always been in my education 

17.21 18.05 B: uh-huh 

17.65 20.12 A: i'm only twenty two so 

18.86 19.76 B: right 

19.78 21.60 B: it's just always been there 

20.99 31.01 A: yeah i don't i i guess probably not in kindergarten but you know i don't remember that so i guess i'd like to say they helped [laughter] [laughter] since that's all i've had 

25.61 26.64 B: right 

28.60 30.41 B: yeah well 

30.79 35.79 B: well actually that would be really good to hear about i'm a little older and so we didn't have um 

35.92 40.64 B: er computers in our school although we did have a punch tape system we could dial into 

40.71 42.77 B: so ah it's a little different now 

41.30 42.83 A: oh yeah 

42.93 46.47 A: yeah i think i vaguely remember hearing about that 

45.89 47.94 B: [laughter] 

46.86 47.86 A: long 

48.00 51.74 B: yeah so wh- what kinda things have they helped you learn about 

50.99 56.70 A: [mn] well i think it i think you know i don't know if this is really good or not but it was really a lot easier to do research papers 

56.29 58.59 B: yeah i'll bet that's right mhm 

56.89 58.69 A: with the internet you know 

58.52 59.76 A: i mean 'cause 

59.54 65.39 A: we didn't i didn't have the internet maybe in like grade school um 

63.90 64.92 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

65.17 77.78 A: so you know i'd actually have to go to a library and talk to people and stuff but now you know you just sit at home you can find five hundred articles without any problem um but then again i guess you don't really know the validity of the articles either 

69.51 70.35 B: uh-huh 

73.11 74.12 B: right 

77.06 83.69 B: that was just what i was going to ask you how do you how do you decide if ah if an article looks like it's ah valid or not 

78.49 79.50 A: yeah 

83.12 96.43 A: i you know i think basically i just go to like a a you know like time dot well time wouldn't be a good one [laughter] you know a different maybe like newsweek or something dot com and then you know that they're going to have is gonna be good 

89.55 90.57 B: right 

92.88 93.79 B: right 

94.91 97.80 B: some place that you kinda trust you know about already 

96.53 102.29 A: yeah i wouldn't just go to some website if it's just like ah someone's idle rantings you know 

101.29 103.10 B: right you can tell the difference 

102.54 106.01 A: yeah usually usually if it's a reuters article or whatever 

103.59 104.48 B: uh-huh 

105.53 111.15 B: right so you kinda go with maybe the major major news sources just to start with 

109.48 110.61 A: yeah 

111.02 121.27 A: yeah i mean and and there's so many archives of just every article written for the past five years so so that's pretty good um 

115.05 115.92 B: uh-huh 

118.06 119.24 B: sure 

121.40 125.14 A: you know especially if you wanna kinda research all the way back on something or whatever 

124.69 125.71 B: mhm 

125.26 128.12 A: [lipsmack] but then again i dunno if that makes it too easy 

128.59 129.79 A: (( and ah [sigh] let's )) 

130.12 136.53 B: well let's take an example what's um what's a research paper you wrote recently where you were able to get the information 

135.99 137.78 A: see well i'm trying to think here 

137.82 143.53 A: 'cause i'm in college now but i haven't had to write many research papers i think i had to write about oh 

139.00 139.84 B: uh-huh 

144.68 148.41 A: man i can't remember any more [laughter] it's been so long 

146.98 152.29 B: well let's see let's take a class what class might they have asked you for a research paper and i bet we i can help you english 

150.37 151.31 A: english 

151.98 154.13 A: english usually yeah 

152.95 158.63 B: well let's take english ah maybe there was an author or a time period like american literature or english literature 

156.30 161.28 A: yeah i had to i had to research woody allen one time i think 

159.93 161.82 B: woody allen let's let's take that one 

161.55 162.49 A: so 

162.58 164.04 A: i mean that that's 

164.10 166.79 A: you can look up movie reviews from 

167.25 171.43 A: you know a movie that he did like twenty years ago or something 

170.55 172.63 B: sure and it's all it's all right there 

171.90 175.74 A: it's all there so i mean i think that's good but 

174.01 178.67 B: uh-huh well do you remember what you what you learned about woody allen by doing that 

178.12 180.29 A: i don't think so i don't remember any of it 

180.09 184.79 B: [laughter] well there's no guarantee that a person would have if they had done it the old fashioned way 

180.83 183.54 A: (( [laughter] )) 

183.77 186.12 A: [laughter] i don't think i you know what 

184.98 188.38 B: i don't i'm not sure the computer scored a mark here though [laughter] 

187.68 194.06 A: yeah i do but i do remember like research papers i wrote in eighth grade when i'd have to sit in a library all day 

191.19 192.32 B: yeah 

193.45 198.36 B: well let's take one of those it's not a scientific experiment let let's pick one of those see if you can remember one of those 

194.66 195.86 A: so [noise] 

197.01 201.82 A: i did i did a research paper in eighth grade on the ozone layer 

201.23 202.53 B: the ozone layer 

202.27 205.04 A: and that was big that was like that was like ninety 

205.61 209.72 A: yeah ah no wasn't ninety that was like ninety four or something 

209.28 210.51 B: sure okay 

209.75 214.36 A: the hot hot button issue just big deal then so 

211.32 212.96 B: that was a big deal then 

213.29 214.49 B: what did you learn 

214.40 224.37 A: well i learned all about like c._f._c.s and h._f._c.s and how um c._f._c.s were what everyone hated that was the horrible thing but but h._f._c.s were actually worse 

223.88 224.87 B: right 

224.32 238.24 A: and i had to you know once i found that i was like well that's so i had to go research that and that was [sigh] i mean i i probably spent twenty hours at least on like the four page which is a lot you know when you're like you know thirteen 

233.11 233.99 B: yeah 

237.10 243.86 B: actually you know that's a pretty good ratio twenty hours for a four page paper but you'd put some depth in it some thought it sounds like to me 

240.55 249.46 A: yeah it was very it was very complex course i got a b. on it 'cause my teacher didn't like me [laughter] but that's entirely another story [laughter] 

244.72 245.67 B: mhm 

246.99 248.78 B: well that's all right 

248.90 253.35 B: yeah that's ah that's kinda [laughter] water under the bridge you remember what a c._f._c. is 

253.35 256.07 A: yeah it's chlorofluorocarbon and um 

255.20 256.06 B: mhm 

256.94 260.82 A: it's ah it's a gas and it destroys the ozone layer you know 

260.41 261.42 B: mhm 

260.83 273.31 A: and and that h- i remember ay ah hydrofluorocarbons and that those are made by refrigerators and and um the [mn] they put out much more you know and i remem- you know 

264.38 265.26 B: mhm 

266.85 267.78 B: mhm 

273.18 279.09 A: i i do remember more about it i think than i remember about i mean i can't even remember for sure a research paper i did 

279.70 281.71 A: when i had the internet to help me 

281.32 287.02 B: that's actually pretty interesting actually those were interesting years right then because i know a car i had was a 

287.13 297.30 B: ninety three model and that was the first year that they used the new kind of air conditioning ah the the refrigerant and that they had to switch over on account of the same thing that you were researching about 

293.01 294.61 A: oh yeah 

296.72 298.75 A: yeah exactly 

297.35 305.04 B: because the they were releasing those kinds of gases into the air which was er people you know felt was damaging the ozone layer 

301.18 303.29 A: just destroy everything 

305.03 306.30 A: (( yeah i know )) 

305.40 308.95 B: that that was certainly a hot a hot a hot topic then 

308.39 310.60 A: yeah [laughter] 

309.56 318.13 B: actually you know the the computer's not scoring very high marks let's let's take another area so research papers maybe that's um maybe that's not the best application 

312.62 313.65 A: no 

317.84 318.86 A: yeah 

318.17 320.51 B: maybe there's another thing what kind of um 

320.31 322.80 A: well see we used to play a lot of games 

322.44 323.80 B: yeah 

323.28 336.33 A: oregon trail i dunno if you heard of that it's it's like this game where you're um [lipsmack] travelling along the oregon trail and they they try to justify it because you know it's history 'cause you're taking the oregon trail which is you know 

325.32 326.73 B: i haven't 

336.26 337.39 B: yeah 

336.79 341.70 A: historical or but it was really just a game [laughter] 

337.44 339.65 B: well let's let's take that one did let's see 

339.95 344.01 B: well let's see if you remembered anything about the oregon trail from playing that [laughter] 

343.16 347.16 A: no [laughter] not really [laughter] 

344.72 349.34 B: [laughter] i think the computer's going down in flames [laughter] 

347.53 353.69 A: yeah i know i remember i remember it went to oregon and ah people died of dysentery a lot 

350.62 351.47 B: yeah 

353.04 357.98 B: well dysentery you wouldn't have got from the name i mean oregon trail you could guess from just the name of the trail 

355.34 356.33 A: no 

357.42 359.45 A: yeah but 

358.16 360.65 B: but dysentery okay so there's something 

359.50 366.52 A: yeah yeah always died of dysentery and i always lost people to dysentery that was horrible and i didn't know what that was so i learned what dysentery was 

366.04 367.57 B: well what's dysentery 

366.97 371.17 A: that's that's that's when you you die from from ah horrible diarrhea 

370.93 371.83 B: okay 

371.49 374.23 A: but that's not really i don't think that's what they wanted us to learn 

374.43 375.53 B: yeah 

375.00 377.41 A: they they probably weren't aiming for that [laughter] 

376.97 378.57 B: well maybe they didn't know 

378.22 387.25 A: i dunno but and then the carmen sandiego well carmen sandiego was pretty cool because you have to you learn a lot about geography from that um 

382.87 383.85 B: right 

385.77 386.74 B: okay 

387.24 392.97 B: well let's pick something geo- let's pick something geographical then what what's what's something that it might have tried to teach you 

387.36 389.11 A: but 

390.04 391.54 A: yeah 

392.11 396.94 A: it well you're looking for carmen sandiego all o- all across the ah 

397.67 399.77 A: (( all acr- i think it was where in the world )) 

398.50 402.64 B: let's say she went to africa let's say what what what's a country in africa she might have gone to 

400.19 401.90 A: yeah 

402.11 405.45 A: i think she might have gone to south amer- i dunno south america i guess 

404.69 408.05 B: that's it south america that's great but but what country might she have gone to 

408.56 411.15 A: that's a south that's a country isn't it 

410.32 412.42 B: well south america is a whole continent 

411.85 419.33 A: isn't it not south i'm sorry south africa i'm thinking of south africa she obviously didn't do that well 

412.56 413.79 B: mhm 

414.88 416.45 B: south africa all right 

416.61 420.04 B: all right well what's a what's a city she might have gone to in south africa 

419.41 429.07 A: south africa madagascar right i think isn't that yeah that's the yeah i remember that 'cause it's the hard one see but i i learned that from watching the show too 

421.84 424.14 B: well that's an island off the coast of africa 

425.56 426.46 B: mhm 

428.40 435.07 B: from watching the show 'cause i know i've seen that on t._v. it's a p._b._s. show where where i i can remember the theme song 

432.82 434.67 A: yeah 

434.73 441.49 A: mhm i remember way too much from it 'cause that was how my childhood was sp- spent was basically watching [sigh] 

440.05 442.25 B: yeah well you're not alone in that 

441.67 447.70 A: yeah and watching the the carmen sandiego but ah i don't think i 

443.73 444.68 B: uh-huh 

446.66 454.83 B: well let's we've we've tried let's see this is good we've tried history we've tried literature well movies that's kinda literature and we've tried geography 

450.91 453.07 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

454.72 456.10 A: yeah 

455.03 463.16 B: and so far i think that the regular library is stacking up better that was science i guess now let's let's take something like i dunno math 

459.18 461.01 A: yeah 

462.83 471.18 A: now maths was good because they had a lot of maths they had a game called what was it called it was called math 

463.99 465.33 B: mhm 

471.39 476.26 A: math munchers or something it was something stupid like that and it was like 

473.54 474.57 B: that's okay 

476.68 480.23 A: they they just shoot a whole bunch of problems at ya 

479.81 480.89 B: mhm 

480.25 485.18 A: you know like addition like real simple stuff this was like back on apple two or whatever 

482.41 483.31 B: mhm 

484.77 485.92 B: oh right 

485.29 491.88 A: and that was good because you got to practice a lot like you you had to do it over and over again and ah i 

488.06 489.37 B: mhm 

492.14 494.71 A: think a lot of math is kinda memorization 

494.33 495.19 B: uh-huh 

494.79 499.49 A: so it it i think that did help just the the constant 

496.79 497.76 B: okay 

497.79 507.51 B: so it probably got just the familiarity with just doing addition so if you let's say for example i don't mean to quiz you but we'll just we'll test this out let's say you go to a restaurant and you're figuring out the tip 

500.04 501.91 A: mhm 

503.92 504.76 A: (( that's okay )) 

507.40 510.04 A: mhm no 

507.83 509.63 B: do you have to get out a calculator 

509.71 511.20 B: you just do that in your head 

510.38 518.84 A: i'm good at math but my dad's an accountant that's probably a big part of it 'cause he wouldn't let me have a calculator 

511.35 512.48 B: see there you go 

513.71 515.07 B: mhm 

515.73 517.05 B: oh it could be 

518.41 522.77 B: you'd have to learn to do that in your head but that could have been your dad to some extent 

519.45 530.50 A: yeah even in even in algebra i i can i can i ah he let me have one once i got into like more complicated math but in algebra i wasn't allowed to have a calculator 

526.92 528.23 B: (( mhm well )) 

530.69 534.80 A: so but all the other i mean we were allowed to but my dad wouldn't let me 

534.09 536.79 B: right he held you to a higher standard 

534.83 535.84 A: so 

536.16 548.06 A: exactly so i i was sitting there doing it like long hand all year long and then at the end we had we couldn't use a calculator on this big test we had and i finished it like way before everyone else 

540.92 541.73 B: mhm 

544.69 546.40 B: oh yeah you'd score 

547.43 549.35 B: oh yeah and probably better too 

548.16 554.24 A: 'cause oh yeah i i i think i was the top in the class just because i had been doing it without a calculator for so long 

553.44 554.91 B: you were just used to that 

554.30 565.00 A: ah yeah i i'd probably you know i had to keep up with them on calculators so i was way faster and i finished it like in ten minutes and you know it took them like an hour or something because they didn't know what they were doing 

558.11 558.97 B: (( mhm )) 

564.82 567.34 B: why don't i tell you i think the computer's going down 

565.01 565.87 A: um 

566.72 569.07 A: i think the computer's going you know i think 

567.79 579.38 B: [laughter] 'cause here whether it's because of your you know your your your dad really kinda wanting you to learn this and doing it in long hand so the i dunno about the computer let's take another area well go ahead 

573.67 574.98 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

576.32 587.05 A: but but i think ah well i think you know i think that really computers can i i think it's when they try to make it you know and plus i think computer games for education have gotten better 

586.69 589.54 B: ye- yeah well you know that's a possibility they could be 

588.41 594.11 A: 'cause i think i kinda followed behind them like by the time that the game came out for something i'd need to know i already knew it 

593.47 596.27 B: yeah you probably did maybe they were too hokey then or 

594.63 595.56 A: (( you know )) 

595.91 599.89 A: exactly but i think i think it's good for like little kids you know 

596.70 597.62 B: yeah
