3.36 4.28 B: (( how's it going )) 

4.39 6.18 A: not it's going pretty well 

6.24 15.30 A: um i'm i think i'm the type of person who has a lo- a a few close friends not a lot of i have a lot of acquaintances too but like only one or two really close friends 

6.44 7.14 B: (( good )) 

15.56 22.71 A: and most of them i've had for a very long time like [mn] since before high school like junior high school and stuff 

22.96 29.30 A: and i i find it pretty har- i mean for me anyway i think it's pretty hard to find like really really close friends 

22.99 23.68 B: yeah 

29.89 30.66 A: (( but [noise] )) 

30.88 35.31 B: okay i kinda agree i'm the same same kind of way 

35.48 39.41 B: um i have friends from like kindergarten 

39.64 41.05 B: but um 

42.54 54.47 B: and the type of friends you know i i'd keep in con- contact with are the ones that are gonna you know be there for you if you need it and you'll be there for them you know 

52.54 53.35 A: (( mm )) 

53.58 59.78 A: and yeah like are they like how do you know they're going to be there for you do you know through experience or 

60.63 61.70 B: um 

60.72 64.59 A: or you just had the feeling that that's the type of people they are 

64.56 69.51 B: well that's the type of people they are and um 

71.34 74.91 B: you kinda built that level of trust that if you 

75.63 79.18 B: if you really asked them to do something for you 

79.19 82.95 B: you know if you really need it then they're going to 

82.94 87.98 A: yeah i i guess since you known them since kindergarten that's that's why 

86.94 89.11 B: well i have one or one or two 

89.52 94.12 B: one or two i've known since kindergarten and um but i 

94.89 102.80 B: that's like my best friend is is i've known since kindergarten and you know we don't even live in the same country any more but um 

103.90 105.15 B: (( [lipsmack] if )) 

105.41 109.58 B: you get well when we get back together it's exactly the same as we left off 

109.29 113.72 A: that's a pretty good relationship that you that even though the time and the distance 

113.92 116.25 A: is there that it doesn't affect you 

116.41 128.18 A: and that you can just resume it's like nothing ever happened kinda like that most of my friends just they live around me still like they live maybe two hundred miles away but i mean since 

119.37 120.39 B: yeah 

128.48 134.72 A: it's so easy just to talk like on the computer or even just give 'em a call [cough] and i see them 

134.73 145.43 A: i see them frequently enough that you know i can still re- i can still retain that special that special close relationship with them but like here i mean 

143.01 144.03 B: yeah 

145.83 156.38 A: when i meet new people i think it's just that i've known these people so long that you know like you were saying you know what kind of per- what kind of person they are and it takes a little time and 

154.08 154.89 B: yeah 

155.61 157.85 B: yeah especially if you've grown up with someone 

158.19 161.70 B: you know then it's a little easier to um 

162.28 164.41 B: to get a good character judge 

164.48 171.45 A: yeah because you've you've just been through so much with them and developed as a person with them that is [noise] 

169.79 174.32 B: yeah the same sort of problems and same sorts of things yeah 

174.45 177.08 A: true with do you have a lot of acquaintances yo- 

177.58 179.95 B: yeah i don't 

180.14 184.55 B: i don't tend to keep in contact with people 

184.66 187.47 B: that i'm not like overly friendly with 

187.38 189.10 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

188.17 189.17 B: um 

190.61 191.24 B: (( [mn] )) 

192.39 193.64 A: but yeah 

192.82 200.59 B: like i can you you know i i have in small number of um really good friends 

200.49 201.40 A: mhm 

200.78 203.90 B: and then there's quite a lot of distance between 

204.45 207.16 B: you know a level of friendship between um 

207.41 216.51 B: the closest close friends and like acquaintances and things so i don't like i hang out with the acquaintances and things but i'm 

217.67 224.20 A: you wouldn't call them like you wouldn't say that they're so close that you could rel- like you couldn't ah 

224.53 227.68 B: not i couldn't like depend on them maybe that's the best 

227.03 230.84 A: yeah okay that's a good that's a good thing to say but 

230.10 233.65 B: maybe that's how i define a close friend someone who you can depend on 

233.25 234.84 A: no matter what 

234.41 235.48 B: yeah 

234.90 236.87 A: [noise] yeah [noise] it's 

237.29 245.74 A: i think that's that's very true and it's like almost like family like you know if you're very close very long close friends that you know 

241.38 242.25 B: yeah 

245.92 249.80 A: they even if any bind that you'd be in that they would know 

250.35 252.66 A: uh you'd know that they'll be there for you 

250.47 251.47 B: yeah they would 

252.61 254.25 B: yeah and do what they can 

254.10 261.36 A: mhm [noise] but i i'd say i have a lot of the most of my acquaintances i think i would know if i would know through 

261.28 275.27 A: my long term friends like they would they would have long term friends themselves or they would have just have other acquaintances and since they'd be hanging out with them i would hang out with them too and i'd get to know them a little bit [noise] but not on the same level 

270.70 271.39 B: yeah 

273.79 274.52 B: yeah 

276.92 278.11 A: as the other ones

279.99 281.14 B: i have a 

281.27 291.39 B: i consider them friend i consider them friends but not like really close friends i am with the people you know all the time um who 

289.45 290.43 A: mhm 

292.84 301.74 B: most of the people i consider that i hang out with are friends i don't hang out with people don't intend to hang out with people that i don't like or don't 

296.19 296.95 A: (( mm )) 

301.45 312.82 A: yeah [mn] yeah i also have an- i also have a lot of people who like i would just see them passing in the hall or walking down the street and i would stop and say hi and have a you know little conversation with them or maybe even 

302.16 302.89 B: (( have )) 

312.76 326.83 A: you know if they were sitting somewhere i'd sit down and have lunch with them or something but i really wouldn't call them friends i i mean they're friends but you know i would say they were friends but more you know they're more of a- acquaintances in the tradit- in the true sense of the word that [mn] 

325.84 326.79 B: yeah 

327.10 334.01 A: they're the person who i always say hi to they're the person who maybe if i'm waiting for a bus or something that 

334.03 342.70 A: we would have a conversation or sit on the bus together but i wouldn't give them a i wouldn't call them up on the phone and say you know hey you know let's go out and do something or 

337.00 337.81 B: yeah 

342.76 345.26 A: i wouldn't go to the movies with them or anything 

345.23 346.80 B: okay yeah 

346.08 347.44 A: just in passing mhm 

347.37 348.65 B: (( that's kinda )) 

348.83 350.59 B: kinda cool um 

351.06 352.07 B: yeah i 

352.51 356.48 B: i don't have too many of those those types of friends 

356.73 358.02 B: um 

358.81 361.37 B: the acquaintance 

361.66 369.92 B: type of friends i just if i don't get on really well with them then i tend not to put the time into it to 

369.95 371.61 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

370.20 372.28 B: to develop that relationship 

372.07 373.84 A: [noise] so you yes 

372.43 373.42 B: plus i'll 

373.79 376.32 B: i'll talk to anyone on the bus [laughter]

379.00 379.72 A: (( [noise] )) 

380.01 383.67 A: but people are friendly enough on the bus but sometimes it's a little 

384.57 388.79 A: it's a little um weird like people talking to you just randomly 

389.06 390.79 B: yeah 

390.03 390.70 A: (( [mn] )) 

390.75 392.64 A: especially yeah 

390.82 402.71 B: yeah it is but i it i like it when you know when everyone's bored it's just so much easier to get a conversation going and you'll never see the person again anyway so 

397.33 398.56 A: mhm 

402.78 404.75 A: (( true [laughter] )) 

405.33 409.39 A: [mn] you don't have to you don't have to worry about saying the wrong thing or 

409.37 411.17 B: (( yeah it's kinda a )) 

410.27 412.48 A: or being polite [laughter] or anything

417.86 418.87 A: [laughter] 

419.11 425.70 A: [mn] but that's that's true and that's also i think a benefit of like talking to people online or something like you don't 

425.87 428.42 A: you know you could say things that you wouldn't normally say 

428.58 429.43 B: yeah 

428.62 438.01 A: or you could you could be a little more edgy than you would be or a little more provocative than if you met them in person because you know what are they they can't [mn] 

434.01 434.97 B: oh yeah 

438.26 443.67 A: they can't see you they can't reach out and strangle [laughter] you or something if you say the wrong thing

458.68 462.29 A: i'll strike up conversations with the person sitting next to me just because 

462.59 470.38 A: they just you know we're sitting together for a few hours and there's nothing to do and they're not showing a movie on that flight or something 

465.38 466.60 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

467.76 468.54 B: i

486.26 487.22 B: (( that's uh )) 

488.39 496.94 B: yeah defying gravity for um three hours you may as well get to know who you're sitting next to 

491.51 492.89 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

495.01 495.62 A: (( [noise] )) 

497.69 501.88 B: and i like meet- meeting new people

518.92 521.52 B: like some someone's completely new to you

528.59 529.47 A: uh-huh 

529.74 532.36 A: like just to find out a little about them and their life
