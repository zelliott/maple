0.53 2.71 B: yes hello [noise] 

1.76 3.78 A: hi i'm peter how are you oh 

3.27 12.29 B: hi i'm gene sneider how are you doing [laughter] oh that's good you know i always wonder how do they know my our names and ah by giving the pin number or 

5.73 7.37 A: i'm fine [laughter] 

12.44 15.27 A: i don't know they they did not address me with my name 

15.16 17.47 B: th- they didn't ask your name 

17.20 18.46 A: ah no 

18.13 19.89 B: oh okay ah 

19.05 23.49 A: well they have my name somewhere but they didn't mention it during this procedure today 

22.80 31.22 B: yeah maybe our phone number is what does it i guess you know they probably okay i guess you know we have to talk about um computer and education 

30.45 33.32 A: computers and education what do you think does it harm 

33.30 42.25 B: yeah i think no i well i think it does good i mean i haven't really seen it because i'm not in the classroom so i don't know how much um 

42.80 53.69 B: they use a computer because maybe it is too much or maybe um the students might rely on it too much or something like that but i'm not really sure i- it depends on how 

50.25 50.82 A: (( mm )) 

53.70 57.44 B: i'd like to see it being used you know what do you think 

56.07 62.44 A: yeah i i entirely agree it it really depends on on what you think about what a computer is 

62.50 72.95 A: and and ah if you try to to understand it as more a technique than a a technology then ah it becomes interesting so it is like like you have 

73.39 87.38 A: language as a technique and you have the the writing as a technique and as well you have a computer as a technique and and you have to learn them all you learn to s- how to speak first and somewhat later you learn how to to write and then you need to learn how to deal with a computer 

87.14 93.92 A: i think these these times are not possible without ah that technology that knowledge about it 

93.38 94.45 B: yes 

94.47 95.77 B: (( ah yes )) 

95.89 103.86 B: that's true i think um [sigh] let's see another thing maybe um 

104.53 106.79 B: yeah i'm not sure maybe it's it's 

106.70 120.23 B: the it is good for somewhat of a can learn maybe faster easier but maybe with a teacher i mean a regular person it is better using the chalkboard too because um 

120.93 123.01 B: i don't know they can um 

123.35 129.39 B: you know ask more questions to the teacher too i guess but i they can still talk to the computer too somewhat i'm sure 

129.52 133.68 B: so i guess i don't really know i i guess it's both ways 

133.26 140.44 A: [noise] yeah and i i i think you're right ah and if it takes over the classroom then it's certainly bad 

139.80 141.67 B: yeah 

140.71 146.89 A: it it's ah yeah it shouldn't be instrumental to ah make it easy to cheat or or or 

147.06 156.06 A: doesn't if a student does not need to to er um do things by him or herself anymore that that's certainly not not a good idea 

156.26 164.67 A: um i think a student should should learn how to write by hand first and then how to type things with a computer or should learn how to 

164.67 171.83 A: to multiply and and and ah do simple calculations with a pen and and and a piece of paper 

172.08 173.29 B: oh 

172.11 175.54 A: and and and then use the computer to do these things 

175.44 176.77 B: yes that's 

176.15 177.34 A: and 

177.60 183.08 A: ah yeah have the computer teach the class is certainly ah ah not a good idea 

182.18 191.36 B: yeah i mean not completely well i'm sure they don't you know i'm sure it's not completely just computer i'm sure they have a teacher you know there first and the teacher 

191.11 192.28 A: yeah 

192.06 197.98 B: but i'm i'm i'm sure what they mean is that it's the computer it's like you know the computers are really 

198.10 206.62 B: lot what they have nowadays just like um you know telephone ops the telephone operator for nine years you know i even the operator we used to have to say you know 

207.41 220.04 B: t- forty cents for three minutes the computer does that the computer even tells them how much to put in nowadays and they even we used to have to say it is now three minutes but now the computer does all that you know unless they don't put the money in then a live person comes on 

220.06 225.92 B: that's what i mean i think um that's what it's they are i- i'm sure the younger 

225.98 230.44 B: ah students like in the first you know to third grade or so 

230.05 230.97 A: (( mm [noise] mm )) 

230.38 243.22 B: just learn how to read and write they obviously do only have a teacher i'm sure the computers don't do that because they probably won't e- even understand the computer stuff anyway you know i'm sure the i'm sure the computers are they probably have them for the like you know 

238.67 240.40 A: yeah 

243.19 246.39 B: sixth grade like junior high and high school 

247.24 255.29 A: yeah i i i think that that k- kind of the first five years ah ah r- i don't think a a student needs to learn how to deal with a computer 

255.44 263.62 A: how old are kids in fifth grade that's about twelve or and and and below i i think they can perfectly live without a computer 

263.42 265.68 B: uh huh that's right 

264.49 276.55 A: and and and and later on they can learn all these these little things and and how to write small programs and and maybe even bigger programs and ah um use the computer to make life somewhat easier but um 

276.65 290.68 A: i think it's crucial that that a person using a computer always knows what exactly that person is using the computer for what is going to be easier with the computer and and and so i think it's it's essential that a person learns that 

285.83 286.90 B: (( yes )) 

290.75 298.57 A: beforehand so that that he or she appreciates the computer much more than than as if ah it was just a normal thing to have 

298.48 299.53 B: yes 

299.95 301.58 B: that um 

302.16 305.79 B: [sigh] that's what i mean i don't know if it is really even 

305.63 318.14 B: going on right now with the using the many comp- that much computer in the schools or not i don't i don't know that's what they were asking i know they they mean that it is going on nowadays or it's going to be you know more said but 

316.65 317.30 A: (( mm )) 

318.21 324.35 B: but either way i don't know if it is and i figured i don't know um i won't be able to say because i don't really know anyone that's in 

324.47 338.42 B: in the kids in high school age or well you know i got nieces and n and my niece i haven't talked to her you know she's in like um [sigh] i guess eighth seventh or eighth grade you know i forgot about her and then my other great niece yeah but 

333.46 334.72 A: [noise] uh-huh 

338.48 340.70 B: i could ask them you know the i 

340.71 349.45 B: it was never pointed out until now that i would think about using that they use computers that much in school but yeah next time i talk to them i could ask the they 

350.51 363.15 A: right i i have no clue how much computer they are using when i was a kid in school i never had a computer at all and and i was i remember i was ninth grade when we got these these small scientific calculators for math 

363.41 364.78 A: and and the sciences 

364.58 366.36 B: (( oh really )) 

365.65 369.23 A: (( but i but i was ah ah fifteen when i got that )) 

369.30 374.67 A: so i i never had anything of that that kind er when i was younger and and my 

374.83 380.77 A: first real computer i i i ah saw or ah operated when i was twenty 

380.51 381.72 B: oh 

381.23 383.52 A: so that was certainly a bit late 

383.64 394.36 A: and and and nowadays these things are cheaper and and and easier to [noise] and easier to deal with and i think it's a good idea that that a kid at the age of say fourteen fifteen 

394.72 398.85 A: ah ah would start using such a machine because it's so essential in in in 

399.01 400.85 A: every day life nowadays 

401.21 402.34 B: yes 

402.15 406.50 A: so ah i think it was a bit late with me but um probably was 

406.97 408.47 A: (( [laughter] different times )) 

408.43 409.55 B: (( uh-huh )) 

409.69 411.77 B: but you um 

411.79 416.32 B: it what like ah how long ago did you graduate from high school or 

417.00 418.78 A: (( oh that's that's some time a- )) 

418.80 421.28 A: (( some time ago i graduated in the eighties )) 

421.12 422.39 B: ninety 

421.46 423.52 A: the nineteen eighties 

422.98 430.21 B: nineteen eighty do you um do you remember what they use in computers that much then or 

430.41 436.49 A: well i i know that in other high schools they used more computers but but er not that much more 

433.92 435.14 B: oh 

436.13 441.03 B: yes i graduated in seventy four and i um 

438.43 439.08 A: (( mm )) 

441.11 446.23 B: no i don't remember at all that back then they used the computers that much just 

446.45 455.69 B: really not at all practically you know i mean of course you know in the the curriculum office the guidance office and that you know and attendance office they 

455.80 460.08 B: i guess there they had computers to um put things you know kids' 

457.48 458.11 A: (( mm )) 

460.21 470.12 B: names and [sigh] phone numbers in order but i mean as far as the classroom i don't remember i don't think at all they used computers that much i don't remember 

470.20 474.16 A: well yeah i i mean the in the seventies especially the early seventies 

474.21 480.94 A: ah computers weren't that common at all i mean they were extremely expensive tragically slow when compared today 

480.90 492.38 A: and and ah there weren't that many convenient programs to to be used that easily i think if you wanted to use a computer these days you need to learn how to do that quite ah ah ah thoroughly 

490.65 492.16 B: (( [noise] )) 

492.22 493.39 B: (( uh-huh )) 

492.96 500.20 A: and then and now you just buy a computer and and everything is pre installed you just switch it on and and the thing works 

500.05 502.28 B: yeah 

500.96 507.76 A: but that that's really ah ah very recent development so the first computer i got was was um 

504.39 505.70 B: (( uh-huh )) 

507.85 510.29 A: a two sixty eight 

510.50 523.07 A: machine and i had to install everything from little disks and and i need to needed to to learn how how d._o._s. works and then write my own little programs that everything was working properly and um 

517.33 522.66 B: (( [noise] )) 

522.97 531.95 A: and that was already convenient if i compared with other people who who got into that much earlier that ah um yeah things have changed so much 

532.44 541.23 A: i work with computers now everyday that's that's ah um yeah my life is wouldn't be possible the the way it it worked my my job nothing er without a computer 

532.57 536.66 B: (( yeah )) 

541.02 542.73 B: really 

542.04 544.47 A: (( yeah i i work ah at the university )) 

544.71 548.39 A: and ah i do structure analysis and um 

548.58 550.23 A: everything is in the computer 

550.08 553.54 B: oh but ah okay go ahead 

551.59 552.44 A: so 

553.15 557.06 A: yeah no that's it's it's just um it would be way too too ah 

557.28 568.02 A: huge it it's a and and the computer can process that within a couple of minutes and it would take a human ah months and months to to just go through all these tables 

568.47 569.71 B: oh 

569.33 570.54 A: so um 

570.75 577.61 A: yeah ah i'm using it virtually ah um every hour of of my my business life yeah 

574.37 575.97 B: oh really 

576.09 577.62 B: oh 

577.80 589.58 B: but in the h- a- do you know um any you know high school age people that you high school age or junior high school that you asked about these computers in school 

587.24 588.18 A: i 

589.60 591.84 A: i don't know really anyone no 

591.73 592.74 B: oh 

591.98 594.31 A: i know that my school where i 

595.01 596.84 A: (( from ah )) 

596.89 599.32 A: some i don't know how many years ago 

598.22 599.95 B: (( [noise] ))
