91.93 101.18 B: and i've it's taken me a long time to really understand maybe what family could mean for me um and i i think um [mn] 

101.71 110.99 B: from what i've seen from what i've learned you know i think ah family probably ah is about o- other than you know a biological 

103.88 104.59 A: (( mm )) 

111.03 113.44 B: need or whatever i think it 

113.21 114.14 A: (( mm mhm )) 

114.11 118.89 B: it's ah a learning experience it's to teach you about life probably 

118.54 132.34 A: well it looks like you what is doing okay but remember whoever is in your family when they got divorced or not that doesn't mean you you know you would be in the same 

126.84 128.01 B: yeah 

132.33 133.40 B: right 

132.64 134.58 A: situation because 

134.81 140.36 A: usually people take ah you know marriage and that kind of ah 

141.21 152.18 A: you know they think it's something well once you do it you know once you get somebody and you got married then that's about it but it's something like even in your job 

149.17 149.96 B: (( yeah )) 

152.58 159.37 A: (( so you still have to work in the job and show that you know you are worth the )) 

155.03 155.90 B: right 

159.86 167.42 A: you know for the employer to keep you working right so as long as they see well you're not working and then 

163.26 164.24 B: yeah 

167.61 172.96 A: there is a problem where they will let you go and then you know hire somebody else 

173.06 174.06 B: right 

173.42 182.82 A: so is there something about marriage too you know where some people they don't work at it but if you want it and it's a good life 

182.47 183.74 B: yeah 

183.04 188.74 A: being married because you have somebody who is unconditionally you know 

189.40 196.58 A: kind of just want to be with you and going to take in turn you know all these things ah 

197.04 203.95 A: i think that's a good life for me you know i don't i don't have any problem of being married so 

203.01 203.77 B: yeah 

204.99 210.03 A: and i am not in for a of you know if for any reason 

205.07 206.31 B: (( mm )) 

210.10 223.59 A: if i don't work at it and the person i am married to would work at it then i think you know days and weeks on end when these people get divorced got divorced you know there is a reason for it even though you can't see it 

223.32 224.57 B: yeah 

223.93 236.85 A: there is a reason but would you yourself would you be willing to work at your marriage in case if you would get you know if you had to if you have to get married or something 

236.70 238.47 B: yeah yeah 

237.58 245.22 A: if you would of i think maybe you would of worked at it and you could avoid that si- the same problem these people have 

244.85 245.74 B: (( right right yeah )) 

245.87 256.39 A: so you know the- there is one thing if you're not ready for it if you don't want to do it don't just go and do it just for the sake of it 

255.80 257.18 B: right 

256.40 265.47 A: but because of your family situation or people you know how their life turned out by being married 

265.77 275.58 A: i wouldn't let that you know stand on my way and say you know since everybody got divorced and you know it seems like you know ah things 

273.33 274.08 B: yeah 

275.65 282.90 B: well i don't i don't look at it as you know since they did i'm not it's more i mean i it wasn't 

278.87 279.71 A: (( mm mm )) 

282.92 284.95 B: i didn't have the 

285.69 291.63 B: i guess the tools you know i i never saw success there so 

290.54 291.70 A: mhm 

291.76 294.56 B: i had to learn it on my own you know 

294.19 295.17 A: (( oh )) 

294.76 304.23 B: and i had to see it through other examples and i think slowly over time i'm i'm becoming more comfortable with the idea and and i 

302.78 303.80 A: mhm 

304.73 305.87 B: i'm 

306.01 313.69 B: you know i'm probably i'm looking forward to getting married within a few years probably maybe within the next five years 

313.53 322.37 A: yeah because you said you have several girlfriends and when they think you know it's not going anywhere that's the reason why they left also 

319.43 320.65 B: yeah 

322.31 326.46 B: yeah well i usually you know get disinterested usually 

326.57 328.65 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

328.67 338.77 A: yeah i i think yeah i think it's it's you know ah if you work at it i don't think it's a prob- you know it's not bad 

338.45 339.81 B: yeah 

339.16 347.58 A: to get married you know as a matter of fact it's good because you know like you're thinking for two people instead of one 

347.39 348.41 B: right 

347.88 358.01 A: sometimes it can you can feel it's overwhelming but sometimes too you know it's all good there is nothing saying everything is good good good good good [laughter] you know 

357.61 358.78 B: right 

358.15 366.84 A: and and so is life in general you know today you might get up you feel very good and to- you know tomorrow you feel a little bit 

360.83 361.52 B: yeah 

367.40 369.37 A: you know not so good but but 

367.60 368.46 B: right 

368.79 370.27 B: right 

369.72 378.82 A: apparently that's how life you know you get evolve around life and then you know it's primarily it's something you know you watch 

379.39 387.13 A: and you know you watch kids and if you have kids grow and everything i think that would be a good life 

386.91 399.57 B: yeah yeah see it's a learning to me i i've seen i've noticed for healthy people that are have healthy marriages it's it's a a learning experience about life you know you watch your children you 

387.34 388.31 A: mhm 

393.28 393.89 A: (( mm )) 

394.88 395.82 A: yeah 

397.62 398.86 A: (( oh yeah )) 

399.32 400.40 A: mhm 

399.75 407.02 B: learn about being selfless and and uncon- having unconditional love from people and 

406.68 417.23 A: [mn] yeah that's very good yeah being like you said selfless because you know when you're thinking about me me me me me and you see you have to think about somebody else 

413.34 414.41 B: yeah 

416.83 418.06 B: right 

417.41 426.46 A: it's a good feeling because even in the bible the bible say you know there is more joy in giving than receiving 

425.65 427.14 B: exactly 

426.43 434.42 A: and once you keep giving and you receive something even though it's not materialized but you know 

433.22 434.12 B: yeah 

434.16 435.31 B: right 

434.66 443.12 A: you receive something the satisfaction of being able to give or to make somebody feel better about themselves you know it's 

442.81 444.17 B: right 

443.54 446.74 A: it- it's a good feeling and 

446.32 456.64 B: yeah yeah see i never i didn't understand that concept earlier in life i didn't i was i was probably more self absorbed ah you know 

448.26 448.89 A: (( mm )) 

450.88 451.65 A: (( mm )) 

452.26 453.46 A: yeah 

455.61 456.62 A: well 

456.93 463.43 B: ah earlier on you know when i'd have girlfriends in my early twenties or even late twenties you know 

461.51 462.27 A: (( mm )) 

462.73 463.82 A: mhm 

463.52 467.49 B: i ne- and i couldn't understand the idea of you know 

467.69 473.77 B: ah being selfless and helping others and i i think i was just more self absorbed you know 

473.78 484.09 A: well yeah well willing to experience you know like when you say like every time you do for yourself or else for others sometimes you are ex- you know 

484.14 495.83 A: what can i do for somebody else you see and when you do that and especially you don't imagine the joy you can realize you know you don't realize the joy that 

486.31 487.33 B: yeah 

495.76 500.30 A: comes with that ah selfless action when you do it 

499.60 500.81 B: yeah 

500.31 509.08 A: and which is which is a good feeling by the way you know and and i am come from a country you 

509.71 512.18 A: know i come from a country where 

512.27 523.90 A: (( like you know family it's a a very close to each other because even you are a cousin or if you own things )) 

517.95 518.93 B: uh-huh 

524.02 532.16 A: (( whatever you possess you know you you are obligated you know to help your family )) 

531.94 532.92 B: right 

532.23 539.95 A: because they count on you which when i come to you know when i came to america and i find out like 

539.91 548.94 A: y- you know even your kids your parents you know if you have millions and they don't have you're not obligated to give them anything you know 

548.36 549.57 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

549.50 551.42 A: which is to me 

551.58 559.29 A: that that's something that we learn from the early age that you know you have to help you know your family 

559.10 560.42 B: yeah 

559.70 574.37 A: a- and and this is like this kind of things that help you throughout your life like you said yourself you know you do for yourself and you're self absorbed there is nothing wrong with this sometimes you have to be a little selfish because 

573.50 574.29 B: yeah 

574.45 578.91 A: if you don't take care of yourself it's gonna be hard to be able to 

579.33 581.50 A: (( help other people you know )) 

581.09 582.51 B: right 

581.65 592.61 A: which is good but at least when you do you do for yourself then you can you know get used to the idea of doing for somebody else and 

592.03 593.80 B: yeah 

592.68 596.06 A: which is like i said a good feeling but 

595.99 597.54 B: wh- where are you from 

597.24 598.14 A: (( mm )) 

597.60 599.53 B: what what country are you from 

598.57 599.95 A: oh i am from ha-
