8.55 12.17 B: dayton ohio i'm from raleigh new carolina 

11.61 16.75 A: oh okay i went to school in raleigh north carolina north carolina state university 

14.34 15.44 B: oh really 

16.42 19.13 B: i actually grew up in stoomville ohio 

18.62 22.21 A: oh really i i grew up in western north carolina 

21.64 22.74 B: okay 

22.87 27.73 B: uh i guess the topic is foreign relations and is there anybody else a threat 

28.84 30.41 B: did i get that right 

29.73 31.47 A: [mn] yeah that's correct 

31.17 33.95 B: (( okay um you got any opinions )) 

33.35 37.84 A: yeah i have an opinion i think definitely china is definitely russia is yes 

38.71 40.26 B: china and russia 

39.67 40.58 A: yes 

40.46 42.48 B: you ever spend any time in the military 

42.16 45.59 A: uh i'm a civilian engineer with the air force 

45.59 50.13 B: okay i've spent three years in the navy and uh did uh 

50.15 51.93 B: two tours overseas 

52.43 53.38 B: so 

53.71 62.17 B: i guess i would tend to agree with ya um definitely china russia with the current leader um 

62.56 66.12 B: i believe um they're not it's not a friendly leader 

66.74 71.83 B: and um i think it's still run a lot by the russian mafia 

72.53 77.36 B: and they will sell their arms and anything else they can just to make make a buck 

77.11 82.55 A: yeah i agree with ya exactly i really do and i think that o- old habits are 

82.68 92.62 A: are hard to die and i i do believe in relation of the value system that we have in our country and i i i say that generally because that is changing but 

92.44 102.34 A: i think you compare that system to the system that we see in evidence in russia and china it's uh they're definitely not friends of ours 

102.01 103.08 B: right 

102.41 105.77 A: and i i i just think everything you know we kind of 

106.24 119.67 A: of uh with the world climate and and the way uh uh world politics is being is being manipulated and dominated i think they uh have a lot to gain by making a lot of trouble for us so 

119.77 121.68 A: i don't see them as friends at all 

121.46 134.27 B: yeah i i agree with you on that i am also i i think uh north korea is just a puppet of china and uh they're china is basically giving them full rein to do 

134.49 144.11 B: uh whatever they want to get their viewpoints or their their their whole agenda uh they're just letting north korea hand- uh do that for 'em 

137.86 138.75 A: right 

143.48 146.75 A: sure and they and they kind of used them as a uh 

146.81 150.93 A: oh i don't know maybe maybe to m- manipulate the world's stage or 

150.98 155.57 A: or to manipulate the situation in a region or things of that nature so 

155.86 158.54 A: i i agree with you there and i think uh 

158.73 165.32 A: oh now now how how the relationship completely plays out i don't a lot of times i don't think they even 

165.20 175.78 A: know but they sort of kind of you know allow it to go along and then react and watch and and then in some cases actually proactively do things like you're taking about so 

175.20 178.00 B: right what do you uh think about france 

178.14 180.59 A: well i i i uh 

180.51 189.46 A: because of of uh capitalism and other things i agree that france [noise] is is i well i don't agree i think france is 

189.29 201.11 A: is an enemy or they are opposed in many ways and uh maybe enemy is a little harsh but they certainly don't enjoy a deep abiding friendship with us let's put it like that 

200.53 215.52 B: yeah i think they've uh they've had so many so much involvement in the past in the middle east is you know with the french foreign legion and and all there uh just kinda like you know britain used to do and britain used to be into africa real big and 

214.92 216.18 A: right 

215.57 220.34 B: and i think they've gotten their hands in it so much they tend to uh 

220.53 224.31 B: uh let let 'em do things on the sly and uh 

224.48 230.78 B: and don't and and it won't long ago when france and libya were real tight i was in the navy when 

230.67 241.97 B: we actually uh went after muammar gaddafi and the planes i was on an aircraft carrier and our planes actually went and bombed him and and uh and france was a big supporter of them back then 

234.50 235.49 A: oh were you 

238.01 238.93 A: yeah 

241.47 256.18 A: yeah well i i i i think because of the way their government is and the value structure in the country the way socialism has evolved in europe i do believe that they just look at society and they look at uh 

249.82 250.78 B: yeah 

256.19 262.43 A: um the international climate and environment a lot differently than we do 

262.27 265.57 A: and i believe when you combine that with capitalism 

265.37 269.83 A: they'll sell about anything to anyone and i and i believe that they will 

269.60 280.74 A: uh even even if even if uh uh in indifference to the way we feel they would sell things to china and russia that we would never sell to them so i just don't believe that 

280.54 290.02 A: and and i think if you involve them in third world situations like india uh russia and china i think you you have a very explosive 

290.26 293.31 A: uh problem on in on your hands really 

293.81 294.87 B: right 

294.20 299.07 A: whether they're selling weapons or whether it's involvement in the united nations or whether it's 

299.10 307.68 A: uh any geopolitical situation i i think again i i won't call them an enemy necessarily but i won't call them a friend of the u._s. so 

307.10 320.80 B: right you know the thing i think with russia is when the wall came down communism went down the tubes nobody stepped in to help them out as far as get reorganized and and i i think you're seeing a lot of that now and i would 

313.05 313.98 A: yeah 

315.17 316.12 A: right 

319.58 323.43 A: yeah i think the clinton administration bears a lot of responsibility for that 

322.70 330.61 B: yeah uh well we don't that i i wish that would be a whole other talk uh thing [laughter] [laughter] 

323.73 324.90 A: and uh 

327.91 330.57 A: yeah [laughter] i agree with ya i agree with ya 

330.64 344.39 A: uh but but the and and again there's a different value structure there in in that country and uh and i think when you combine a lot of things like you com- you combine some resentment from those years you combine 

344.26 357.27 A: the mafia and the situation of of uh crime in the country and and you're combining the the heritage that communism left them uh i think all those are are elements that 

357.17 361.34 A: mean that we're gonna have a lot of problems to deal with when it comes to them in the future 

361.27 362.45 B: yeah 

361.80 362.55 A: so 

362.29 375.55 B: no you're right there it's uh there's a lot of things that need to be uh ironed out or it's uh thing is if we let iraq go and not not try to not so much keep a grip on 'em but at at least watch what they're doing 

375.32 379.09 B: and how they develop then uh we it could actually worsen over there 

378.48 392.48 A: that's right and and hopefully we're being proactive and i don't agree with everything bush is doing but i think he has tried to proactively get a hold of several situations several international situations and i think he's done a pretty good job so far 

392.31 398.70 B: yeah well you know well i've been a republican but i've coming from the military uh end of it um 

399.00 409.66 B: you you just and i and i've been in egypt and i've been in all those all those places over there and like you said it's a whole different mindset their countries are based on religion 

409.29 410.18 A: right 

409.53 414.43 B: and are based on who has money and power are the peop- ones who control the country 

413.60 428.27 A: right in some ways their feudal systems and and uh it's hard in those feudal systems it's hard to relate those and to get the message across also to the american people is what you need to do and how you need to deal with the situation yeah 

416.46 417.64 B: right 

427.45 437.49 B: well the issue over there is when you get a fanatic in charge of a country like that he he takes from the country he just starves the country like like like uh 

435.44 436.27 A: right 

437.40 445.85 B: saddam hussein did and and and and how they get the hatred towards any other countries that don't agree with their politics or religion 

446.03 452.59 B: is they've got to give 'em something else to feed on uh to keep the uh to keep them off of themselves because 

451.59 456.56 A: sure that's right because of the desperate situation of the country itself that's right 

456.69 463.85 A: and and they'll seize on a lot of different opportunities uh situations uh international and domestic 

463.66 472.08 A: to achieve whatever goal they want to do at that time and and so it can cause a very uh difficult situation for us internationally 

471.49 473.87 B: oh yeah for everybody everywhere 

472.76 473.50 A: yeah 

474.06 475.06 B: and uh 

474.88 484.36 A: well uh uh is is that i i guess i didn't know exactly what was happening when i answered by is is that what we're we we supposed to do is to discuss the topic then 

483.48 487.14 B: yep anybody [laughter] i think we pretty much hit on everything
