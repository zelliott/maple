0.64 1.83 A: hello 

1.26 3.13 B: hi this is esoura 

4.00 4.80 A: who 

4.12 4.77 B: (( hi )) 

4.99 5.89 B: (( esoura )) 

6.26 7.34 B: how ya doing 

6.67 9.86 A: oh i'm doing okay doing okay 

8.49 9.43 B: [laughter] 

9.93 11.22 A: where you calling from 

11.08 12.50 B: um california 

12.42 14.66 A: california oh i'm up in washington 

13.16 13.89 B: (( yep )) 

14.57 15.67 B: oh okay 

15.66 16.50 A: okay 

16.79 19.61 B: so what do you think do they help or harm [sigh] 

19.42 27.56 A: [laughter] i dunno we ah ah i'm just old enough that ah we had like apple twos when i was in school 

27.25 28.21 B: uh-huh 

27.70 28.61 A: so 

28.62 31.30 A: did you have computers in ah when you were in school 

31.00 33.67 B: actually not until i got to college 

33.74 35.37 A: not until you got to college 

34.78 37.69 B: yeah that's when the computer really started 

38.08 45.59 B: growing [laughter] i guess they're using i dunno i i i think that it can harm and it does help 

39.54 40.96 A: [laughter] 

45.72 47.63 A: it can harm and does help 

47.05 48.29 B: i think so 

48.74 51.03 A: that's a that's a rather ah 

50.88 52.21 B: it's vague huh 

51.07 54.53 A: (( all encompassing ah opinion yes )) 

53.91 57.26 B: well because it er in on one side 

57.69 61.94 B: you know it can harm because people i think depend too much on them 

62.10 66.69 B: versus being able to to have the knowledge in in your brain 

66.88 67.96 A: right 

67.34 76.09 B: and to be able to to bring it out versus restoring everything and not having to really worry in case the computer breaks down then you become you know 

76.19 77.57 B: useless i guess 

77.58 78.92 B: or immobile 

78.75 81.07 A: [laughter] immobile yes quite 

80.70 82.11 B: huh you know 

81.34 93.18 A: well i i'm an engineer by training and ah i heard stories about when the calculator came out people were appalled that engineers couldn't calculate logarithms on using ah 

93.17 96.55 A: um mathematical tables in the back of the book any more 

96.08 97.44 B: [laughter] 

96.79 101.30 A: they were using calculators to ah calculate their logarithms for them 

101.49 112.24 A: and how they wouldn't be as good a engineer because they didn't know how to tabulate these complex functions and interpolate and use a slide rule and this other stuff um 

110.26 111.21 B: uh-huh 

112.23 119.90 A: but it turned out not to be the case um because you know calculators make better engineers because they can 

114.14 115.03 B: (( really )) 

119.95 121.79 A: focus on ah 

122.29 123.56 A: more 

124.25 127.20 A: ah relevant pieces of their 

128.18 130.35 A: ah [lipsmack] ah of the trade i suppose 

130.61 133.24 B: okay i'm computer illiterate i can't 

133.36 134.54 A: oh okay 

133.64 136.43 B: [laughter] work it [laughter] you know [mn] 

135.66 142.98 A: well definitely you know so i i think in the technical ah in technical areas it can be a t- a good tool for people to use 

142.85 143.67 B: yeah 

143.17 146.46 A: but maybe in the liberal what what did you study in college 

145.88 150.30 B: english [laughter] it was the feature you 

147.04 147.73 A: (( english )) 

148.48 157.13 A: oh right so so how do you feel about these computers telling you ah that you're ah you have dangling participle or a 

155.76 164.53 B: see it and and that's a lot of things because it it says you know a word is misspelled or the phrase is wrong but it's not it's just a different wo- you know 

164.92 167.77 B: it's not patience instead of patient yeah 

167.77 168.83 A: yeah 

168.25 173.03 B: kinda thing and and so in that that aspect i think gives students a false 

173.18 177.04 B: um impression of of the word or it doesn't really help them 

177.37 181.28 B: to to get the correct spelling or or the grammar 

178.72 179.44 A: (( see do )) 

180.31 189.56 A: you think it makes for a lazier ah a lazier student just type it in and then correct what the computer tells them is ah incorrect usage or incorrect spelling 

188.94 193.92 B: i dunno if it's a lazier student i think they don't there they don't learn 

194.00 198.90 B: they don't get the they don't grasp the concepts so when it comes to when they're in class sitting down 

198.91 201.46 B: and actually they have to write it themselves 

201.52 205.09 B: the they don't do as well as those who actually take the time 

201.62 202.76 A: mhm 

205.73 211.52 B: to write it you know but it's so much convenience you know convenience for the computer just to type it up too i 

205.79 206.67 A: right 

212.13 213.27 A: that's true 

213.51 215.43 A: and you get to see what you have 

213.66 214.32 B: (( feel )) 

214.94 217.53 B: yeah so it's it's a mixed feeling [laughter] 

217.39 224.45 A: [laughter] i ah i i i think that maybe like the internet and everything ah has 

221.53 222.38 B: mhm 

225.03 236.94 A: um well what can i say dulled people's appreciation for actually doing research on a topic they're gonna write about because they might just go to the internet and 

237.21 238.31 B: that's true 

237.27 246.77 A: find whatever people are saying and then put it together rather than actually having to go to the library and try and find relevant topics and look through the books and 

246.59 251.81 B: yeah it's so much convenience but at the same time you you do lose a lot of sense and also 

251.98 254.92 B: um people put anything they want on the computer 

255.48 259.04 B: so you might not get the accurate information or the correct information 

259.31 260.73 A: that's a good point 

260.40 261.56 B: yeah 

260.96 265.24 A: 'cause any any any any bozo with a computer can it's just 

264.24 266.55 B: anybody could put a website [laughter] 

266.34 276.00 A: [laughter] like saying you know you know there is a slot you know you put your fruit inside a pyramid and it won't go ba- go won't go rotten and i don't know what else 

266.83 268.34 B: [laughter] 

275.58 286.43 B: you know you you could be learning the you learn how to make bombs i mean there's really anything on the internet but you have to assess which which information would actually help you and which will not 

286.36 287.60 A: mhm 

287.03 292.91 B: and not enough people are really willing to put the time into find discovering what is correct and what's not 

293.30 295.11 B: or to put it to good use 

295.67 299.12 A: but is that the ah is that the computer in education fault 

299.20 300.46 B: (( i ah )) 

301.28 302.31 B: good question 

301.31 302.21 A: (( because ah )) 

302.30 314.48 A: on the on the other side of the on the other side of the coin because you have so many people talking at the same time it might be that the students would learn to be more critical with things that they that they learn 

307.17 308.21 B: mhm 

314.79 316.64 A: rather than ah 

316.75 328.28 A: just finding one source and ah one authoritative source and ah and quoting that and using that as a basis for their writing they could you know go out and find ten or twenty people saying 

321.59 322.53 B: mhm 

328.65 332.23 A: di- er slightly different things and and come up with their own opinion 

332.76 335.17 B: yeah you could you could argue that too 

335.67 336.54 A: mhm 

335.81 337.36 B: um [laughter] 

337.58 342.38 B: it's an interesting topic i'm not sure if it helps or hurts i dunno 

342.87 344.05 A: mhm 

343.56 346.14 B: depending on on the person i i think 

346.47 347.68 A: (( right [noise] )) 

348.49 350.96 B: but um i know it helps the 

351.08 360.05 B: in terms of living round the computer or you know you play the video games on the computer in order to help get the motor skills and you know when you're driving and all that other stuff 

360.99 364.89 B: but i'm not i dunno i have mixed feelings [laughter] 

364.74 371.98 A: [laughter] yeah ah we like i said we had computers in ah grade school 

371.69 373.09 B: mhm 

372.37 380.49 A: and it was you know it was a very special thing there was a special computer lab you could go to and it definitely lear- allowed us to 

380.81 384.17 A: explore things that we couldn't have done without computers 

384.08 385.15 B: mhm 

384.45 391.50 A: um i think in that that aspect it was good we learned to you know just very basic programming a little bit of 

392.06 395.52 A: i remember those this program ah called logo 

395.55 402.16 A: where you could do geometry by telling a little turtle where to go um yeah and you know 

398.90 399.99 B: oh okay 

400.47 402.47 B: i don't think we had computers 

402.56 404.26 A: it was kinda interesting 

404.54 408.63 A: um and you could see i i guess it was a little bit of a help 

408.79 410.23 A: (( but ah )) 

410.53 415.80 A: definitely without the guarding against the making the students lazy 

416.02 419.08 A: um it'd be a real a real big ah 

416.03 416.93 B: [laughter] 

419.36 421.02 A: (( ah downside )) 

419.48 422.55 B: well i think it would make it become it makes them more introverted 

423.86 425.03 B: and they don't 

424.06 426.41 A: because they aren't dealing with real people 

425.84 426.91 B: yeah 

427.90 436.61 B: because they they they feel you know you could stay home and you could do everything there versus getting out there and actually talking to a librarian or asking questions 

437.02 439.08 A: oh that that is a real good point 

438.50 440.27 B: and i'm finding more you know 

440.49 446.45 B: just be- being able to you know socialize with people that i think that's taken away a little bit 

447.79 455.73 A: yeah there is something that people do on computers it's kinda like socialization but i never really got into it this whole chat thing 

455.38 458.18 B: yeah i can't [laughter] i can't do it 

458.42 460.96 A: i take it you're computer illiterate [laughter] but you 

460.23 464.73 B: i mean i know i i i don't i can't use the computer [laughter] 

465.07 466.29 A: (( can chat )) 

465.13 465.98 B: [laughter] 

466.07 469.64 B: i could chat but it bores me it it i don't have that 

468.51 470.50 A: it it's not really social 

470.84 472.67 B: i i think it's it's a new 

472.68 474.94 B: a new kinda socialization 

474.90 475.96 A: mhm 

475.60 477.41 B: but i it bores me 

477.66 482.91 B: and i need to interact with people i ne- i need i need them i'm a social butterfly [laughter] 

483.23 485.40 A: [noise] okay that's fair you know 

485.91 491.29 A: ah [laughter] yeah though do you have a yeah mm 

491.00 492.28 B: [laughter] see but 

491.44 498.79 A: face to face face to face is definitely good and that's why we have you know like for higher education universities rather than all 

498.89 503.13 A: you know phone in mail in your test correspondence schools kinda thing 

502.64 506.61 B: yeah but you still have a lot more and more you know they're doing the 

506.65 508.36 B: our class is online 

509.16 511.66 A: yeah i really don't like that 

510.98 512.23 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

512.24 513.30 B: so i 

512.50 524.34 A: there's there's something about having a critical mass of people there that you can actually talk to and see their faces in the in the school and you you know might go out for drinks later on and talk about class or 

519.96 520.87 B: mhm 

523.40 526.11 B: (( what are you talking about later before the class [laughter] )) 

524.85 525.92 A: (( what's )) 

526.24 527.47 A: that [laughter] 

526.69 529.70 B: [laughter] you go before the class starts [laughter] 

529.04 531.97 A: oh yeah you go out for a drink before the class starts 

530.70 534.65 B: [laughter] to be with them [laughter] 

534.70 538.06 A: [laughter] oh yeah i forgot you studied english that's right okay 

534.80 535.97 B: but it is 

537.10 540.51 B: [laughter] and the liberal artsy people 

540.70 550.63 B: but it it it's i think more education is more than just being able to read something or or you know multiply something it's the interaction with people you know the experience itself 

550.72 553.02 A: right in and computers 

553.04 558.09 A: too much reliance on computers would definitely ah harm that type of interaction 

557.41 564.30 B: i think i mean don't take me wrong they have done great things and and it's you know made society progress so much 

564.35 566.49 A: right i agree with you 

564.85 565.80 B: (( you know but )) 

566.14 567.18 B: yeah 

567.66 576.87 B: at the same time i think we are losing that quality of being you know being sociable everybody's such at a such fast pace now that you know they'd rather stay home 

577.46 580.35 A: yeah that's it's it's really unfortunate 

580.41 581.36 B: yeah 

582.59 585.97 B: this is a but i think it's it's hurt students 

586.17 589.00 B: but i mean it it's like a dual thing 

591.45 593.19 B: as far as i'm concerned [laughter] 

593.56 595.48 A: it's like a say that again please 

595.03 599.95 B: it's like a dual it's a dual it has a it serves a dual purpose i dunno
