110.62 122.87 A: and um quite interesting um how and why ah the issue of divorce actually came up which was due to my ex wife's ah critical health 

122.78 133.16 A: and as a result of that she had chosen to be totally separate um it's imminent that she will pass away probably within the next two years

205.45 206.78 A: how does it feel 

207.19 220.75 B: so it's ah it's absolutely wonderful it's everything i could have asked for um i ah was very fortunate in meeting my wife many years before we got married and chasing her for four years 

220.53 221.62 A: mhm 

220.79 224.63 B: and finally being able to catch up or at least allowing she let me to catch her 

224.66 237.10 B: um but it worked out great for both us and and i i couldn't be happier in the whole format of the way we've got things going ah and when it comes to things like the extension of family it's 

225.34 226.33 A: mhm 

237.48 241.66 B: i didn't i never gave anything up as far as 

241.46 243.86 B: um my family having to 

243.79 245.59 B: spend more time with hers or 

245.55 252.60 B: her family her giving up time for having spend more family time with mine and it's it's just been a really really nice mix 

252.59 265.84 B: and um we came together as a couple of people that had lives and neither one of us gave up those lives we kept those lives and just intertwined them together to create our life and then extended that on through our families 

265.60 277.70 B: and now as we create our own and and work towards letting our kids grow up we give them the opportunity to understand that and and see both sides of the family and and know that they're loved in all directions 

277.61 292.39 A: that's terrific yes yes i i i see where you're coming from with all of that and ah i'll say that i had a bump in the road ah for the moment ah so with the adjustment now 

292.32 304.48 A: of ah having a family but within a different context ah in order to maintain the relationship with my children or my my child actually my young man um 

302.45 303.14 B: (( mm )) 

304.58 318.44 A: ah i've had to make personal adjustments and realize that ah that the child is more important at this point um therefore um 

318.84 322.40 A: m- to ah maintain um 

322.48 331.81 A: a kind of decorum in a way and ah making sure that there's honesty ah involved in this family ah 

331.67 344.18 A: as much as can be ah until ah the relationship again will adjust or readjust um with her ultimate demise and then i will have him 

344.26 351.21 A: ah and then there will be ah another transition constant transitions ah 

344.44 345.29 B: yes 

351.23 356.99 A: ah going on but ah that's what life is about anyway and ah y- 

356.04 357.22 B: yep 

357.14 370.61 A: y- you know the thing is is to ah be able to um make those adjustments as best as possible without impacting anything negative ah on the other person 

370.87 371.74 B: (( yep do )) 

371.12 372.07 A: (( um )) 

372.11 377.94 B: you think he has a good understanding of what's taking place and um is accepting of it 

375.73 387.10 A: yes he does ah he was there at the time five years ago when my wife um had her ah operation he and i we were in the waiting room and um 

387.08 399.73 A: she managed to survive ah but part of her personal healing health um was for spiritual retreat and so she chose to go to the mountains 

399.90 411.10 A: and ah i personally believe that there's a point where a a child needs to be nurtured more probably by the mother 

411.18 421.59 A: ah where it's more accessible to be around the mother whereas the father ah comes in and out as long as he maintains a strong relationship with the child 

421.63 435.37 A: and ah in this situation and i felt that it was best that he actually go with her while i continue my work and and part career ah as well and um 

421.66 423.03 B: (( mhm )) 

435.40 439.03 A: and visit ah i didn't realize though 

438.91 451.78 A: that um in the year's time that i had been away and had maintained visiting and finances and taking care of that that actually part of her su- her growth 

451.62 455.83 A: was she wanted more independence and to be um 

456.02 458.77 A: totally of herself 

458.80 462.23 A: um and not willing to share with a spouse 

462.22 467.48 A: and so she filed for separation and ultimately it was divorce 

467.46 470.93 A: for the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage 

470.88 483.92 A: ah interesting thing is that she maintains no ah relationships with men ah or anything like that it isn't that we didn't well fell out of love or whatever um 

483.91 491.05 A: it was something that just occurred ah which was health related and um 

489.05 489.93 B: (( mhm )) 

491.32 500.03 A: ah giving up of oneself and also loving someone enough to give him or her up 

500.40 501.54 A: is 

501.69 503.50 A: quite um 

504.14 506.53 A: quite a a choice to make 

506.63 509.48 A: um you know in that 

506.79 507.83 B: yes 

509.61 510.54 A: (( [lipsmack] you know )) 

510.82 511.96 A: (( ah )) 

511.30 514.20 B: lots of people find it difficult to 

514.29 529.01 B: ah be able to accept it without anger and frustration and it sounds like the situation you guys were involved in being a part of it and understanding it and knowing the reasons behind it it didn't impact you a whole lot in that way although it may have i i i don't know 

518.53 519.57 A: well 

528.84 542.07 A: well ultimately it did ah h- have a a major impact and um i sought some guidance ah some therapy and as well ah as well as she and my son 

542.15 554.76 A: ah in trying to better understand how this um situation will evolve and try to keep it as as positive as possible um but there is 

554.76 558.10 A: um loss there's grief 

558.15 561.23 A: ah involved with it um 

561.28 569.60 A: very much so and then there's ah of course anger ah frustration hopefully acceptance 

569.60 570.70 A: um 

570.67 574.53 A: with as minimal you know pain as possible and then 

573.74 575.46 B: (( mhm )) 

574.51 587.88 A: the adjustment of thinking of of your future in a different context but still maintaining relationships with these people that you've um have lived with for many years 

588.10 589.16 A: um 

588.13 589.21 B: yeah
