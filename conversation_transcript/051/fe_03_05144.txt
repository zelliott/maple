0.08 1.85 B: hi my name's david 

1.74 4.06 A: hi ah my name is ah daniel 

4.00 5.44 B: (( daniel how are you doing )) 

5.30 6.49 A: good how are you 

6.12 7.63 B: very good very 

7.90 9.17 A: (( ah )) 

8.81 9.54 B: (( good i )) 

9.20 13.87 A: yeah so do you have any ah opinions on ah on computers in education 

14.31 21.23 B: well i i sup- i don't want to sound ah like i'm waffling here but i i can see how there's pros and cons 

21.52 22.54 A: (( right [noise] )) 

21.57 22.72 B: um 

23.19 24.66 B: certainly 

24.68 25.80 B: [sigh] 

25.63 30.55 B: i mean th- as our society becomes more and more technology 

30.39 43.78 B: um based and computer based it's certainly something someone needs to know in order not to fall behind um and you need to be proficient as well to to be able to ah 

38.77 39.68 A: right 

44.26 50.81 B: be successful in the job market um but at the same time 

47.45 48.28 A: right 

50.98 60.46 B: if people start to lose social skills and you know a lot of the stuff that i don't know how you ol- how old you are but when i was a kid you know computers were just starting to 

60.76 64.53 B: get into the classroom when i was you know pretty much at the end of high school 

64.68 69.07 B: and so everything was done more 

70.71 79.68 B: [mn] i don't know i get to see how it could get to an extreme where people lose more and more social skills and um become too 

77.36 78.42 A: right 

79.95 86.19 B: um [lipsmack] what's the word for it dependent on you know computers to do the the work and the education 

86.46 89.03 A: mhm yeah 

87.99 89.64 B: (( but )) 

89.58 93.14 A: yeah i i i totally agree ah 

93.25 97.59 A: i think computer and internet definitely brings a lot more information 

97.71 107.30 A: to to people to ah average people but at the same time people are not um what's well at least some of the people are not 

107.56 112.80 A: ah taught how to analyze and and digest all this information 

113.15 114.39 A: ah 

113.31 117.07 B: well absolutely i think that um ah 

117.12 120.27 B: you know people in general can be somewhat gullible 

120.36 121.63 A: right 

120.45 124.52 B: and w- when you don't have anything to filter out the information 

124.68 128.73 B: or anyone to filter it out for you e- especially in 

128.86 131.68 B: you know a medium like um 

132.27 134.14 B: you know a computer where 

135.16 140.67 B: it does seem to be cutting edge to a lot of people they'll believe almost anything that comes across it 

140.64 141.78 A: right 

141.05 143.41 B: because you know it's a computer 

143.97 144.60 A: yeah 

144.68 145.58 B: but 

145.68 152.79 B: certainly you know and also i guess it would lend itself to to much more efficient like i said i mean you could you could literally list you know 

153.06 155.83 B: twenty different pros and twenty different cons 

156.01 156.57 A: (( [mn] )) 

156.09 162.17 B: but um certainly would make a more efficient classroom if if you know as you use computers more and more 

162.44 163.26 A: yeah 

162.45 165.94 B: um i i just think that really it depends on the teachers 

166.15 167.13 A: mhm 

166.25 180.98 B: if they're able to incorporate it no- in a an efficient way and in a way that makes sense without taking away anything from you know that's obviously very important time for kids as far as learning social skills learning how to you know 

181.85 185.23 B: basically deal with their small version of society 

185.19 186.93 A: (( yeah that's ah )) 

185.86 187.54 B: at that point 

187.28 189.14 A: that's very true um 

189.34 195.64 A: distant learning is ah is becoming very popular ah for adults taking classes online 

195.24 196.10 B: right 

195.51 205.33 A: but i but i definitely agree with you like children like for say elementary school and sec ah and junior high school to high school like this having ah 

205.34 211.88 A: a ah like a physical school where where kids can get together is is very important 

211.45 215.89 B: well absolutely and and and certainly i mean i'm old enough for ah 

215.90 220.11 B: you know my wife is taking some distant learning classes and h- 

220.44 229.27 B: at that point i think you know once someone's in their late twenties early thirties if they don't have social skills by then i don't think it matters how they're taking their classes 

229.25 229.95 A: (( mm )) 

229.54 233.15 B: so ah you know and and in that case it's very ah 

233.31 234.85 B: very useful 

234.72 236.81 A: right right 

235.00 238.19 B: because you know as people get older their 

238.61 241.85 B: their free time is just so much more restricted 

241.90 244.20 A: yeah yeah 

242.38 249.53 B: that you know i ag- again it lends itself to a lot of flexibility someone could literally you know at one o'clock in the morning 

249.98 253.61 B: you know see what their lesson was for that day 

253.57 255.76 A: yeah yeah 

254.32 255.31 B: (( so mhm )) 

255.75 257.39 A: yeah definitely 

257.36 266.25 A: ah i guess like for for ah a- d- adult distance learning it's more it's more efficiency it's more 

266.23 273.86 A: ah the y- you know like ah i guess yeah ah flexibility but for children it's more ah 

274.09 279.10 A: i guess the the groundwork of of how to socialize and stuff 

278.36 280.48 B: well yeah and and i think [mn] 

281.08 287.58 B: also i oh doing research pag- papers and such when i was younger 

287.97 290.41 B: it wasn't right at your fingertips 

290.29 291.43 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

290.61 297.58 B: so i think i- it definitely helped you to learn how to to do research and um 

297.90 298.82 B: (( i- )) 

299.76 309.19 B: you know you had to work for it you had to find it you had to you had to cull through it and make sure you were getting information that was relevant um whereas with the computer 

306.20 306.95 A: yeah 

309.45 316.92 B: but again going on the opposite yeah you get it instantly which maybe they're not working as hard but they get so much more 

316.95 327.50 B: and so therefore they can spend more time you know actually working on whatever they're researching as opposed to finding the information 

327.62 338.50 A: mhm mhm yeah and also like now nowadays like kids have to learn how to like filter out like your irrelevant ah search results like query results and 

337.63 338.54 B: true 

338.76 342.91 A: how to ah how to find reliable sources obviously ah 

343.02 352.82 A: ah s- you know like some documents posted on some personal website is less ah authentic than you know a research institution or stuff like that 

351.32 352.49 B: (( yeah right )) 

352.55 358.00 B: i yeah and i and i guess with some kids who might be a little shy it's a real good way for them to work in groups 

358.04 358.89 A: right 

358.26 360.45 B: um you know where 

360.54 370.35 B: i- i assume that a lot of kids now if they have a group project type thing might be emailing each other back and forth and you know um sending you know 

370.48 373.91 B: emailing pictures or articles or whatever it happens to be 

373.88 374.63 A: yeah 

374.51 379.67 B: that they're doing in their work on which i guess could help some kids maybe get over that hump 

379.78 383.01 B: if they've got some issues with that 

379.84 380.84 A: mhm 

382.44 385.02 A: mhm yeah 

383.44 384.64 B: so 

385.58 388.26 A: [lipsmack] yeah so 

387.40 391.82 B: i i don't know if we've really solved the the big debate here [laughter] 

391.18 398.59 A: [laughter] well well i mean like there like you said there there are definitely like ah cons and pros 

398.92 402.47 A: and and but i i think like um 

402.61 407.09 A: i think i think like we're in general we're both like pretty optimistic 

407.11 411.46 A: and and i and and i think like ah internet e- 

411.30 425.85 A: especially in the beginning stage i- ah tends to be more chaotic and i'm sure things will sort itself out and um and the internet will be more mature ah information will be more organized 

425.91 428.95 A: ah people will learn from their experiences 

429.03 429.93 A: (( ah )) 

429.03 429.97 B: (( well )) 

430.31 438.44 B: yeah and i i would hope so but at the same time it's the type of thing where literally um it's almost like ah 

438.55 440.15 B: you know when you you see a 

440.30 445.32 B: a street post and it's got a bunch of posters all over it that people keep stapling over each other 

445.47 455.38 B: um you know the internet literally is almost like that in a lot of ways because anyone can get on and put anything on it at any time whether or not it's true or in between 

451.94 453.46 A: yeah yeah that's true 

455.39 456.41 A: that's true 

455.62 468.72 B: um so i you know that's that down will be an interesting component of how that whole thing ends up falling out i- is that going to go away or is it just always going to be that way and maybe kids in the future will be a little less nave 

468.83 470.38 A: yeah and and 

469.27 474.42 B: and able to you know see through smoke and mirrors a little bit better just by having to 

474.59 477.23 B: be exposed to that at younger ages and 

477.57 478.61 A: yeah 

478.05 479.08 B: you know 

479.17 485.91 A: and and also like um [mn] i'm sure like technology will get better search engines search engines will get better 

485.87 499.59 A: ah internet services such as yahoo will have better ah i don't know organisation of of online content um and hopefully like you know someday like ah the network will get smarter 

486.84 488.16 B: oh certainly 

499.59 505.79 A: (( ah you know become sort of like a. i. you know like just to ah ah )) 

506.01 512.97 A: determine by itself what is ah what is ah garbage and what is more relevant and hopefully hopefully 

510.57 511.60 B: right 

512.22 518.87 B: right but anyway i guess we haven't even touched on the issue of you know um the socio economic issues of e- 

518.92 523.80 B: if it's not used in the classroom then are certain economic groups 

523.91 537.62 B: not going to get the exposure that they would need because they're not necessarily going to have that technology at home whereas maybe upper mi- you know upper class or middle class people do and is that going to you know that whole digital divide thing is that gonna 

529.44 530.30 A: mhm 

537.75 542.51 B: increase whatever differences there are educationwise between 

542.51 544.42 A: (( mhm mhm yeah )) 

543.90 547.18 B: um the different socio economic groups 

547.13 548.98 A: (( right right )) 

549.01 550.81 B: so i guess 

549.45 552.06 A: but on the other hand sorry 

552.01 557.61 B: i i and i guess in in that respect it's kind of necessary to make sure there is a lot of exposure in 

557.73 559.12 B: every school 

559.06 560.26 A: yeah yeah 

559.64 562.03 B: to make sure no one does fall behind 

561.75 564.40 A: (( definitely yeah definitely and hopefully um )) 

564.60 568.69 A: hopefully technology will get cheap enough that every school 

568.67 582.24 A: in you know every part of the world has the same ah easy access to the internet and you know have the same exposure to you know like world class faculties and education 

580.49 581.42 B: right 

582.16 590.17 A: so ah so you know like a one one world renowned professor will not be limited to one classroom of ah students 

589.88 591.07 B: right 

590.45 593.01 A: but to whoever that can get online 

592.83 595.14 B: (( and i mean as far as the [mn] )) 

595.37 599.89 B: the class issue e- it already seems like it's just getting you know so much less expens-
