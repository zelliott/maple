68.02 69.15 B: um 

68.92 70.75 A: well family um [lipsmack] 

72.87 77.92 A: it can it can mean ah your all your friends though as well as ah 

79.27 81.24 A: other people 

82.41 90.78 A: i mean ah of course essentially ah it would be the your nuclear family your parents and your siblings so 

90.33 92.12 B: right 

91.69 94.16 A: ah t- you know ah to begin with 

94.72 96.30 A: (( [lipsmack] and ah all your )) 

96.36 99.07 A: children if you are a parent 

98.05 99.91 B: (( [noise] right )) 

99.50 103.38 A: although um when you remove it from that situation then 

103.70 105.95 A: often times the 

106.44 110.31 A: are are w- ah that is if you are in that situation 

110.45 114.10 A: then it can be extended to your friends and so forth but sometimes ah a 

114.45 122.55 A: a group or a group of friends might become your family if you're away from 

123.07 125.28 A: um relatives you know 

125.15 126.36 B: certainly 

126.30 127.69 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

126.87 127.87 B: um 

127.71 128.93 A: and ah 

127.94 136.05 B: it really ah i- it's it's subjective you know it's i guess family is whatever you know whoever 

137.57 141.29 B: whoever you feel i guess that the closest kinship to 

141.43 142.26 A: uh-huh 

141.87 146.60 B: you know regardless if it's blood or ah your friends or 

146.94 149.03 B: even co workers i guess 

148.68 151.00 A: yeah i was just thinking that too ah 

151.48 152.51 A: if you have a 

152.94 156.48 A: good relationship with your co workers that's like a family 

155.94 162.13 B: mhm 'cause sometimes you spend more hours a week with them than you do your regular family 

157.29 158.23 A: and some 

161.79 162.88 A: yeah 

162.38 164.17 B: yeah 

164.62 165.73 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

166.99 170.03 B: well i i don't know i i i guess 

170.12 173.07 A: some bosses try to encourage that ah 

173.48 176.06 A: kind of paradigm at their work place 

176.40 179.85 B: oh certainly i mean i've worked for companies where 

179.87 192.47 B: i mean they wanted you to spend every hour with i mean they wanted you to go out for drinks after work with your co workers and you know the- their their perfect employee was a single person who 

186.04 186.84 A: yeah 

192.68 206.55 B: you know fresh out of college who would want to spend you know make that their life really which ah i guess that's part of the you know coming back to that whole thing and i guess that's the kind of part of the definition of family is 

198.55 199.36 A: (( uh-huh of )) 

206.45 210.29 B: you know what what your life revolves around really 

206.88 207.97 A: course so 

209.34 211.55 A: i've never been in the military but ah 

212.04 217.39 A: you get the idea that ah people are hm do go in the military 

217.68 218.99 B: oh certainly 

217.68 221.28 A: become very mu- much like a family with each other 

220.70 229.66 B: mm yeah i mean especially being in a situation like that where where you're in danger together or you know you you really have to to trust each other 

226.40 227.33 A: yeah 

229.75 237.21 B: and you know have faith in that these people that you're with are gonna you know have your back 

236.79 237.58 A: uh-huh 

238.10 239.17 B: um 

239.49 250.44 B: i i could see how that that emotion would be brought around same thing you know w- if you're playing on a on a team for a particular sport or something like that too from time to time you know if you're 

249.71 251.65 A: yeah i've seen how where 

251.95 256.47 A: in ah a religious organization people become like a family and ah 

255.82 256.94 B: (( most certainly )) 

257.20 259.59 A: like ah different 

260.04 262.05 A: adults may ah 

262.57 265.78 A: help ah take care of other people's children 

265.05 267.32 B: (( right right )) 

267.55 269.45 B: right 

267.69 269.96 A: you know and so there's 

270.13 271.65 A: all kinds of ah 

272.95 275.15 A: close relationships that develop 

276.12 278.11 A: that are like family 

277.59 278.75 B: (( [sigh] right )) 

279.65 282.40 B: which i and again i guess it comes back to you know 

283.05 286.45 B: what is the difference definition of family so 

286.56 290.72 B: wha- what our defin- or what you know an individual's definition of family is 

291.45 298.53 B: i- is a lot of different things you know people that you trust people that you feel certain you know closeness to 

296.66 297.45 A: uh-huh 

299.36 300.48 B: um 

300.60 302.17 B: (( you have in comm- you know )) 

302.46 304.59 B: sometimes it's just 

302.59 305.08 A: yeah that's that kind of is like ah 

305.57 308.34 A: an ideal of a family whereas 

309.47 310.41 A: um 

311.49 316.32 A: y- you don't necessarily have such good relationships with ah 

317.57 318.61 A: um 

319.96 322.42 A: r- relatives that are family 

321.85 329.62 B: right yeah i mean ah there- there's certainly the more th- the more clinical ah you know literal definit- definition that you know 

322.83 324.05 A: at lea- or at 

329.81 331.75 A: so there's like ah 

332.96 337.25 A: there's like a physical definition and an ideal definition i think 

336.53 340.76 B: yeah i i think that that that emotional definition of you know 

341.37 343.87 B: what emotions i guess are are are 

344.53 345.76 B: ah 

345.87 348.08 B: you know conveyed by that word 

348.63 350.67 B: (( um and you know )) 

348.84 350.34 A: mhm 

351.56 357.81 B: usually you know when you say that you're talking about people that you know that are almost a part of you really 

357.92 360.59 A: [noise] yeah when you're coming into the world with ah 

361.38 365.70 A: your ah people that you're most closely related to ah 

366.89 368.02 A: (( you ah )) 

368.60 372.57 A: especially in the the human race you know y- you require 

372.70 373.94 A: very ah 

374.78 375.67 A: um 

376.35 377.88 A: intimate support 

378.89 381.94 A: a ba- you know a baby can't do anything on it's own 

382.12 384.45 A: so that intimate support ah 

382.30 383.89 B: right 

385.53 388.01 A: is required and so 

388.96 391.76 A: that's like where i guess we got our ideal 

392.71 395.06 A: ah definition of family where 

395.98 398.73 A: um people that are supportive of each other 

398.87 401.26 A: create a group that's 

402.28 404.82 A: that's like the nuclear family 

404.71 412.23 B: right yeah i think i think support you know going back to that em- that emotional version of what family is 

411.27 412.05 A: (( mhm )) 

412.30 418.58 B: i think that that support mechanism is a huge component of it 

418.77 420.36 B: [lipsmack] that um 

420.89 427.23 B: you know th- these i guess it's it's tough out there sometimes and these are the people that help you get through the day 

425.54 426.52 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

427.92 428.98 B: (( you know )) 

428.15 430.90 A: yeah it's um there's like a 

431.99 442.07 A: there's an impetus to ah cooperate and whereas there's a requirement to to compete so you have units that are family units where 

442.53 444.43 A: you can cooperate more 

444.60 446.34 B: right 

444.78 447.76 A: to to help you compete against ah 

448.64 449.89 A: the larger 

450.15 452.61 A: su- you know the rest of the world 

450.71 451.57 B: i can 

452.18 455.41 B: yeah i mean against the rest of society sometimes 

452.72 453.64 A: (( ha )) 

455.15 456.00 A: yeah 

456.42 461.34 B: but definitely seems to come back to that a lot of times that you know 

462.23 466.60 B: ah these are the people that are are there for you really 

466.57 467.37 A: uh-huh 

467.35 472.85 B: and you know again sometimes like if it's your children then that could be a totally different thing as well they're they're 

473.26 476.00 B: not necessarily there for you but they give you that ah 

476.54 479.44 B: um what's the word i'm thinking of here 

482.87 484.18 B: (( you know )) 

484.60 487.22 B: just complete love they you know they're 

486.98 488.85 A: yeah a bonding 

488.64 494.51 B: yeah they they don't you know there's no judging there's no you know just 

494.34 495.76 A: unconditional love 

495.15 498.53 B: (( yeah that's the word i'm thinking not even a complicated word )) 

497.09 497.79 A: (( mm )) 

498.71 499.87 B: um 

499.94 509.94 B: yeah i mean they're they can be the ones that you know again you know when you're trying to get away from everything and all the the work and everything and 

510.09 521.55 B: th- they're the ones that you know unconditionally you know they're going to be there you know and that they're just excited that you're you really so 

515.60 516.47 A: yeah 

519.70 522.48 A: mhm and you know they say that ah 

522.66 527.40 A: married people have a longer life span and better health usually throughout 

527.51 529.81 A: because they're more content 

529.30 531.09 B: right 

529.98 532.43 A: family relationship 

531.74 535.16 B: right yeah i've heard that i've heard that um 

536.06 537.59 B: (( heard that ah if )) 

537.84 547.10 B: what did they say that if a but a man widower or a you know a man who's widowed does not necessarily live as long as a woman 

544.57 545.34 A: uh-huh 

547.27 548.56 B: for some reason 

549.14 553.08 B: i don't know what you know what component that comes back to but 

553.97 555.01 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

554.04 556.26 A: a part of that might be the way ah 

557.51 561.18 A: men are trained in our s- s- in our society to um 

562.52 566.43 A: i mean they're not trained as much as women for domestic ah 

566.41 568.09 B: right 

566.47 568.94 A: talents or skills 

568.60 575.07 B: i think a lot of times usually in that scenario it's older i you know i'm sure the large majority of time it- it's older couples 

575.00 575.77 A: yeah 

575.18 579.63 B: and ah ah you know older men are probably a little more dependent on 

579.98 582.43 B: their wives than vice versa 

582.26 585.73 A: you mean ah the older generation in particular or uh-huh 

584.78 590.07 B: yeah yeah and also men don't age as well generally speaking you know as far as 

590.31 595.99 B: their capacity to to carry on their day to day things 

596.01 597.23 B: um 

598.20 599.89 B: you know obviously that's in general
