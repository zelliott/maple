27.78 28.58 A: that's 

31.30 36.81 B: there's quite a conflict over there that's just been going on forever um but you know 

37.06 41.96 B: we can't just sit still because if we did then 

42.09 43.39 B: um 

43.74 47.53 B: well i don't think we've used that we we can't do that that's not an option 

44.73 45.63 A: (( right )) 

47.20 53.45 A: we need we need in other words we need to help those people in one way to make a better living for themselves 

52.97 54.25 B: right 

53.52 58.95 A: and we're got to keep their economy keep our own economy and we got to help them help themselves too 

58.62 66.09 B: that's right that's right it's very it's really tough i don't want to say that we can solve any problems but i think we're doing the best we can 

59.26 60.35 A: uh 

65.72 76.27 A: oh yeah i well i do too yes sir i believe uh it was a bit i if we since we're having to have a war i'm glad we went over there and had a war not that they come over here 

67.72 68.88 B: mhm 

72.74 73.96 B: mhm 

75.88 77.16 B: right 

76.36 86.82 A: and uh i i wouldn't want a war here in the united states and i think mr bush done an excellent job for if we didn't know where to what to expect m- most people i don't think 

79.03 80.29 B: (( no )) 

86.80 93.99 A: and my little bit of knowledge i don't believe we've ever fought a war over there in that part of the country in all that sand and all that stuff 

91.47 92.56 B: no 

93.78 94.64 B: yeah 

94.00 101.54 A: it it was new to us and i think they've done a great job and i still think they're doing a great job we've still got a lot of people over there 

96.29 97.27 B: yeah 

100.71 101.81 B: yes 

101.59 108.52 A: and uh of course i have a flag flying right here in my front yard i'm very very patriotic type person 

108.24 109.67 B: absolutely 

109.01 110.25 A: and uh 

110.26 113.12 A: it makes me mad when i see people 

113.29 117.08 A: downgrade the united states and say that we're not doing right and 

116.75 117.86 B: right 

117.18 126.09 A: all that type of stuff i i think we're doing a we may not live in the most perfect world but we got the best we got way far better than anybody else i'm sure 

125.49 128.47 B: sure and i think um 

129.23 132.56 B: i think that uh again 

132.81 147.47 B: if we didn't help if we didn't have okay i think what what um what upset what has upset um a lot of people in the middle east about united states policies that we kind of like the um 

147.72 150.62 B: we take on the role as as if like the big brother 

150.57 151.28 A: (( right )) 

150.98 152.59 B: and um 

153.07 163.36 B: and you know well while that may be a little bit over- overbearing i mean if we didn't help like we did then i think they'd be more harm than good 

163.23 164.40 A: i i agree with 

164.04 165.37 B: yeah 

164.71 171.80 A: you what if we had uh if the president hadn't sent out troops and things that would've helped those people out they would have come back 

169.27 170.15 B: yeah 

171.98 178.64 A: and done like if terrorism did and you know nine one one did and that that would have been terrible here for the united states 

175.18 176.11 B: right 

178.12 179.12 B: sure 

178.78 185.60 A: and i that's my opinion of the situation but of course you've got people that's gonna be different all over the world and 

180.60 181.48 B: sure 

185.61 190.77 A: i would but those people they're not used to any kind of help i don't think oh they 

190.09 191.09 B: right 

191.33 194.86 A: they don't know how to comprehend that we're trying to help those people 

194.12 196.95 B: that's that's very true it's kind of like um 

197.77 202.94 B: it's like they can't even really understand you know why we would want to help 

202.72 203.81 A: right 

203.43 206.20 B: and and that's you know that's you know 

206.34 207.53 B: um 

208.20 212.65 B: that's okay i mean you know it's just the world that they live in 

209.29 210.64 A: (( right )) 

212.90 216.92 A: people say well have did we get uh get rid of mr 

217.04 221.75 A: hussein i don't know whether we did or not but we got him we got him on the run anyway and

221.03 222.62 B: right 

222.10 223.68 A: (( and r- and )) 

222.73 224.29 B: got him afraid 

223.74 229.01 A: a lot and a lot of his what followers he's got afraid to because they turned their own 

228.98 241.61 A: looks to me like what i keep with they turned their own selves in to get away from him they're scared of that man they at least the united states are giving them a chance to live and he won't even give them a chance to live or do anything else so i 

233.15 234.28 B: right 

235.38 236.43 B: (( they are )) 

240.91 242.32 B: mhm

247.58 248.66 B: right 

249.10 253.87 A: but i think we done the best thing we could do when we went over there 

253.88 258.03 A: and went to war with that country and mr bush and our leaders 

258.34 266.37 A: and lots of people done a lot of thinking and talking and praying and everything else about this situation and i'm proud of it

354.80 355.86 A: what uh 

355.36 357.75 B: um i think um 

357.77 366.66 B: i think that another thing going on is how we help um how we help israel why why that why that kind of angers a lot of other other countries but 

366.80 370.22 B: israel i think we think israel are um 

370.65 377.39 B: they treat their people well and we we think we kind of [cough] we have respect for the way they [cough] for the way 

372.42 373.53 A: (( right all )) 

377.62 386.76 B: they do things over there and treat their people and other countries that surround them don't treat them quite as freely that's why i think we like israel 

386.46 390.83 A: right and i couldn't understand when they wanted to the 

390.85 400.34 A: i can't think what i'm trying to say but when we asked for help to fight this country over there some of them some people turned us down and we've helped those people we've helped those countries before 

395.73 396.48 B: yeah 

399.40 402.75 B: that's right france turned us down and we helped 'em 

401.94 404.80 A: that's that's sort of made me feel bad 'cause 

404.85 410.15 A: we get and probably some american people lost their lives over there i don't know all the details about it 

410.02 411.35 B: (( absolutely [mn] )) 

410.84 414.86 A: and but then they wouldn't turn around and help us and they don't 

414.99 418.09 A: i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want a whole lot of friends like that 

417.70 422.26 B: no you're right and um now that it's more or less 

422.74 434.12 B: [cough] now that it's more of less over it seems like most of these countries who didn't help us are at least kind of hopping on the bandwagon and saying hey well you guys did it right [cough] 

429.73 430.76 A: right 

431.87 439.05 A: you know we were there helping you all if you all need us you all call we did call some of them some of them turned us down also 

434.49 435.14 B: (( [cough] )) 

438.67 440.79 B: right 

439.58 441.33 A: and of course 

441.36 444.42 A: in a small place like where i live of course 

444.57 451.00 A: the oil we got oil i don't know whether oil prices are coming down or not i hope it does i can tell a little bit about it anyway 

447.81 449.24 B: mhm 

450.47 451.85 B: right 

451.11 454.65 A: and the economy i hope the economy gets back good 

454.78 455.71 A: uh 

455.70 456.72 B: me too 

456.46 460.20 A: i hope i don't why i used to watch the stock market every day 

459.75 461.25 B: yeah 

460.34 464.76 A: but i don't i quit watching it because it made me sick when things would happen 

464.43 466.63 B: sure we kind got um 

466.21 467.77 A: i got 

466.79 469.65 B: we got rocked by the yeah 

467.86 470.27 A: oh did we though it was terrible what 

469.85 471.29 B: yeah 

470.56 471.59 A: uh 

472.10 478.73 A: do you think it like like we still got a lot of people over there and all that type of stuff do you think maybe 

476.36 477.35 B: yeah 

478.93 486.56 A: one say in six months a year they'll be coming home or we always we will always have to have people over there i think to help those people 

487.03 488.33 A: leaving so 

487.24 491.15 B: i gotta i gotta agree with that yeah 'cause um 

491.51 493.58 B: because um it's 

493.66 499.48 B: well kinda until things are i guess it depends on how um how long we think things 

499.94 507.74 B: are stable or when you know when they when they get a government that that in there that can kind of contain itself rule itself 

507.48 517.46 A: and uh of course there's now there's and i think mr mr bush has done a great job and all those people the leaders of the land 

516.89 520.49 B: he has he has really rallied a lot of people behind him 

520.19 521.72 A: yeah i think so 

520.67 524.33 B: and under a good cause i think i really do 

523.97 530.89 A: yes sir and because i i won't have a go in my lifetime anyway i don't think anyway i don't have a desire to go over there but 

530.36 532.69 B: (( [mn] right )) 

531.22 536.18 A: but i'd feel safer going over there now than i would have before this war ever come up 

535.86 537.02 B: sure 

536.77 542.88 A: and uh and i think again i i pray for mr mr bush for doing the job he done 

542.58 544.18 B: mhm
