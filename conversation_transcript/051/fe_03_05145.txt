15.70 18.97 A: mhm what do you think about it 

18.16 23.96 B: well ah i hate to think about computers ah education without computers 

24.24 25.69 A: oh really 

24.34 29.38 B: (( i think yeah i think it i wish i'd had computers when i was in school but ah )) 

29.58 30.60 B: i think and 

29.63 40.59 A: yeah interestingly like i i grew up around um computers like when i yeah no- not until like maybe like seventh or eighth grade but not not too early 

34.75 35.90 B: oh really 

40.65 44.13 B: well when i went to school we didn't have computers at all 

44.03 45.47 A: oh really 

44.89 50.93 B: yeah so i i wish we had now i had i've had a computer since ah 

51.04 52.98 B: probably seventy nine 

53.14 54.51 A: oh really 

53.90 64.58 B: yeah so i mean i had to do my own programming so i mean i know i'm pretty pretty good but man i'd hate to think what the school system would be with the education system would be like without computers 

64.49 76.37 A: yeah but i i think that like there there could be a negative impact because i mean like kids can use it the wrong way like instead of for educational purposes 

76.54 79.74 B: [lipsmack] well that's true ah but 

78.22 81.17 A: it depends on how you use it 

80.11 83.39 B: there'll always be kids though that that ah 

83.90 86.61 B: misuse or abuse it 

86.10 86.91 A: mhm 

86.62 93.47 B: and ah someone will turn out like bill gates and then someone will turn up in in in federal prison somewhere so 

90.09 91.26 A: [laughter] 

93.21 100.80 A: that's that's quite a slim chance i'll turn out like bill gates though i think ah i think that's that's a rash of luck 

97.16 99.45 B: (( [laughter] you )) 

100.38 100.94 B: (( [mn] )) 

101.02 111.02 B: well the- well yeah i i i think it's probably like ah athletes and if you have a thousand athletes how many actually make it to the n._f._l. you know make it to the pros 

109.50 110.55 A: yeah 

110.67 112.19 A: (( i see what you're saying )) 

112.00 116.51 B: so you know bill gates steve jobs ah 

116.56 121.13 B: guys like that you know they they just happened to make it to the pros 

120.88 121.93 A: (( [laughter] )) 

122.02 128.42 B: but in some er- some of the poorer school districts ah if they didn't have computers 

128.32 136.62 A: yeah unfortunately like i i've heard stories like where they um where they had to share a computer or maybe not even have one 

136.49 138.16 B: yeah yeah 

137.04 141.68 A: and some some schools have like practically one for every student so 

142.03 143.64 A: it's fairly unfair 

142.14 143.15 B: well 

143.47 147.22 B: yeah it depends on the school district the part of town you live in 

147.14 148.43 A: yeah 

147.79 153.61 B: i know if you go to the library sometimes ah they have com- got computers 

153.69 157.47 B: kids could be out in in front of the library even before it opens 

157.48 158.87 A: (( hm wow )) 

157.98 164.30 B: and it and it's because it's for two reasons number one they want to get in and get a computer and number two 

164.59 168.94 B: that they use the parents use the library as a babysitting 

168.84 170.43 A: (( ah )) 

170.28 171.82 B: yeah and tho- 

170.94 172.79 A: it d- it doubles up 

172.76 174.20 B: yeah it doubles 

174.22 177.58 B: because they come in in the morning and they don't leave until 

177.61 180.16 B: you know the library closes 

180.12 188.20 A: what's up with those um i've seen i i don't know if they have them in your area but like i've seen like after school like um 

188.25 193.47 A: like places set up with computers and for kids after school like to do their homework whatever 

193.25 200.42 B: yeah and in some areas of town ah especially in a couple of a- the ah lower income areas of town 

200.53 212.58 B: ah there've been people who have just taken it upon themselves to to get an old room or or a house or something and outfit with a computers now they're not state of the art computers but they work 

212.47 213.60 A: that's true 

213.40 217.72 B: and ah you know you can get internet you don't need a lot of power to get on the internet 

217.69 221.13 A: yeah do they do they um charge for that do you know 

218.54 219.36 B: yeah 

220.68 221.98 B: no uh-uh 

221.96 224.28 A: oh that's great 

222.23 233.14 B: so it so an- and i mean once again it's almost like babysitting but at least the kids least the kids are doing something they're not out in the streets they're there learning using computers and learning 

226.22 227.35 A: [laughter] 

231.41 233.10 A: right 

233.13 235.53 A: huh i never thought about it in that way 

235.59 239.33 B: yeah i i'm a volunteer for um ah 

240.26 243.68 B: a um tut- mentoring program 

243.38 244.70 A: (( oh really )) 

244.09 249.37 B: and la- and last year we had ah some companies donate their old computers 

249.28 251.05 A: mhm 

249.60 255.07 B: and and we ah well not we i fixed them i tore them apart and put them back together 

255.08 256.67 A: (( oh okay like you )) 

255.36 256.74 B: and we and we took 

257.34 263.59 B: them around and gave them to ah low income households single ah actually we gave them to the single 

263.99 267.17 B: single parents single female head of households 

267.11 269.07 A: mhm 

267.76 269.99 B: and ah man they loved them 

270.05 271.27 A: oh 

270.94 272.16 B: that was great 

271.73 275.27 A: wow that's good to hear like something like that's going on 

275.52 280.87 B: yeah i- it's it's always something you can do there's always somewhere you can volunteer 

280.95 283.27 A: oh how'd you get involved in that though 

283.75 285.32 B: ah well 

285.59 293.82 B: ah my kids got grown and i i figured you and and and mo- and a lot of the kids in my neighborhood would always ask questions or 

293.78 295.04 A: (( oh )) 

294.42 302.92 B: you know need to borrow my printer or something like that so i was like you know what i might as well go ahead and go somewhere and officially volunteer and and help 'em out 

297.10 298.23 A: [laughter] 

302.76 304.11 A: oh okay 

304.32 306.81 B: so their computers um 

307.59 315.21 B: ah some some law firms have given computers to schools in ah lower income ah areas and ah 

315.38 318.62 B: then the teachers are just so grateful for that 

319.50 326.42 B: [laughter] because the computers are teaching the kids a lot you know they're they're teaching them while the teachers are doing something else 

326.24 327.07 A: (( uh-huh )) 

327.89 329.04 B: (( so ah )) 

329.11 332.51 B: anyway the i think computers in the education 

332.62 336.76 B: i'm all for it i think it's more definitely more positive than negative 

336.53 341.49 A: yeah i agree with that it it seems like you only have like 

341.60 353.42 A: ah distinct cases where you hear of kids hacking into the school system but o- overall i think like it helps like especially especially research 

346.25 347.65 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

353.41 354.30 B: (( [noise] right )) 

353.63 356.15 A: i- it speeds it up a little bit more [mn] 

356.57 357.86 B: well i think 

357.89 359.32 B: (( go head )) 

358.80 365.72 A: oh i'm sorry 'cause like i mean i i'm going to school myself and like i i don't know what i'd do without it you know 

366.21 367.68 B: well that's true 

366.47 372.99 A: something like yeah 'cause in- information's just getting more and more 

369.26 370.28 B: and ah

404.81 406.69 B: you know we don't do it anymore 

406.47 410.75 A: yeah that's that's true i think it's it's actually um
