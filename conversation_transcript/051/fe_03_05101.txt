30.44 42.47 A: you know just like almost black and white you know to some degree uh not as you know not as bad with black and white as it is over there but y- y- i just feel that diplomacy is so important

46.93 48.27 B: i agree 

49.23 55.74 B: uh do y- do you have ver- uh do you have h- uh very high hopes for these negotiations right now 

55.25 69.21 A: well i think they'll go along for a certain extent of time and i mean you know uh when they had the agreement years ago you know between israel and egypt you know that went fine 

60.06 61.75 B: yeah 

68.77 76.97 B: well what's interesting over there is the fact that most americans love saddam he was the one that negotiated and everything but in egypt he's hated 

77.68 80.33 A: well is is that true i 

79.52 88.09 B: yeah yeah yeah and even his wife who doesn't live in egypt she lives in the states she lives in maryland with her children 

80.63 81.65 A: oh 

82.85 83.76 A: uh-huh 

87.22 91.45 A: oh she does oh wow 

88.57 102.99 B: yeah you you know it because i i went to college for politics and i've always ever since a child i've always liked politics and this is one of the subjects especially in new york city uh a lot of people feel strongly one way or another 

93.63 94.85 A: oh 

95.58 96.62 A: uh-huh 

99.27 100.15 A: mhm 

102.58 103.47 A: uh-huh 

103.31 115.83 B: i'm person- i i when i went to college uh i went to college with a lot of iranians uh because yeah because at that time the country was falling apart and a lot of the people the families wealthy families uh 

108.47 110.53 A: oh did you oh 

115.10 115.96 A: uh-huh 

115.62 124.09 B: sent their children to the states and everything and they went to college over here a lot of my friends they some of them were pro shah uh you know pro shah 

117.93 118.94 A: oh 

122.88 125.78 A: the shah of iran yeah yeah mhm mhm 

123.94 128.17 B: right and some of them were pro khomeini and everything and it was very interesting 

126.42 127.46 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

128.01 132.64 B: but i've always been very sympathetic like i believe that the palestinians 

132.43 147.00 B: have a right to a homeland and i and i don't think that united states is terribly objective when it concerns the the arab world i think to be honest with you like uh president bush says oh this isn't a war against islam 

133.85 135.52 A: i agree i do 

135.58 136.43 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

146.79 149.84 B: i think personally i think it is 

149.57 150.51 A: do you 

150.01 156.99 B: i i think we have something against muslims it's a different faith we don't even have 

155.84 156.51 A: (( okay )) 

156.94 159.91 B: [mn] i think in this country 'cause you know 

159.85 173.47 B: you know christianity's so much a part of the country that you know uh uh and especially with bush he looks to uh the the jews as like you know a something in prophecy that you know the jews must have a homeland and everything 

160.82 161.71 A: sure 

162.43 163.43 A: (( that's right )) 

172.25 174.16 A: mhm that's true 

173.61 179.51 B: and i there's something with a religious fundamentalist in the country and the right wing jews 

179.54 193.36 B: and it it bothers me greatly because of the fact that i don't think president bush really gives a damn about the palestinian people and yeah and ariel sharron is not a man of peace of all if you 

187.33 189.65 A: oh do you really think that way do ya 

192.50 195.27 A: no no he- he's a violent man 

194.57 197.66 B: he he yeah and oh i'm sorry go ahead 

195.32 196.09 A: and 

196.74 205.95 A: he was very very even before he assumed the you know prime ministership uh he was an sob [laughter] uh [laughter] 

202.84 212.90 B: yeah he goes back he goes back to i don't know if you remember when they went into lebanon in the la- in the eighties under pagan he was the general there 

211.36 214.24 A: [noise] oh oh that's right yes yes 

212.87 218.22 B: and a- apparently they massacred uh a lot of uh palestinians 

217.72 220.67 A: yeah i have heard something like that 

218.66 226.57 B: rig- yeah yeah yeah and he had a he was forced to resign because he knew that they were going in there for that reason and he just looked the other way 

224.38 225.36 A: mhm 

226.51 237.71 A: yeah i was real surprised when he got elected uh to the prime ministership because he's so radical in his beliefs although he has at least outwardly toned himself down to some degree 

237.43 252.06 B: you know it- not not not really not really it's it it is very interesting the media like for example after nine eleven and also after uh with this iraqi war and everything it is interesting that how the mo- media portrays things 

244.45 245.37 A: uh-huh 

247.15 248.37 A: (( yeah uh-huh uh mhm )) 

251.88 261.48 B: no in in israel there's people of his in his government that believe in deporting the the arab from israel 

261.23 264.20 A: oh really oh my goodness sakes 

261.94 266.12 B: oh yeah they they believe in deportation and i said uh my because i've 

265.89 278.46 B: living in new york city i have a lot of jewish friends and i says [lipsmack] well that sounds very much like hitler doesn't it and also i don't know if you're familiar they're also building a wall over there in certain parts of israel to 

270.75 272.61 A: yes it sure does 

275.94 276.61 A: wh- 

277.58 280.27 A: was it fencing or actually a wall 

279.66 281.86 B: (( a wall a wall )) 

280.56 282.10 A: actually a wall 

281.72 288.52 B: yes i says [lipsmack] doesn't that remind you about the warsaw ghetto and and they say no no no 

285.20 286.82 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

288.34 294.98 B: i says you know something it it's so interesting the the oppressed becomes the re- a- repressers 

294.77 300.18 B: i says i don't know oh for example in this country when uh we freed uh the slaves 

299.78 300.58 A: yes 

299.96 308.94 B: some blacks went to africa to uh liberia and what did they do over there they did the exact same thing over there they created a caste system 

308.85 315.37 B: of you know the lighter skinned people had all the power and all the dark skinned people you know they took advantage of 

310.85 311.66 A: mhm 

312.54 314.22 A: mm yeah 

314.47 317.41 A: were secondary that's right second class 

315.42 323.71 B: yeah and it's interesting how th- the you know with people don't like being repressed and then once they get power what do they do they 

323.17 325.08 A: they do the same thing again 

324.16 327.12 B: yeah i find it so interesting 

325.70 334.33 A: well india of course still has the caste system they probably always will have the caste system you can't get away from that that's something that's forever with them 

328.61 330.42 B: yeah 

333.73 335.22 B: (( right right )) 

334.36 344.37 A: but getting back to this other thing with uh palestinian state yes definitely hey have to have a place to live just like they created israel like fifty some years ago you know 

343.30 345.30 B: fifty fifty odd years ago 

344.72 350.46 A: yeah right so i mean they really have to have their own area but in a sense i think i can't 

350.36 362.79 A: blame israel for trying to block or stop these people that come in loaded with ammunition on their body and blow themselves up in the middle of a bus or something like that yeah 

358.45 367.08 B: yeah well i'm not saying yeah yeah yeah this is a great thing of course not but one thi- but one thing 

364.89 365.73 A: right 

366.96 369.64 B: i tell my friends i says you know something 

369.40 373.88 B: i says where is the difference i says it's a war of liberation 

373.65 386.42 B: the israelis do not want to acknowledge that they have a right to a homeland as the english didn't want to recognize that the jewish people had a right to a homeland also there were more palestinians in that region 

378.79 379.59 A: yeah 

383.18 384.20 A: mhm 

386.22 398.29 B: than jews there were eighty thousand jews in uh what is considered israel now there was like uh uh three hundred and eight thousand palestinians excuse me the numbers don't match up there 

391.46 392.29 A: uh-huh 

395.23 396.37 A: oh my goodness 

396.66 400.84 A: wow no they sure don't that's for sure 

399.03 400.65 B: yeah but well 

400.51 403.60 B: yeah but it's you know it's you know everyone you know 

401.64 402.45 A: (( [noise] mhm mhm )) 

403.44 416.88 B: you know they have a state now and they they don't want to accept the fact that as i said they have a right to a homeland like for example with this w- with the war with iraq you know w- um weapons of mass destruction chemical warfare 

415.41 416.19 A: right 

416.50 417.21 A: (( right yeah )) 

416.96 429.68 B: you don't hear much in the conversation the fact that israel has four hundred nuclear bombs and they also have chemical warfare but we don't we don't we don't discuss that they introduced nuclear weapons into the region 

423.68 424.82 A: that's right 

429.27 436.98 A: and i really think that israel would not be existent if it wasn't for us we pour a hell of a lot of money 

435.24 436.31 B: indeed 

436.39 437.73 B: i i agree 

437.17 443.91 A: into israel every year but we do it because there's a lot of jewish influence in the united states 

443.38 444.43 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

444.08 449.74 A: and we wanna keep 'em happy and of course their votes you know for us for them the politicians 

449.64 464.17 A: and i just feel that you know israels fine i mean we have to back 'em up because they're a force in the area and we have to have some kind of force in the area or they'll just be walked over by well the six day war you know years ago mhm mhm 

462.98 471.44 B: i i i agree but don't you think that as every country that receives money from united states they have to answer to us 

464.25 464.92 A: (( uh-huh )) 

471.30 475.86 B: israel does not seem to answer like for example when uh sharron was going into the 

475.86 486.72 B: the regions that were controlled by the palestinians george bush kept on telling 'em get out of there get outta there and he totally ignored them he totally ignored the numerous times 

480.61 481.42 A: yeah 

483.03 484.00 A: (( yeah )) 

485.60 494.43 A: i agree that part but do you think really when george bush said get outta there do you think that was just for consumption of the public 

494.37 502.63 A: and uh you know he said well i'm gonna say this to the public i want you to get out of there but you do your thing and get it down i don't know [laughter] 

498.52 500.50 B: (( i )) 

500.34 509.50 B: i a- actually th- that that is a good point but i also heard a journalist sa- indicate that he says that he spoke to some some people at the white house 

502.64 503.20 A: (( [mn] )) 

509.08 509.94 A: mhm 

509.32 521.11 B: apparently the strategy of the white house is to win the jewish vote and that that that makes sense to me because of the fact that they're basically allowing sharron to do whatever he wants there 

514.19 516.12 A: yeah everything is [mn] 

516.70 517.50 A: yeah 

520.04 521.66 A: mhm that's right 

520.91 525.07 B: you know obviously we knew how close the election was last time 

524.65 527.08 A: yes very much so mhm 

524.94 535.08 B: and uh you know obviously they have to go after every potential vote and uh you know th- the jewish community how how strongly they support israel 

529.28 530.20 A: sure 

534.92 541.65 B: it's like you know i i living in new york city with so many jewish people is i often compare it to 'cause i 

538.26 539.27 A: sure 

541.56 552.51 B: i've lived in florida at one time and down in florida you do not discuss castro you do not say anything pos- uh positive about him otherwise you're a communist 

543.53 545.23 A: oh did you uh-huh 

550.04 553.41 A: oh right i i can imagine yes 

552.48 561.43 B: and the same thing in new york city any time you criticize israel it's like [lipsmack] oh you're anti semitic i says excuse me i'm not anti semitic i says but i am objective 

556.44 558.20 A: (( oh oh )) 

560.99 562.42 A: mhm true 

561.57 564.77 B: i am objective and uh i believe that you know 

564.70 575.71 B: like for example someone that i was having a conversation with uh someone else overheard the conversation and he says i i worked in saudi arabia for five years and he says i not me but this guy was saying 

571.59 574.26 A: (( mm )) 

574.54 576.47 A: (( mhm oh mhm yeah )) 

575.63 582.80 B: and he says i knew a couple that their family lived in jerusalem for four hundred years 

582.21 583.66 A: uh-huh wow 

582.82 587.94 B: and when israel uh you know took over the country they were they were deported 

585.76 586.54 A: (( yeah )) 

587.27 589.60 A: oh oh for gosh sake oh 

588.09 596.89 B: and he says for four hundred years we all of my family lived there and he says now he says i i we lost everything the family 

589.87 590.69 A: gee 

591.20 592.60 A: oh my god 

593.04 594.60 A: yeah that's not right 

595.48 597.12 A: yeah that's not right 

597.16 599.89 A: um although some of this stuff we're uh
