82.66 88.02 A: [mn] sure so uh what's a what's it like they asked they asked about favorite holidays 

88.07 94.73 A: um [lipsmack] and the other thing that they said with that is if you had if you could create [noise] a holiday what would it be 

94.10 96.52 B: uh that's a wonderful thought 

96.02 99.71 A: [laughter] oh yes i'll start with if you could create a holiday 

96.70 97.72 B: yeah 

98.85 100.21 B: okay 

99.74 105.61 A: as an orthodox jew i would create a holiday to celebrate the end of passover [laughter] 

104.95 107.08 B: oh that's kind of nice 

105.71 113.55 A: because passover is a great holiday but a lot of work [laughter] for the orthodox jew oh okay [mn] [mn] 

110.37 111.52 B: yes 

112.39 119.46 B: i could imagine see i'm jewish [mn] but i'm certainly i am the ultra ultra extreme i'm pretty reformed myself 

114.22 114.92 A: (( courtier )) 

118.50 120.34 A: (( and of course the )) 

119.73 125.75 B: so tell me of all the work that you have to go through i mean i know of course i have friends who were and 

123.44 124.31 A: (( different dishes )) 

126.19 130.11 B: and especially the gifts although you need so much more 

127.28 128.66 A: right 

129.74 134.07 A: yeah so well passover is basically a huge spring cleaning 

133.61 134.80 B: yeah 

134.22 141.43 A: which is a spring cleaning from the top to the bottom of your house and making sure there's not a crumb left anywhere 

137.63 138.36 B: (( oh wow )) 

140.28 142.00 B: (( [noise] right )) 

141.59 144.86 A: and when it comes to the ki- kitchen for a passover 

144.26 145.26 B: yeah 

145.20 151.96 A: like pretty much we cover everything over with aluminium foil all our counter space and everything 

149.31 150.19 B: (( right right )) 

152.08 157.67 A: and we don't use our regular stove stove or oven we sort of close those off 

153.90 154.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

157.07 158.33 B: yeah 

157.85 158.79 A: um 

158.94 164.28 A: just ma- major amounts of cleaning and then the food is very restricted but 

163.01 163.93 B: yeah 

164.29 166.97 A: there's we use handmade schmiralotzah 

166.82 169.04 B: [lipsmack] really 

167.84 179.10 A: yeah so that's that's i think that's delicious gets a little tiring after a while and especially older people have to be a little careful about how much they eat 'cause it what it does to your digestive system 

172.40 173.76 B: yeah 

176.68 177.83 B: right 

178.02 183.39 B: absolutely yes i know of that of course i will that's fascinating see 

180.12 181.97 A: yeah [laughter] 

182.37 186.51 A: but on the other hand it's really strong fibre so it does have a [laughter] good effect 

184.49 192.17 B: yes yes see that's funny that it's it's so i always talk about that you know to people who are not jewish um 

192.11 196.25 B: that in judaism even though you and i are jewish we're the same religion 

196.11 207.96 B: you know our actions are so different i mean you wouldn't dare to ride on saturday right and you wouldn't dare to ride friday night [lipsmack] and now are you um hassidic or are you [mn] 

198.13 199.34 A: exactly 

201.56 202.71 A: right 

203.88 204.87 A: right 

206.82 211.77 A: i am but actually i'm also a doctor so i can drive for patient care 

210.61 218.03 B: uh yes of course they always say uh like you could say um on y- yom kippur if you have to take medication it's okay 

212.28 213.82 A: (( but otherwise i don't [noise] )) 

217.44 218.79 A: absolutely 

218.34 222.03 B: oh that's fascinating that re- what kind of doctor are you 

219.47 220.23 A: (( so )) 

221.58 222.84 A: i'm a surgeon 

222.42 231.31 B: oh boy i'm ve- i'm very honored to be to be talking to you [laughter] so you live in the city in manhattan yeah 

223.17 225.46 A: so a resident but 

226.83 229.53 A: [laughter] thanks it's a 

229.87 232.86 A: yeah so how about your holiday what's your favorite 

232.15 242.74 B: okay well i'd say my favorite holiday is um probably memorial day and not because of what it represents which of course it's a wonderful wonderful holiday to think about 

242.71 254.16 B: you know all of the people who um defended our country but um to me it's sort of the uh beginning of summer and the beginning of good times and happy times especially with this past winter 

250.29 251.49 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

253.94 255.03 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

254.04 266.97 B: um i'm the type of person i'm very highly affected by weather and by lights um so when it gets dark at four thirty in the afternoon and i also work you know i'm in the insurance business 

266.32 267.29 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

266.87 275.02 B: so getting out let's say five o' clock clock pitch black freezing cold ice driving all that i hate it 

274.79 275.80 A: yeah 

275.13 282.21 B: and we could always say you know that we've had i think one of the worst winters this year for many years [laughter] we've been spoilt 

278.98 281.64 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

282.11 291.89 B: so i my favorite um holiday would be probably memorial day because again what it represents it represents you know the beginning of of summer and life and just 

291.75 299.72 B: watching i mean just right now watching all the trees bud and the flowers i love it i really love it i'm just so happy 

296.86 298.36 A: (( yeah that's yeah )) 

299.74 306.24 B: you know because new york it's tough especially of course of what we've all been through too and just living in this area 

306.11 311.33 A: yeah and that's that's right this memorial day is gonna mean so much more than usual 

311.03 312.27 B: (( i know )) 

311.61 323.45 A: besides for it like a like you said on the first [noise] just basically what it's made for is having our troops come home is you know you watch it on t._v. and it's so exciting thank god thank god 

315.43 316.67 B: right 

318.23 319.59 B: (( i know )) 

322.59 332.59 B: absolutely i mean we're very lucky um 'cause y- i had a few friends who were against the war and then i'd i've really you know wanted it i felt it was the only thing to do [noise] 

331.80 333.14 A: (( [noise] right )) 

332.43 337.73 B: but then you know looking back of course and seeing well i think they said a hundred and twenty five were 

337.51 338.09 B: (( [noise] )) 

338.06 343.19 B: killed which of course in war is very good i mean you of course being a doctor yo- 

340.22 341.22 A: yeah 

343.15 357.04 B: that would [laughter] [sigh] certainly uh confirm that compared to the statistics you know from vietnam and all the others we've had [noise] so it's just tough times we're living in but i just thank god that you know we come from we all live in a wonderful country and 

343.55 344.64 A: yeah 

348.64 349.70 A: yeah 

357.13 367.19 B: um it's america were you born here of course yeah did you grow up in new york area [noise] yeah me too my whole life [laughter]

367.37 371.34 B: i know i did live in new jersey for two years i guess that counts [laughter] 

370.86 372.41 A: that's still close enough 

372.06 379.14 B: i know i know so that's wonderful that you have um that were you're a resident and so what

541.04 547.23 B: so this is my third call now they only um allow you three that's what it says 

546.49 554.74 A: says that they only allow you three but somewhere on the study it mentioned that if you have different phones to call from you might be able to have more than that or 

553.47 557.99 B: [cough] oh that's right that's right 'cause it asks what type of phone 

555.82 556.62 A: (( something )) 

557.67 560.21 A: right so i have to look into that 

558.12 559.26 B: (( [cough] well )) 

559.46 568.41 B: yeah that's fascinating it really is because it um i called myself i wasn't called the three times i did it this is third time

582.30 584.28 B: (( oh of course )) 

584.34 592.69 A: one so i i'm not sure why w- actually i do know why 'cause i thought i'd be home so as one was right before charvis and one was right after and i hadn't been out of 

592.74 599.02 A: the house i'd been by a friend for charvis so [noise] but this way it's easier you just make your own call 

594.65 595.95 B: yeah 

598.29 599.95 B: of course have you been
