0.17 2.16 B: hello this is david willis 

1.95 4.49 A: hi my name is april huck 

4.89 6.49 B: hi how's 

5.05 6.20 A: i live 

6.35 9.64 A: i live in west los angeles california 

8.28 9.69 B: (( it )) 

10.15 13.01 B: oh and i live in hollywood california 

12.24 15.72 A: oh okay um we live pretty close to each other then 

15.91 18.16 B: yeah that's that's that's kind of weird 

18.08 20.28 A: [laughter] 

18.28 21.35 B: so [laughter] would you like to go first 

21.02 23.58 A: um no you go first 

23.73 27.09 B: okay well um i guess the topic today was bioterrorism 

27.15 33.85 B: and um i'm not sure exactly what they want us to talk about it but uh i feel that all the uh 

34.09 38.62 B: stuff that the united states has been doing to try and prevent all this bioterrorism by uh 

38.81 44.44 B: cutting back on our civil liberties and all these extra taxes to cover all this homeland security stuff 

44.36 57.87 B: is really just like a lot of crap because we can't really do anything um to stop bioterrorism on any kind of scale whatsoever if one person feels like they wanna do it then it's pretty easy for them to do so 

57.21 67.18 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well do you think then uh do you think then that all of our national defence is basically farce is that what your saying i mean because by the logical of your argument you would be saying that 

58.07 59.03 B: that's pretty 

67.22 76.00 A: kind of all of our national defence is kind of useless because of one person could ruin any of the holes in our national defence 

76.79 90.72 B: well i'm not saying that it's completely uh useless but it's it's great for like a larger scale type of situation but you you're not going to stop if somebody like they they even admitted it if somebody wants to kill the president and they're willing to sacrifice their lives they're gonna kill the president 

83.03 84.17 A: mhm 

90.66 91.68 A: right 

90.93 92.95 B: (( you know and it it )) 

91.47 98.82 A: but does that mean that the whole program is a waste or does it mean that we should continue to fund the program and expand the program 

98.62 107.59 A: but just have more realistic expectations and use our propaganda system to more educate the public and make the public more understand that 

107.43 115.93 A: it isn't a full proof system but it's more of a hit and miss system but to understand that we need needlessly we need it either way 

116.51 128.66 B: right well no i understand that we do need but yes we should uh we should channel our efforts and our mone- monetary sources towards things that we can actually like help prevent or benefit or things like 

127.99 129.57 A: mhm 

129.29 131.09 B: whereas we just 

129.62 136.63 A: do you think do you think like we should all have like bioterrorism suits like in our homes or in our workplaces 

136.96 145.72 B: no i don't because uh i think that it a bioterrorism attack occurs i don't think you really have enough time or 

146.09 152.89 B: chance to put that on if you're within the zone the killing zone already you're pretty much gonna dead 

153.07 156.22 B: quickly and it's just gonna cause hysteria and all that 

156.09 164.52 A: see i disagree i think that i think that at least you should be wear like some kind of a gas mask i mean i know with most like biochemical weapons that 

156.30 157.17 B: (( and )) 

164.29 174.53 A: it doesn't matter like if you're able to burn your skin and stuff like that you're probably gonna die anyways but i think for some reason like you you should be able to have made or they should be able to manufacture 

169.31 170.37 B: mhm 

174.30 186.65 A: some kind of gas mask or some kind of head mask that's able to like block off your mucus membranes and your mouth and your ears and it should be like light and durable and easy to carry around with you 

178.12 178.68 B: (( [noise] )) 

186.47 192.82 A: so that like that should just kinda be part of like something you bring with you like your umbrella that you carry with you in your car 

192.58 207.37 A: or that you have at home with you and that just that should just be kinda like part of our like earthquake preparedness war preparedness it should just be something that becomes a part of life i don't think it should take over our lives but i think it should just be something that we kind of 

207.30 216.26 A: implement more in our life but i don't think it should be something that should be expensive but i think that they should purposely manufacture it so that it's attainable for everybody 

216.00 219.06 B: do you think it should be something that the the government should supply 

219.40 227.52 A: i don't if it's someth- well i don't know i mean they seem to be just spending a lot of money on things that don't seem to be working so for me it's something more practical 

227.34 236.82 A: and it gives the you know population some more sense of control over the situation because you know you're right you mention the word hysteria and that just seems to be exactly what's going on 

236.76 242.69 A: and you know there's there's a lot of holes in the system as it is and you wanna just expand and expand 

242.46 252.03 A: i mean why not just make the public feel more in charge and more in control and manufacture something that is of durable grade that is affordable 

251.83 257.62 A: and maybe there's some kind of a tax or some kind of a bond that money is raised to like supply this 

257.46 270.23 A: as opposed to like you know spending more money on having the national guard at the airport which i don't think is something that's gonna help national defence or national security or help us you know ward off any type of biochemical attack per se 

270.66 272.02 A: that's all i'm saying 

272.48 276.89 B: [noise] right well then that makes you know complete sense i completely agree with you on that [noise] 

277.24 281.21 A: yeah i don't know how else i mean i know we're supposed to talk for ten minutes about it but 

281.02 286.26 A: i don't know of any other ways i think we could kind of ward off a biochemical attack other than like 

286.05 298.20 A: stopping some of our imperialistic tactics that get the rest of the world like this angry with us but i know that we can't you know talk with each and every single individual in the rest of the world and make them happy with us as a nation or 

298.07 301.87 A: as a national agency or body of people you know 

301.82 303.57 B: right 

302.93 314.77 A: so i don't really know what we you know what else we could do besides you know have some kind of more equal system where there aren't people starving in the world or aren't there aren't you know reasons for people to become zealous 

315.11 318.48 A: and that my friend i just can't i just don't know 

318.84 325.37 B: right no i under- again i completely agree with you we should stop uh running around uh flexing our muscles and pissing everybody off 

322.11 322.93 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

325.47 339.60 A: yeah and i don't think the media i don't think the media is helping in any way i think they're just aggravating the situation i mean they're not helping me feel more empowered in this situation and i thought that we owned the media and that it was like for the social purposes and i feel that they're just really 

339.53 354.07 A: screwing us in this instances and you know maybe we just use a lot of advertising dollars you know toward the purposes of making the public feel more in control and empowered we would be able to like get out of this mess that we're in i don't know 

354.72 356.49 A: (( [noise] )) 

355.83 368.90 B: yeah i don't see any quick fix or anything like that at all especially with the bioterrorism part where one person can uh just come in and like i said take out hundreds of thousands not only the people what he can carry on his body 

368.55 377.31 A: right and i mean if you make more more chemicals illegal i mean all there is is a black market and i mean what what's i don't even know what they're doing about the black market 

373.76 375.29 B: yeah 

377.13 389.12 A: the more you make something illegal the more it becomes underground and i don't even know what they're doing about that i mean a person like me with my status and my level isn't privy to that kind of information 

389.21 401.15 A: so i don't even know how i would go about getting the information even analyze that situation to even talk about it in this type of of forum [laughter] to be honest with you you know i mean i don't even know enough about that 

389.50 391.17 B: right 

400.94 404.09 B: yeah oh yeah yeah yeah i know i know we only know what they tell us so 

404.17 414.73 B: it's pretty hard to like uh actually be able to speak on the topic any more than i think we already have and i'm not even sure how long we've been speaking at this point so um i don't have you done have you done this before 

412.47 424.56 A: well have yeah yeah i done this one before one time and basically the way it works is that um you have to talk until they stop telling they come on and tell you to stop talking [noise] so 

423.29 426.18 B: oh so they will they will cut in and then they'll 

424.63 426.20 A: [noise] yes 

426.51 427.32 A: yes 

426.62 427.95 B: oh okay 

427.45 434.07 A: [noise] yeah so you have to keep brainstorming on other ideas about how to 

428.80 431.15 B: (( i see okay so how are things )) 

434.29 436.19 A: what to do about bioterrorism 

437.28 438.77 B: huh well 

437.60 447.34 A: i think it's just something that's always gonna be there i mean just like if there wasn't bioterrorism there there's still the bombs you know there's still the missiles there's still lasers i mean 

447.61 449.95 A: if it's not one thing it's gonna be another thing 

450.10 459.84 B: right totally always there's always gonna be something there's always gonna be somebody made as somebody that doesn't care about hurting anybody else just to get their message across 

460.05 462.31 B: and there's nothing you can do about that [noise] 

462.10 470.51 A: [noise] yeah i mean i wouldn't even think i was thinking about education and i was thinking this isn't even a matter about education i mean it's about a matter of opinion and it's a matter of you know 

471.29 474.69 A: things that i don't even really understand necessarily as an american 

474.67 475.55 B: right 

475.49 478.33 A: so i mean [sigh] i don't know 

477.08 482.25 B: yeah i mean that goes all it goes all the way back to like the kamikazes in world war two and i'm sure even further back but 

482.53 491.10 B: you've got people that are willing to like do whatever it takes to get their point across and now it just happens the easiest way to do that with the most effective is bioterrorism 

489.00 497.04 A: [noise] well but we also we lots of those people on our own soil too i mean it's not even just that it's foreign people i mean we have lots tons we have you know 

496.95 506.34 A: lots of people in the back woods and people in the cities themselves that are our own citizens who were born in this own country who are willing to do things like that so it's not just 

504.72 510.46 B: oh no i know i'm not saying i'm not saying just i only used the kamikaze reference because it's the most 

510.58 517.54 B: widely like you know and it's the fartherest back that i can remember of like some kind of like death for honor and a point kind of thing 

510.93 512.58 A: right 

517.51 525.86 B: and back then the only the best thing they could do was fly a plane into something now sure i mean i'm saying look at the anthrax thing that wasn't even they think that was a domestic thing that wasn't even a 

526.15 527.20 B: uh a 

526.23 528.76 A: that's bioterrorism yeah right there 

528.13 539.50 B: yeah yeah that's solely bioterrorism you know mailing anthrax you're not going to get much more bioterroristic than that and you know they say that that came from inside the u._s. so it it was like a white supremacist group that kind of stuff 

533.09 534.15 A: right 

538.32 545.14 A: that was really handled well and we're really lucky that there wasn't that many more copycats like crimes done on that you know 

545.58 556.57 A: basically however they handled that you know that's how they need to handle this and they did a pretty good job of it whatever they did i'm not privy to know what they really did though [laughter] that's the thing you know 

549.68 550.70 B: (( right [noise] )) 

554.72 555.70 B: right 

556.03 557.98 B: or or if that's all that happened 

558.36 566.71 A: really exactly i mean what we i i don't know i guess sound really paranoid on this thing now [laughter] this makes me sound just really paranoid 

563.82 565.02 B: [laughter] 

566.88 570.32 A: [laughter] 

567.51 568.71 B: [laughter] 

569.47 574.13 B: well you know it's kind of a topic that uh that uh instills paranoid inside someone you know 

574.10 581.11 A: i guess [laughter] i just i've just been listening to myself talking going wow i sound like a real paranoid freak here okay 

575.14 576.53 B: [laughter] 

580.31 582.15 B: [laughter] 

581.25 583.66 A: [laughter] 

584.19 585.85 A: (( okay )) 

586.61 587.81 B: what's the time 

588.28 594.31 B: it's been a while it's probably i thought it i figured it had been ten but i'm not used to talking to people i don't know for this long so you'll have to forget me 

594.01 595.27 A: [laughter] 

596.59 597.67 A: i don't know 

599.11 599.89 A: seems like it
