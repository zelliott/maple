16.14 18.34 A: it's definitely thanksgiving 

17.89 19.89 B: [laughter] why 

18.90 30.52 A: [laughter] just because it's the most um [noise] fun i think because there's lots of eating and families over and you know there's no gifts involved 

30.82 36.29 A: and um [noise] it's [noise] in very homey i like it [noise] [laughter] [noise] 

34.12 42.41 B: [laughter] i think my favorite is christmas and i believe it's because i always get so excited watching the kids get excited at christmas 

41.49 43.26 A: oh uh-huh 

44.43 45.53 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

44.47 49.47 B: i understand we're supposed to decide if we could create a holiday what would it be 

49.08 51.10 A: yeah that's a tough one 

50.62 55.29 B: i know i haven't quite decided what i would create for a holiday have you 

52.51 53.68 A: [noise] 

55.28 59.77 A: no not really um [laughter] i- [noise] 

56.80 58.38 B: [laughter] 

58.73 60.42 B: what about earth day 

60.74 63.04 A: i think that already exists 

62.59 65.25 B: does it i wasn't aware of that [noise] 

63.58 64.60 A: yeah 

64.61 68.38 A: yeah yeah [noise] um let's see 

69.91 80.97 A: [noise] how about [noise] no i don't know if there's a teacher day but it would be good if there was like an appreciation day for teachers 

81.19 89.05 B: that's true they have a very rough time of it i studied to be a teacher long years ago and i would not want to teach in today's schools [laughter] 

88.35 94.67 A: [noise] [noise] yes i i'm training to be a teacher so i'm kind of like [noise] [laughter] it's 

93.90 100.09 B: well you must be into holidays then because if you're training to be a teacher you have to observe them all with children don't you 

94.91 95.49 A: (( [noise] )) 

99.95 106.40 A: i guess so yeah [noise] yeah i ha- i am yeah [noise] i haven't been in the classroom yet so 

106.78 107.90 A: um 

107.52 114.21 B: well let me ask you a question if you're going to create a holiday that's teacher appreciation day how would you celebrate it 

109.07 110.01 A: sure 

115.45 119.43 A: [noise] [noise] um basically well let's see 

119.53 121.39 A: i think it would be 

121.49 123.43 A: a day where 

123.50 125.67 A: teachers um 

126.03 138.90 A: would get letters from their students telling them why they liked them or you know don't like them i guess [laughter] um [laughter] and um just you know to make teachers feel good about what they do and 

132.43 133.47 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

139.06 150.37 A: and um yeah 'cause i think teachers are under appreciated in general and they're underpaid so it would be nice to get good feedback from students and maybe parents too 

150.37 159.57 B: that's a good one you know i saw a movie recently and uh a child had a good idea and then i think if i had to create a holiday it would be pay it forward day 

154.84 155.97 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

159.66 161.45 B: you remember that in the movie where 

161.16 163.05 A: oh yeah yes 

161.54 171.17 B: every [laughter] where every time someone did something good for you you paid it forward and it just passed on you pay uh you paid it forward to three other people 

170.98 174.00 A: right right i think yeah that's a great idea 

171.53 172.83 B: and they in turn 

173.21 176.50 B: [laughter] and they in turn had to pay it forward to three others 

175.84 177.36 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

176.89 179.90 B: so just what it would be like if we did that 

179.19 180.08 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

180.70 187.75 B: one day out of the year at least that everybody concentrated on yes uh-huh wouldn't that be exciting 

180.74 181.92 A: yeah inst- 

183.27 186.58 A: instead of gift giving holidays yeah 

187.60 196.57 A: yeah that's a good idea i wonder if if the people who are doing that research are using ideas for a holiday [laughter] yeah [noise] 

195.25 202.10 B: [laughter] i don't know but i think that would be really a fun thing how do you think children would respond to something like that 

203.26 205.13 A: um hm 

206.48 211.90 A: i think some of 'em would get a lot of it and other ones wouldn't know what to do with it 

212.50 213.43 A: (( you know )) 

213.20 221.30 B: well i was awfully impressed in the movie of course it was just a movie but still i was awfully impressed with the fact that it came from a child 

221.01 223.49 A: right right exactly 

222.39 226.26 B: i think that's one of the reasons why i thought it would be such a great holiday 

227.15 229.78 A: oh yeah i like your idea better actually 

230.52 232.17 A: [laughter] 

231.62 238.23 B: [laughter] well i don't know i like yours too because teachers are very very under appreciated people [laughter] 

238.00 239.64 A: (( yeah true )) 

238.58 240.60 B: they work pretty hard 

240.38 240.95 A: (( [noise] )) 

240.70 246.77 B: i think you have to be very dedicated and that would be a nice holiday to have is to appreciate them for a change 

241.12 241.68 A: (( [noise] )) 

245.90 251.61 A: mhm yeah definitely so we have to discuss for ten minutes huh 

251.42 257.96 B: yes as as a minute of fact i think the voice intro said they'd let us know when ten minutes were up 

258.28 259.26 A: okay 

258.69 263.15 B: [noise] sometimes it's tough to carry on a conversation if you don't know someone that well 

263.09 266.55 A: right right exactly [noise] hm 

263.56 264.32 B: [laughter] 

266.84 268.05 A: let's see 

267.87 277.42 B: well i think some of the other holidays that i enjoy very much too are well i'll tell you one that i don't enjoy as much and that's halloween 'cause it's gotten kinda crazy these days 

273.29 274.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

276.47 284.22 A: [noise] yeah exactly and yet it used to be so much fun when i was younger because we could actually go trick or treating 

284.41 287.87 A: but these days you really can't do that [noise] 

287.02 292.47 B: right but then another favorite holiday with me is uh easter too how about you 

292.89 296.58 A: i don't celebrate easter but i think it's fun i think it would be fun 

297.95 301.50 B: i like the um the bunnies and all the rest of it 

301.15 302.39 A: [laughter] 

301.67 302.37 B: (( [laughter] )) 

302.65 305.71 A: yeah it's cute especially kids 

304.95 312.48 B: yeah that's one of the things i used to do with my kids we always had lots and lots of little stuffed animals and things at uh easter that was the fun part 

311.95 313.35 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

313.92 321.02 A: and then they go did they go hunting for the eggs [noise] [noise] 

316.73 322.65 B: yeah as a matter of fact one year we actually did a row for um easter eggs on the white house lawn 

322.91 323.96 A: oh 

324.32 325.79 B: that was exciting 

325.64 327.76 A: so you live close to d._c. 

327.36 333.47 B: no we just decided to travel up there for the heck of it and we did that [laughter] that particular easter 

331.87 332.95 A: (( [noise] [noise] huh )) 

333.32 335.17 A: that's great 

335.88 337.48 A: [noise] excellent 

338.37 339.55 A: (( [noise] so )) 

339.64 342.58 A: let's see what other holidays do i like 

342.97 344.12 A: well 

344.21 348.10 A: i can tell you what i don't like um valentine's day 

348.19 349.77 B: oh why 

348.31 349.35 A: it's kinda 

349.78 354.03 A: [noise] i just think it's really it puts a lot of pressure on men 

354.16 361.86 A: to buy something that you know can impress the girl and i think it's like unnecessary pressure 

362.89 366.51 A: [noise] i don't know in general i don't [noise] like gift giving occasions 

367.54 368.34 A: but 

368.42 369.76 B: why's that 

369.81 377.74 A: [noise] um i think that it puts people in a position of either like having to spend money they don't have or 

377.74 389.22 A: you know getting something to impress the person or a lot of times they don't know what to get them and it's just a pain i think but uh an- don't get me wrong i like getting presents [laughter] but 

387.81 394.30 B: [laughter] well what do you think or how do you think it would be if people could be taught to make things for other people or to to 

393.32 396.58 A: i i think that's even better yeah exactly 

395.58 398.39 B: give a personal time things like that 

397.22 400.97 A: i do that a lot of times actually you know for a family 

399.31 400.61 B: (( do you [noise] ))
