7.93 9.03 A: fine 

9.08 13.71 B: uh did they mention the question about the favorite sport to you 

13.49 17.29 A: yeah i don't really watch sports that much other than i guess 

17.34 22.30 A: unless you call figure skating sports [laughter] 

21.17 26.06 B: [laughter] i'm a football fan i have a twelve and a half year old son [laughter] 

25.62 30.83 A: i've an eight year old son and he's just not really thrilled with sports yet [laughter] 

30.21 38.06 B: oh mine uh he's like a little sports fanatic he subscribes to all the sports magazines and um 

36.91 37.73 A: mhm 

39.04 40.37 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

41.03 54.62 B: [sigh] he likes to watch the hockey games and football uh base he loves to go to them too his dad takes him to most of 'em i enjoy the uh figure skating when i get a chance 

54.05 55.02 A: uh-huh 

55.05 59.75 B: 'cause um i don't know i guess that is more of a women's [laughter] 

59.09 60.28 A: yeah 

59.85 64.02 B: you know enjoyment thing they could care less about it [laughter] 

61.40 62.46 A: yeah 

62.80 71.34 A: i had started watching the baseball games last year as a matter of fact and kinda started getting excited about those but [mn] 

71.71 77.39 A: then i always hate the commercials coming in i always wonder what i miss [laughter] 

76.60 83.30 B: [laughter] well for me um baseball is too slow for me to watch on t._v. 

83.06 84.12 A: yeah 

83.51 88.24 B: i don't mind once in a while if my work schedule 

88.16 100.15 B: coincides with the games i'll go with the two of them to a game and i think half of that is you can look around at the people and everything else and [sigh] just sorta be a part of it being there but 

99.39 105.85 A: yeah i like [mn] sometimes i'll flip through the channels and see some sports on and you can they'll pan through the 

105.71 116.04 A: through the audience and it looks [laughter] nearly more interesting sometimes than what's going on [laughter] seeing the people all getting all ex- just wild 

110.84 112.60 B: [laughter] 

114.73 121.38 B: yeah it's just hard for me to sit and watch baseball and golf to me is just interminable 

120.56 124.06 A: oh i don't even think that's a sport [laughter] 

122.83 125.82 B: (( yeah that's true [laughter] that's a )) 

124.93 129.37 A: i mean how hard is it to hit a ball around the field i mean [mn] 

129.11 130.39 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

129.66 134.66 A: i mean you can and they get paid absolutely ridiculously to do it 

134.20 137.69 B: oh i know it's well they all get paid ridiculously 

134.99 135.97 A: [laughter] 

136.78 137.89 A: yes 

138.17 142.18 B: uh 'cause that's what i try to tell my son like because he'll get um 

142.51 150.56 B: [sigh] oh you know [noise] like alan iverson and [mn] i don't know if you're at all familiar but he's like a basketball star for philadelphia 

148.58 149.61 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

150.69 159.98 B: and um you know he he's i guess a great basketball star but um or the same with michael jordan he disappointed me the more that i heard about his personal life 

159.54 161.18 A: yeah 

160.57 168.14 B: but um what i try to tell him is okay they excel in sports that's what they're paid for but they're not heroes to look up to 

168.16 169.95 A: [noise] yeah that's true 

168.61 173.61 B: because it seems like so many of them [laughter] you know like when 

172.63 174.77 A: seem to get themselves into [laughter] trouble 

174.60 181.16 B: yeah i guess the money is [laughter] too overwhelming they they don't know how to live like the rest of us poor 

178.64 179.65 A: (( yeah )) 

182.28 191.88 A: yeah and then you know then they get all that money and then they go bankrupt and start boohooing and i'm like how can you go bankrupt with making that much money 

191.48 192.69 B: i know 

191.95 196.64 A: you know and start having things repoed and stuff [sigh] and 

195.52 210.10 B: well i think some of them um number one uh maybe to start with they don't get a um a good financial adviser [sigh] and let's face it half of them if they didn't do sports they'd probably be working at mcdonald's [laughter] 

203.38 204.51 A: that's true 

210.13 211.47 A: yes 

210.85 219.99 B: and um not that there's anything wrong with working at mcdonald's but i mean i i think uh part of the problem they'd never make it through college and so on and so forth 

213.96 214.64 A: (( uh-uh )) 

220.13 221.53 B: but um 

221.42 236.05 B: i think the and then it goes to their head they just buy everything all at once i think some of them get on the heavy duty drugs and but that is amazing when you think of that kind of money and how like you say you can be boohooing [laughter] a couple of years down the road i don't wanna hear it frankly 

225.23 226.30 A: mhm 

227.64 228.76 A: yeah 

234.25 235.36 A: [laughter] 

236.00 247.74 A: yeah [laughter] especially when my husband makes a military career pay you know raise a family and what they get paid for being over in iraq when these 

236.74 238.43 B: [laughter] 

241.53 242.62 B: [laughter] 

246.59 248.66 B: [noise] oh my god yeah 

247.92 254.30 A: when these guys are sitting here just playing one game and they make millions of dollars [laughter] 

253.09 255.43 B: right more than we make in a lifetime 

254.87 256.28 A: oh yes 

255.58 261.15 B: yeah 'cause i i work for the postal service i work nighttime and that's 

259.41 260.62 A: mhm 

261.22 274.85 B: what i have to do to you know be around for the family so it's like you take naps you don't sleep you do stuff like this [laughter] [laughter] but i oh by the way on a question um not really related to that but [lipsmack] um 

264.11 265.28 A: mhm 

266.75 267.73 A: yeah 

268.34 269.38 A: yeah 

275.12 278.59 B: when it did your number ring up right at three o'clock 

279.47 284.29 A: um they didn't tell me when it was when i was gonna receive a phone call so 

283.96 295.61 B: oh okay they on my thing they had asked me when it was good and i had told them three o'clock and uh 'cause i figured well i'd definitely be up and my son wasn't quite home from school yet i could do it in peace 

295.38 300.75 A: [sigh] oh okay yeah i just filled in all the boxes because i'm usually here [laughter] so 

299.47 312.64 B: oh okay and then when um my phone rang when i picked it up it went dead and i think maybe i'm gonna have to be the one calling them because we have that like phone blocking for 

311.67 313.76 A: yeah i have privacy manager 

313.61 321.75 B: yeah and i guess whatever this is um it's like with our state like that you don't get these um calls or whatever 

321.23 322.38 A: (( mhm )) 

321.74 331.20 B: and i have a feeling that's what cut it out 'cause then when i called them and gave that p._i._n. number then you know they clicked me right on to you so i said oh well this is good at least [laughter] 

330.84 333.69 A: [laughter] well that's good that you can call them too 

333.05 337.72 B: yeah because otherwise i guess i'd be out in left field somewhere and that would be the end of it 

337.17 339.04 A: yeah [laughter] 

338.59 347.70 B: but um i am i have to admit i'm a great football fan for pro football uh we live in uh pittsburgh [mn] i don't know what area of the country you're from 

342.93 343.89 A: mhm 

345.46 346.74 A: oh okay 

347.57 355.09 A: i'm in oklahoma right now but we're from tennessee so i know when tennessee wins and loses [laughter] 

353.63 360.11 B: [laughter] and well my my son likes the titans he actually has i don't know which one one of their jerseys 

359.58 360.48 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

360.18 369.54 B: he likes them too um but i think it's eddie george [mn] but i guess that i don't know if that'd mean anything to you or not but [laughter] um 

369.89 376.94 B: i do enjoy watching the football games i guess that's from the old days uh i think i'm a little older than you just by your voice 

376.38 378.02 A: yes i'm twenty six 

377.65 380.98 B: okay i'm fifty four [laughter] 

379.54 382.58 A: (( [laughter] oh you're my mom's age [laughter] )) 

381.21 385.82 B: (( [laughter] but i have a twelve year old feel sorry for me [laughter] )) 

384.99 389.95 A: [laughter] my mom has her youngest one now is sixteen so [laughter] 

389.09 391.85 B: this is my only one [laughter] 

392.06 395.95 B: and um so anyways he uh [lipsmack] 

396.28 403.51 B: uh from back in the glory days when i was young you know and they were getting all those uh superbowl rings you kinda got caught up in it 

403.10 404.18 A: (( mhm )) 

403.57 410.44 B: and pittsburgh is a really heavy sports town it's like we boo 'em when they lose but it's like oh my god if they ever left [laughter] 

406.44 407.00 A: (( [mn] )) 

409.55 410.97 A: yeah 

410.37 420.55 B: so it's almost like um if you're alive you almost have to at least know about the sports and then like i said with the twelve year old wait your day's coming [laughter] 

419.75 422.23 A: [mn] yeah yeah 

421.04 432.88 B: um you know we're hockey uh like i said they're baseball uh we're all matter of fact i like the football better than my husband if once in a while he can get tickets at work like comps 

432.96 441.04 B: for different sports and if it's football like and he could only get two tickets i mean i'd kick him in the knees if he thought he was going 

434.11 435.20 A: mhm 

439.51 450.58 A: well if i if i went i think i would be more interested in sports if i went to a physical game instead of watching it on t._v. 'cause watching it on t._v. i 

447.71 451.39 B: yes yes there is a big difference 

450.51 460.97 A: yeah you probably get caught up in the excitement and the crowd and the noise and the whereas on t._v. i mean i can always find something better to do [laughter] 

451.44 452.00 B: (( [mn] )) 

455.06 456.40 B: mhm 

459.03 472.45 B: r- right a lot of times too i think as women you know we have to make the dinner we have to do this so you're up you're down you're you know throwing in a load of laundry and [sigh] you just don't sit there with that all and all like here we go type thing 

463.48 464.47 A: (( mhm )) 

465.60 466.54 A: (( yes )) 

471.71 473.66 A: (( [noise] yeah no [sigh] )) 

473.56 477.35 B: but um you sound like you need a nap [laughter] 

476.68 477.94 A: oh [sigh] 

478.31 485.16 A: with my husband being gone to iraq my sleep patterns are just a mess [laughter] 

481.97 483.94 B: [noise] oh i bet 

484.24 486.17 B: will he be coming home soon 

485.94 490.95 A: oh no he just left a month ago and they're getting ready to send more over there so 

490.07 491.33 B: (( oh boy )) 

491.55 493.95 B: well hopefully the worst is over 

491.72 492.57 A: (( yeah )) 

493.57 495.91 A: yeah that's that's what we're hearing 

494.23 497.13 B: at least as far as the danger and that you know 

496.43 498.02 A: yeah 

497.87 512.59 B: because it's like um god bless 'em i can't imagine uh especially [sigh] uh well i'm sure your husband's young too but you know you get these kids wet behind the ears right out of high school and they're going over i mean i can't in my worst nightmare imagine what they go through 

508.10 509.50 A: (( oh yeah )) 

512.22 514.47 A: yeah it just is 

513.69 515.59 B: and it's um i 

514.89 518.26 A: but you know they get they get to watch the sports 

518.18 521.60 A: over there what they do is they tape it and they 

518.95 520.27 B: i did 

521.37 534.49 A: show it for to 'em over there in these what they call theaters but all it is is a big t._v. set up and a couple of chairs set up and the guys go in there and they get all hooplaing about it and think it's great [laughter] 

533.46 541.08 B: well that's good 'cause they're they're i did hear something uh i and i thought this was kinda strange but they got to watch the academy awards 

534.67 535.69 A: yeah 

540.50 542.12 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

541.53 551.73 B: and i thought i don't know it doesn't remind me that most men maybe a few of the women uh you know over there but i i just couldn't see where too many men would get all excited about that 

550.38 553.99 A: maybe they just wanted to see the women [laughter] 

552.61 558.01 B: [laughter] oh that okay i didn't think of that aspect that's true all those low cut gowns [laughter] 

557.25 559.06 A: yes yes 

558.36 563.48 B: but the sports i could see them getting excited about and uh

578.92 579.88 B: mhm 

582.45 586.29 A: uh some sort of weaponry thing 

586.32 596.67 A: [mn] because it was on everybody's mind i think it was biological chemical weapons or something and [sigh] so i didn't know what it was gonna do so i just signed up for it i was like sure [laughter] 

589.81 590.85 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

596.38 599.89 B: yeah i didn't have any idea did you uh say that you'd go for
