50.68 51.49 B: mhm 

55.47 67.48 B: yeah it comes on i think about three times a week and i may watch it like once a week maybe if i can catch it but usually i'm so busy i hardly ever watch sports unless it's like the superbowl

90.75 93.14 B: 'cause i think uh-uh [laughter] 

92.38 96.67 A: so you your weekly total of minutes would be low like mine is 

96.12 109.53 B: exactly i'm not really into sports i'm you know into watching other things like c._s._i. miami you know and things like that but dharma dharma and greg type shows but uh-uh strictly for men only so 

97.15 98.19 A: [laughter] 

101.67 102.70 A: [laughter] 

103.55 104.63 A: uh-huh 

106.28 107.29 A: uh-huh 

110.28 114.73 A: well i like to watch some baseball on t._v. sometimes [lipsmack]

115.95 117.04 A: (( it is it )) 

118.07 121.95 A: is some people think it's too slow but um 

121.08 122.15 B: exactly 

122.14 129.92 A: but but i but i enjoy it a lot and we have good teams here in new york at least one good team [laughter] 

127.45 128.95 B: okay okay 

129.23 130.89 B: mhm exactly 

130.47 132.27 A: (( [laughter] [lipsmack] )) 

131.40 136.57 B: so i i don't know i just i think um they put a lot of emphasis on sports 

137.08 141.10 B: and it's i don't know it's just not my thing it's just not my thing at all 

138.03 139.87 A: right right 

140.40 145.00 A: mm [lipsmack] yeah my my boyfriend is big time sports fan 

144.68 154.41 B: exactly we fight over the television in this house as to when we want to watch sports and this game is coming on and i always watch the golden girls with you so you know 

147.37 148.47 A: [laughter] 

155.02 158.00 B: you can just sit down and watch this game with me so 

157.22 158.46 A: (( [laughter] )) 

158.49 161.25 B: i do even though i don't choose to 

161.09 163.47 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

162.65 164.80 B: as a a matter of fact he's playing on the um 

165.07 166.27 B: (( ah um )) 

166.36 168.69 B: game on nintendo now a basketball game 

168.46 169.77 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

169.40 171.85 B: if it's not television it's a video game 

172.27 175.87 B: a sport video game anyway but yeah i 

173.42 174.39 A: yeah 

174.71 180.54 A: well it is more fun watching with somebody who's knowledgeable about them like yeah 

178.80 185.05 B: exactly i think that's one of the main reasons why number one in high school i never really participated in any kind of sport except cheerleading 

185.03 185.71 A: (( mm )) 

185.41 188.31 B: and you know most guys don't consider that to be a sport but it is 

188.13 192.28 A: [laughter] definitely athletic for sure yeah 

188.68 190.14 B: (( and )) 

190.44 191.81 B: exactly 

191.97 193.20 B: and um 

193.57 206.57 B: i did track but that was like it and i think that's the main thing why i really don't watch sports on t._v. or anywhere else is because i'm not very knowledgeable on sports to me it's just like a bunch of barbarians you know tackling each other and i don't know what's going on 

195.89 196.80 A: (( mm )) 

202.01 203.09 A: mm 

204.42 205.42 A: [laughter] 

206.94 217.72 A: [mn] i know it's kinda scary to me to watch professional football i i enjoy it i must admit and i think i've probably watched more football than anything else actually you 

217.22 218.81 B: okay okay 

217.68 223.47 A: know in in in recent months anyway in the past year i've probably watched more football 

223.56 232.35 B: i think mine has been more um now that you mention it more baseball i've i've attended more baseball games than any other sport in my life um 

232.74 236.05 B: i think i'm watching baseball and basketball equally 

235.98 237.04 A: mhm 

236.43 238.71 B: and like i said i try to catch um 

238.87 239.83 B: pool 

239.94 242.34 B: tournaments as well as bowling tournaments 

242.60 245.38 B: 'cause i like to bowl and i just find that really interesting 

242.66 243.65 A: yeah 

243.93 244.77 A: mhm 

245.13 256.08 A: yeah i haven't seen that on t._v. recently either i know that when i was a kid there used to be quite a quite a bit of bowling on t._v. there was a show called bowling for dollars [laughter] 

252.72 253.85 B: exactly 

256.00 260.89 A: which is i'm sure way before your time but [laughter] 

256.33 256.92 B: (( mm )) 

258.33 267.43 B: exactly it's it's very interesting but on the one sport that i do not watch at all and that is golf i do not watch it that is the slowest sport i have ever seen in my life 

263.42 264.34 A: oh 

267.20 281.35 A: i sometimes enjoy wa- you know if i'm just you know i'm just hanging around on sunday and there's a golf tournament on you know i might watch it just mostly 'cause it's like pretty scenery you know you know it's like green trees and 

273.38 274.37 B: mhm 

277.80 280.21 B: (( exactly [laughter] but that's about it )) 

280.70 288.08 B: exactly but i'm not actually play golf before um more than just natural putt putt golf but 

281.54 283.05 A: but that's it 

287.35 289.18 A: you've you've played golf 

288.62 290.70 B: yeah and 

289.40 290.36 A: yeah 

290.72 294.37 B: i don't know it was [mn] i didn't even like playing it was like so boring 

294.19 294.88 A: (( [mn] )) 

294.62 301.80 B: 'cause that's what my uncle that's what he does you know he used to take me as a child and i just i don't like it it's boring i don't like to look at it 

296.48 297.65 A: uh-huh 

301.37 302.43 A: [laughter] 

301.85 303.54 B: nothing to have to do with golf 

303.46 307.84 A: well people who like it really really like it you know yeah 

305.91 306.94 B: yeah they do 

308.08 313.56 B: and actually there's a lot of money in golf that people really don't know about 'cause my mum used to try to get me to um 

313.58 315.47 B: join a golf team at my high school 

315.20 316.18 A: right 

315.80 322.22 B: and she was like um 'cause she had found out that there's a lot of money in golf you know most people give it a chance you know things like that but 

319.27 320.20 A: yeah 

320.84 321.68 A: right 

322.25 323.66 A: (( right [mn] )) 

323.10 325.34 B: i just i don't know i couldn't get into it 

325.62 329.06 B: i had to be very passionate about it you know what i'm saying at some anything 

328.74 334.07 A: yeah it sounds like you probably like something that's that's livelier that's more reactionate 

332.58 336.07 B: exactly like i said football or basketball it has to be 

336.16 338.55 B: they have to be doing something at all times 

338.00 346.03 A: right and the strategy i mean maybe maybe maybe you're interested in physics 'cause with the pool you know it's like all these angles and 

344.02 347.49 B: exactly exactly exactly 

346.20 355.91 A: right and bowling some of the some of the same stuff you know like how many pins get knocked down depends on the angle of the strike and stuff like that 

355.31 360.97 B: yeah 'cause i always go bowling i mean all the time my best friend um she's um um she's in a bowling league actually two 

361.28 369.81 B: and so i've got i've kinda gotten into it with her and then um a cous- my cousin and two of her children they've actually been in a bowling tournament too so 

369.80 377.58 A: right bowling is one of the things that that we can do when whereas like not that many people play baseball i think 

376.96 378.22 B: exactly 

377.85 382.50 A: i mean some guys play a lot of basketball i know you know on their own you know 

381.68 382.69 B: yeah 

382.81 387.19 A: but um football we're not so likely to be just go out and 

387.68 390.70 A: you know get up a a scratch team and 

389.93 403.40 B: yeah i know right [laughter] i know but other things that i do watch you know i like the olympics you know i like those sports you know i'll watch that i'll watch like the equestrian races and you know when they're racing in the pool and the um 

392.12 393.72 A: [laughter] 

397.00 398.11 A: oh yeah 

403.68 410.71 B: ah track races you know i i watch things like that those are the kind of sports i'm more into gymnastics that type stuff 

405.77 406.79 A: yeah 

407.20 408.12 A: right 

410.61 413.81 A: right are you still in- involved in sports 

414.62 424.06 B: no i don't i don't well actually i took up tennis which is very ironic i took up tennis um actually started in february the past february 

415.34 416.67 A: the bowling 

423.54 424.51 A: uh-huh 

424.45 428.90 B: and that's where i really just did that not because 

429.37 431.41 B: well because i need to be active 

431.23 432.30 A: yeah 

431.56 436.11 B: not not only 'cause i'm really interested tennis but a lot of my friends play tennis so i was like well 

436.33 440.60 B: besides just working and going to school i need to be doing something else too so um 

436.40 437.35 A: yeah 

439.82 440.86 A: yeah 

440.85 449.85 B: i bought a treadmill actually and i run on that two miles um four days out of the week and then the other three days you know we try to go up to the tennis court and play tennis so 

449.64 453.15 A: [mn] do you watch do you watch tennis on t._v. 

450.58 451.14 B: (( [mn] )) 

452.64 457.59 B: yes i do now there's one thing i do watch i just love tennis that's very interesting to me 

453.50 454.67 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

454.86 455.97 A: yeah 

457.49 460.51 A: yeah those good those matches can be really fun 

460.65 470.00 B: i watch tennis um [lipsmack] what else do i get into there's so many sports and when you talk about sports you're just like basketball baseball and football 

465.67 466.99 A: that's true 

469.95 471.11 A: [laughter] 

470.42 476.90 B: but then it's like track gymnastics you know bowling golf i mean there are so many things ice skating 

473.74 475.95 A: right ice skating 

476.37 477.64 A: yeah 

477.03 480.17 B: and and you know me and they really don't give a 

481.44 486.41 B: our sports a chance you know they don't really consider cheerleading to be a sport or ice skating to be a sport you know 

485.89 493.80 A: [mn] i know i've seen some dance contests on and that wouldn't be considered a sport i guess exactly but i mean 

487.06 488.32 B: a lot of men 

488.55 489.55 B: yeah 

492.14 492.88 B: uh-huh 

493.64 504.86 A: those people are athletes too you know yeah some of that very vigorous ballroom dancing swing dancing and stuff i mean that's very athletic i've seen um 

495.54 496.69 B: exactly 

501.44 502.64 B: exactly 

505.18 514.87 A: well it's not gym- not gymnastics but actual like aerobics you know competitions on t._v. those are kind of fun too sometimes 

510.26 511.50 B: exactly 

514.62 520.26 B: what is the definition actually of sport isn't it just like any kind of recreational type of activity i guess 

521.12 532.46 A: um interesting question you know s- sport i and athletic ah recreational ac- activity i would guess you know and it's competitive too 

530.00 531.01 B: okay 

532.29 534.10 B: e- exactly okay 

533.07 534.25 A: yeah 

534.53 535.81 B: (( i could do that )) 

535.01 540.31 A: there's horse racing did you watch the ah did you watch the kentucky derby 

540.45 555.15 B: actually i did not my first time ever watching like an equestrian race was when i went to um the ninety six olympics when they came to atlanta [mn] and actually me and my mum were given free tickets to go to equestrian races um one of the aquatic races and um 

555.35 557.86 B: a gymnastics tournament 

557.14 558.51 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

558.13 565.89 B: so that's my first time ever watched actually watching that but it's very interesting you know how you have to it's like a mind thing and you have to learn how to talk to the animal 

561.38 562.21 A: right 

565.55 566.76 A: mhm 

566.14 570.55 B: you have to be actually become one with a horse so it's very interesting 

568.85 570.02 A: mhm 

570.43 572.26 A: right right 

571.90 576.14 B: it's like you have to read body language and the horses have to be able to read your body language as well 

575.82 577.71 A: mhm mhm 

576.57 580.06 B: so it was very interesting how they all put that together too so 

579.40 580.89 A: mhm 

580.95 584.53 A: so that's a that's a sport for for animals 

581.21 582.13 B: (( [mn] )) 

584.66 587.09 B: yeah it is it is 

586.46 590.74 A: [laughter] and and for the humans i guess for the jockeys 

590.37 596.22 B: (( yeah even they don't do too much but yeah i guess you know if they don't topple the horses and like but i don't know )) 

592.30 593.20 A: [laughter] 

595.74 596.95 A: yeah 

596.48 599.89 B: i guess you kinda direct them but um i don't know
