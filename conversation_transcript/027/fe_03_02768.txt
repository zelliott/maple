96.05 97.75 A: too much of the game 

97.29 98.83 B: [laughter] 

98.42 101.65 A: and we do have season tickets for football but we 

101.32 103.33 B: (( oh how fun )) 

101.96 105.59 A: we sometimes let our sons and their wives go 

105.90 117.11 B: yeah it's fun to go i love it see we don't have any um we have college football here but we don't have any um real teams we don't have any n._f._l. teams here 

106.18 108.04 A: instead of us 

109.06 110.30 A: it is 

116.73 118.61 A: oh okay 

117.69 131.27 B: so i kind of have to if i want to see football i either have to travel real far um to the next city or i have to go somewhere and watch it so that you know that i'll go over like friend's house and watch it um 

122.07 123.13 A: uh-huh 

126.93 127.62 A: oh 

129.62 139.42 A: [laughter] yeah that's hard to do well it is about an hour and a half in for us but [mn] i guess if you just make it a whole day and just enjoy 

138.93 140.22 B: yeah 

139.58 142.31 A: doing everything while you're in there 

141.58 143.74 B: oh and then it's fun to go 

143.62 145.32 A: yeah 

144.32 148.99 B: i think [laughter] um what else do you guys like basketball 

148.96 150.42 A: um we don't 

150.60 152.95 A: watch a whole lot of basketball no 

152.64 153.88 B: mhm 

153.99 155.92 B: and yeah 

154.05 155.27 A: i just 

155.30 159.25 A: we watch a little bit of hockey professional hockey 

157.38 158.73 B: mhm 

159.51 165.23 A: but not basketball at all i don't know i guess we're just not basketball fans 

164.15 167.70 B: you guys are not a basketball family [laughter] 

166.20 172.40 A: no [laughter] we're probably the minority in the whole united states right 

171.48 186.03 B: um well i think it depends where you are like our team's been winning past few years so everybody's a basketball fan right now but you know once they start having seasons that aren't so great [laughter] and people start thinking 

176.94 178.27 A: okay 

183.55 185.06 A: right 

185.88 189.01 B: oh maybe there are other sports that are fun too 

188.60 192.63 A: yeah yeah and i don't know i guess i 

193.36 201.42 A: i enjoy watching the very end of the game because then i know the results i think the whole game is is boring to watch 

197.79 198.73 B: yeah 

201.15 207.04 B: well i think it- it's fun to go to again i think it just sports are so fun live 

201.48 202.55 A: so 

206.97 209.99 A: they are fun to go to you know they are 

208.38 209.77 B: yeah 

210.14 213.41 A: more fun live than watching on t._v. 

212.98 219.99 B: yeah i think so 'cause i'll go any time anybody says oh let's go to a game i'm so there [laughter] 

220.26 225.07 B: but to sit and watch it on t._v. it has to be a really special game 

224.66 231.17 A: yeah [laughter] yeah let's see what else were we supposed to talk about is that it 

225.47 226.48 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

230.46 238.61 B: um yeah i think what what we like what our favorite is oh how much time we spend watching well it doesn't sound like you spend all that much time 

235.18 236.93 A: oh yeah 

238.41 247.82 A: no i wo- you know like during football season probably one game per week is it and that's like three hours i suppose a week 

244.31 245.60 B: mhm 

247.26 249.23 B: yeah that's not 

248.16 257.02 A: baseball season we probably watch two or three games a week but they probably are only like two hours 

256.38 257.76 B: yeah 

257.75 259.59 A: so i suppose like six 

257.79 270.10 B: and also you don't sit there right in front of it the whole time and watch it you're doing other things too usually i know i always do and specially with baseball because it's such a mellow mellow game 

260.70 262.44 A: right 

263.59 265.65 A: yeah right 

269.67 282.55 A: right you can pick it up and you know you know watch the next inning and then run down and put a load of clothes in the drier [laughter] then run up and see the next innings 

270.28 271.14 B: (( yes )) 

272.07 273.13 B: (( uh-huh )) 

274.85 275.89 B: yeah 

277.75 281.29 B: (( exactly [laughter] )) 

282.06 286.15 B: yeah and then go and fix some sandwiches and come [laughter] back 

285.49 290.60 A: right unless my husband yells at me that something really exciting's happening 

290.36 293.12 B: oh then yeah then you run up and catch it 

291.46 294.88 A: then i run back and and drop what i'm doing 

294.30 295.96 B: [laughter] 

295.43 300.39 A: or sometimes he's the one that's gone down to his workshop and i'll yell at him 

299.99 302.27 B: (( [laughter] yeah and )) 

300.83 306.61 A: although he has a t._v. down there too i don't have a t._v. where i do my craft and stuff so 

306.02 307.30 B: (( oh )) 

307.04 312.46 A: i don't i have to run up every once in a while in order to see it 

310.18 312.21 B: [laughter] 

312.82 323.97 A: but i do i would i would say between three and six hours a week and that's probably only doing football and baseball seasons 

323.56 324.83 B: right 

324.23 325.38 A: you know the 

326.18 330.78 A: other times tha- that basketball's on and stuff i don't 

330.98 332.23 B: (( yeah then it's )) 

331.16 332.77 A: add any more 

332.34 335.03 B: exactly i think it's cut right out 

335.30 337.67 A: yeah so 

338.83 339.98 B: well me 

339.29 341.90 A: what area of the united states are you in 

341.59 344.87 B: i'm in um california in los angeles 

344.56 346.11 A: oh okay 

346.20 347.84 A: and i'm in minnesota 

347.73 350.92 B: oh how neat oh you have um the vikings then 

350.66 352.78 A: that's right yes 

351.65 353.44 B: (( oh fun [mn] )) 

354.40 356.05 A: they are fun they're 

356.18 361.78 A: they're interesting to watch sometimes we get a little upset at them you know 

356.28 356.87 B: (( yeah )) 

361.84 364.54 A: when they do dumb things 

361.88 363.87 B: (( oh yeah )) 

363.92 369.08 B: [laughter] they do sometimes you go i could have coached that game better 

367.91 371.20 A: [laughter] 

369.81 380.00 B: oh i say that all the time when i watch them and i go why did they just do that what are you thinking nobody does that it doesn't make any sense [laughter] 

374.30 375.44 A: (( right )) 

378.68 380.08 A: [laughter] 

380.10 382.90 A: (( [mn] exactly it's you )) 

380.42 381.43 B: [laughter] 

381.56 383.63 B: (( mhm oh [mn] [mn] )) 

382.92 384.52 A: know but 

384.68 390.58 A: it's fun anyway even though you get mad at them one week you go back the next week and watch again 

390.22 391.78 B: oh sure 

391.97 394.65 A: so yeah we do enjoy the vikings 

393.59 396.42 B: do you do you guys have a nice stadium 

396.95 401.31 A: well they're [mn] it's getting old 

400.98 401.99 B: uh-huh 

401.33 403.82 A: and they're hoping to build a new one 

403.69 405.07 B: (( oh that's nice )) 

403.85 407.52 A: but people are fighting using tax money to do it 

407.03 409.65 B: sure it should be private [mn] it 

408.88 410.19 A: so 

409.83 412.20 B: should be private money and 

411.47 421.27 A: right so i'm not sure what's going to happen the colleges also use the same stadium as well as the high school for their tournaments 

420.65 422.17 B: wow 

421.79 426.04 A: and so you know it's it's well used 

422.98 426.87 B: well that's great that it's getting so much yeah 

426.16 427.94 A: yeah 

427.05 429.90 B: 'cause we have stadiums that just sit 

429.71 430.89 A: oh 

430.22 439.93 B: and nobody hardly ever used them and it's so so frustrating 'cause of all that money yeah so it sounds like everybody uses your sta- that's terrific 

435.11 437.37 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

439.57 450.68 A: yeah it it is a well used thing so they're you know thinking that maybe like some of the colleges could put some money in and the owners of some of the sports teams and whatever 

450.05 461.39 B: that's yeah i think it should mostly be private money and then maybe a small bond since you know the schools do use it maybe maybe a small bond to for part of it 

452.79 454.60 A: yeah 

457.57 459.39 A: right 

461.08 463.08 A: yeah 

461.37 465.54 B: but yeah it's it's better i think when most of it is private money 

465.50 468.41 A: yeah it's it's hard to 

468.44 476.49 A: to talk people that are real sports fanatics though they think that there's just should be the best thing built right now and that 

476.02 490.91 B: [laughter] [laughter] well they won't like it so much when suddenly their taxes go up the next year [laughter] beside all these bonds and then they pass and all of a sudden they go wait i'm not getting as much money back this year [laughter] [laughter] then they suddenly won't 

476.68 477.95 A: wait for 

480.58 482.22 A: (( [laughter] that's true )) 

488.52 491.15 A: [laughter] exactly 

490.91 492.62 B: (( like it )) 

492.21 495.40 A: (( yeah yeah exactly )) 

492.97 494.04 B: and they'll go 

494.62 499.17 B: that's what oh what a horrible idea [laughter] 

499.13 500.46 A: yeah 

501.68 510.18 B: but usually as long as your team does well and and it's generating money and-and you know then there's private private investors that will come 

505.92 508.92 A: (( but )) 

510.13 517.41 B: put money into it which is the best way to go anyway i think there are so many people out there with so much money 

511.36 512.50 A: right 

516.66 523.59 A: oh i know that's what you know and you hear that the the owners have made all that money and 

517.77 519.09 B: (( [laughter] )) 

523.65 533.60 A: and the t._v. rights are costing this much and they're being paid this much and all that you think well then something could go into some stadiums 

527.80 529.30 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

530.93 531.51 B: (( mhm )) 

533.13 538.29 B: (( i think so i know if i had that kind of money i'd [laughter] build stadiums )) 

537.83 539.36 A: (( right yeah it'd be like )) 

538.59 542.78 B: 'cause you wouldn't even notice it you'd go like oh pshaw you know 

542.32 543.65 A: (( buying a car or )) 

545.80 546.68 B: (( oh )) 

546.44 558.28 A: something for regular people [laughter] right and and one reason that they want new stadiums here in minnesota is we only have i don't know very few private boxes and i guess that's what brings in more of the money 

557.90 570.42 B: yeah you get the season subscriptions and then they spend tons of money on food and drinks and yeah they're up there smoking cigars and 

558.95 560.33 A: and so 

561.13 563.34 A: right yeah 

569.77 572.28 A: yeah so they 

572.32 585.01 A: that's what they want to do is build a a bigger stadium that will have more private boxes but i guess that probably won't affect us we'll probably just still buy our season tickets which are way up pretty high but [laughter] 

578.18 578.85 B: (( [mn] )) 

585.04 587.77 B: but at least more reasonable i'm sure 

586.55 591.78 A: but yeah yeah it's something we can afford and still enjoy it 

588.31 588.91 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

591.44 593.52 B: (( oh it's tons of fun )) 

592.33 596.02 A: and you know it's just fun to be in the atmosphere 

595.90 599.89 B: i think so yeah it's it's festive and there's lots going on
