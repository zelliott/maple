292.15 293.87 B: see baseball 

294.27 300.94 B: i guess i i went to a few baseball games they're more they're more fun just because you have the whole atmosphere there

316.68 318.32 B: they give us three or 

319.21 324.36 B: [cough] yeah but the other day they gave me one topic and the person i was talking to a different topic 

324.40 325.31 A: whoa 

325.18 327.51 B: so [laughter] we didn't know what to do we just 

327.66 330.20 B: decided to choose the topic we liked better 

330.81 335.21 A: [laughter] the first topic i got i didn't know anything about i can't remember it now 

335.46 337.52 A: (( but i didn't know anything about it )) 

336.77 337.55 B: (( oh )) 

337.56 339.96 B: well my first one was reality t._v. 

340.20 342.17 A: oh i wouldn't know anything about that one either 

341.54 344.84 B: yeah neither of us knew very much about it 

344.56 347.62 A: [mn] i love sports though that's a perfect topic 

347.32 356.56 B: yeah [laughter] see sports i don't know much about [mn] but the other one we got was she got bioterrorism and i got favorite holidays 

356.41 357.63 A: (( [laughter] )) 

356.73 359.25 B: [laughter] and we discussed holidays 

358.62 360.95 A: [laughter] i'd probably go for that too 

360.04 360.61 B: (( [mn] )) 

361.68 367.71 B: but for sports i'm gonna just let you take it away because [laughter] you obviously know more about it than i do 

364.41 365.32 A: [laughter] 

367.71 371.46 A: [mn] um i watch you know the big things on t._v. um 

369.11 369.87 B: [cough] 

371.65 373.56 A: i like when they um 

373.93 376.10 A: like hockey has the stanley cup 

375.96 376.81 B: uh-huh 

377.00 381.04 A: and you already know about the world series and then the super bowl 

381.63 382.62 A: um 

383.30 385.39 A: are the big things um 

384.52 386.22 B: yeah 

386.02 387.52 A: i know that um 

388.44 396.75 A: [mn] when the playoffs come for the football and the baseball and the hockey that gets really good because you usually get the best teams in there 

396.76 397.61 B: uh-huh 

397.26 408.05 A: and it's really cool to watch them on t._v. because you get the best playing the best usually and it just gets really exciting and intense and involved [laughter] i like that 

405.51 406.54 B: yeah 

407.73 411.07 B: that's more competitive than a good team and a bad team 

410.93 413.04 A: yeah yeah i mean 

412.19 413.01 B: (( [cough] )) 

413.47 418.40 A: i watched ah my parents liked ah baseball a lot when they were alive 

418.68 419.52 B: mhm 

418.71 423.95 A: so i'd watch it with them and like you know a ten to two game baseball game on t._v. 

424.11 427.26 A: that's like you know who's gonna win why watch 

426.68 428.98 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

429.05 430.11 A: (( i prefer to )) 

429.19 434.54 B: [cough] it just came to me wasn't there just some game recently that surprised everybody 

434.79 435.76 A: really 

435.47 439.08 B: i don't remember what it was it could have been in the last few months actually 

438.77 439.98 A: [laughter] 

439.53 440.87 B: [mn] i just 

440.09 441.83 A: do you know if it was baseball 

442.26 442.98 B: i 

443.13 445.99 B: think it was but i'm not positive 

447.05 452.09 B: but i just remember everyone talking about no actually i don't think it was i think it was football 

452.60 460.99 B: they were all talking about how this other team was like the known to be the losing team and all of a sudden they came from behind and 

452.97 453.97 A: mhm 

459.94 462.01 A: [mn] that might be arena football 

462.38 463.52 B: that could be 

463.78 465.50 A: do you know what arena football is 

464.82 466.67 B: no idea [laughter] 

466.06 466.71 A: [laughter] 

467.08 468.76 A: they take it um 

468.89 471.68 A: do you know what a hockey rink looks like 

471.07 471.91 B: yeah 

471.94 476.58 A: well they basically take a hockey rink and convert it into a miniature football field 

476.39 477.41 B: okay 

477.30 479.03 A: and they play football in there 

479.60 480.64 B: yeah 

479.64 483.70 A: and they go back and forth and back and forth and [sigh] um 

484.53 487.70 A: they score like tons and tons of points 

487.76 490.80 A: i don't really get the concept of arena football 

488.44 489.00 B: (( [mn] )) 

490.93 496.55 A: because i'm used to the regular football fields which is a hundred feet and i think this is only fifty feet or something like that 

492.36 493.38 B: yeah 

495.82 497.92 B: it's sort of like mini golf to golf 

497.92 499.24 A: [laughter] 

498.36 499.97 B: totally different game 

499.78 501.64 A: yeah mhm 

502.12 502.93 B: so 

503.04 504.06 A: (( uh [mn] )) 

504.91 506.33 A: do you like golf 

506.97 509.30 B: um not particularly [laughter] 

509.18 509.79 A: (( [laughter] )) 

509.87 512.85 A: that's one one sport i can't watch on t._v. 

512.76 517.06 B: (( i definitely can't watch it [mn] but )) 

513.03 513.87 A: i think 

514.26 515.44 A: oh 

516.75 517.90 A: (( and playing it is almost as )) 

519.46 521.88 B: and then you get sports like bowling [laughter] 

522.25 526.08 B: i think bowling is supposed to go to the olympics soon or something like that 

525.88 527.80 A: bad [laughter] [laughter] do you not like bowling 

528.63 531.19 B: [mn] bowling actually i find to be fun 

531.31 534.86 B: but i don't see it as something that should be an olympic sport 

534.45 535.73 A: [laughter] 

535.70 536.66 B: (( it just )) 

537.54 539.85 A: you can actually be pretty good at bowling 

540.00 541.03 B: yeah 

541.22 542.28 A: i um 

543.28 545.83 A: i like watching bowling every once in a while 

546.02 548.72 A: but if you get too much of it i think you go to sleep 

548.31 549.81 B: yeah that's true 

550.57 559.23 B: well when you get the good the good players get pretty boring because you know they just put that perfect spin on the ball and it's you know strike after strike 

558.66 560.57 A: mhm mhm 

560.28 561.25 B: so 

561.93 562.96 A: and then there's 

561.97 567.09 B: if that's how to play i don't think it should be an olympic sport 'cause you can get like it's just too easy 

567.65 570.56 B: to to play a perfect game 

570.71 573.82 B: not that i can [laughter] but 

572.91 575.15 A: i don't know about that one [laughter] 

574.37 578.17 B: it it's a lot easier than playing the perfect game at 

578.39 581.99 B: at golf where there are so many other factors that come into play 

583.11 587.76 B: you know or especially against if you're playing against a team 

588.20 593.78 B: [mn] uh um [lipsmack] like football or baseball where it it depends on the skill of the other team 

588.38 589.32 A: mhm 

593.94 595.60 A: [lipsmack] that could be true 

595.48 598.04 B: it's just in bowling all you have is 

598.29 599.89 B: like you don't have any wind fact-
