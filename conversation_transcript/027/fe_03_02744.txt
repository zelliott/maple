106.91 111.69 B: fascinating it's on e._s._p._n. it's it's like miss fitness america 

111.97 113.16 B: and it's like a 

113.21 117.97 B: it' it's more like a a cross between an athletic competition and a beauty pageant 

117.47 120.22 A: is it like a like a body building competition 

120.10 129.73 B: yeah it's like body building fit- you know but but it's not that much an emphasis on like the you know the muscular it's more like sports like physical prowess 

129.79 130.85 A: (( oh okay )) 

130.30 138.34 B: kind of and you know usually these people the women who enter are usually like aerobics instructors or you know athletes and

140.40 141.39 B: (( um )) 

141.77 148.01 B: i don't know cause usually when i when they go through the bio's of these women they usually say like they're dance instructors or 

148.36 152.77 A: something where where they need to where they need to be fit for their line of work but they're not 

151.81 155.16 B: yeah personal trainers and that that's 

155.13 158.19 B: you know gym teachers that that kind of stuff and

174.90 180.31 B: they have to do this routine where they're really showing their physical prowess it's kind of like an aerobics routine and 

179.67 180.61 A: okay

245.57 247.16 A: in laws or things like that 

248.91 256.70 B: yeah for- fortunately we like we usually like all women are gathered together so it's kind of like the thought of sports and we're like no [laughter] 

256.58 257.77 A: [laughter] 

257.64 264.14 B: well except for one of our sisters she's into sports and like every now and again she might click and like if there's 

264.17 269.81 B: like if the college game like maybe college is playing she might check and see like who's winning who's losing 

270.00 272.99 B: and stuff like that but other than it's like 

273.34 283.30 B: not not really in this sports in the holidays and i mean and like i said with e._s._p._n. thing they they have other things there too i saw that was really fascinating and it um 

283.40 290.67 B: they had like the world strongest man and the worlds strongest woman contest and you know it is more like that test of 

291.12 293.42 A: like a test of the human endurance just to see who 

292.74 298.07 B: yeah brute strength endurance type of thing and they have them do all these weird things like 

298.79 299.97 B: role big 

300.17 309.51 B: gigantic wheels like fifty feet across [laughter] the somewhere and it's kind of strange but it was like fascinating at the same time it wasn't your typical 

303.46 304.50 A: (( right )) 

310.46 314.77 B: boring sports thing and they had it for both men and women which i thought was nice 

315.45 319.99 B: cause you know usually they usually they have like you know this male oriented stuff 

319.40 320.59 A: absolutely 

320.74 324.60 A: uh no that's really cool i've i haven't heard about uh

324.88 332.54 B: yeah i just happened to catch it when i was like flicking through channels one day and i saw it and i was like i wonder what this is about [laughter] you know 

332.53 344.09 B: cause i usually don't i usually just steer clear of the s._b._n. [laughter] and i was like i was just kind of curious one day and there was like this little half hour program and it had all of these little competitions and these like 

344.36 346.89 B: big broady guys and they're doing all 

346.92 347.95 B: lifting 

348.39 356.25 B: ten boulders or something and it it was kind of like funny and you know it's kind of cool and funny in a way 

356.62 357.55 A: um 

358.87 363.98 A: can you can you um can you guess ahead of time like who you think is going to 

364.13 365.66 A: to do well or 

366.77 367.80 A: um 

367.14 369.90 B: um oh in the show not oh 

370.96 373.76 B: not really i mean i know the commentators i guess 

373.93 379.44 B: you know the knowledge of the other participants they always say like well you know this guy's been 

379.76 386.70 B: a champion for like three years and you know he's expected to win or we have this new up you know this 

386.84 391.39 B: new comer he's gonna be in and you you know that kind of thing i i 

391.80 393.51 B: yeah i'm not that well 

392.79 397.08 A: but they don't really set it up so that you're rooting for the under dog to i don't know beat make 

396.17 397.83 B: yeah they don't really 

397.94 405.92 B: set it off i don't know i think one time they set it up when i was watching there was a guy i think he he was an older man and 

406.39 416.47 B: he's been competing for like a long time and and i think they were setting it up it sounded like they had a bios towards him and wanted him to win 

416.91 421.76 A: sure that he could still pr- prove to himself or to the fans that he could still perform 

419.49 420.47 B: right 

421.15 428.07 B: yeah like i think he won like two or three years in a row or something like that and then they had this other guy he was 

428.60 435.99 B: he was like an iceland or i think the guy who was winning for a while was from the u._k. and this guy was from like iceland and he was like you know the 

436.11 438.19 B: new up start kind of thing 

438.03 439.10 A: mhm 

440.00 444.27 B: you know i mean it's the newer guy ended up winning but it was kind of like you know 

445.90 454.12 B: they just the way they kind of like the commentators they kind of set it up like to say like you know well this one's been winning for a long time and 

454.24 458.57 B: that kind of stuff and you know it it was it was a 

458.59 464.32 B: it was like really interesting and especially with the women they don't show the women the women that much though than 

464.95 465.79 B: (( the men )) 

464.96 468.33 A: i know it's a real that that i would like to see more of um 

467.83 474.73 B: the worlds strongest women was really interesting too it was like i said they only showed the man [laughter] one so on 

475.20 481.71 B: e._s._p._n. i i only happened to come across the woman one i was like the worlds strongest woman what's that about you know but 

482.79 488.05 B: that was a lot of fun too they didn't don't remember them setting it up to the place where 

488.61 495.52 B: you know this woman's been winning for x. amount of years but it was like interesting in like the backgrounds of these women i mean some of them were 

495.59 497.82 B: i think one woman was a paramedic 

498.23 502.09 B: and one was like stay at home mom you know [laughter] 

501.01 502.93 A: coming from all walks of life

509.28 511.61 B: these women from all walks of life 

512.24 514.90 B: it wasn't like you know typical 

515.65 518.09 A: well i find them more compelling than um 

518.16 519.26 A: um 

519.39 520.73 A: for example watching 

520.75 524.92 A: watching baseball like i i i actually like going to base ballgames more than 

525.00 535.31 A: um more than i would like i wouldn't sit down and watch a baseball game on t._v. at home although although i like it atmosphere of going out and being with you know community stands and 

533.30 534.24 B: yeah 

535.48 536.42 A: (( something )) 

536.23 545.54 B: yeah yeah i was actually at yankees stadium like some time last year for like another function and i mean not i don't like baseball either i think it's like kind of boring but
