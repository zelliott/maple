0.00 0.39 B: (( [noise] )) 

0.29 2.42 A: hi i'm anne-marie 

1.82 3.24 B: hi i'm becky 

2.77 4.50 A: hi becky do you 

3.70 5.52 B: i'm in florida 

4.96 6.52 A: i'm in ohio 

6.34 8.92 B: oh right on [laughter] 

7.17 8.05 A: yeah 

8.15 10.34 A: so a little bit far away 

9.97 11.59 B: [mn] yeah definitely 

10.45 13.62 A: right so do you watch sports on t._v. 

13.65 18.29 B: well to tell you the truth my boyfriend loves sports on t._v. 

14.88 19.59 A: [noise] oh really [mn] 

18.39 20.78 B: yeah to me i 

19.78 32.19 A: i know i never watched sports on t._v. and then my husband got me into it g- a while ago and i like to watch football i think during the football season and we usually watch you know a couple of games every weekend 

28.51 30.18 B: yeah definitely 

32.18 40.98 B: i lived in key west during football season last and we just made it a monday football every single go down to the bar and relax with just everybody that we knew 

38.43 39.50 A: mhm 

40.74 51.16 A: yeah [laughter] we always used to do that and now i have two kids so a lot of the time you know we'll hire a baby sitter just to go out and watch 'cause it really is hard to do it 

41.59 43.88 B: it just becomes a huge party 

51.56 53.06 B: yeah definitely 

51.72 53.54 A: so but 

53.37 56.90 B: um i have a one year old oh yeah 

54.61 63.30 A: oh really yeah i have a three year old and an eleven month old so that definitely puts a cramp in in that and my husband is a real big dallas fan 

58.65 59.88 B: oh that's fun 

63.25 71.19 A: and so i don't think he can be as boisterous as he would like to be with the kids around so he tries to like watch his language and all that so 

66.97 69.26 B: ah yeah definitely 

71.09 75.78 B: well you know one way to keep up um my boyfriend watches e._s._p._n. sports center all the time 

75.30 76.89 A: oh yeah 

76.13 84.41 B: and but it's wonderful because i don't have to sit through the entire thing and he can sit there and catch up on everything that's been going on in an hour 

80.50 81.63 A: [laughter] 

84.03 87.68 A: that makes sense that sounds good yeah that's is that chris berman 

85.15 86.06 B: (( you know )) 

87.48 88.42 B: (( hm )) 

87.92 100.72 A: yeah and he watches that too to get the recaps because i think a lot of times he'd love to see the dallas game and here in ohio we don't see it you know a lot of times so he can only watch either the recaps or you know when they break away 

94.81 95.50 B: (( where )) 

95.88 97.26 B: oh yeah 

100.63 103.57 B: yeah you know i grew up watching baseball 

101.15 102.48 A: and do it that 

103.23 104.98 A: oh 

103.67 109.98 B: yeah my entire family it used to be so funny because my grandfather worked for the school board and he's a marlins fan 

109.58 110.78 A: ah 

110.25 120.24 B: so but my entire family are atlanta braves fans [laughter] so he worked right next to the marlins' baseball field 'cause the school board's right next to 

113.04 115.05 A: ow [laughter] 

115.07 116.22 A: that's hard 

117.95 119.65 A: (( ah neat )) 

120.32 131.20 B: it every time it came on marlins facing atlanta braves man it'd be the entire family that we'd all go over to grandma and grandpa's because it was a battle between my grandmother [laughter] and my grandfather 

124.36 125.66 A: (( yay )) 

129.46 130.44 A: (( yep )) 

131.27 132.49 A: that's funny 

131.35 134.11 B: 'cause my grandmother was a diehard atlanta fan 

133.61 147.40 A: ah that's right yeah i didn't really grow up watching sports at all except sometimes we would go out sometimes to games my parents are divorced and so when we went to see my dad a lot of times he would take us to a game i grew up in um new england so we'd the boston red sox 

147.28 155.86 A: but because they were such a losing team for so long it was really hard to be a big fan 'cause you knew they were going to lose in the end anyway so 

147.30 148.55 B: yeah 

154.62 158.37 B: well you know if you're a diehard fan it doesn't matter if they lose 

157.02 159.06 A: i know i know 

158.93 162.69 B: there's some people i mean the atlanta braves my family have stuck by them 

162.73 170.72 B: through thick and thin it doesn't matter if they were winning losing or who they were trading you know but there was you know like chipper jones 

163.50 164.56 A: mhm 

166.96 168.82 A: right right 

170.64 171.63 A: mhm 

170.85 173.71 B: mm we kept an eye on him even after they traded him 

173.20 174.79 A: (( uh huh okay )) 

173.77 180.58 B: 'cause he's he's a good player just flat out it wouldn't have mattered whose team he was on they really made a mistake by trading him 

177.01 178.00 A: yeah 

180.09 182.86 A: mhm are there any sports you don't like to watch 

183.12 186.44 B: golf [laughter] 

183.80 190.07 A: oh i know boring [laughter] i put that up there with bowling yeah [laughter] it's like 

186.92 195.20 B: [laughter] yeah golf pool and bowling i don't enjoy watching on t._v. [mn] 

192.29 193.39 A: (( mhm )) 

194.08 201.22 A: no and tennis too i don't like watching tennis on tv i think that's i mean it can be okay it's one of the 

197.24 199.23 B: well sometimes i don't mind it in 

200.22 201.57 B: between commercials 

201.30 202.93 A: yeah that's true 

201.95 212.49 B: mhm that's how most of my sports are watched except for unless it's a really big game or something it's usually in b- i'm watching a movie or or a show or something 

202.95 204.23 A: but yeah 

210.76 211.83 A: mhm 

211.98 215.81 A: and you flip over for a few minutes me too me too 

212.90 214.84 B: yeah exactly 

214.93 218.03 B: uh-huh 'cause then you get all the recaps and everything it's just 

217.88 229.36 B: sometimes watching an entire game is just four hours of watching like race car driving just going around in circles and around but it's interesting you want to know who wins and you want to see all the wrecks and you want to know 

222.05 222.76 A: [sigh] 

224.04 225.30 A: exactly 

229.15 237.45 B: if everybody's okay i remember i was down in um cape canaveral with a bunch of my friends watching the race when dale earnhardt died 

237.15 238.06 A: (( mm )) 

237.71 240.99 B: and they had just had a ten car pileup

366.35 367.63 B: yeah 

366.48 372.44 A: but that and wrestling is another one it's like i just can't get into that and i oh the fans are just like avid fans

382.31 391.56 B: i know and they keep doing all these things and all they show is these people becoming restless and everything i know 

383.22 384.34 A: but 

387.47 388.44 A: (( mm )) 

390.18 404.20 A: exactly but you know what's weird too is i think the difference between guys and women watching i mean yeah women can be big fans but the difference between how women and men watch i think it's just totally different you know 

393.48 394.92 B: (( i know )) 

396.68 398.52 B: (( oh )) 

402.66 406.49 B: (( yeah men are like yeah my team scored all right )) 

404.31 418.57 A: [laughter] i know it becomes like their life you know and it's like you know it's ju- and i-i look at them and i think it's just a game you know yeah i want my team to win but you know i'm not going to like scream and yell and get all upset and it's not life or death [mn] 

406.89 407.97 B: (( uh )) 

409.16 410.96 B: (( huh )) 

414.30 417.25 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

418.48 426.75 B: exactly and also cool is you know if the other team does a good play i'm going to acknowledge it you know like yeah that was good you know what i'm saying 

424.02 425.40 A: exactly 

425.51 432.17 A: exactly and they're all like oh that's not fair or that's da da da and that was a penalty and it's like no it wasn't it was fine 

429.00 430.23 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

431.83 434.47 B: (( yeah it's just a good play man admit it )) 

433.77 435.82 A: exactly exactly 

435.03 440.93 B: that's the difference between men and women you know they're so stuck on their thing and oh you know my person's right just because i like him 

436.65 437.44 A: yep 

440.37 444.10 A: right right [laughter] i think so too 

441.09 446.06 B: but they can't admit that somebody else [laughter] made a good play and got around their man [laughter] 

444.82 446.35 A: i know i think so 

446.39 447.29 B: (( yeah you )) 

447.47 448.75 B: (( want to go play with your ball )) 

449.18 450.85 B: i don't like um 

451.10 453.55 B: golf when it first came out 

452.06 452.91 A: no 

453.88 457.42 B: or not when it first came out when f- tiger woods first started joining 

457.02 458.36 A: mhm 

457.75 463.55 B: is when golf just became so much m- more popular you know you know what i mean 

462.25 470.71 A: right 'cause it was just so much fun to watch because he was so good and he would do things that you totally didn't expect but very rarely do we put golf on 

465.02 466.38 B: exactly 

467.54 468.50 B: yeah 

469.07 471.31 B: i think it's something golf needed 

471.04 471.83 A: (( hm )) 

471.46 475.97 B: i think it's something golf needed it was about to be a dying sport you know what i mean 

472.59 474.07 A: yeah 

474.96 485.98 A: exactly i think you appreciate golf more too if you play and we don't play golf and it's like all right you know big deal and i- i'm sure it's real difficult you know and it looks hard but 

478.33 479.49 B: yeah 

481.40 482.76 B: exactly 

483.78 484.87 B: mhm 

486.32 490.09 A: it's like i think you have to really do it to appreciate it 

486.78 487.65 B: well 

489.70 499.95 B: oh definitely it's also it's much more of an expensive sport you know what i'm saying it's like you need to have money this game's not good enough for you people who don't have money you know what i 

490.36 491.60 A: you know i can't 

492.79 495.55 A: yeah yeah mhm 

497.06 497.80 A: right 

498.76 501.50 A: right it's a country club sport yeah 

500.25 512.87 B: mean exactly you know you got doctors lawyers take their day off just to go and have golf and it's just it's more along the lines of you've got to have money to do this come join our country club and 

503.86 504.86 A: mhm 

510.36 511.28 A: right 

511.82 516.67 A: exactly whereas soccer is yeah give me a ball and a net and anybody can play 

515.23 521.59 B: exactly basketball they have free courses you know free courts where you can go and play i 

519.32 520.27 A: (( yeah )) 

521.25 522.16 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

521.50 533.19 B: enjoy playing sport and that makes it more appreciative to watch it you know what i mean i mean the basketball and baseball two of the main ones and 

526.56 527.68 A: (( right [mn] )) 

531.32 544.12 A: yep yeah and in fact i don't watch basketball usually except during the n._c._a._a. play offs but it's because my husband where he works they do a pool and i think that gets me more interested in sport sometimes too 

536.69 537.66 B: (( oh yeah )) 

543.83 545.01 B: yeah 

543.99 548.80 A: it's like you you pick the team that's going to win and so you have something to watch for 

548.50 551.50 B: yeah i like watching people that i know you 

548.81 550.44 A: and so that makes it easier 

551.55 554.64 B: know what i mean for instance my brother plays baseball 

551.57 552.41 A: mhm 

553.96 554.98 A: ah 

554.82 560.63 B: and to go down and watch the live game that makes a difference to us when [mn] we're actually there you know 

559.03 564.49 A: yeah i think so too we used to go to some hockey games we lived in um the d._c. area for a while 

564.30 577.76 A: and we used to go watch the capitals and 'cause i never liked hockey before that and then all of a sudden once you went there you could see so much more than what's on the t._v. you know you could see the plays the plays developing and stuff and so i 

571.66 572.57 B: (( exactly )) 

574.24 575.47 B: oh yeah [noise] 

577.58 580.48 A: gained more of an appreciation of what they were doing 

580.09 581.23 B: mhm 

580.48 587.24 A: you know and it made a huge difference being there and the same thing with baseball i don't [mn] i can't watch baseball on t._v. 

587.14 597.04 A: so much but when you're there you know with the crowd and the popcorn and [mn] the whole atmosphere is just so much different than sitting on your couch watching it 

594.81 596.32 B: (( yeah that's right )) 

596.91 597.81 B: yeah 

597.18 598.70 A: you know so 

597.87 599.95 B: i like it um basket-
