0.00 1.69 B: hi my name is john 

1.20 3.37 A: hi my name is kay 

3.29 4.20 B: hi kay 

3.75 4.68 A: hi 

4.51 13.84 B: so i i just heard this question 'cause i didn't hear the beginning of this uh phone call uh my roommate handed it to me but i guess it was what can the u._s. do to prevent a bioterrorist attack okay 

12.24 14.62 A: yeah yeah um 

14.33 16.40 B: (( do you have any thoughts 'cause i'm still kinda getting )) 

15.18 20.10 A: well first of all i'm living in manhattan i don't know where you're at so 

19.27 21.89 B: i'm in uh cambridge near boston 

21.36 29.06 A: oh okay so we're both eastside- -siders um well from my perspective hav- having 

23.31 24.43 B: pretty close yeah 

29.14 41.01 A: lived here i don't know there is much you can [laughter] can do to prevent it because [mn] other outside of it being a police state um there's seri- so many 

30.07 30.98 B: mhm 

38.69 39.48 B: right 

41.02 48.57 A: opportunities for people to just kinda slip in and i take the subway to work every day and i don't 

48.78 55.11 A: [laughter] i don't know how they could prevent somebody from getting down there and just you know opening up whatever 

55.88 61.59 A: doing whatever they need to to start it yeah 

57.37 60.88 B: right like what they did in japan with the serum uh attacks 

60.71 73.60 B: um in fact it it's it's actually somewhat heartening that there isn't too me that that there isn't more terrorism and i think there really could be um like that you know if if people were 

69.25 70.26 A: mhm 

73.68 81.82 B: yeah uh it seems like all the time and i i think you know especially whatever in the wake of september eleven et cetera that i feel like um 

82.00 93.84 B: yeah you know if somebody really wanted to to do evil they probably could have gotten away with it by now you know like every time i drive over a bridge or through a tunnel and and yeah and general just releasing things into the into the general population i'm not sure it's 

86.25 87.40 A: oh yeah 

88.88 89.84 A: mhm 

94.33 102.58 B: i'm [mn] i i i i'm not sure that it's it's something to worry about but nothing you can really worry about too hard 

101.82 105.11 A: right because there's not much we can do 

104.82 116.38 B: right uh and perhaps uh other you know other ways to go about you know yeah it's it's something if some people are going to try something i think there's a large chance aside from the you know normal terrorism prevention 

116.43 126.47 B: you do what you uh uh there's not too much but you can perhaps you know uh educate if there's some way to to uh you know avoid symptoms or uh 

126.49 140.05 B: or develop vaccines uh in advance i think that would probably be you know spending money on on those you know on vaccines on on defenses uh we- i think would probably be the best bet 

128.87 130.34 A: mhm 

139.34 141.38 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

140.09 144.59 B: um we've we've probably spent money on developing uh 

144.53 156.32 B: more likely than not on developing uh uh bioterrorism uh chemicals themselves so they probably have some evidence towards you know how to have the how to uh to defeat them 

152.09 153.20 A: right 

155.61 158.37 A: right that we just don't know about 

157.39 158.44 B: right 

158.53 166.88 B: um now i i i'm i'm trying to think of what other bioterrorist uh stuff has happened and and i most notably think about in japan um 

165.65 170.19 A: yeah had they had that uh well here that we had the the anthrax 

169.96 175.89 B: right the the anthrax but was that ever really resolved as to i guess there was some anthrax right 

170.63 171.75 A: scare 

173.43 174.43 A: well there was 

174.76 182.49 A: yeah i mean i think two or three people died of it and it was so close to september eleventh that everyone was panicking about it um 

179.33 180.49 B: right 

181.24 182.03 B: right 

183.15 187.30 B: and it ended up being actually like like americans 

183.25 184.29 A: but 

185.87 192.52 A: they were actually y- but i don't know if they caught the the person just you know it just kinda stopped [laughter] 

189.27 190.30 B: right 

190.47 191.61 B: it kinda went away 

191.80 192.87 B: yeah 

192.98 194.06 A: so 

193.08 194.03 B: um 

194.09 199.05 B: yeah i don't i don't have i know actually a lot of my friends are involved in uh 

199.75 211.00 B: uh bioengineering and and genetics and stuff like that i'm not so i don't know too much about what sorts of things can be done and what can be identified uh and do you have any background in that by chance 

200.99 202.13 A: mhm 

210.29 219.65 A: no no i'm thinking of things like you know smallpox um and things that are fairly um 

220.26 228.02 A: common or used to be common which now if it was released i think it would you know like it would you know be like the plague 

221.26 222.08 B: right 

228.98 236.75 A: and that's regardless of whether or not you were vaccinated and and i'm forty three and i was vaccinated but 

232.96 234.14 B: right 

237.12 241.69 A: i don't i don't know that's it um i mean they were telling people that were going over to 

241.81 245.69 A: the middle east that they should be vaccinated for it again so 

243.63 247.71 B: right that's for the smallpox when when do you know when they stopped vaccinating for smallpox 

247.02 250.79 A: you know i want to say it was in the seventies 'cause 

248.94 254.05 B: oh okay i was born in seventy eight so i wonder if i i probably didn't get it then 

253.51 262.96 A: yeah i don't think so um because at some point they they said it had been eradicated although you always when you hear that it's 

262.55 264.33 B: right especially 

262.97 266.86 A: exactly for in a couple of test tubes [laughter] that we keep you know [laughter] 

265.26 268.13 B: exactly and could release at any time yeah mhm 

267.17 268.28 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

268.61 269.97 A: but um 

270.32 274.57 A: you know i think of it that way and i know on september eleventh um 

275.27 278.55 A: i was at work i work for a like two blocks from 

278.58 281.77 A: grand central and and my um 

279.62 280.74 B: (( yeah )) 

282.55 287.49 A: my friend you know the day of he just said do not get into the subway 

287.13 288.00 B: mhm 

287.41 301.84 A: and walk home i jus- i live fairly close too but it was don't get in the subway whether it was you know for fear that they would have bombs down there or you know gases or whatever but um 

292.78 293.73 B: right 

296.90 298.42 B: right 

298.45 299.78 B: gas or 

302.20 308.33 B: but you i mean you being in manhattan like probably spend quite a bit of time underground in subways right 

307.78 308.97 A: yeah 

308.38 316.41 B: and you know it is a closed environment and yet i mean i know that when i'm in subways that are i still for the most part feel pretty safe 

315.95 316.95 A: yeah 

316.49 331.19 B: um and you know when i look around i think most people feel pretty safe and i don't think i think that that the worst thing to do is to really preoccupy yourself with that it it is a valid concern but i think in some ways you know uh it feels weird saying this but i think by 

331.00 339.06 B: by keeping it so much in people's consciousness uh is probably more of a disservice than again you know like um 

334.04 335.02 A: mhm 

339.10 344.22 B: keeping people in a state of panic you know during various orange alerts or whatever 

340.77 341.76 A: right 

344.43 345.33 B: um 

345.20 351.46 B: it it it makes peop- it makes people jumpy and to some degrees i guess it is good to be concerned you know like i mean 

351.31 361.14 B: to a large extent we were in sort of sheep mentalities before september eleven and are not anymore you know like i mean i know when i fly on a plane i feel 

356.22 358.34 A: mhm mhm 

361.09 375.58 B: kind of on edge a lot and and you know it's just the different type of of thing whereas before i i was just would not know what if something happened i would probably leap into the irrational action which in some i mean in some way might worse than not doing action but i think in general it might be better now 

362.17 363.35 A: mhm 

367.50 368.42 A: right 

370.17 371.03 A: yeah 

375.31 379.31 A: yeah i know in grand central this is one of the um 

379.50 387.47 A: precautions they're taking and i'm sure they have thi- i know i i went to boston right after september eleven and as a matter of fact i flew there and back but 

384.13 385.17 B: mhm 

386.28 387.33 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

387.35 394.76 A: um and there were there were people you know national guard or whatever but at that point they weren't armed 

394.88 400.33 A: um now in grand central you can see 

400.54 411.33 A: that there are um armed national guard members especially in the you know the middle kind of meeting place or whatever transfer thing 

406.47 407.83 B: yeah 

410.08 422.61 B: i you know i notice that i was in when i was in new york a couple of weeks ago uh in the subways um it seemed to for some reason it seemed to coincide with subways that were under construction in like the atlantic avenue subway station in brooklyn and then 

422.40 430.97 B: some other one in lower manhattan i would see like yeah i guess like national guard peop- guys with berets and and so- some automatic machine guns 

424.24 424.91 A: (( mm )) 

430.40 431.38 A: yeah 

431.01 433.17 B: um it was kinda freaky but [laughter] mhm 

432.18 447.16 A: yeah and it does i mean it i went down to ground zero about two weeks after it all shook down and [sigh] and i tell ya at the very end which is i'm you've been here so i'm assuming you know how to get to the statute of liberty and that kind of thing 

444.09 444.85 B: uh-huh 

446.13 447.08 B: sure 

447.02 451.51 A: there's a big park around there and that park was full it was 

448.97 449.77 B: right 

451.70 458.78 A: it was roped up and there were tents and it was like an army station we were like we were under police [laughter] 

456.17 456.97 B: (( right yeah )) 

458.93 462.75 A: in a police state and that was unnerving for me just because you don't 

462.93 466.64 A: really think that it's gotten to that point 

464.88 465.70 B: yeah 

466.83 471.99 A: um but on the other hand i mean you can have all the people you want sitting in the 

472.18 481.70 A: in um grand central terminal and if somebody wants to they just drop a briefcase and go and that's it 

474.86 475.71 B: mhm 

479.57 480.41 B: right 

481.43 482.48 B: right 

482.01 483.38 A: so [laughter] 

483.49 490.28 A: i think that they're there for us feel like there's something being done and i'm not saying nothing is being done 

489.80 491.04 B: right 

490.58 492.23 A: but um 

492.86 494.14 A: i think 

494.54 497.52 A: it it would be it's virtually impossible to 

497.68 498.79 A: to 

499.22 502.68 A: prevent that kind of attack should somebody want to do it 

500.96 501.86 B: right 

502.33 505.13 B: i i i think about the current terrorism 

504.98 518.36 B: like you know in in israel right which is probably the the most consistent i'm mean it's died down now but you know uh uh six months ago i think it was pretty it was pretty hot and it was like every every day almost uh 

506.67 507.79 A: mhm 

515.83 517.06 A: right 

518.23 527.01 B: they were pretty much only bombs not bio uh terrorism efforts which you is i mean i think that's largely because they they probably weren't you know the palestinians weren't 

519.78 520.69 A: mhm 

526.92 533.68 B: receiving support from countries that could manufacture this mainly but i don't know how i mean how hard is it maybe to make smallpox 

530.30 531.75 A: right 

533.33 544.04 A: yeah and and like i said if you've got one little test tube of it and some the the wrong person gets it they can give it to somebody else or sell it to somebody else and and um 

540.83 541.66 B: right 

544.08 549.28 A: and it's not just smallpox i'm sure they have strains of different things like the sars wh- you know 

548.67 557.46 B: i wondered about that yeah this i i to a certain degree i mean i was kinda freaked out when we were starting to hear about sars but the reality uh the 

549.66 550.87 A: [laughter] 

557.44 565.86 B: the death rate for sars is lower than the death rate for the flu in any given year [laughter] so um it is new but i don't think it's 

560.57 561.71 A: right 

561.75 563.13 A: [laughter] 

566.15 572.17 B: unless of course they're greatly underexaggerating the prevalence of it in china in which case it could 

570.31 580.29 A: yeah i i agree because i i see it and it's like you know that many people die from you know drowning [laughter] and 

577.73 579.43 B: right exactly mhm 

580.94 586.10 A: i guess they are con- the concern is that it's highly contagious where you know 

584.69 585.51 B: mhm 

586.27 590.61 A: drown- drowning or ac- accidents or things like that aren't 

590.62 591.92 A: but um 

592.58 599.04 A: i guess if i was really really concerned about bioterrorism number one i wouldn't take the subway 

599.22 599.89 A: and number two
