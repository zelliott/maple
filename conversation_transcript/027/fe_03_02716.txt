0.43 1.65 A: hello 

1.49 2.89 B: oh hello there 

2.75 4.28 A: hi this is iman 

4.45 6.27 B: oh hi this is lee hans 

6.39 7.80 A: hi lee [noise] 

7.95 11.90 A: um so i guess we need to talk about bioterrorism 

11.58 15.67 B: yeah and it looks like what you would the u._s. can do to prevent bioterrorism 

15.09 19.90 A: yeah um this is kind of my first call so i'm not really experienced in this 

19.89 22.24 B: no i me as well i guess um 

22.63 30.22 B: what we can probably do is understand more about exactly what bioterrorism is and first of all i 

30.23 33.45 B: what what is your understanding of what bioterrorism is 

33.32 34.13 A: (( [noise] um )) 

34.00 48.99 A: [noise] um the way i kinda understand it is it's some um i- it's a kinda modern warfare where you don't need um weapons or any any ar- arms i mean all you have to do is release some of these germs or viruses 

49.00 57.78 A: and then they kinda mutate and multiply and and uh take its toll on human life wherever they're released i guess 

57.75 58.54 B: (( mm )) 

58.64 61.21 B: i guess um the anthrax is 

61.28 62.53 A: yep 

61.70 64.38 B: (( considered a bioterrorist weapon )) 

64.71 66.64 B: and i guess there is um 

67.31 70.70 B: [lipsmack] a even just poisons i guess that they spray in the air 

71.57 73.68 A: yep i mean um 

73.01 74.44 B: pretty much anything 

74.17 82.49 A: yeah i guess it's some a- any chemical or or or virus or anything that that can multiply in the air i guess 

82.11 82.95 B: (( mm )) 

82.89 83.76 A: um 

83.11 88.92 B: it doesn't see i to me i from what i know is it doesn't seem as if there's anything which is particularly 

89.91 93.68 B: threatening or dangerous i mean more of kind of a i mean 

94.68 98.99 B: no- not on a widespread level it's not a big threat 

98.33 99.33 A: sure 

99.59 100.59 A: um 

100.79 109.11 A: to to me uh i've always been confused now when they say bioterrorism um does it mean just airborne um 

109.11 117.17 A: chemicals and diseases or could there be something you could mix in the water or you know something like let's let's spray it into 

117.41 121.50 A: um you know your your water supply lines or something 

120.80 123.42 B: yeah i think i think it 

123.64 126.96 B: it's funny they talk about biological weapons um 

127.61 134.85 B: i mean just because it's biological there are other kind of weap- i mean um well a poison is is non biological some of them 

135.17 136.08 B: like 

136.14 144.00 B: [mn] chlorine gas or it might not it'd be mustard gas which i guess is not a biological weapon it's ju- just an organic 

143.91 145.29 A: yeah 

144.67 146.43 B: uh it's a inorganic 

146.40 150.13 A: i mean that that could be equally lethal as well though 

149.80 151.11 B: (( substance yeah )) 

150.53 153.97 A: right um you know that's what i always 

152.93 156.92 B: so are you i guess i guess you're right it has to be something that's being um 

157.54 158.57 B: uh 

159.44 163.93 B: some organism which spreads i guess small pox would be um bioterrorism 

163.51 167.96 A: [noise] yep i mean 'cause um that could be it too and then 

168.31 173.62 A: [sigh] um i think in in london they they nabbed seven or eight people that were 

173.65 178.34 A: mixing some toxin that typically you mix it in water i guess 

178.11 179.92 B: yeah ricin i guess 

179.23 181.63 A: ricin yeah you're right 

181.05 182.07 B: um 

182.38 186.43 A: that would be a form of bioterrorism too right i mean at least 

185.49 186.63 B: yeah 

186.66 192.28 A: uh it's a form of terrorism i don't know [laughter] if that gets lumped into bioterrorism but 

191.22 196.69 B: yeah i i i guess it probably they're probably gonna covering everything [noise] 

197.10 205.07 B: [lipsmack] 'cause i know when uh they had some quite serious problems in the subways in japan where they had um a particular kind of toxic gas and they killed a lot of people 

205.30 207.08 A: yeah some years ago 

207.03 210.20 B: (( yeah so you could kind of basically )) 

207.65 209.12 A: (( yeah )) 

211.03 214.68 B: i guess basically they just lump everything in together probably 

213.94 215.34 A: yep yep 

215.36 223.24 A: um now the question is i guess how do you prevent it i mean i'm not very familiar with things that you could do to prevent them or 

223.72 232.47 A: or say for example there was a a scare in your neighborhood about just small pox i mean what do you do to avoi- i mean 

232.73 235.44 A: what do you do to contain it's it's spread 

235.34 236.27 B: (( [noise] [noise] hm )) 

236.57 241.82 A: and i'm not very familiar with preventive measures i mean i've read the 

240.90 245.22 B: yeah i know that they um you can be vaccinated against small pox 

245.89 246.71 A: right 

246.02 250.25 B: um and i i think there was some progress underway to uh 

250.66 251.69 B: (( um )) 

252.26 257.42 B: inoculate or or vaccinate um health workers and things like that first care respondents 

259.57 264.62 A: yeah but i mean what about say anthrax or any of these really 

263.33 264.25 B: (( hm )) 

264.89 265.89 A: um 

265.93 267.47 A: difficult things 

267.36 268.19 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

268.66 274.99 A: 'cause i mean it's small pox i think peop- those vaccinations have been around for years so people kinda know 

273.95 274.64 B: (( mm )) 

275.16 286.26 A: about a small po- pox vaccine but what do you do about say things that came in your mail like the anthrax thing that comes in your mail and what do you do next 

283.86 285.63 B: yeah 

286.14 292.87 B: i guess the other interesting question is in a in a way they say that terrorism is just instilling terror in people 

293.04 293.96 B: so 

294.99 300.57 B: stopping bioterrorism you don't necessarily need to stop the the um 

300.64 305.96 B: the occurrence as long as you stop people from being terrified and being scared and being concerned 

305.77 307.16 A: correct i mean 

306.13 311.96 B: uh then you've actually you've actually defeated them so in some ways maybe the public education could be um 

312.04 313.20 B: and uh 

312.13 314.28 A: that's i think that's the key 

314.41 315.36 A: (( um [noise] [noise] )) 

314.56 322.44 B: yeah if people are not afraid even if there are some outbreaks um you know if people aren't afraid of anthrax and i think in the be- in the beginning people were 

322.80 324.96 B: incredibly afraid of anthrax 

325.11 326.92 B: then in reality the the 

326.98 333.02 B: overall impact of it is you know it's nothing anything like a plane crash or uh nine eleven or anything like that 

332.40 335.12 A: yeah or a road accident for that matter 

334.49 336.68 B: yeah exactly you ride a bus so 

336.75 337.51 A: yeah 

336.77 338.20 B: probably if um 

338.34 339.99 B: probably if people are i 

340.00 342.01 B: think much more 

340.74 343.69 A: i think it's the perception that you know you have these 

342.78 343.71 B: yeah 

344.00 349.14 A: harmful chemicals in the air and you know they could spread and kill a lot of people 

348.84 361.74 B: yeah so i'm sure if they uh i'm sure if there was a public campaign just to introduce all these different things and what happens and how dangerous they are or aren't you know at least people have the information and they won't be so scared so 

361.81 363.71 B: yeah and that in a way could just 

363.87 367.49 B: really uh maybe that would even just take away the uh 

368.93 370.06 B: the um 

370.95 377.50 B: the desire for terrorists to use those things if they if they know that the public is well aware of them knows how to deal with them and is 

377.55 380.77 B: not concerned then maybe the terrorist would 

381.65 383.62 B: think of other other objectives 

383.16 385.63 A: correct uh i mean i think it's 

385.96 389.31 A: the bottom line is the terrorists are just looking 

389.12 392.74 A: at using tools that could instill fear 

392.55 407.11 A: in in the minds of people and at this point they really don't care if it's bioterrorism or anything else they just want to find um um a matter to kind of terrorize people at least scare them um 

394.48 395.22 B: mm 

404.47 405.30 B: (( mm )) 

406.44 409.63 B: yeah because ultimately the the impact on the economy with 

409.89 412.59 B: um people's fears is 

412.77 415.12 B: probably the most significant thing that you can do 

414.92 416.32 A: right and i [noise] 

415.58 419.79 B: and if we assume that september the eleventh had a big impact on the economy and uh 

419.98 422.59 B: the the the anthrax scare then 

423.00 426.55 B: you know that in itself has much wider consequences for people 

426.66 427.59 A: correct 

426.83 439.00 B: you know it it affects the hospital waiting lists and you know ultimately people more people die if the economy is bad just because of the you know less money for operations and health care and policing and all those kind of things 

439.14 440.30 A: correct correct 

439.64 443.91 B: so you're right over- overall the impact of fear is is a huge thing [noise] [noise] 

443.66 458.54 A: yep i mean it it it actually brings down a country because the economy slumps and then once the economy slumps then others other things start crumbling i think it's like a house of cards if if one leg starts falling then everything else 

455.64 456.42 B: mm 

458.32 459.66 A: follows 

460.12 462.09 B: and then i i guess based on the 

464.15 471.64 B: based on that you're right that that's the uh the easiest thing that they can do is is instill fear and affect the economy and then i guess they get uh 

472.63 481.01 B: i don't quite know what their object- ultimately what why they want to do that but i guess they uh that probably creates some political power for them or 

481.44 484.21 B: you know they can make make demands on 

484.18 485.74 A: (( [noise] right )) 

484.23 485.07 B: (( the )) 

485.42 487.97 B: and or influence decisions like 

488.24 490.19 B: i guess potentially they're um 

490.69 491.78 B: the uh 

492.18 498.60 B: al qaeda terrorists are interested in the affecting the outcome in the uh in israel probably 

498.66 499.64 A: right 

499.30 504.70 B: or at least just um maybe influencing the outcome or maybe it's retribution i'm not sure hm 

505.05 510.27 A: yep i think it's more trying to force um the u._s. hand into 

509.53 510.30 B: mm 

510.28 516.65 A: taking a decision one way or the other as opposed to just maintaining the status quo 

516.35 517.11 B: (( mm )) 

516.78 526.99 A: like right now i think the u._s. policy's pretty clear they support israel and they want um all the the militant activity in in palestine to cease 

527.21 531.83 A: and a lot of people don't see it that way at least in the middle east um 

531.36 532.56 B: mhm 

531.95 541.74 A: a lot of countries i should say muslim nations don't see it that way so i think what these terrorists are trying to do is trying to use that muslim sentiment into 

541.89 552.14 A: you know if if they can have some sort of impact on the u._s. uh policy in the middle east and they believe that's a moral victory for them 

551.35 553.79 B: well in that way then maybe a way to um 

554.11 558.92 B: prevent bioterrorism is to uh to solve the root of the problem which is uh 

559.01 562.02 B: the the the issues in the middle east and the israel 

562.21 563.35 B: the israeli 

562.35 563.17 A: right 

563.77 565.57 B: palestinian conflict 

565.19 566.27 A: right right 

565.58 567.68 B: so i guess maybe maybe that's a uh 

568.09 572.36 B: a mechanism for the united states that looks more to the root of the i mean 

573.00 574.84 B: i i always think that's a 

576.32 577.75 B: um to to 

577.96 582.21 B: you know it's almost like giving in to terrorists but you know in some ways uh 

582.49 585.06 B: there's always two ways to fight a problem [noise] 

584.86 586.05 A: yep 

585.65 589.59 B: but um yeah looking for the causes i guess and and trying to reduce 

589.78 599.89 B: because the less people that support as a on a widespread level or the less people that support their activities that the easier they are to catch then the easier they are to um well the less funding they have i mean 

594.90 596.01 A: (( yep yep ))
