1.84 3.38 B: my name is stormy 

3.13 4.75 A: i'm sorry i missed it 

4.41 5.80 B: it's stormy 

5.30 6.51 A: stormy hey 

6.40 7.42 B: (( hey [laughter] )) 

7.43 8.76 A: where you calling from 

9.17 10.41 B: pennsylvania 

10.04 11.76 A: ah i'm in l._a. 

11.50 13.20 B: oh okay [laughter] 

13.05 14.47 A: yeah 

14.10 16.69 B: so it's a normal time of day for you [laughter] 

16.07 18.59 A: yeah [laughter] it's kinda late for you huh 

18.39 20.40 B: oh well i was up doing laundry 

20.45 22.43 A: ah very good 

22.17 25.15 B: we have to start talking about bioterrorism now [laughter] 

24.18 26.67 A: that's right that's a good point 

26.10 27.32 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

26.92 30.08 A: i don't think there's anything we can do to stop bioterrorism 

30.94 32.84 B: why do you say that [noise] [noise] 

32.61 45.95 A: well i think the technology is simple enough that anybody with good biology knowledge can do it and once it's introduc- it's simple to introduce 

47.21 48.40 B: (( okay [noise] )) 

48.81 58.06 B: and what do you think as far as them getting this from just books or the internet or is this something that 

57.78 60.07 A: well yeah i i 

60.83 65.99 A: in order to fight um microbes i think there has to be 

66.12 71.06 A: scientists involved 'cause in order to do medicine you have to understand the pathology 

70.90 72.52 B: mhm 

72.19 73.37 A: so 

73.39 77.34 A: if anybody gets paid to and or 

77.53 79.22 A: has grudges 

79.42 84.12 A: you know i think the manipulation of the material would be pretty easy from what i can see 

85.07 86.23 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

87.27 97.05 B: well i kind of agree with you [laughter] i didn't want to say it myself i didn't want to be a pessimist about the whole thing but i feel there is nothing they can do about it i'm sure if there's any um 

93.11 94.19 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

98.08 106.29 B: sort of vaccines that they even have to combat most of the bioterrorism that they said that we have could be threatened with 

106.56 107.66 A: yeah 

106.61 108.20 B: so um 

109.88 117.60 A: i mean they don't even have vaccines for naturally occurring mutating viruses like hunter virus or ebola or anything like that 

118.32 125.41 A: so nature viruses and nature are creative enough without the evilness of man being added to it 

125.52 130.13 B: [noise] that's true i mean look at the fact that they can't get rid of a common cold anymore 

130.20 133.40 A: yeah although they're making good progress on that 

132.94 135.78 B: oh to a certain extent i mean i think that um 

136.08 136.68 B: (( [mn] )) 

137.01 138.96 B: and i'm not sure exactly w- 

139.32 149.11 B: at what extent or what extent bioterrorism at this point is has affected anyone in the country without us really knowing about it 

149.83 152.22 A: oh yeah good point 

151.87 156.54 B: i mean uh most people that i know have had like really 

156.84 159.29 B: horrible colds this summer 

159.77 163.36 B: to the point they've gone b- this winter beyond 

163.52 164.83 B: a normal cold 

165.07 168.70 A: oh that's interesting 'cause in l._a. it hasn't it hasn't been like that but 

169.30 170.01 B: (( mm )) 

169.86 172.55 A: you guys had a bad winter though this year didn't you 

171.23 180.40 B: yeah but i [sigh] i would never have thought that and i i i know this probably to be a fact that you know colds are not caught by 

180.64 182.12 B: just the weather [laughter] 

181.90 187.14 A: oh no but i was just thinking when the weather's bad people spend more time in proximity to each other 

186.94 188.64 B: mhm true 

188.72 189.55 B: true 

188.79 191.46 A: you know there's i think that's part of the reason why 

191.74 193.11 A: there are less 

193.90 199.13 A: the spread is less strong in l._a. because we're outdoors a lot we're not with each other much 

199.26 199.83 B: (( [laughter] )) 

200.19 201.86 B: (( isn't that sad )) 

201.80 211.91 A: [laughter] yes if the human race survived based on l._a. well we don't we'll have a human race but it will be very weird 

202.14 207.08 B: [laughter] 

211.70 213.65 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

212.51 214.31 A: [laughter] 

215.69 217.60 A: it'll be very weird 

215.88 216.72 B: well 

217.26 218.55 B: yeah well 

218.80 226.02 B: if children continue to progress as they are progressing with use of the internet and all the information that they seem to be getting from it 

226.79 230.11 B: bioterrorism is gonna be the next big thing [sigh] 

231.37 236.93 A: yeah you know i think the only thing we can really do to stop it is to make ourselves less 

237.58 241.17 A: um obnoxious a target as a government 

241.66 248.38 B: okay [laughter] all righty then i'm not sure that's gonna happen any time soon but we'll see 

247.95 251.51 A: [laughter] yeah you know 'cause i i think if we were more 

251.77 262.91 A: cooperative and less bullies people would people project on us a lot and i think if we were more cooperative and people got to know us better then there'd be less projection 

256.72 258.09 B: mhm 

263.91 267.95 B: well us as a people um are you speaking of 

267.14 269.46 A: well this is the government i think 

268.84 270.51 B: (( mm okay )) 

271.47 273.23 B: well i don't think anyone's gonna 

273.31 276.08 B: let them know us as a government per se 

276.01 277.35 A: yeah that's true 

276.19 280.57 B: because they perceive our government has having to be top secret and 

280.15 280.86 A: [mn] 

280.76 285.37 B: [laughter] everything that we do is you know under a shroud 

281.18 282.25 A: (( yeah )) 

284.74 288.41 A: not only under a shroud but divinely ordered 

288.64 292.33 A: and directly handed down from god to our president 

292.18 294.21 B: yes that's true [laughter] 

293.81 297.23 A: [laughter] 

294.22 298.45 B: [laughter] 

300.04 301.31 B: so 

300.29 301.42 A: yeah 

301.33 303.66 B: the only thing we can really do is just um 

303.71 306.00 B: phrase it 

306.38 310.05 B: people who have grudges move on to something else 

310.35 312.16 A: yeah 

311.57 312.95 B: quickly [noise] 

312.79 318.58 A: yeah i mean terrorism is the is the province of the people that perceive themselves as powerless 

318.95 320.17 A: (( so if )) 

320.23 324.09 A: there were less perceived powerlessness i think there'd be less terrorism 

324.17 332.65 B: and now that you've said that when you think about the um show of force that we just used i think most people think they're powerless and just went against us 

332.05 340.44 A: oh no kidding absolutely the only thing that can save us if we start cooperating like crazy with the u._n. and the international community 

333.37 334.34 B: (( [noise] )) 

340.49 343.12 A: and get out of it really fast 

344.38 345.18 B: (( oh )) 

345.27 348.26 B: i don't think there's any fast solution to getting out of there [laughter] 

348.03 351.64 A: no you know what i feel like we've fought our way into prison 

352.14 353.69 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

353.05 355.83 A: we were safely out of that mess and now we've 

356.01 360.52 A: forced ourselves in there with zero subtlety and no understanding at all of what's going on 

360.92 362.85 B: yeah but the good 

361.85 367.05 A: and that's just one region we've got the whole of the north korea south korea thing going on too 

366.09 371.71 B: oh gosh well that that would be your next case for bioterrorism north korea [laughter] 

370.79 377.70 A: yeah and you're lucky you live on the east coast i'm within missile i'm within missile range 

373.70 376.52 B: uh-huh that's right 

376.77 382.84 B: [laughter] you are in missile range [laughter] and you know they have them oh 

378.79 381.07 A: [laughter] i know it's [laughter] 

381.50 384.85 A: yes i do it's like uh-oh 

385.51 388.79 B: [laughter] that's true oh gosh 

388.44 393.81 A: yeah it's just another thing to worry about but you know if you start worrying about this there's really nothing you can do 

393.47 394.70 B: that's right 

393.88 396.11 A: that's one of these advantages where 

396.78 401.11 A: it's like very dourest i can't do anything so why worry 

400.86 401.98 B: (( that's true )) 

402.17 403.48 B: that's very true 

402.56 405.49 A: the the same with the bioterrorism it's like 

406.02 412.15 A: [sigh] you know there's really nothing i can do if someone wants i mean look at that anthrax scare that some bozo did 

412.39 414.04 A: right after nine eleven 

413.94 414.98 B: yeah 

414.90 417.70 A: you know and and apparently that was our anthrax 

417.95 420.30 B: [sigh] yes it's very interesting 

421.44 422.25 B: well 

422.95 424.52 B: i don't think there is much 

423.57 430.10 A: not a cheerful note for you to go to sleep on though [laughter] [laughter] 

425.44 432.43 B: [laughter] i'm not gonna go to sleep now i'm gonna be up and sealing my windows in duct tape [laughter] 

430.11 434.93 A: there we go today today's topic is scaring us [laughter] 

434.05 441.88 B: [laughter] oh i i really don't worry about it i think that everyone has their time 

441.94 443.51 B: to a certain extent 

444.24 446.23 B: and some things just can't be helped 

444.28 446.65 A: i'm with you i don't do anything reckless 

446.63 448.24 B: mhm 

446.91 453.45 A: i don't do anything to speed it along but i mean there's really not much you can do with this stuff 

453.26 454.81 B: [noise] [noise] no there's not 

454.92 467.61 A: i work as an extra on movie lots and stuff and they do all this incredible security searching people 'cause like movie studios are gonna be the next target but even with all that it'd be easy 

463.11 464.03 B: (( mhm ah )) 

467.82 469.81 B: oh sure sure 

467.85 468.71 A: (( you know )) 

468.72 469.68 A: it's like 

470.32 471.25 A: okay 

473.20 474.02 B: huh 

474.71 477.06 B: (( it's really kind of sad )) 

474.93 481.93 A: so the object is to enjoy life while you got it no matter what reason someone someone or something takes you out for it if you 

480.90 484.19 B: well that's my motto i live life to the fullest 

483.51 484.92 A: yeah 

484.41 486.04 B: each and every day 

485.94 487.10 A: yes 

487.39 491.12 A: exactly even doing laundry late on a sunday night 

490.55 499.01 B: even doing laundry late on a sunday night for unexpected guests tomorrow [laughter] [laughter] 

494.52 496.17 A: oh very cool 

498.04 499.55 A: very cool 

499.30 501.54 B: unexpected guests from new york 

501.57 502.37 B: so 

501.89 502.78 A: (( ah )) 

502.47 504.08 B: laundry [laughter] 

503.71 505.19 A: oh very cool 

505.37 507.39 B: well it's it's interesting 

507.90 514.39 B: [laughter] and i'm sure he's not worried about bioterrorism either [laughter] 

508.83 509.81 A: yeah 

511.89 512.86 A: no 

513.12 518.46 A: have him sign up for an interesting proj- interesting topic on accents and see what he gets 

518.69 525.53 B: oh gosh i do i do have him signed up for this so hopefully he will um participate 'cause it's been very interesting [laughter] 

524.46 528.98 A: yeah i've been finding it too just the idea of sticking to one topic has been kinda hard 

529.02 534.19 B: it is hard to stick to bioterrorism [laughter] because unless you really have an interest in it 

530.98 532.15 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

533.55 539.09 A: yeah no kidding it's like okay it's bad and people die from it all right next topic 

535.53 537.76 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

538.86 540.48 B: and we are afraid 

540.02 542.34 A: yes [laughter] it's like 

541.70 546.71 B: [laughter] and north korea is probably the next one to use it [laughter] 

543.75 547.26 A: yeah there we go it's it's not a good thing 

547.06 548.61 B: it's not a good thing 

548.42 550.39 A: viruses are not our friends 

550.45 560.12 B: [laughter] oh gosh well let's just hope um as i said some young high school student is uh 

561.33 568.93 A: well the other thing that is hopeful though is that for every genius that's out there thinking of bad there's geniuses out there working on healing things so 

561.97 563.00 B: busy 

569.03 570.29 B: thank goodness [noise] [noise] 

569.78 578.42 A: yeah and another thing although it's a a very it's like a silver lining in a very very dark cloud but because of h._i._v. 

578.55 582.60 A: um we've been doing so much research on the human immune system 

582.51 583.86 B: mhm 

583.78 588.87 A: and i think we're miles ahead of where we would have been if [sigh] we hadn't had that retched disease 

589.70 590.60 B: true 

590.79 591.61 B: (( true oh )) 

591.45 596.66 A: and a lot of really motivated people are in the field whereas before it was like i wanna be a plastic surgeon 

597.99 599.89 A: and now at least we've got good minds
