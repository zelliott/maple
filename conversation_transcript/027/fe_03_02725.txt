0.66 2.90 A: hi my name is janet 

2.50 4.30 B: my name is sophie 

4.34 5.69 A: hi how are you 

5.31 6.79 B: okay how are you 

6.38 7.62 A: okay 

8.14 10.84 A: so why what was the topic um 

10.57 14.63 B: what do you think the united states can do to prevent bioterrorism 

14.04 15.22 A: (( bioterrorism )) 

16.82 18.05 A: um 

18.95 28.44 B: i th- i think one thing that we could and it's more a long term but it's to try to um understand more about other cultures 

28.62 32.02 B: and to um do more 

32.22 35.20 B: um to to reduce the 

35.25 43.27 B: sense of inequity and uh frustration that they have with us the- they'd be fewer people who were interested in committing bioterrorism 

42.87 43.80 A: right 

44.15 45.11 A: right 

46.07 49.35 A: i i guess i think more um 

50.69 53.85 A: in the immediate sense that 

54.18 55.78 A: that they should just 

56.04 59.40 A: instead of putting so much money into 

59.96 64.31 A: the war and fighting that we should have more security 

64.47 66.32 A: just more um 

67.07 71.09 A: [mn] at the airports and and packages and all that and 

71.11 73.53 A: more security as far as 

73.66 78.13 A: what they're doing in laboratories in our country and 

78.75 80.00 A: and just 

80.41 83.61 A: right now find out more of what's going on 

83.94 86.16 A: in our on our own soil 

85.70 86.76 B: mhm 

86.82 88.22 A: that um 

88.97 92.43 A: can prevent people that are already here and are working on 

93.17 95.15 A: on things and um 

96.00 99.34 A: i just think that's a very vulnerable feeling to to 

99.73 104.84 A: to say the statistics that there isn't you know so many that are already living here and 

104.91 107.61 A: working on these things and we don't even know it 

107.26 108.22 B: right 

108.55 112.41 B: um sin- maybe i mean i think there's um 

113.68 118.66 B: there's more equipment that could be purchased wh- that's sensitivity to that 

118.81 119.77 B: (( to )) 

119.21 120.24 A: right 

120.12 121.92 B: the some of the 

121.98 130.01 B: chemicals that are most likely to be used um and that uh that the post offices and 

122.36 123.44 A: chemicals 

124.65 125.69 A: right 

129.55 130.81 A: exactly 

130.07 131.39 B: (( um [mn] )) 

131.50 137.53 B: should should definitely be equipped with them and uh i think subways are definitely um 

137.66 150.24 B: you know frequently mentioned as a target and that's an area where i really don't mind having um you know the cameras like you know every three feet if necessary i mean so you really see if 

148.68 150.06 A: right 

150.81 152.46 B: (( somebody uh )) 

152.66 158.92 B: acting suspiciously or leaving something behind and and uh you know they could close off the area 

158.66 159.65 A: right 

159.08 161.02 B: you know almost immediately 

161.00 163.44 A: (( well that's the thing i you know i think people )) 

163.96 174.79 A: since nine eleven [noise] they just are more acceptable to more security and i i know we had gone on a trip a couple of weeks after that happened and um 

175.71 187.44 A: you know we had no problem with them going through our stuff and you know taking off our shoes and you know all they did where you know before that i'm sure people would be much more upset about it but 

180.95 182.36 B: mhm 

186.69 187.68 B: right 

187.86 193.91 A: it made us much more secure getting on that plane knowing that it was really everyone was 

193.94 197.73 A: really thoroughly checked and um 

198.10 200.11 A: even when we went to disneyworld 

200.18 207.39 A: and uh at disneyworld they went through camera cases video cases pocketbooks everything 

207.65 211.54 A: um every time we went into a park and 

211.97 218.20 A: but people weren't upset about it at all it just made 'em feel more more secure and more safe and 

214.25 214.94 B: [mn] 

218.29 219.56 A: you know 

220.16 227.54 A: after what happened everyone's just willing to accept that much more and to be more cameras and to be watched over more 

223.30 224.21 B: right 

227.75 237.28 B: although from what i've read um a lot of the security measures are kind of cosmetic to make people feel more secure 

237.17 237.88 A: (( oh )) 

237.24 244.65 B: but if you you know if you had a canister of sarin or something i mean you could have that disguised as a roll of film 

241.37 242.47 A: mhm 

244.27 245.18 A: right 

244.94 247.54 B: and um and so all that 

248.02 250.44 B: all the searching of all those people 

248.25 249.56 A: (( right )) 

249.88 252.37 A: that's true that's right 

250.51 252.76 B: doesn't really um 

253.28 254.35 A: that's true 

253.84 259.81 B: doesn't you know isn't gonna really handle that um 

257.28 258.75 A: right 

259.83 266.93 B: i actually uh saw something the other day on the science channel and they were talking about the um 

266.91 275.90 B: being able to tell by your brainwaves um like within twenty seconds or something if you are lying or not because 

270.46 271.18 A: (( hm )) 

275.89 283.72 B: you you emit different levels of uh brainwave activity depending on whether something's familiar to you or not 

283.23 284.19 A: oh 

283.91 295.36 B: so it seems to me like you know instead of like searching people's stuff and not necessarily getting what they have because maybe it's not metal or it's you know in a kodak 

291.17 292.09 A: right 

292.90 294.01 A: right 

295.01 295.95 A: right 

295.34 301.32 B: thing that you would ask them you know these questions and and their 

298.08 299.31 A: right 

302.42 309.64 B: their brainwaves would give 'em away and they'd even really need to invest more in that kind of technology and research 

304.09 304.87 A: (( [cough] )) 

308.07 309.24 A: that's true 

309.55 310.58 A: right 

309.84 318.62 B: because you know as soon as you as soon as you block off an avenue i mean criminals tend to you know very adeptly 

315.83 316.96 A: mhm 

318.52 319.47 A: right 

318.68 322.80 B: um change their tactics to circumvent the system 

322.36 323.53 A: exactly 

322.87 333.54 B: and um they believe at this point that you know only the most you know pathological of liars would be able to to um 

330.59 331.56 A: mhm 

334.36 335.38 B: to 

335.09 337.46 A: get past that yeah 

335.41 347.09 B: get around that because if you recognized the topic or the question or whatever it's if you have knowledge about it it's it's going to register differently than somebody who doesn't 

340.36 341.39 A: mhm 

346.30 358.07 A: right right i mean they could come up with something that could definitely tell that i mean um you know like the whole lie detector thing doesn't work 

347.74 348.73 B: (( i don't know )) 

354.83 356.04 B: (( mhm )) 

356.76 358.67 B: right that's not very 

358.33 360.90 A: it's not effective because of um 

359.34 360.35 B: right 

361.29 362.85 A: a lot of people can 

363.12 367.36 A: get around that but you know if they could come up with a system 

363.82 364.74 B: right 

367.44 369.56 A: like that you know um 

370.10 371.92 A: that that would make sense 

371.96 374.17 A: it's like i i heard the um 

375.52 378.31 A: um they were in um 

379.73 384.18 A: for the sars thing that at the airports 

381.25 382.39 B: mhm 

384.37 385.80 A: (( in um )) 

385.98 387.12 A: china 

387.60 395.56 A: they had an x-ray machine not an x-ray but it was some kind of machine that um could see be- people's body temperature 

395.33 396.46 B: oh wow 

396.12 404.66 A: and that when people went through it if their body temperature was red which meant they had a fever or something 

404.73 408.37 A: they stopped them and and made them get checked by a nurse 

408.51 410.57 A: um before letting them 

410.76 412.21 A: out of the country 

411.44 413.17 B: mhm that's great 

412.61 423.65 A: because they were trying to prevent any kind of you know and that was like that's amazing you know that they thought of something like that you know that they just walked by this thing and they could tell their uh 

419.02 420.14 B: right 

420.50 422.53 B: and implemented it 

423.83 428.37 A: body temperature but you know you think with all that technology um 

424.44 425.56 B: right 

428.89 432.93 A: there would be something that we could could do to um 

433.14 438.02 A: be safer with with the chemical threats and 

438.48 439.47 A: that's 

439.57 445.32 A: you know that's you know when they talk about it's as easy as um putting something in our water and um 

443.50 445.92 B: [noise] [noise] 

446.20 447.81 A: (( hold on a second )) 

447.42 448.24 B: (( [laughter] )) 

448.00 448.90 A: um 

449.90 452.58 A: you know that's frightening that they'd 

452.60 455.10 A: take they have we're that vulnerable 

455.48 459.42 B: right now apparently the person that they that they 

460.09 462.25 B: uh most um 

462.64 467.03 B: uh seriously suspect in the anthrax thing 

465.74 466.85 A: (( mhm )) 

467.31 474.50 B: he had a government clearance which was based on saying that he i think had been a fellow at 

474.55 482.78 B: i don't know some n._i._h. program or something and it turned out that wasn't true but that nobody checked that because 

476.95 478.18 A: right 

482.13 483.11 A: (( oh )) 

482.88 488.66 B: because i guess partly 'cause it's so easy to verify you know who would like about it 

487.64 489.21 A: (( [mn] exactly )) 

488.63 499.34 B: and then also the sense that well if you're good enough for the n._i._h. or you're good enough for i really don't remember which organization it was then then you're good enough for us 

496.34 497.23 A: right 

498.79 500.19 A: right 

499.32 503.64 B: and um and so you know he i mean obviously 

503.68 506.50 B: somebody who who's lying about their 

506.62 511.34 B: background from day one is um is somewhat suspect 

507.57 508.53 A: right 

511.02 516.77 A: i had never heard any more i mean i heard when they were sus- suspect- suspecting him but i hadn't heard more 

516.88 525.31 A: about that that you know really hasn't you know i still always wondered if it was just someone in our country doing it 

524.91 528.29 B: it it i mean if they think so yeah 

527.01 530.87 A: yeah that it it wasn't even something to do 

529.56 533.53 B: it was one our scientists to yeah so 

531.33 533.12 A: yeah 

533.57 537.64 B: and apparently the the drugs i mean the drugs the um 

538.51 539.45 B: the 

539.52 550.37 B: anthrax that was used you know almost has like a fingerprint and um and a lot of those strains i think of smallpox and stuff do also and so being able to 

540.78 541.77 A: mhm 

543.18 544.01 A: (( ah [cough] )) 

548.84 549.63 A: (( mm )) 

551.09 563.80 B: to track things as they're sent to other labs and whatever is also really important because apparently i i hope it's changed now but apparently like if you wrote and said you were a scientist studying x._y._z. 

563.41 564.38 A: mhm 

563.73 566.55 B: it was relatively easy for you to get 

566.57 571.07 B: um samples [noise] sent and um 

568.04 570.21 A: ah my goodness really 

571.76 580.45 B: so i think uh you know really massive penalties for for any kind of manipulation of the system also 

577.55 578.50 A: right 

580.03 581.05 A: right 

581.08 584.77 A: well there was the peop- you know the people making jokes and sending other people 

585.04 586.88 A: you know letters with uh 

587.64 594.06 A: powder in it and you know i heard about them being arrested or whatever you never heard more about it but 

591.54 592.69 B: mhm 

594.24 596.42 A: yeah you know in this time 

596.96 599.66 A: in this age we can't take anything
