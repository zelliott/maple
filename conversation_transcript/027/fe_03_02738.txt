0.05 1.64 A: hi i'm alison 

1.14 3.50 B: hi my name's melissa 

3.24 4.40 A: hey melissa 

4.09 5.18 B: hi 

4.94 8.51 A: okay so we're supposed to talk about what the [laughter] u._s. can do to 

8.66 12.24 A: to deter bioterrorism or prevent bioterrorism 

11.94 14.16 B: right um 

13.32 15.97 A: do do you know anything about the topic at all 

16.26 17.96 B: well i kinda 

18.01 21.18 B: the first thing that came to my mind was the whole chemical 

22.24 28.24 B: terrorism that saddam you know supposedly he had all those chemical weapons 

28.05 29.06 A: right 

28.44 34.16 B: so that's the first thing that popped into my head but i'm not quite sure if that's really bioterrorism mhm 

34.21 35.46 A: (( uh i )) 

35.69 46.03 A: well i think that part part of the aspect of i think you're right there might a difference between chemical weapons and bioterrorism but i think i think what they're worried about is they had something called blistering agents 

46.14 50.54 A: uh and then you know they had anthrax of course and then they had 

49.86 50.70 B: right 

50.51 63.74 A: uh i th- some some derivative of smallpox or something that could kill everybody or or whatever that situation is but um well we invaded a country they were looking for 'em and i'm not sure they actually found any do you know 

57.12 58.13 B: right 

63.73 73.28 B: no i well if you're talking about the chemical um in iraq no they never found any so whether or not they just haven't found it yet or if they've already destroyed but 

73.44 76.32 B: i think the u._s. needs to 

76.44 80.48 B: be really proactive obviously because it can be quite deadly 

81.52 82.74 B: to us 

82.70 97.26 A: [mn] yeah the risks are very high i i guess the question is what what can one do short of invading every country you suspect of having because uh they may or may not find them in iraq i mean i think i think our government did the you know 

97.28 104.22 A: had the best intelligence they could considering the circumstances and i think they did what was right personally but but 

102.33 103.15 B: right 

104.19 113.31 A: the fact of the matter is they may go in there and they may they may not find any and then it's almost like you invaded the country for this [laughter] so um 

111.23 112.37 B: right 

113.78 118.62 A: i i you know i i really don't know i'm i'm wondering if more intelligence is probably 

118.51 129.81 A: um the key here to to make sure that if you know the koreans or these weirdos kadaffi or people around in these other countries have have it i i you know 

125.49 126.59 B: (( [noise] [laughter] yeah )) 

130.12 132.31 A: they just need to be sure they have it 

132.01 138.22 B: right and the one thing like uh that happened after nine eleven and even with this whole 

138.37 147.11 B: iraq thing is you know we i feel that the u._s. have good um intelligence but whether or not all the 

148.12 155.86 B: departments kinda work together they don't really communicate together and i know we created this homeland security thing but yet is it 

154.86 156.34 A: is it really working 

155.85 159.11 B: yeah like it's another department yet 

158.96 164.59 B: supposedly to be in the middle but they're still not communicating like one thing from nine eleven 

164.43 178.48 B: the f._b._i. was saying they had pictures of the terrorists but they couldn't even because their offices were shut down at the world trade center and they were set up at satellite offices they couldn't even email these pictures out to people i mean 

177.76 178.93 A: oh great 

178.67 189.37 B: like just things like that like okay can we like focus on maybe bettering out departments that we now to service you know whether it's the c._i._a. f._b._i. or local 

189.81 191.82 B: police force you know 

192.06 193.42 B: i don't know like 

193.79 199.58 B: i think intelligence is obviously our biggest key but the u._s. can most definitely 

199.69 203.83 B: instead of taking that money and creating yet another department maybe 

204.26 205.68 B: bettering the 

205.39 208.30 A: the intelligence well they certain are short 

206.34 214.65 B: yeah like the communication you know or you know you're gonna have to think disaster okay if this office shuts down 

208.82 209.82 A: yeah 

214.69 219.81 B: how else are we going to use our technology to communicate [laughter] [laughter] 

219.12 222.04 A: we- well it's it's hard for me to believe that you know the thing is 

222.47 225.08 A: with all that stuff but you know 

224.94 237.80 A: even the corporation i work for has like a back up system [laughter] you know we back it up every night in a remote location and one would think [laughter] you know the f._b._i. would be able to like get their hands on it but you know for some reasons they weren't 

230.04 230.83 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

237.69 244.66 A: um i mean the oth- one thing is intelligence the other the other thing is i'm wondering how how helpful it would be to have um 

244.97 246.07 A: like a 

246.20 247.22 A: something 

247.27 261.52 A: other than the united nations [laughter] help out i mean you know since we're a world congress i mean the problem is every all these different countries including the small ones that have a lot of radical you know fundamentalism or whatever they uh 

261.51 263.99 A: they have their own agendas and so 

264.46 273.88 A: wh- i would think even if you had a world congress that it's still not gonna make any of these guys either particularly take heed of it i i'm not really sure other than 

273.77 287.22 A: intelligence and [laughter] invading other countries i i don't i i really can't think of anything that could help the bioterrorism i mean the the war pressure i'm not sure how much that really helps i mean what what are your thoughts on that 

285.51 286.47 B: yeah 

286.88 291.90 B: well i don't have a whole lot of confidence in the u._n. you know especially after 

290.98 292.98 A: well i don't think anybody does at this point 

292.33 299.42 B: but right with iraq uh one of the things we can take be is you know set stronger guidelines and be a 

299.35 308.69 B: little bit more adamant about it and you know granted we had all these policies set in place with iraq saying you can't build this stuff yada yada but we were not 

309.40 314.70 B: we never checked up on them until all of a sudden you know like for years we kept saying 

312.51 313.36 A: right 

315.17 322.79 B: he's a dangerous man and we never did anything but you know when countries come to us needing help and money or whatever you know that's when 

322.94 325.53 B: we kinda have 'em by the you know 

325.26 326.27 A: (( that's right )) 

326.01 331.39 B: [laughter] yeah and you know okay if you want this we're gonna set these rules and you've got to 

331.34 342.23 B: commit to you know us periodically checking your stuff or whatever and not let a situation get to many many years down the road and you know 

342.73 344.24 A: yeah the the problem 

343.31 346.06 B: chemicals could come about or yeah 

345.69 351.90 A: i mean the problem is you had to there's a hard balance because them people are saying well you know in some countries 

352.33 362.16 A: like i'll give you an example like maybe turkey turkey thinks turkey may have some they probably don't but say they they think well we need to have it 'cause we need to protect ourselves against 

362.33 365.44 A: iraq or we need to protect ourselves against you know 

365.35 377.61 A: well not greece but you know one of the yugoslavian states and and tho- they're you know they're going to be angry at the at the united states saying hey we're unilaterally going to check this because we're worried you're gonna use these bio- 

377.86 392.70 A: you know these biochemicals against us and here they're saying well look if we don't have these weapons at our disposal against at least as a deterrent against these other countries then you're really taking away you know a lot of our it's a it's a hard balance 

392.10 403.63 B: yeah right i mean well i think like with iraq and other countries we've said you can have cert- so- x amount but no more than x amount and it can't slot you know you're 

399.54 400.75 A: a limited one 

400.81 401.60 A: right 

403.68 412.20 B: bomb can't fly all the way to reach us type of thing so i mean they're short term uh you know but you know bioterrorism is more 

408.17 409.07 A: right 

412.56 422.89 B: dangerous that could harm anybody you know and at the end of the day which country is the largest to be able to help any of these other little countries if they're ever in need 

414.87 415.86 A: right 

423.00 427.08 B: chances are we probably will help them you know so 

425.79 427.34 A: right right 

427.30 431.52 B: i mean i think first of all we need to protect ourselves and 

431.03 432.09 A: well sure 

432.02 434.19 B: i don't know i'm just like right 

432.46 446.61 A: well you know one one of the things i thought was interesting was when they you know remember when they uh had all the terrorists running around right after nine eleven you know the other countries did pitch in and help like spain but you know spain ran down some of the terrorists and so did germany and so and france when 

446.76 449.63 A: before they became the way they were and 

449.82 456.88 A: you know that kind of cooperation really really helped a lot and that that was sort of like uh another kind of coalition that 

457.12 469.33 A: you know didn't have anything didn't have the u._n. deal to deal with and that kinda i think that could probably help a lot now the problem is you know you've got the shifting the fans you've got the french who flake out at times and but that that 

468.64 473.00 B: but now they want a piece of the action in rebuilding iraq 

470.79 480.68 A: oh yeah i loved how that works yeah they they they they said they weren't going to help and everyone painted themselves in a diplomatic corner and then 

473.23 475.14 B: (( [laughter] you know )) 

480.15 493.44 B: i mean everyone kept saying we were doomed for failure with iraq like this will never happen yada yada um and look at you know the success that we've had with iraq and look how happy those people are that 

493.64 497.40 B: you know we've given them freedom and the chance to talk um 

496.74 498.80 A: right right right 

497.94 501.53 B: so it's just kinda like maybe this is will also 

502.19 505.36 B: build back some of the credit that you know 

505.80 507.96 B: the respect that these people will have 

506.01 514.73 A: well i think franc- i think france has so shot themselves in the foot i and you know they they think that they're gonna try and repair the damage with the u._s. [laughter] 

509.69 510.72 B: [laughter] 

514.63 525.95 A: i'm not necessarily so sure it's gonna happen but they the uh you know so i i'm wondering i'm wondering if enough people can you know enough nations can work together like they did the terrorism that 

525.78 526.74 A: they can 

526.53 541.31 A: put pressure on others or they can find out maybe maybe they can have an international outlaw of these weapons point blank and then just have all the other nations work together to enforce it i'm not so sure i mean it's not like i'm not again suggesting the u._n. which we know is completely useless but 

541.29 544.61 A: uh you know some other type of coalition of that nature 

544.24 546.15 B: (( right and the other thing is is )) 

546.18 557.01 B: if another anthrax type thing goes around i mean we need to come up with a better way to just shut systems down you know like when you know nine eleven when they took over the airplane 

557.39 562.29 B: eventually we got to the point where we shut down all the flights and all the airports uh i 

562.39 565.45 B: mean maybe we need to figure out a way to ha- 

565.65 569.67 B: okay if this is a topic how do we protect ourselves like how do we 

568.86 579.05 A: yeah instead of all the postal workers getting killed off i mean that's that's that's basically you know i think there's a couple of workers and i think it came out in the senate buildings a little bit but the people mostly got 

571.47 572.67 B: yeah 

577.81 584.88 B: right right i mean are there filters we can put in place or or i don't know i mean i'm sure it's going to be extremely costly [laughter] the 

580.70 582.28 A: right 

584.91 588.40 B: prices will go up who knows but [laughter] uh 

584.92 586.10 A: well 

587.52 593.66 A: well we- y- you know they had that that equipment that you know that can sniff out bombs essentially you know how used to they had to 

593.87 599.95 A: physically search your luggage and now they've got you know bomb sniffing dogs and [laughter] you know 

595.56 596.55 B: yeah
