122.77 127.56 B: and then eleven years ago i moved here and what struck me as extremely amusing 

127.72 131.85 B: only because i don't have that experience of the that the tennesseans do 

131.91 141.16 B: the minute they think there's going to be snow and it n- never really snows here to any degree i mean a half an inch throws the population into a tizzy

206.50 217.50 B: [lipsmack] are you are you and he and the rest of your family frightened about uh whatever the illness was that struck uh um so many of our servicemen during the gulf war [lipsmack] 

218.50 220.35 B: you know they came home and they 

219.55 220.37 A: right 

220.44 225.25 B: they can't eat they can't sleep 'cause they're suffering from nightmares anyway if they saw action 

224.84 225.90 A: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

225.28 232.10 B: but i mean do you think that that might have been a chemical reaction do you think that chemicals were released into the air 

231.44 237.47 A: [noise] i really do 'cause if i remember right when he went over there i'm trying to get my dates straight 

237.54 240.88 A: um while we we went into germany first 

240.61 242.92 B: what what years are you talking about now 

242.24 244.93 A: um he went in at eighty 

246.64 251.47 A: [noise] i wanna say eight nine ninety something like that 

249.86 252.95 B: [lipsmack] so it was just prior to the gulf war then 

252.62 253.59 A: right 

253.01 254.32 B: yeah okay go on 

253.86 255.88 A: no no this was the gulf war 

255.42 257.77 B: oh so we went to germany first 

257.17 264.94 A: yes we were we were stationed in germany and they decided to pull troops from germany to go over to the gulf war 

259.24 260.18 B: oh 

263.96 265.02 B: okay 

265.20 266.51 A: and um 

266.98 272.29 A: [noise] we had a very difficult time we lost children um 

272.65 275.10 A: [noise] my daughter in law was trying to have children 

275.54 281.77 A: and um [noise] she was pregnant twice over there [noise] after he came back from desert storm 

280.13 280.81 B: (( [lipsmack] [noise] )) 

281.07 282.56 B: (( [cough] okay mm )) 

282.20 285.48 A: [noise] one child died in the womb at five months 

285.76 290.29 A: [noise] it was called a missed abortion [noise] no signs of [noise] you know 

290.69 300.27 A: you know normally cramping or something to let you know [noise] you're hav- you're losing the child the child just died in the womb [noise] [noise] and they had that um [noise] take that child [noise] 

294.21 297.14 B: yeah right right oh 

298.05 302.48 B: oh at five months that's unusual in itself i would think 

301.80 309.18 A: i know a a five month old baby just died and the only way they knew the baby was dead was because there was no growth 

303.89 304.85 B: yeah 

309.14 318.33 A: [noise] and um and they kept saying we don't feel any movement [noise] and the government said well it's a smaller baby right now it's only five months old not much to it 

318.38 323.10 A: [noise] and they did an ultra sound and found out that the [noise] heartbeat had stopped [noise] there was no heartbeat 

321.62 333.89 B: that's ordinary that's the question he could have found out about the heartbeat you know so you think that maybe your son was exposed to chemicals which which gave him sperm 

324.86 325.79 A: mhm 

328.86 330.26 A: oh oh we know 

330.96 331.70 A: (( yeah ))

336.10 340.62 A: right after that they tried again [noise] and she went to seven months 

340.73 343.80 A: with a baby [noise] still over there right [noise] 

342.13 342.92 B: (( how )) 

343.06 344.71 B: how horrifying 

344.27 348.94 A: um they had to do an emergency c section through the german government 

349.06 351.22 A: and the baby lived thirteen days 

350.65 354.03 B: mm mm [lipsmack] oh you've had a lot of heartbreak in your family 

353.51 357.69 A: so and right now he suffers with memory loss 

357.68 358.72 B: uh-huh 

358.02 360.71 A: he has sores all over his head 

360.22 361.71 B: spores

363.00 366.30 A: mhm all over his head um nothi- 

365.29 369.87 B: [lipsmack] so we're talking back thirteen years cripes fourteen years 

367.60 369.64 A: uh-huh muscle weakness 

369.95 377.98 A: um joint pain he's had so many surgeries um since then all these joints [noise] he's falling apart literally [noise] 

373.15 373.99 B: yeah 

377.40 379.80 B: [lipsmack] how old a boy's man is he 

379.38 381.32 A: [noise] he's fifty now [noise] 

380.93 385.06 B: oh god what horrors you've go- you guys go through 

381.38 382.59 A: (( oh [noise] )) 

384.71 385.46 A: i 

385.90 391.88 A: it i applaud them they served their country he just retired in ninety nine um and 

391.97 404.66 A: they wore all this chemical stuff [noise] uh we used we used to laugh about it when he would come home and tell us all the staff they had to dawn in [noise] and they've got pictures of it and [noise] and they showed us the camps they lived in and everything 

404.73 409.26 A: [noise] and he slowed down so much just at the age of fifty [noise] [noise] 

408.83 411.60 B: so much for preventive measures right 

410.65 412.61 A: (( mhm um [noise] )) 

411.64 416.67 B: so so this topic today really is very dear to your heart very close to your heart 

414.66 419.43 A: [noise] it is because there's nothing we can do to prevent it [noise] [noise] 

418.65 427.35 B: [lipsmack] that's why you leaped in immediately with my first remark about it with um you know resounding your right type of response from you 

426.68 432.89 A: mhm yeah it there's nothing you can do there's always someone out there that has evil in them 

428.95 429.51 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

431.90 434.03 B: intentions yeah [sigh] 

433.26 434.77 A: and they will do it 

434.27 438.74 B: [lipsmack] you know a- another thought that comes to mind now is [lipsmack] 

439.02 445.01 B: what do we not know that the government has been hiding from the civilian population 

444.64 446.27 A: there's a lot there's 

445.52 457.00 B: and many you know i pers- i'm seventy seven years old and i really believe in u._f._o.s and and the possibility of aliens and the crop circles which give me 

448.60 449.42 A: uh-huh 

454.23 455.20 A: (( right )) 

456.17 456.96 A: (( right )) 

457.05 463.22 B: when i see programmes on crop circles i don't know something very emotional happens away deep inside 

461.18 469.79 A: happens thank you thank you i feel the same way there's a there's another universe out there that god created someone else i 

464.58 465.93 B: [lipsmack] yeah it's 

467.14 468.15 B: yeah 

469.05 476.30 B: but the crop circles and particularly i mean i had no idea what a what why i'm reacting the way i do maybe it's something

498.69 499.66 A: mhm 

503.45 504.56 B: i mean 

504.58 516.95 B: photograph after photograph and videos and videos and videos of crop circles that they are so beautiful and so mag- magical they are to me beyond beauty there's something very special 

506.28 507.32 A: mhm 

507.34 508.56 A: (( mhm yes )) 

514.40 517.80 A: it is it's be- it's beyond human development 

517.32 527.09 B: i mean you know i'm sure that there are some people who have done it but i'm sure that there are uh deep they're those crop circles are made by some 

520.98 522.56 A: (( [sigh] definitely )) 

523.34 524.16 A: (( okay )) 

527.15 529.95 B: intelligence that we just can't explain 

528.96 531.89 A: it's the perfection we just can't understand 

530.76 544.20 B: [lipsmack] i mean when especially when you them from on top i mean they are so mathematically precise that i don't care how many men walking with planks [laughter] you know and ropes you can't do that you just can't do that 

535.45 536.37 A: (( yeah )) 

538.05 540.66 A: [laughter]

548.63 563.44 A: you know before the twenty two my my son and his wife have been with the government for twenty seven years and it's been always hard during the holidays because they would they'd try to come in for christmas that was the only holiday they could spend with us [noise] 

563.58 575.14 A: or he was always deployed um [noise] and see my daughter in law's from georgia [noise] and we're from the d._c. area so it was always difficult but they always tried to make that effort to come to us 

574.63 579.54 B: yeah that's what i feel about special procedure the whole family was always together [laughter] 

578.84 580.80 A: yes yes i 

580.08 581.39 B: how old are you 

581.31 583.02 A: i'm sixty nine [noise]

587.39 588.30 A: i i 

589.21 590.68 A: (( do yeah and may- there ))

597.62 599.89 A: there there's something out of the house you're right 

598.13 599.89 B: believe that there's a whole thing going on
