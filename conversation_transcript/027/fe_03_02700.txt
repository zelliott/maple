20.04 22.55 B: oh i would say it's probably um 

22.46 35.50 B: christmas or thanksgiving and that's just because it tends to be one of those holidays where you get everybody home and get everybody back together and get to see people you haven't seen in quite a while so what about you 

33.04 33.81 A: yeah 

35.49 36.31 A: (( oh )) 

36.62 38.15 A: [lipsmack] probably christmas 

38.50 40.19 A: it's because um 

40.56 50.26 A: i really like the lights just all of the uh that like everybody's life is it's well sometimes they're rude in their stories but they try to be nice [laughter] 

50.05 52.27 B: [laughter] 

53.31 57.63 A: but yeah christmas it's a really a nice holiday 

58.96 63.20 A: but i don't know what i would what kind of holiday would you create if you 

64.13 65.40 B: um 

64.26 67.10 A: (( could )) 

67.28 71.89 B: i don't know i mean i guess i can kind of start to think of just kind of 

74.75 77.91 B: like a couple of times of the year uh where 

79.26 80.81 B: maybe it would be nice if 

80.91 83.88 B: we had another holiday or two i mean 

83.19 84.83 A: yeah 

84.02 85.92 B: maybe we need i 

87.64 93.80 B: don't know maybe we need one in june i mean it doesn't seem like we have a whole lot in june um 

91.20 92.54 A: (( [laughter] [cough] )) 

93.71 95.17 A: that's true huh 

96.15 97.81 A: except father's day huh 

97.86 100.86 B: yeah w- we have father's day but uh i 

102.20 104.12 A: (( that's right )) 

104.61 111.44 A: but i don't know do they like people do people take that off of work or is that just another workday i can't remember 

110.84 115.44 B: think that's just another workday i think that's actually a hallmark uh 

115.47 122.22 B: a hallmark holiday it's kind of one of those things that i think that they just made up so that they could sell a bunch of uh 

122.09 123.34 A: (( [laughter] )) 

122.23 125.24 B: greeting cards and stuff like that 

125.50 127.72 A: that's funny yeah 

128.74 129.97 A: yeah 

130.34 131.30 A: um 

132.06 137.04 A: if i were to create a holiday i would create a holiday that lasts for fo- 

137.20 139.21 A: for a whole month [laughter] 

139.65 141.60 B: that lasts for how would 

141.04 146.35 A: it would last for a month and your employers would have to pay you the whole month [laughter] 

145.96 147.90 B: (( that would be nice [laughter] )) 

147.00 148.58 A: [laughter] 

149.09 151.56 B: yeah i guess they think that's that's part of 

149.68 150.24 A: (( [mn] )) 

151.82 155.85 B: what's nice about holidays just the fact that i when i think of a holiday 

156.17 161.07 B: a major one i think of federal holiday not having to go to work 

160.52 164.60 A: yeah and it would become month off holiday [laughter] 

165.78 167.67 B: that would be a nice holiday 

166.86 168.13 A: [laughter] 

170.89 181.36 A: yeah and you would celebrate like eating something really special everyday [laughter] like something i don't know 

182.67 186.40 B: (( um let me think i'm just trying to think of )) 

186.70 188.50 B: i i'd never really thought of 

188.71 191.06 B: (( making up holidays before )) 

191.75 193.68 A: and i haven't either 

198.34 200.23 B: (( i suppose how you how do you )) 

199.23 201.82 A: maybe i like cats you know 

201.83 205.57 A: maybe like a celebrate cats day [laughter] 

205.46 208.69 B: (( that would be nice i suppose we could have like an ant and a hog day )) 

207.54 210.28 A: or a pet like pets in general a pet day 

210.82 214.47 A: you could take it off and spend it with your and walk your dog [laughter] i 

216.11 219.41 B: yeah they wouldn't mind that i don't think so 

216.23 217.03 A: (( wonder if )) 

220.13 222.05 B: (( that wouldn't be a bad idea )) 

222.03 223.57 A: do what 

222.92 231.59 B: i said that wouldn't be a bad idea i guess another another thing uh that we can't do and now i mean especially with uh 

224.71 225.76 A: it wouldn't 

232.08 235.12 B: (( the shape our world's been in the past )) 

235.88 239.07 B: nineteen months is just holidays to uh 

239.83 241.64 B: honor our servicemen 

241.99 243.81 A: yeah 

246.87 249.39 A: that's a good good one too 

250.62 254.15 B: i mean you may have eventually see them declare a 

252.77 255.24 A: what about vet- what about veteran's day 

256.58 260.76 B: that that's kind of one of those in the category uh where 

261.52 265.75 B: it's a holiday but i would like to see more places uh 

266.40 268.54 B: make a greater effort to 

268.98 271.86 B: observe their holidays actually uh 

272.00 276.41 B: give people um that day off of work because there's 

276.78 280.43 B: we've never had veterans' day off um we've never had uh 

280.29 281.99 A: yeah 

281.50 283.97 B: memorial day off and 

285.02 286.15 A: oh really 

287.76 288.80 B: yeah and my 

287.78 288.89 A: (( yeah that sort of )) 

289.70 290.96 B: well actual- 

292.58 297.57 B: i mean yeah we've we've gone to school um a lot i mean there's actually some state schools 

298.05 305.41 B: that i know of uh that actually have school on even labor day or start on labor day and i'm kind of like man that's 

304.79 306.18 A: oh really 

307.45 309.11 A: [cough] where do you live 

309.35 310.61 B: indiana 

310.68 311.90 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

312.88 318.35 A: oh we never started school on labor day i could tell you that but it's always off [laughter] 

319.34 324.74 A: huh maybe indiana needs to get get some more uh 

325.32 326.93 A: (( more holidays huh )) 

327.52 329.60 A: (( i mean to have some more things off )) 

336.26 337.38 A: what do you think 

339.17 342.73 B: i think that wouldn't be a bad idea but i think part of what 

342.72 344.98 B: people think for holidays is 

344.94 359.51 B: mostly time and just kind of a oh well um this is great um i get today off i don't have to go to work and that they really don't think about what they're suppose to symbolize in um most situations so 

360.09 361.72 A: yeah 

362.32 367.82 B: i mean i don't think they want veterans' day or memorial day off so they can go and uh 

368.75 369.64 A: [laughter] 

368.90 373.30 B: commemorate somebody that's just kind of well i don't have to go to work 

370.95 371.51 A: (( [cough] )) 

372.70 374.94 A: oh yeah that's true 

377.85 380.06 A: [lipsmack] wonder if they should have like 

380.92 386.56 A: they make september eleventh like a a holiday like a memorial day to remember 

387.72 389.63 A: but they don't do that 

390.05 393.54 B: well it's kind of one of those things that isn't really for a 

394.06 401.37 B: it's still relatively recent too so that could be something that they eventually do decide to do that's probably 

400.61 401.27 A: (( so )) 

401.40 412.37 B: not a bad idea but then part of what trying to do with that is just that it's so close to labor day uh and a and a lot of situations but when you look at that i mean it's 

410.62 411.45 A: oh 

413.69 417.37 B: i don't know so it's kind of one of those things that 

414.74 415.30 A: (( [cough] )) 

418.06 421.35 B: i mean a lot of people set some time aside to 

421.53 433.74 B: think for i mean think of and uh and reflect of and obviously it was something that was very hard not to do since it was just a year ago but yeah i think that's a possibility 

431.55 432.33 A: yeah 

434.13 443.18 A: yeah because i know like a year after it happened nobody like hardly anybody just worked as usual and it felt kind of like it shouldn't be it's so mean [laughter] 

443.40 445.03 B: yeah exactly 

446.23 448.17 B: exactly i mean that's still so 

449.07 454.12 B: surreal so i don't know i mean that's not a bad idea i mean just a 

456.29 456.91 A: (( yeah )) 

456.44 457.91 B: kind of a 

458.67 461.79 B: i don't want to say commemoration but a 

461.43 463.30 A: like a memorial d- day 

463.02 465.61 B: exactly yeah exactly a 

465.63 467.74 B: memorial service day 

468.29 472.20 B: let's take a moment and pause and think about 

472.54 475.42 B: what happened on this day and uh 

476.54 478.20 B: these people and 

481.88 484.84 B: just the changes um that 

485.15 488.79 B: have occurred because of it because i think that's something [noise] that's 

489.53 492.02 B: important just that we make sure that 

494.80 497.62 B: we don't forget about that we don't let it fade 

499.40 502.47 B: so yeah i guess that would probably be my pick 

501.80 504.66 A: (( yeah )) 

502.86 505.53 B: (( probably my pick )) 

506.53 508.15 A: that would be your day 

508.64 511.51 B: i think so i think that would be my uh 

512.91 514.87 B: that would probably be my holiday 

515.11 517.00 A: that you would create 

516.98 523.72 B: yeah not not a happy one but i guess if you're going to put me on the spot of things that i can think of 

523.75 525.50 B: that's what i would come up with 

527.89 528.81 A: yeah 

530.60 535.05 A: but it makes you think about all the other things you could want to remember [laughter] 

535.16 538.05 A: well not want to remember but ought to remember [laughter] 

537.77 539.54 B: mhm 

539.70 543.86 A: but for especially for america that should be one 

550.33 552.09 A: i'm wondering if they should have 

552.28 555.75 A: like a remembering the victims of the holocaust day you know 

558.01 566.08 A: i've been watching a lot of public uh television shows late night about you know how when the germans invaded france and 

566.89 572.66 A: how some of the french people tried to hide the jews and just another one about how 

572.67 583.66 A: before they sent all the adults up to the concentration camp like some of the kids got sent to england in foster homes they called it kinder transport i never even knew about that 

584.49 588.21 B: yeah it's kind of creepy i mean but it's amazing how much uh 

588.45 592.00 B: more real and how it's more of an issue things are when uh 

592.35 595.63 B: when they're closer to home and that they're 

596.05 598.52 B: on our own turf so 

597.52 598.44 A: yeah
