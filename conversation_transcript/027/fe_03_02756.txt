22.03 23.19 A: yeah 

22.55 26.69 B: uh my son is very into ice hockey 

26.61 30.33 A: ice hockey so what's going on with the flyers is this like the playoffs 

29.71 42.97 B: oh yeah see we we stopped watching it we're in new york so we're islander fans [laughter] we have a cable network and we had to get the extra sports for when he didn't have tickets for the game so he could come over to watch it [laughter] 

33.32 35.48 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

42.26 44.22 A: well when are the last games 

43.90 47.43 B: um i think they're in the thing i think the devils are doing well aren't they 

47.14 52.90 A: i don't know anything about it i just know that a friend of mine is supposed to be at a meeting on wednesday and he wants to cancel it because there's a 

47.66 49.37 B: no yeah [laughter] 

52.95 54.57 A: seventh game 

53.97 58.33 B: oh okay so that sounds that that sounds like something my son would say he's twenty four 

58.37 63.84 B: he like i said but once the islanders were done i i kind of lost the whole thing for hockey 

63.57 65.16 A: [laughter] 

64.12 67.50 B: [laughter] my husband watches football 

67.21 70.48 A: yeah my dad watches football a lot and he plays golf 

70.94 76.78 A: i tried to play golf but it was a complete failure so i gave the clubs back to my dad and a free game somewhere 

76.22 77.33 B: (( [laughter] )) 

76.93 79.48 A: and then he didn't use it i was very hurt 

78.89 82.36 B: yeah i think i think golf is a little bit boring to watch on t._v. 

82.33 89.27 A: he watches it though and so does our other friend our other friend is a a owns a golf course and she watches it constantly 

83.48 85.42 B: yeah and he really enjoys it huh 

88.67 92.69 B: oh well i would imagine that that's really her forte then um 

93.07 94.32 B: so when you 

93.57 95.47 A: she's actually terrible though 

94.88 97.44 B: [laughter] what area of the country are you from 

97.29 99.02 A: i'm in philadelphia 

98.42 100.26 B: oh okay we're new york so 

99.91 101.35 A: new york great 

100.49 104.22 B: actually my son's favorite football team is uh the eagles 

104.55 105.51 A: really 

104.89 113.06 B: and he goes down for the eagles game he doesn't watch that one on t._v. when uh new york plays the eagles either the jets play or the giants i'm not even sure 

112.59 115.61 A: well we're getting a new stadium so it's pretty exciting 

115.05 116.72 B: oh that's good 

116.01 118.50 A: and uh everybody should have uh better seating 

118.80 123.54 B: and obviously then you don't follow baseball either 

123.36 128.08 A: uh a little i like baseball a little bit more even though i was lousy at it in high school 

128.56 139.14 B: [laughter] actually i played softball for a bank i worked with so i kinda could follow sports i grew up in a family where my father taught his daughters to fish bowl and appreciate baseball [laughter] 

138.42 142.07 A: oh fishing i liked a lot i used to fish a lot when i was a kid 

141.46 144.74 B: (( yeah no we do have some fishing shows is that considered a sport )) 

144.74 152.32 A: i guess so i mean there's uh i don't know if e._s._p._n. has it or not but there was like a whole hour on bass fishing on one channel i found 

150.91 157.50 B: yes that's what i it was on one of the cable stations i can't think uh it's not on regular t._v. broadcasts 

157.60 161.94 B: but there is a fishing show and then there was one where a guy was making flies 

161.68 163.50 A: [laughter] 

162.07 166.51 B: [laughter] i don't think i would go that far i i don't mind the worms but 

164.71 175.76 A: oh those people are real into it you know there's a real art to that and it's kinda neat if you go to one of these people's houses they have like a bench in the basement and they have all these little cubbyholes full of all kinds of feathers and things 

175.08 176.18 B: yeah 

175.65 179.89 A: and they really really go out of their way to make these things look really neat 

179.30 186.83 B: they always have those special magnifying glasses that they put on and and threading it looks as complicated as some needlepoint does 

182.16 184.04 A: all that stuff yeah 

186.39 189.22 A: really i've seen some flyers that were just amazing 

189.37 195.95 B: yeah well the fishing we do we have a boat ourselves we fish but we don't watch it on t._v. okay what other sports [laughter] 

195.53 206.02 A: well you know fishing is pretty dull actually unless you're actually there and you're you're enjoying the nature and everything but you'd think on television maybe it would be worse but it's not 'cause it's shorter 

205.51 208.70 B: yeah i think 'cause i think they edit a lot of it out 

207.94 209.84 A: they go straight to the fish 

209.23 210.43 B: right [laughter] 

210.56 222.60 A: so it's probably more interesting on television actually i saw one show where these guys were climbing out of the boat waist deep and then they would hold their breath and go under and they would yank out these uh catfish that were eight feet long 

221.95 223.41 B: wow 

222.99 227.36 A: with their ha- bare hands i forget what they call it there's a name for it 

224.26 226.48 B: that had to be someway down south right 

227.13 228.27 B: wow 

227.73 230.40 A: yeah it's like arkansas and places like that they do it 

230.11 231.82 B: (( yeah )) 

231.08 234.15 A: i can't remember what the name of it is but there's a word for it 

234.79 235.84 B: don't know 

235.73 239.28 A: yeah i saw that on television that was pretty amazing 

236.34 237.51 B: but uh 

240.08 241.02 B: yeah 

240.24 243.14 A: and then i guess you could eat for a week [laughter] 

241.69 245.22 B: [laughter] i would imagine as long as you liked it 

245.61 246.39 B: [laughter] 

245.86 255.54 A: i i think uh people that are interested in sports play sports or played sports i think people like me who were lousy at sports in high school do- tend not to watch it 

254.94 257.42 B: i i think you're probably right 

256.86 259.98 A: although i like road racing and i like horse racing a lot 

259.43 262.62 B: oh hor- hor- my sister works with horses 

262.28 265.44 A: ho- oh my d- uh step daughter has sixteen of 'em 

264.86 266.42 B: oh wow 

265.54 268.07 A: she's breeding them up here in fleetwood p._a. 

267.71 276.23 B: oh that my sister lives on an estate in mutton town that's like a you know real green big acre- acreage kind of place 

275.67 276.86 A: yeah 

276.27 290.42 B: on long island [sigh] and she rents the barn on the estate and then she rents out the stalls and she's qualified as a vet's assistant so uh but horse racing yeah now they have that they just show those little snippets of it though on the cable network 

281.35 282.65 A: oh that's great 

290.08 299.77 A: well when i'm home i watch the kentucky derby because it's like a whole history of each horse and they really get into it and it's like four hour broadcast but i missed it this year again 

292.20 292.96 B: oh 

297.13 298.62 B: yeah no i think that 

299.41 304.76 B: ah now that i know the winner was i can't think of the name but it was twelve to one long shot 

304.32 308.63 A: yeah it was it was like twenty four dollars for the place horse or something 

308.04 314.04 B: and i heard on the way home uh m- mayor bloomberg from new york city bet fifty dollars and won six hundred [laughter] 

313.13 315.07 A: [laughter] 

314.33 317.62 B: he's the first horse that came from new york [laughter] i think that won 

317.32 318.33 A: wow 

318.32 321.52 B: but the favorite one was emperor or something like that

341.18 343.29 A: [laughter]

411.54 414.74 B: i'm sure the architects uh architecture must be amazing 

415.07 429.35 A: oh it's beautiful it's uh unbelievable and what makes me happy is we spend a lot you know we have a board of directors and everything and we're a community center now and uh a little girl walked in the other day and i was up in the lobby and i i heard her say wow it's a real theater 

428.79 429.72 B: [laughter] 

429.51 436.26 A: and that made me feel good you know 'cause it has all that plaster and art deco stuff and it's just i can't describe it you have to see it 

435.65 442.42 B: i i can imagine because you know i know the theaters from new york city so out here we're a suburb of new york city um we're like forty minutes away 

442.06 444.29 A: well have you ever gone to the jersey lows 

443.77 444.90 B: yes 

445.20 450.82 B: okay but out here i was gonna say they like knocked down all the old theatres and they have these multiplexes

450.84 454.39 B: where there's thirteen screens fifteen screens 

453.87 455.61 A: yeah they have that here too 

455.29 460.96 B: you know some of the towns had nice old theaters but they they have no reverence for uh [laughter] 

460.32 463.30 A: that's right they knocked most of 'em down 

463.34 468.23 A: there's only one left in philadelphia and we're trying to save it now but they've got a demolition permit 

468.01 469.98 B: oh that's that's a shame 

469.64 476.74 A: nineteen twenty eight with a women's theme there's all these uh half naked women hanging uh holding up the pillars 

476.13 477.38 B: okay [laughter] 

476.95 480.38 A: they're like eight feet high [laughter] plaster women 

478.32 479.85 B: wow 

480.68 485.03 A: and they wanna knock it down and there's nobody gonna build anything like that ever again 

484.45 487.73 B: no no the day of that is g- long gone 

488.05 492.97 B: but it's probably not turning a profit and uh whoever owns it wants to see that bottom line 

492.61 498.88 A: well when you get old enough you've seen everything come and go and w- i've seen the vets stadium be built and now it's gonna be knocked down 

498.30 499.71 B: yeah 

499.04 500.93 A: so back to sports you know the 

500.34 503.21 B: uh-huh okay we're back to sports okay [laughter] 

502.07 508.15 A: veteran stadium is is a was a beautiful stadium but now it's falling apart and it's only twenty years old 

507.61 508.78 B: wow 

508.33 509.87 A: maybe thirty i guess 

510.03 514.21 A: but you know franklin field and some of our other stadiums lasted almost forever 

513.94 515.15 B: yeah yeah 

514.41 516.99 A: the older stadiums were built better i think 

516.27 519.57 B: yeah 'cause yankee stadium is still going strong here 

519.03 520.18 A: there you go 

520.01 528.19 B: i i went there as a kid we used to live in the bronx and uh but i mean it's still there now not in a great neighborhood but they still maintain it 

527.89 531.06 A: [noise] yeah they still have the stockyard down in baltimore too 

531.12 532.02 B: okay 

531.74 534.67 A: or whatever it's called the yeah it's the stockyard i think 

534.31 536.35 B: and then we have shay stadium 

536.25 537.48 A: shay yeah 

536.79 544.51 B: but then the new york jets moved to new jersey so they could be in that stadium [laughter] i don't understand why they're still called the new york jets though 

540.62 541.90 A: yeah 

544.87 546.30 A: well i guess 

545.37 547.27 B: but they play in new jersey

551.50 552.64 B: (( okay [laughter] ))

559.92 561.57 B: just to show valley forge 

561.04 569.37 A: yeah the actual national office is twenty miles down the road but they send a truck up every day to pick up the mail in in valley forge 

569.15 570.45 B: (( wow [noise] )) 

569.64 574.90 A: because they wanna be everybody to relate to george washington and the founding fathers and 

573.90 575.28 B: fathers and yeah 

575.37 577.99 B: the whole connotation to valley forge wow
