419.87 422.78 A: (( so i said let me check it out let me see what it's all about and i'd be interested in it )) 

422.31 423.45 B: [noise] 

423.63 424.79 A: (( so that's how didn't )) 

424.02 428.98 B: i didn't realize you talked to people about a topic i thought you took a service 

429.25 431.86 A: (( you no you talk to um but you talk to like an operator )) 

431.85 433.71 B: yeah that's what i thought 

433.72 438.10 A: i think at the beginning i thought it was one big lie i didn't know what it was about 

438.14 439.72 A: then i figured um 

439.77 448.00 A: i sta- i and then when i saw where it was coming from they're probably doing a study that um how people interact with one another when they meet um like over the phone 

448.07 449.73 B: that's what i thought too as 

449.58 451.72 A: oh well um 

451.05 452.84 B: soon as it linked through 

452.99 453.78 A: (( what )) 

454.36 461.17 B: once i clicked through i thought about that too and since they ask you what kind of phone you use i wonder if it's something like if 

461.42 465.70 B: since when you're using a cell phone 'cause are you cell phone or a home phone 

465.10 467.29 A: i'm i'm on a cell phone and what about you 

467.36 468.54 B: cell phone 

468.28 469.34 A: [laughter] 

468.63 474.21 B: because i think how they click you to together so that it's to see if conversations go better when you're on a cell phone 

473.14 475.37 A: um maybe 

475.42 476.90 B: maybe it's something like 

477.06 477.79 B: (( that unless )) 

477.40 478.94 A: probably actually 

478.59 479.22 B: (( it's )) 

479.47 486.74 A: but um uh that's what i knew and and i as soon as i saw where it's coming from and i figured it was for i figured i thought it was some i mean some [noise] 

485.52 487.52 B: yeah it's kinda cool 

487.65 489.18 A: yeah it's actually pretty cool 

489.25 490.61 B: it's the easiest 

490.79 492.57 B: money you can make 

490.90 499.45 A: um [laughter] well it's uh it's really concise i mean some kind of study they're doing i don't know what it is but um that's what i figured 

493.98 494.91 B: [laughter] 

499.76 502.01 B: i wonder how they pick the topic 

502.62 509.61 A: um that would be interesting to find out however i don't think this conversation's going in the to be assigned to us 

509.19 511.01 B: (( [laughter] i don't think they review )) 

509.72 510.67 A: (( [noise] )) 

511.54 518.87 A: mhm i don't they uh uh or maybe the study's to see the if um if two people meet over the phone [noise] 

518.98 520.40 A: if they would start 

520.47 523.60 A: speaking about the actual topic that was 

523.64 528.49 A: assigned to them or they would go on and drift off some kind of a conversation [noise] 

528.31 532.57 B: i wonder how many people wind up talking about what they things about 

531.86 533.45 A: about work 

533.82 536.52 B: no about what the point of the survey is 

535.49 539.19 A: oh um i would say about ten percent
