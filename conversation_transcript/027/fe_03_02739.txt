0.58 1.90 A: hello 

1.19 2.90 B: hi uh 

2.04 4.19 A: hi my name's teresa 

3.96 5.50 B: my name's sophie 

5.36 6.91 A: sophie where you calling from 

7.05 8.50 B: um winco 

8.84 12.04 A: uh winco what state 

11.44 12.51 B: p._a. 

12.66 15.07 A: oh i'm from um arizona 

14.80 15.57 B: oh 

15.93 19.59 A: what a topic [laughter] is this your first time 

17.15 18.20 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

19.61 23.89 B: um no i actually um they called earlier tonight 

23.53 24.58 A: oh okay 

24.48 25.32 B: so 

25.13 29.04 A: this is my second one um okay well 

29.50 31.97 A: go ahead [laughter] 

30.29 31.35 B: um 

31.70 39.83 B: i believe um that they sh- that there are technologies that you know that exist that 

40.28 43.45 B: they should put more money into to to help 

43.65 47.17 B: prevent bioterrorism for instance um 

47.43 48.46 B: there's 

48.95 59.52 B: measuring uh electrical brainwave activity when they ask people certain questions and that's actually probably more effective than you know searching your luggage and that kind of thing because they've 

59.66 66.04 B: been able to determine that you know it's virtually foolproof in terms of detecting um 

67.21 71.74 B: someone's awareness of a sit- of a situation like in crime 

72.43 73.50 B: um 

73.59 82.09 B: interrogations people can't really can't lie like if they present them with evidence they know and um with that that and 

82.40 89.65 B: technologies that would allow them to uh process mail and and things like that uh more safely 

89.68 96.21 B: uh are probably good short term measures and then just really reevaluating our foreign policy 

96.34 98.80 B: as an important long term measure 

97.95 99.69 A: (( right mhm absolutely )) 

100.05 101.40 A: i totally agree 

101.53 108.07 A: that's interesting about the um the the brainwave i'd something i'd never really thought about before but 

108.21 114.81 B: they were actually i believe trying to develop some sort of a product i think for the um 

115.21 120.34 B: hearing impaired or something and stumbled upon the fact that if 

116.94 118.08 A: (( uh-huh mm )) 

120.74 127.91 B: they ask you a question or present information to you and you've never seen it before 

128.17 135.83 B: your electrical activity um is is measurably different than if it's familiar to you 

136.06 141.68 B: so they realize that it would have incredible application you know in um 

141.86 145.17 A: and do you know if they're using it now i would assume that 

144.53 150.53 B: i i think it's still um i i don't know of any 

148.01 149.26 A: oh you probably don't 

150.66 159.61 B: you know any police district that has absolutely you know taken it on as you know the way they handle things but i know that it's been tested in 

159.92 161.19 B: in um 

161.19 175.94 B: you know real situations and it's been proven to be effective 'cause you know like if if you show slides of whole bunch of different murder weapons that the person's gonna have a response to the one that that was actually used 

170.27 171.36 A: (( know right )) 

175.47 176.30 A: uh-huh 

176.80 180.36 B: you know without opening their mouth i mean just seeing it 

180.56 182.72 B: is enough to elicit a response 

182.58 184.71 A: right interesting 

183.75 187.18 B: and so it can't really be um 

187.25 189.04 B: can't really be faked 

188.98 190.10 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

189.82 194.87 B: the way you know a lie detector test or something might be because 

195.08 201.91 B: you know the person i was talking to earlier was saying you know well it's really great that you know they're doing all these security things and 

202.07 211.77 B: um i felt really safe last time i flew because you know they checked our luggage and everything when we got on the plane feeling like wow this is great and i'm thinking what are you nuts [laughter] 

210.94 212.64 A: yeah exactly [laughter] 

212.22 213.80 B: because um 

213.93 220.34 B: you know uh just because you know how to evade certain things or you choose not to have 

220.52 224.45 B: you know you choose to use bioterrorism versus 

225.00 225.95 B: you know 

225.12 226.18 A: right 

226.84 228.84 B: um certainly 

228.06 229.87 A: oh yeah 

229.02 237.87 B: you know and she's like even even at disneyland they looked at our cameras and everything i'm thinking you could have like serum gas in a in a film container you know 

232.68 233.53 A: (( [mn] )) 

234.84 236.75 A: exac- i know 

238.47 243.73 A: well we were just talking about that because we wanted to you know plan our next vacation and 

238.58 239.45 B: so 

243.93 251.27 A: you know nothing's safe right now nothing is foolproof especially with biological warfare 'cause it's so 

249.61 250.70 B: right 

251.34 256.09 A: easy i mean it would be so easy to do it anywhere 

256.00 257.89 B: yeah 

257.86 258.84 A: so 

258.00 260.15 B: so you really just have to say 

260.26 261.26 B: you know 

261.39 265.99 B: [laughter] what the hell i'm going you know 'cause you can't count on anything 

263.45 264.70 A: right that's what 

264.72 267.90 A: you cannot live your life in fear is what it comes down to 

266.90 268.63 B: right [cough] 

267.91 269.73 A: (( that's kinda what we've been saying )) 

270.81 274.30 A: too so are you for this war or against the war then 

271.02 272.16 B: but i think 

274.25 276.02 B: uh against it 

275.58 279.75 A: against it see now i would have guessed that you would have been for it the way you were 

279.46 280.87 B: oh really 

280.28 281.86 A: talking yeah 'cause uh 

281.47 286.01 B: no i i think that our our foreign policy is 

286.53 292.86 B: is just a colossal embarassment uh i just i can't believe 

293.30 300.33 B: you know sort of the way we just like stop and decide that you know we we have the right to 

299.54 302.23 A: we have the right to tell you what to do 

301.80 303.37 B: right and um 

303.94 304.91 B: um 

304.95 306.46 B: there's this guy benja- 

305.52 313.54 A: it is an embarrassment to the country i'm more for this war than against it but i'm talking my neighbors are from switzerland 

313.77 317.17 A: they just came out for twice a year they have a summer home up here and 

317.21 328.08 A: they were just saying you know [noise] the way it is relayed all over europe is exactly like that you know president bush i'm gonna do whatever i want to do i'm gonna come in and and 

323.61 325.06 B: yeah 

329.28 334.44 A: and [noise] it's viewed as you know it's for our gain not their gain mhm mhm 

334.68 336.88 B: yeah and um there's my 

337.03 342.59 B: son had some outrageous statistics like a year or two ago in school about 

342.71 355.52 B: the the way our you know give billions of dollars away each year but it turns out that it's so absolutely planted you know um 

356.69 362.88 B: to promote american interests and then it doesn't go where the greatest amount of need is 

363.01 371.75 B: it goes you know in areas where we perceive we're going to benefit the most from it and that's really sickening 

372.38 373.40 B: um 

374.15 378.84 B: i mean for my opinion because i i really would like to think about this 

379.01 379.88 B: as 

379.92 380.63 B: (( [cough] )) 

380.71 382.15 B: excuse me um 

382.22 386.41 B: you know magnanimous and decent and good and 

386.50 395.54 B: you know all those sort of you know upholding all these ideals and um our behavior just really doesn't substantiate that at all 

395.31 396.85 A: (( [noise] right )) 

396.41 402.06 B: um i saw something on kissinger the other day and i i was just couldn't believe it 

402.41 408.63 B: um you know all this this stuff that he engineers that that you know was just criminal 

408.63 410.37 A: oh i know 

409.05 414.77 B: and um on n._p._r. the other day they were saying you know basically you know how he was gonna head up the 

414.95 427.03 B: nine eleven investigation or something and then they said no it would be a conflict of interests with his his consulting firm so basically he'd be arrested as a war criminal if he left the country 

427.41 428.81 A: really 

427.62 437.06 B: because he helped to engineer you know the coup in chile that brought you know shay to power and you know just all this stuff 

437.48 440.77 B: um that we just never hear about 

441.43 444.65 B: and i think that the resentment 

444.97 447.02 B: that people have against us 

447.23 454.77 B: you know is allowed to like somebody like osama bin laden you know there'll always be lunatics like him 

454.77 463.71 B: out there somewhere fringe people but if those people are fe- you know okay he's not going to be able to attract a big following but at this point 

463.86 467.42 B: there's so much um anger 

467.48 470.16 B: that you don't have to be some sort of 

470.40 472.00 A: (( mhm hierarchy )) 

471.44 478.27 B: you know hotheaded you know whacko to feel that the united states is the enemy 

477.88 484.69 A: mhm so you don't think by taking the regime out of that um it'll lessen 

484.99 488.06 A: a possible terrorist attack with our country 

488.16 491.01 B: [cough] no 'cause i don't really think that 

491.16 493.57 B: (( i don't really think that iran )) 

493.61 497.66 B: and saddam hussein posed an imminent 

497.66 498.62 A: danger 

498.31 507.24 B: danger to us i think our foreign policy poses a greater danger and that alienating like the arab world and all our allies 

507.46 508.44 B: um 

509.67 513.07 B: it has i think more long term 

513.21 515.55 B: negatives um 

517.16 521.54 B: implications than leav- than trying to sort of 

521.66 525.79 B: you know slowly maneuver saddam hussein 

526.34 532.37 B: out you know maybe you know maybe you know help the factions within the country that were 

532.76 537.99 B: that were against him to try to to get him out or groom you know healthy 

538.04 543.17 B: sane decent people to to come in but now there's just this power vacuum 

542.87 544.42 A: mhm 

543.64 547.19 B: and i don't know that that's great 'cause we don't have a lot of 

547.28 550.08 B: um credibility at this point 

549.79 550.93 A: (( mhm )) 

550.68 553.44 B: (( i don't know how successfully we're gonna be able to )) 

553.55 556.33 B: put someone in there who's truly better 

555.67 558.15 A: mhm [noise] yeah 

556.59 562.10 B: and especially when you consider that like we gave him a lot of weapons 

561.44 562.94 A: oh i know 

562.97 564.88 B: i mean that's just 

565.61 569.77 B: you know and we've a history of that kind of thing and and so 

570.55 571.61 B: um 

571.66 578.84 B: i i don't i don't know i don't i don't think there was any evidence that he was able to do anything to us 

580.31 581.48 B: i think that 

580.87 588.57 A: yeah i will say that i am surprised that we have not found proof of biological warfare 

581.50 582.11 B: (( do- )) 

588.57 599.89 A: yet although i know he's had twelve years to hide it within this country but yeah that did shock me i was one of the people that thought we'd go right in and find it right away 

594.18 595.73 B: right or
