163.22 164.45 A: true yeah 

163.89 164.70 B: so 

164.77 167.59 B: and ah i actually like to listen 

167.91 172.74 B: to the football announcer on w._b._a._l. and watch the game 

171.75 172.68 A: okay 

173.09 174.57 A: [laughter] 

173.55 179.10 B: i- i- i can't listen to a game on the radio because i can't follow what's going on 

177.95 181.22 A: i have to see it right i can't visualize it 

179.31 188.76 B: i have to see 'cause i can't visualize what in the world they're talking about but i like the w._b._a._l. announcer i think it's donny holliday i think is his name 

188.73 189.95 A: (( oh okay )) 

188.75 197.04 B: he he does a really good job of you know doing the play by play so i like to listen to him while i while i while i watch tv [laughter] 

196.26 199.98 A: right it's different because like i grew up in nigeria and then london 

199.57 200.47 B: uh-huh 

200.15 202.73 A: and the matches were really emotional 

202.43 203.31 B: uh-huh 

203.25 209.99 A: like over here it's very like statistics very flat toned so it was just it took a while for me to get like into it 

209.94 211.52 B: yeah that's why i like 

210.01 212.07 A: like before i would just 

211.72 217.69 B: that's why i like donny holliday because he's very um emotional i guess that's that's why i like him 

216.28 218.99 A: right like you can feel it yeah oh 

218.11 224.41 B: yeah and that's why i like to listen to him while i watch what's going on because i i can't 

222.73 223.74 A: okay 

224.48 230.16 B: visualize what i'm hearing into football 'cause then i lose track of who's got the ball and where they are you know it's like 

229.52 236.25 A: right like and [laughter] [laughter] 

230.01 241.62 B: [laughter] ah this is driving me crazy i can't do this [laughter] but um yeah i've been watching um maryland football since um college um 

240.25 241.23 A: okay 

241.64 247.69 B: about when did i go [mn] actually before that 'cause my dad actually um 

247.80 257.76 B: goes to the university of maryland so he gets season tickets where he works there so i've been watching it since about i've been about thirty years we used to go to the football games 

250.71 251.64 A: okay 

254.80 255.84 A: wow 

257.73 258.92 A: okay 

258.34 266.17 B: but then of course they got bad for a while [laughter] so it' kind of like ah i'm not really interested you know [laughter] and then when they got 

264.01 266.38 A: [laughter] 

266.35 270.62 B: fr- ah fridge back he's good he was under bobby ross so

277.54 278.84 B: (( yeah )) 

279.12 285.20 B: generally you have to listen to it very well and from what i understand they do that so you go to the 

285.59 286.58 A: right 

285.96 290.69 B: game [laughter] so generally you know you're kind of stuck 

291.11 292.56 A: you know like yeah if 

291.25 293.69 B: listening to the game it's just 

292.89 293.88 A: (( you don't )) 

294.15 295.95 B: yeah it's just the big games 

296.01 298.24 B: (( yeah i see why don't you put that away )) 

298.47 299.32 B: sorry 

299.34 302.50 B: (( [laughter] do you have anything else to say )) 

302.62 304.80 A: um how much time do we have 

304.42 308.12 B: i have no idea i didn't start they said they'd tell us when ten minutes was up 

307.77 309.99 A: in that case i guess we still have time then 

310.23 314.41 A: well yeah that's it i graduate in may so hopefully i mean 

314.70 321.79 A: hopefully i'll be a tough follower for a while i think i'll stay a fan even if they get bad but they've played pretty good the last couple of years 

320.00 322.63 B: [mn] you mean graduate from maryland in may 

322.39 323.34 A: yeah 

322.85 337.79 B: oh okay yeah like i said i didn't i have kids so taking them to a football game is is out of the question so [laughter] it's just way too expensive so that's why like i said i watch it on t._v. if i can get to it so 

329.74 331.63 A: i know it's like [laughter] 

333.22 334.16 A: true 

335.75 336.97 A: (( okay [mn] )) 

337.90 338.85 B: um 

339.61 343.54 B: did you um did you watch the peach bowl on t._v. 

343.60 344.94 A: yes i did 

345.28 347.50 B: we actually got to go there in person 

347.61 349.01 A: oh cool 

348.86 351.39 B: yeah my um in laws live in um 

351.42 353.26 B: atlanta georgia 

352.65 354.15 A: (( ok- okay )) 

353.72 355.16 B: and so we 

355.25 362.49 B: we went and they paid for the tickets [laughter] and we and we stayed with them so yeah it was kind of interesting 

357.38 359.43 A: cool [laughter] 

362.44 363.55 A: okay 

363.16 366.20 B: ah i- i've never been to a ball game in person so 

365.71 366.67 A: right 

366.43 372.30 B: in in some ways like i said it's better to watch it on t._v. 'cause they they blast it yeah you know 

372.10 374.56 A: you see more like on t._v. 

373.31 379.87 B: you you really do 'cause you don't you don't really see the reruns and the you know and the 

375.13 376.21 A: yeah 

379.10 380.06 A: right 

379.91 393.05 B: the sup- the peach bowl they kept playing these commercials so loud that it was like i mean it's like watching it on t._v. you know whenever they had the time outs they would play [mn] a commercial on the 

388.52 389.57 A: yeah 

390.93 391.98 A: right 

393.23 395.86 B: overhead screen so it's like 

394.60 396.45 A: okay instead of replays 

396.86 406.87 B: why are we doing this [laughter] we came here to get away from the commercials you know not to not to watch the commercials so it was like i said it was like watching it on t._v. so 

398.31 400.70 A: (( [laughter] i know it's just so )) 

401.53 403.56 A: [laughter] 

404.61 405.22 A: (( i )) 

406.59 415.24 A: think it's just a vibe like i'll go to oriole park and watch baseball game just like because we're sitting there and my friends are yankee fans so we're drinking beer and it's just fun 

415.31 419.65 A: as opposed to actually watching the game you know it's like a different vibe 

417.76 418.55 B: uh-huh 

419.58 422.62 B: yeah it's a it's a totally different atmosphere you know 

421.65 422.73 A: yeah 

422.66 427.29 B: um we were stuck for some reason um the way they 

427.49 429.82 B: sold the tickets it was like five to one 

429.98 431.10 A: right 

430.17 436.23 B: the fans that were there i think it was tennessee we played there were five tennessee fans for every maryland fan 

436.11 437.12 A: wow 

436.41 439.19 B: so they put all the maryland fans in the end zone 

439.47 440.53 A: okay 

439.79 441.76 B: it made me really kick 

441.58 443.21 A: [laughter] 

441.90 448.05 B: because you know you'd think they should you know even it out you know what i mean [laughter] but they didn't do that and ah 

445.54 446.70 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

448.09 453.34 B: so of course when they started losing they were getting very upset [laughter] 

452.02 454.22 A: (( i'm sure they were [laughter] )) 

453.52 455.30 B: [laughter] so um 

455.74 457.64 B: let's see what else um 

457.28 458.29 A: (( well )) 

459.41 462.18 B: what else do you want [laughter] 

461.04 462.91 A: i i know this is like 

462.73 467.09 B: to talk about it's just hard to talk for ten minutes i-i didn't actually pay attention to the time 

464.79 469.76 A: yeah i didn't think it would be that long it's like wow ten minutes what 

468.59 469.75 B: um 

470.90 473.39 B: well i- i was watching um 

471.22 472.94 A: else that
