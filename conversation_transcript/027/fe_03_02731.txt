83.93 87.55 B: i get a little nervous i don't know for some reason i'm not that nervous 

87.72 94.94 B: as like at the east coast it seems like like we seem to escape a lot of things cause we have got like the whole time difference thing like like 

93.68 95.33 A: yeah i think so 

95.10 100.09 B: if they're gonna surprise attack the east coast they can't really get the west coast because we already know about it by the time [laughter] 

99.76 101.83 A: this is true that's a very good point 

101.20 106.16 B: i don't know i mean that may mean nothing but for some reason i it makes me less fearful 

105.79 108.47 A: yeah i would think honestly that 

108.82 113.47 A: targets would kind of be in the uh north east region as opposed to 

112.23 113.41 B: mhm 

113.49 115.96 A: you guys out the in the west coast 

115.89 118.67 B: yeah i'm more nervous about like

148.82 151.86 A: chemicals and all sorts of stuff and it um 

152.16 154.86 A: just a crude device that is used to 

155.78 156.66 A: you know 

156.80 157.95 A: kill people 

158.27 164.01 A: or invoke fear or cause your economy to plummet something bad like that

164.70 165.85 A: yeah

170.31 172.21 B: i know isn't it [laughter] 

171.43 173.47 A: that's really surprising 

173.42 175.35 B: very very surprising

184.83 187.45 B: yeah that's too bad 

187.15 190.92 A: no i signed up for this time how did you find out about this thing 

190.74 193.31 B: uh l._a. weekly it's a newspaper 

193.12 194.37 A: oh okay 

193.97 197.23 B: um out here it's like a free publication 

197.14 201.73 A: oh surprised it's actually worked i'm surprised it actually worked 

198.83 199.66 B: huh 

201.36 210.28 B: yeah [laughter] i know well only i only i probably wouldn't of noticed it except my friend uh was like put it on my desk and was like hey you should to this i've done these before 

210.03 211.44 A: oh really you get paid 

211.58 212.56 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

212.08 213.52 A: good stuff 

213.79 217.38 A: okay let's talk i guess more about bioterrorism 

216.93 218.67 B: okay um let 

219.01 220.10 B: (( me see )) 

220.30 221.24 B: i mean 

221.25 223.36 B: (( do you think the war's over )) 

223.63 228.20 A: um i don't know that's a very good point 

228.44 231.13 B: that's what i keep hearing you know oh 

231.16 236.47 B: george says it's over and i just don't just was that it that was it 

236.10 240.52 A: i think its it's kind of for the uh like major plan some of the um 

241.30 244.09 A: like troops and stuff like that and tanks and uh 

244.12 251.50 A: airforce and all of that that stuff but um yeah in terms of fighting the war on terrorism yeah that's far from over 

251.31 253.80 B: i think it's crazy with that like with the 

254.86 260.95 B: i would think there would be more bioterrorism attacks or something you know they would release something on the troops if they had something 

260.51 265.94 A: yeah no i don't think so because then i think the whole world would of kind of gone against them you know i don't know 

264.35 265.77 B: yeah 

266.18 272.77 A: wasn't too uh sure they would do that but you know i think they were pretty prepared for that for the worst 

272.37 274.78 B: yeah that's true i mean 

275.11 276.94 B: they all have their gas masks 

276.45 278.18 A: mhm yeah 

278.48 283.43 A: so uh what do you think i came up with that gas mask idea how about uh something from you 

282.46 286.08 B: [laughter] i don't know i mean 

287.29 293.57 B: i would just say like prepare for it worst i mean everyone give everyone a gas mask and also to make sure that 

294.05 302.03 B: i mean i would hate for us to create our own biological weapons cause that would just like wors- make the problem worst you know biological against biological weapons but 

298.52 299.56 A: mhm 

302.70 306.91 B: you know just learn all about anything that they could have 

306.26 309.97 A: yes like educating our citizens and stuff like that cause actually a 

310.48 314.86 A: lot of people in this area have a kind of escape plans from like 

315.41 324.43 A: if there is something like that um a certain room in an office building where you'd go there's no windows and stuff like that and 

317.58 318.62 B: mhm 

323.87 324.45 B: (( [noise] )) 

324.51 331.50 B: or like different ways to react to like how you react to different gases [noise] cause i don't really know [noise] what kind of gases they would use 

328.29 330.22 A: (( um yeah )) 

331.30 333.86 A: yeah well they give all the people 

334.35 337.89 A: gas masks but the yeah they all have them 

335.39 336.55 B: really 

337.27 338.45 B: wow 

337.98 341.78 A: yeah and a little bit of these areas but 

341.88 344.07 A: (( i work in this habit um )) 

344.52 347.36 A: not too close to the hills so i don't get one [laughter] 

346.93 350.11 B: [laughter] you wish you could get one 

349.66 352.85 A: not really i don't really think so no oh i don't know 

353.74 367.69 A: well yeah maybe yeah actually our building doesn't have a plan on what to do but i have friends who live uh a little bit closer and yeah they have had to go over some kind of like protocol in terms of in the event of a 

367.55 369.37 A: biological attack 

369.36 370.48 B: oh wow 

370.04 370.79 A: (( yep )) 

372.26 374.80 B: i feel like out here they're more worried about 

375.02 384.15 B: you know uh like a plane attack or you know something more like september eleven again [noise] or bombing rather than any thing biological 

383.78 384.78 A: yeah 

384.21 389.08 B: i mean security in all of our skyscrapers is seriously hyped up 

388.56 389.52 A: (( yes )) 

389.19 392.04 B: and like and studios and that kind of thing 

391.57 392.37 A: uh-huh 

392.27 393.32 B: but 

393.69 398.78 B: it's more you know like guns and weapons rather than something biological 

398.39 399.37 A: gotcha 

399.66 401.52 B: that's what they're kind of focused on 

401.37 407.45 A: yeah but that's a big thing over here is the dirty bombings uh and biological stuff you're 

401.72 402.28 B: (( [noise] )) 

405.99 407.96 B: yeah that's just not 

408.53 409.93 A: missing out 

409.38 411.67 B: [laughter] it sounds like it 

411.17 412.46 A: [laughter] 

412.93 414.67 B: we just don't i guess [noise] we just 

414.71 418.67 B: don't uh maybe we should watch the news more though i do watch 

418.37 419.78 A: (( yeah i don't know [sigh] )) 

422.29 423.42 B: so 

423.12 427.59 A: okay well i think we've got a couple more minutes we've gotta keep going i don't know [laughter] 

426.81 430.05 B: oh my god i still don't know that much about bio terrorism i guess 

429.67 431.74 A: (( i know )) 

430.07 434.29 B: i mean i know that you need a gas mask i guess we need to be more educated 

433.77 437.50 A: educated possibly gas masks 

437.87 439.11 A: um 

441.44 445.66 A: and eliminating like threats brought i don't think that's really uh 

445.77 449.99 A: something that we're going to be able to over come in the very near future i think it's 

450.11 454.99 A: possibly could happen over a long term but i don't think um 

455.26 458.96 A: eliminating these uh kind of terrorist cells throughout 

459.02 462.15 A: the world is that easier of a task 

461.86 465.88 B: oh no i don't think so cause it just takes you know one person 

465.55 466.65 A: (( mhm )) 

466.04 467.42 B: to be a terrorist 

467.26 468.13 A: (( yep )) 

467.47 469.01 B: you don't need an army 

468.97 469.79 A: mhm 

469.67 471.64 B: you can just 

472.13 474.68 B: you know be a terrorist yourself 

472.99 474.38 A: exactly 

476.87 480.41 B: (( i don't know these terrorist camps are freaky )) 

480.03 481.12 A: yeah 

481.06 484.06 B: the ones on the news that's nuts 

482.01 483.32 A: mhm 

484.86 493.23 A: and now that um they got kind of uh pushed out of afghanistan and they're kind of moving all it's kind of a little harder for us i think to uh 

493.68 499.13 A: track them down cause now they're they're virtually in maybe like thirty countries now they are in over one hundred so 

498.87 500.86 B: (( yeah )) 

499.21 501.20 A: a little bit more difficult 

501.38 502.95 B: i didn't even think about that 

502.30 503.71 A: [sigh] 

504.90 509.39 A: yep they should of sealed up the boarders just a little bit better instead of putting an escape 

509.51 511.50 B: mhm 

512.04 515.31 B: i wonder what's gonna happen in iraq now do we know who's gonna 

515.32 522.07 A: um there is some guy that they've kind of thrown in there for the time being but eventually [sigh] 

515.46 516.37 B: lead 

522.20 523.65 A: i guess um 

524.09 525.00 A: (( i don't )) 

524.92 525.78 B: (( in there )) 

525.25 526.79 A: (( know yeah )) 

526.60 531.15 B: i don't how many times could you watch that statue get pulled down 

530.56 531.76 A: [laughter] 

531.69 533.26 B: i mean really 

532.94 538.51 A: [laughter] i know it's pretty funny with that guys head [laughter] saddam's head getting dragged along [laughter] 

535.92 540.13 B: [laughter] [laughter] oh that's funny 

539.40 541.99 A: and the little kid's smacking it around 

541.94 543.75 B: oh my god 

543.28 545.97 A: that was actually pretty entertaining 

545.36 548.91 B: i was i was very amused i started to like the iraqis 

548.31 551.46 A: [sigh] yep it was very entertaining
