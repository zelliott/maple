295.73 303.50 A: uh like i said college um softball and and the world series professional uh softball women's softball 

300.77 301.93 B: mhm 

302.70 315.12 B: oh what is that woman's name that's uh a golfer a pro golfer that's uh trying to be in the first woman golfer in the in um the men's open tournament

314.91 317.70 A: oh i'm not sure i'm not sure 

316.74 322.14 B: well i i saw a piece on that a couple of weeks ago on t._v. and of course 

322.38 326.14 B: a lot of the men in the tournament don't wanna see that happen 

326.23 333.99 B: and she's going going for it pretty strong trying to get women to be accepted into to the men's 

333.13 337.46 A: well i think the supreme court might have ruled already on that 

336.75 338.09 B: oh really 

337.34 348.54 A: i i'm i'm not sure i could be mistaken but i think that the ruling is that since it's a private institution that it could be limited to men just like the boy scouts um 

343.24 344.70 B: uh-huh 

347.88 348.90 B: mhm 

348.60 360.98 A: leaving homosexuals out uh [sigh] now you know i'm not gay or i don't really agree with that lifestyle but that that is not as much a choice as it is a a natural um 

350.40 351.82 B: mhm 

361.54 366.96 A: you know it's biological it's natural and uh and it is the nature of it in the human animal 

363.56 364.56 B: mhm 

366.77 369.43 B: so how did the boy scouts rule on that 

369.29 375.99 A: the boy scouts ruled that since it's a private institution they can be a private club and and accept only those that they wanna accept 

375.60 377.54 B: i see i see 

376.47 381.84 A: yeah and they they wanna omit gays and so by law they're allowed to 

379.03 379.97 B: uh-huh 

381.56 382.47 B: uh-huh 

382.12 383.40 A: and uh 

383.63 384.49 A: (( you know )) 

383.70 388.62 B: so probably then she has been ruled out of playing in that tournament 

386.26 396.74 A: it's i believe so i believe so now i might be wrong the the supreme court might not have ruled on it yet but i know a lower court did and they 

388.68 390.19 B: in the golf tournament 

390.36 391.56 B: (( well do mhm )) 

396.07 402.43 B: i didn't even know it had to go through the supreme court i thought it was just something between the 

399.36 400.98 A: (( yeah )) 

402.26 415.60 A: and well when it when it when it comes when it comes down to that you know they say well you know sue us and then everything everything always ends up in court 

402.74 404.66 B: [sigh] the men's golf tourney 

404.85 405.58 B: (( now i )) 

405.65 406.62 B: i didn't 

411.52 412.73 B: uh-huh
