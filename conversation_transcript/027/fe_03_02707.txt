0.08 1.84 B: uh my name's brian 

1.30 3.23 A: (( hi my name is laura )) 

2.96 4.07 B: (( oh and how are you )) 

3.74 5.15 A: good how are you 

4.59 11.18 B: with with the uh i'll ask you your impressions first what do you think uh we can do about those bio terrorism 

10.66 16.95 A: um well i don't know i just we live in probably different places um and i live in new york so 

17.26 18.76 A: they do i mean 

18.96 22.35 A: i don't really think there's much we can do actually honestly 

21.90 23.21 B: uh i don't think so either 

22.99 30.95 A: yeah i mean there's one thing just having like the physical presence of like cops and i guess authority personnel but 

31.37 32.73 A: otherwise men 

33.21 36.03 B: what do you think about like closing the borders somewhat do 

36.53 38.20 B: you think that would help 

37.63 40.31 A: no i think that would just i no 

40.13 43.77 B: restricting immigration wouldn't uh you don't think that would be a help at all 

44.39 46.16 A: restricting immigration 

45.90 47.12 B: yeah 

46.61 52.86 A: no because from where [noise] where are you gonna restrict immigration from the middle east and what about like north korea you know 

50.20 50.96 B: yeah 

53.12 56.58 A: not that they're i guess there's not really a history of terrorism there but 

55.92 58.21 B: not bio terrorism at least not yet 

57.64 58.84 A: right 

58.99 61.78 A: oh bio terrorism right i was thinking of terrorism 

61.32 62.19 B: (( uh-uh )) 

62.94 68.60 A: hm well what's i mean i don't know what's what do you think's what how is the threat different when it's bio terrorism 

68.73 73.16 B: because uh from what i understand the biological weapons are much more portable 

72.57 76.92 A: [noise] right is there a way to stop it so it's easier or is it creating more of a problem 

75.63 80.94 B: it's it's like i i i have to prevent it from coming coming into the country that's that's that's my impression 

80.58 83.38 A: right i guess you can restrict [noise] airspace use 

83.51 85.94 B: oh that's it that that's an interesting thing 

83.53 84.49 A: more 

85.24 97.23 A: yeah that's i mean i think that's the main thing 'cause how are you going to bring it here one thing actually that we can do that i know that like we talk about people talk about new york all the time the one place that we're really not safe is like our ports like our coastal areas 

96.66 97.85 B: right 

97.21 102.20 A: our waters not like our water is not so secure so maybe having a stronger military presence 

102.59 103.98 A: on the coast 

103.37 106.93 B: wow expand uh expand coastguard uh authority 

105.55 108.65 A: [laughter] exactly maybe that 

107.76 109.65 B: uh that's very interesting 

109.03 110.77 A: yes well what do you think 

110.96 112.80 B: i think that's a very good idea 

112.21 114.49 A: [laughter] 

113.84 120.23 B: in a way 'cause uh they're no one ever mentions the coastguard in connection with these they're uh coastguards it's always they're they're always catching drug runners 

119.57 124.20 A: right and i think i think part of th- the thing is that it's like it's probably one of the harder things to do 

124.64 125.68 A: (( is to )) 

125.78 134.29 A: i mean you wouldn't think so except that you and then and now i'm thinking water i'm thinking our water supplies probably one of those things that's probably most vulnerable [noise] 

133.95 136.48 B: well that's exactly right then that's why uh 

136.72 139.49 B: that's why restricting immigration are like that 

136.74 137.54 A: right 

138.87 140.64 A: we're restricting immigration 

139.95 141.86 B: yeah 

140.95 144.91 A: [lipsmack] but then when does it stop you know when do we become like 

145.82 153.05 A: i don't know i just i feel like i create it's like a slippery slope you know i get i get nervous about anything when we're restricting something based on like 

153.78 157.22 B: well it's not like restricting of uh uh you know domestic freedom 

157.73 158.76 A: right 

158.54 160.41 B: i mean to me it's a it's a 

161.60 163.34 B: (( it's a you know )) 

164.09 167.35 B: what am i the the word i'm searching for eludes me at the moment 

166.71 179.45 A: right well what about whether what about like internal threats i mean we already have probably um god thousands of terrorists living in our country already do we just start deporting people i mean i feel de- i definitely don't think that's the answer 

179.47 180.41 B: (( start what )) 

180.28 184.65 A: do we definitely to what about the threats that are already within our own country 

183.61 185.92 B: right what did you say after that though i didn't i didn't quite 

185.27 188.61 A: i de- oh i definitely don't believe that we should start like deporting people 

189.86 190.80 A: (( you know who )) 

190.63 191.79 B: (( oh )) 

191.20 192.86 A: live here legally 

192.21 198.30 B: i don't know i don't i don't think this country's had a a history of deportation since like the thirties have they 

198.42 201.55 A: no but we've had a we've had a history like an internment camps so 

198.45 200.38 B: so there are i guess the the so it 

201.48 208.78 B: well yeah but that was that was that was world war t- that was world war two and that's they they as far as i know they kept those japanese people here 

202.36 205.36 A: right that wasn't that long ago anyway 

208.97 210.10 B: [laughter] so 

209.33 211.25 A: (( yeah we don't know if they did but )) 

210.44 215.43 B: [laughter] it's like they didn't let them but they didn't let them leave right [laughter] 

211.37 214.09 A: it was a that was a coming after concentration camps 

214.57 217.61 A: right [laughter] so exactly 

217.84 219.47 A: (( so i don't know )) 

220.10 221.71 A: (( [lipsmack] bio terrorism )) 

221.13 229.32 B: well the scariest thing to me about this stuff is i mean you uh you could uh give broader authority for the domestic spying which apparently they're trying to do 

228.92 230.05 A: right 

229.35 231.69 B: but that to me that's the scariest thing 

231.13 233.59 A: right and i mean that's already happening 

233.19 247.78 B: right but i mean i've always been a big uh believer in in in the you know law and like that and i think criminals have too many rights but i mean we're not all criminals so i'm and i don't wanna be i don't want them to tap my phone 'cause i live next to you know an asian gentleman 

239.44 240.33 A: uh-huh 

241.54 242.39 A: yeah 

245.24 246.13 A: right 

247.35 252.55 A: right and then there's your question like well you're fine if you're not doing anything wrong you know or 

247.85 248.73 B: (( for instance )) 

251.96 255.96 B: oh uh that's that's a false argument well i just don't want you to know what i'm doing uh 

252.84 253.70 A: right 

253.98 255.00 A: right 

255.50 260.43 A: exactly well that's your you know that's what your what fourth amendment right to privacy 

256.02 257.63 B: (( and what about you and )) 

259.82 266.03 B: there is no right to privacy in the fourth amendment that's int- it's been intuited by by legal scholars because 

264.90 266.77 A: right but it has said so 

266.57 272.24 B: yeah but it's it's not there it's just non existent although i do believe in the uh in the principle 

268.12 269.12 A: (( [noise] right )) 

271.64 272.89 A: right 

272.28 279.04 B: you know 'cause isn't it 'bout about the quartering of the soldiers that's how they got the uh the right to privacy out of the fourth amendment 

279.20 280.22 A: what do you mean 

280.16 283.99 B: the right to privacy is because isn't the fourth amendment about the quartering of soldiers 

283.37 285.12 A: i don't even know about that what do you mean 

284.99 285.87 B: (( [cough] you )) 

286.29 293.09 B: know because they uh apparently during the revolutionary war that says uh the british could just come to your house and say you know we're putting up our soldiers 

288.66 289.60 A: uh-huh 

293.03 299.11 A: oh oh oh oh oh you know you're having quartering i'm thinking about the torturing well like when you quarter someone 

297.56 298.40 B: (( oh no )) 

299.14 303.60 A: right exactly you don't ha- and you have the right to not right put up soldiers in your house 

299.46 300.78 B: (( yeah all right forget that )) 

303.02 306.09 B: right and that's where they that's where they got the the right to privacy thing 

305.43 307.03 A: exactly 

306.21 309.61 B: that's where they they derived that but i mean 

307.88 310.93 A: right and there are other things then so [laughter] 

310.07 316.52 B: yeah but i you know i don't mind like i said i don't want somebody you know opening my mail because i happen to live t- next to somebody named hassan 

316.05 317.73 A: right exactly 

316.90 320.57 B: you know or you know what were you doing talking to him over the fence while he was mowing his lawn 

320.53 330.04 A: [lipsmack] and then and then it's like you know they are picking out people like based on their nationality and with i mean that's like with the whole country is not supposed to be based on something like that the whole country is supposed to be a place for 

321.78 322.34 B: (( [cough] )) 

330.11 331.74 B: you mean profiling 

331.34 340.60 A: right i mean and i am not saying that i'm i'm one hundred percent against profiling and i think it's a different when we're talking about people getting on planes or people whatever but 

340.64 345.15 A: that's that's in a totally different issue than just you know going into someone's mail 

345.31 349.03 A: i think it's f- i think it's good to monitor i mean i think you can monitor people 

349.01 353.98 B: and how would you do that you mean you mean touched by a stakeout or what not or what do you 

349.78 350.81 A: in a different [noise] 

352.70 362.21 A: there is i mean clearly i think that you know after september eleventh we see that there is a will to survive i think that before that no matter really i don't know if we ever really thought there was like a real threat i don't know 

361.14 365.10 B: well they had the world they had the world trade centre bombing if that wasn't a tip off yeah right 

364.44 370.61 A: right it was a tip off and i think that that probably did increase a little bit but i don't think that we really thought that we were as vulnerable 

370.68 384.95 A: as we were and i think that now that we know this well we have to start looking and seeing where are we vulnerable for example like we were talking about the waterways you know well we see now that we were very vulnerable as far as like airplanes go and so now we're putting out all the stuff is going into 

378.58 379.57 B: right 

385.13 394.51 A: looking to see who is in flight school and increasing security on planes and that's that's really important but we also just missed that one you know we really need to look at other things as well sorry 

392.06 393.14 B: [laughter] 

393.70 398.38 B: just barely missed it huh [laughter] we just barely missed it 

395.20 396.11 A: (( what )) 

397.91 398.87 A: (( do you mean )) 

398.44 404.03 B: well you said we just missed that one about you know the because they were the they learnt how to fly here in florida apparently right [noise] 

403.43 411.89 A: right no i'm saying like we didn't even we didn't see that but it's not like we're either going to continue to do the same thing over and over again they're gonna find something else to do and it's like right 

406.54 408.00 B: yeah there was the yes 

410.23 420.84 B: right well uh there there was a a apparently some plane that was foiled or they or they we got wind of it s- too early that they're they were gonna set off some kind of poisonous gasses in the lincoln tunnel 

420.27 422.64 A: that would have been a good plan [laughter] 

421.60 428.77 B: or like a in a sub or yeah or even like uh the subways are all talk about the water supply i mean how many millions of people are affected by the subway system 

427.95 430.10 A: but the subway system also would be like 

429.18 434.88 B: and that stuff it sits it's a tunnel obviously that stuff's gonna just be trapped down there until it seeps up to the surface 

434.49 437.42 A: right and it's gonna travel through also 

436.97 443.66 B: right so they so they they're i mean ev- you but uh how can you live in a free society and not be vulnerable i mean that's a dichotomy 

443.43 444.86 A: right and then 

444.25 453.84 B: i mean would you i mean i don't under i don't really don't know what you what you can do i think uh besides i mean i i just don't know because you don't wanna give up any i i certainly don't wanna give up any freedom 

453.20 467.30 A: right and then i think that i think that we're like americans are also dealing with the fact that we're we are vulnerable uh like we didn't realize that and we think we could figure a way there's going to be like this answer like how can we deal with it well this is the answer and that maybe there isn't an answer you know 

466.37 468.01 B: [sigh] we know there have been uh 

468.50 470.73 B: you know there have been uh suggestions 

470.89 477.97 B: that uh like uh well there's this is a little off the subject i guess but they did uh wanted to go into like drug neighborhoods in the inner cities 

476.44 477.34 A: uh-huh 

478.05 480.93 B: and they wanted the people in the in fact i i i believe some 

480.74 494.47 B: neighborhoods actually suggested themselves you know t- t- to that they were to spend certain a certain of their rights so the police could just come in arbitrarily like knock down doors and find you know drug people because the neighborhood was so bad the neigh- people in that neighborhood 

482.73 483.60 A: uh-huh 

493.98 496.68 A: [noise] or like a whole bus even if you do that 

495.90 507.84 B: like yeah it was i guess like up to them it seemed like a hopeless situation other than that like almost marshal law or marshal but i mean i wouldn't uh [laughter] not not in my neighborhood you're not going to be able to come into my house 

500.87 501.91 A: right 

504.15 504.97 A: yeah 

507.29 509.57 A: that's like you give 'em you give 

508.53 512.81 B: you might even get to yeah that they're they're there are many instances where people get the wrong address 

509.74 510.86 A: [noise] 

512.78 520.94 A: right and after you give them like that much freedom like you know i don't know what's do what's that what's that you give them like a cliche like you give 'em a something and they'll take a whatever you know 

513.27 514.26 B: [laughter] 

520.15 522.12 B: you give you give 'em an inch they'll take a mile [noise] 

521.44 523.60 A: exactly you know what i mean like 

523.73 530.02 A: i'm cer- certainly not wanting the n._y._p._d. coming into my house you know what i mean i don't need them to come in here and see that like 

526.81 528.33 B: (( no especially )) 

530.40 536.41 A: and anything else that like might be able like you know slightly illegal i don't need them to come in here and get in trouble for other things you know 

536.40 544.39 B: well that's right and besides uh especially if they get the wrong address i mean they might have uh you know they might have information that these people are heavily armed 

539.59 540.52 A: right 

543.86 545.03 A: (( right [noise] )) 

544.52 547.01 B: and they're coming in and they you know and 

546.63 547.19 A: [noise] 

547.24 554.06 B: you know i don't know what you would have in your hand at the time but say say say you're like your [laughter] you have a you know curling iron in your hair you know 

553.30 554.89 A: right exactly [laughter] 

554.15 557.79 B: you know it's a weapon and then then you're shot you're shot because you were trying to you know 

557.50 561.66 A: right and that would be so likely too in new york i have to tell you [laughter] 

559.25 559.96 B: (( [cough] )) 

560.82 571.38 B: well how how about a t._v. remote will you you might we will do something that's uh uh uh gender nonspecific what if you just have the remote in your hand and ya and somebody's not b- you know breaking in and you just turn and you have the remote in your hand 

565.48 566.71 A: exactly 

566.73 567.65 A: [laughter] 

570.79 572.12 A: exactly 

571.53 574.38 B: you know that's that's the see of course it's gonna look like a gun 

574.35 575.23 A: right 

574.82 576.64 B: uh 'cause they're expecting to see one 

576.19 578.76 A: and that's also something that can just be used for an excuse 

579.16 585.43 B: well [laughter] now that they would use that for an e- they they would they would use that for an excuse after they realise the mistake has been made 

580.50 583.12 A: well i don't know really where you live but [noise] 

585.64 586.55 A: right 

586.37 589.78 B: [laughter] either that or they take the remote out of your hand and actually put a gun in it 

588.18 591.46 A: or whatever reason just flash apartments or whatever [noise] 

590.48 591.40 B: uh-huh 

591.62 592.84 B: but as far 

591.72 595.19 A: and you know [noise] what we're talking about like you know local police or 

595.25 596.51 A: f._b._i. or what 

597.36 599.89 A: i don't know i just don't i just i really think the problem
