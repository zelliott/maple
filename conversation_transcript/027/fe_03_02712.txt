10.34 13.21 B: oh you've got alabama on this end so 

13.80 18.67 B: so between the two of us we're supposed to figure out what the united states can do to prevent bioterrorism 

18.83 20.46 B: (( hm [mn] )) 

20.11 22.13 A: (( well that should be interesting )) 

22.36 23.42 A: um 

24.13 28.95 A: i guess pretty much which of the what they're doing now except take a more active role in you know 

29.53 33.33 A: dealing with some of the other terrorists more so than iraq right now 

32.15 34.17 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

34.22 39.55 B: yeah i think that the bioterrorism is very scary i mean i'm ex military so 

39.85 42.48 A: well i'm a spouse's military 

42.20 43.27 B: (( ah )) 

43.46 45.57 B: so we both see it on that side huh 

45.50 46.82 A: yeah so 

47.03 49.08 A: that's the big issue 'cause you know 

49.90 59.51 A: that's the way i look at it 'cause like my husband he's he's in iraq now and yeah and so you know we're hoping he'll be coming home soon 

53.66 54.87 B: oh really 

55.17 56.41 B: god 

59.22 60.60 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

59.96 69.42 A: and so he um you know and i just started thinking i'm like i would hate for him to have to go somewhere else so soon but i believe that you know they have to deal with the 

65.82 67.27 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

69.49 71.99 A: bigger issue at hand more so than 

72.18 81.08 A: who gonna bomb us because we can prevent it's easier to me to prevent a bomb attack than it would be for somebody just come by and drop something you know and just put 

79.27 82.09 B: (( [noise] [noise] like anthrax or some )) 

81.20 83.95 A: yeah you know just drop it and they just spray it 

83.67 85.28 B: yeah 

84.69 88.18 A: you know 'cause i was looking at you know how they have the sars on t._v. 

87.73 88.63 B: uh-huh 

88.24 99.78 A: and that's what i kept thinking i'm like that's you know stuff like that is so easily spread just through the air and i'm like gosh [noise] anthrax attack i mean what [noise] they're like duct tape i'm like duct tape okay 

99.75 106.60 B: [laughter] well that's something that scared me anyway when sars first came out 'cause i kept on thinking oh maybe that's what it was 

100.64 101.71 A: (( i'm like )) 

105.95 111.15 A: i did too i was like okay so this is and then they say like it's mutating i'm like okay 

110.88 114.42 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

112.75 116.21 A: you know the best way i believe you know like i said earlier 

116.83 118.55 A: [noise] once they get they just gotta 

119.61 125.01 A: i think it's you know you know i have have you ever thought about maybe they should just ban a lot of these chemicals anyway 

124.62 129.36 B: yeah well something that bothered me about the iraqi 

126.10 127.09 A: you know 

129.47 134.36 B: incident is you know the one thing that we heard about was a pesticide plan 

134.39 135.51 A: mhm 

134.58 148.09 B: okay first of all you got a nation that has no agricultural whatsoever and then you've got a pesticide that sends fifteen of our soldiers to bleach bath you know it seems like a little much there so 

138.78 139.68 A: (( uh )) 

146.45 148.67 A: mhm very much 

148.32 152.86 B: wh- [laughter] what does your husband think does he think that they're gonna find the weapons over there 

152.60 155.71 A: you know to be honest i haven't spoken to my husband since 

156.30 158.07 A: before the war started 

157.96 159.22 B: or oh man 

159.08 163.52 A: because he's like on he was like front ro- frontline fighting and 

162.57 171.41 B: yeah i have a first cousin that's a green beret and we haven't really heard anything from him either all we do is every once in awhile we get the note that he's okay 

165.64 166.39 A: oh 

171.23 176.65 A: yeah we get a let- i got a letter for the first time since like about two weeks before the war 

172.95 174.11 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

176.96 179.18 A: and it was dated april seventeenth 

180.09 185.95 A: and so i finally got a letter and he's like i'm still alive because they had we had lost a couple of guys in his unit 

185.67 186.68 B: (( oh no )) 

186.02 190.63 A: and so he was asking you know he wanted to make sure i was okay with that and you know 

189.86 190.52 B: mhm 

191.33 198.54 A: and how you know let me know that he wasn't hurt and he wasn't one of the guys that got hurt and i was like you know it's okay i'm you know 

198.36 199.35 B: mhm 

198.72 200.60 A: they're keeping me informed 

200.74 204.11 A: but you know i i was thinking you know with all the [noise] 

204.78 218.07 A: i just want a find a way for them to just deal with the bio terrorism 'cause there isn't a way for us to protect ourselves and i don't care who you are unless you're living in shelter [noise] if they drop something it's not i mean honestly how it's gonna you know 

216.01 217.68 B: yeah 

218.10 219.42 B: well one of the things 

218.24 220.60 A: duct tape whatever is not gonna help you 

220.52 228.68 B: yeah i was water purificationing so that's always terrified me because i've seen the kind of things that they can put in your water supply 

224.21 225.97 A: oh yeah 

227.75 229.29 A: yeah 'cause it's so open 

229.02 240.90 B: yeah and i it's not protected i mean i know that we have people that are new with facilities now but and i tell you something that really bothers me and for me to have this idea i know that a terrorist somewhere would 

231.45 232.03 A: (( mhm )) 

240.78 244.66 B: you know what if they was to put it on twenty dollar bills 

244.05 245.50 A: (( oh everybody be gone )) 

245.17 246.42 B: exactly 

246.57 247.85 B: you know something like 

246.95 249.44 A: twenty over one e- everybody's gone 

249.19 250.12 B: mhm 

250.45 256.57 A: but you know i like i was saying too you know a lot of the places that you know produce our food 

250.54 254.17 B: (( yeah )) 

256.83 257.57 B: they 

257.95 263.07 A: it's so easy to as- you know they were doing on the um computer they had the um 

258.18 261.43 B: (( yeah )) 

263.84 268.20 A: the method one of the sodas might have been contaminated at one time 

267.71 269.52 B: mhm 

268.27 271.22 A: and i'm like do you realise how easy that would be though 

270.84 272.44 B: mhm 

271.32 274.31 A: because how you know 'cause most plants do tours 

274.00 275.43 B: mhm 

274.79 279.23 A: and how easy would it be just to walk away from the tour and actually drop something in there 

278.72 279.91 B: exactly 

279.65 288.10 A: you would only have to go you take you if they have like five people each day in one place you can go on a tour and by the fifth day they're gonna have the whole place mapped out 

287.67 288.81 B: exactly 

288.41 292.18 A: and know the routine of what they do on the tour and how the tour goes 

292.94 295.85 A: and so i was like it's just too easy 

295.51 301.18 B: it is and it's hard to think about how many people it would take actually prevent something 

301.81 310.18 A: it'll take a lot that's why the best thing will be to start banning chemicals because and if they have something to make this [noise] they need to stop it [noise] 

301.84 302.94 B: that 

303.74 304.66 B: it will 

309.41 311.90 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

310.72 315.96 A: you know i know they say you know 'cause it sou- like i told my mom it sounds like the way the world is going we're going to be like 

316.70 320.68 A: we're gonna basically be like to the point where we can't do anything [noise] [noise] 

320.01 328.07 B: yeah you get scared to be in a large crowd because you don't know what's gonna happen there and then you're afraid to eat something and drink 

323.73 324.72 A: (( [noise] yeah mhm )) 

328.08 333.04 B: but i know that we all live in a very small town and my dad works for the local 

333.21 335.58 B: water treatment plant one of them 

335.72 336.83 B: and um 

337.88 344.02 B: i was down there with him one day and he knows that i know about a lot of this thing and he was telling me what they're doing 

344.03 346.20 B: and they're doing an extra filtering now 

346.25 350.49 B: which is something that they did by the time we got it it would be so diluted that where 

350.52 359.37 B: it would probably make us you know maybe the diarrhea and the sick like that as far as chemical goes but there's so much i think that we don't even know about what they've got with the viral 

359.84 364.51 B: and you know even if it didn't affect us how would it affect the generation to come 

364.48 365.64 A: that's true 

365.26 367.41 B: i mean it's it's scary stuff 

366.66 373.50 A: you know because they could give us something and it wouldn't do anything to us and then all of sudden all of our kids just start dying off aft- as we have 'em 

371.59 375.14 B: (( and yeah )) 

374.04 379.21 A: [noise] you know and that's so true and that [noise] i also i told my mom i says [noise] sometimes being in military [noise] 

379.83 381.57 A: is a scary thing 

380.96 388.01 B: yeah 'cause you know more and and that information is scary a lot of well like with my oldest son he was born 

382.42 383.99 A: yeah you know [noise] mm 

389.22 394.08 B: i w- me and my husband got married right after i got back from the first desert storm 

394.53 395.71 B: and um 

395.88 401.64 B: so he goes every so often to get tests on him because he's one of the first children that were born 

403.13 407.37 B: to a female after she came back i mean after i came back 

406.23 407.98 A: mm mm that is awful 

407.38 409.10 B: mhm and uh 

408.03 409.47 A: that has to be the most 

409.84 416.26 B: but i mean he's fine and my youngest son's fine but i mean still that's what's always terrified me was how would we know 

410.00 410.75 A: (( [noise] but )) 

416.56 420.34 A: you know that is so true that is so true because 

417.25 418.06 B: (( ye- )) 

418.43 426.20 B: mhm how would we know about future generations or even if he has grandkids will they be affected are my grandkids to be affected so you know 

425.06 427.62 A: (( that's true [noise] that is so true [noise] )) 

426.37 428.86 B: you never know what any of 'em's got in 

429.69 431.17 A: because my um 

431.52 442.33 A: it's [noise] like i you know everything i say i just tell my mom i said you know you never know i said because [noise] the one thing i don't like is the fact i know we [noise] need the people that um [noise] spray the food 

441.59 443.02 B: (( this i- i- mhm )) 

442.69 444.04 A: you know and the a- 

444.12 446.30 A: (( crop dust that's [noise] what i was think- share crop )) 

444.61 447.24 B: yeah 

446.60 452.16 A: but that scared me so bad because my mom was like oh it's the share cropper going over my house i'm like huh 

452.07 453.15 B: uh-huh 

453.32 457.06 A: you know and that messes with me 'cause i'm like that is just so easy right there 

456.44 457.79 B: yeah 

457.10 461.79 A: because you don't really think about 'em [noise] noone really you see 'em and you're like okay 

462.02 463.61 A: that's a share cropper 

462.52 465.07 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

463.63 470.85 A: you know and aci- and in reality it couldn't be one you know it could be somebody just spraying you a chemical who you wouldn't know any better 

470.60 479.77 B: yeah well i know that um after september the eleventh and i think that was i honestly meant think that that was a humongous wake up call 

479.76 480.89 A: mhm 

479.97 482.84 B: and i feel that we're a lot safer after it that 

484.14 485.55 B: you know to me 

485.74 490.34 B: there's so many things that i could see that could have been just horribly 

490.41 491.85 B: horribly done 

493.02 494.18 A: yeah because [noise] 

493.45 498.52 B: and for us to have lived as many years as we have and not have something like that i mean could you imagine 

498.55 503.19 B: live and eat on the west bank or in israel where it is an everyday occurrence 

502.22 503.44 A: everyday 

503.70 508.32 B: and you know it w- it was kind of naive of us to say well that ain't never gonna happen here 

507.90 516.89 A: i know i told momma i said i told my mom once it happened you know i called her and i was like you know what i said this i've really been expecting this 

516.38 518.36 B: mhm 

517.19 523.46 A: [noise] because everybody has war and has all this ordinary you know country and continent well we don't 

523.17 524.11 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

523.55 525.82 A: [noise] i said well it's time for it [noise] 

525.73 527.34 B: exactly 

526.69 536.43 A: i said so and i you know i know it's a bad thing but in a go- in a way it's a good thing because it woke a lot of people up like hey we are not invincible 

534.00 535.68 B: yeah 

536.67 538.85 B: yeah and that's 

537.08 542.77 A: we you know we have to protect ourselves we have we can't just let anybody do anything they want to 

542.29 549.65 B: yeah i don't i don't think the next one will be anything that will involve an airplane i think like you know what we're talking about it'll be 

543.58 544.50 A: you know 

548.72 555.10 A: yeah because you know i don't know how what you have around you but we have like little bitty army posts 

554.42 556.01 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

555.11 560.20 A: that may have maybe a hundred people on it the real small one like a little depot 

559.29 561.62 B: (( [mn] uh-huh )) 

560.60 564.79 A: and those terrify me because they have a little bit of everything on some of those 

564.23 565.97 B: (( well you see i live )) 

566.12 569.29 B: within an hour of fort mcclellan which 

569.36 573.33 B: is the place in the united states that they're destroying all of our 

573.39 578.16 B: chemical and biological weapons and then we had an earthquake the other day 

575.14 576.33 A: mhm 

578.07 579.72 A: i heard about that [noise] 

579.16 585.98 B: it was like a four point six and everybody was going oh my god 'cause it was centered right right close to fort mcclellan 

586.02 591.60 B: and so everybody was going how did it affect it you know 'cause uh everybody's terrified i'm in like a an orange zone 

591.72 595.61 B: where you know so many miles there were if there was an accident 

595.83 599.96 B: there was be certain things that we do where they've educated us what to do 

599.35 599.90 A: (( [noise] oh my ))
