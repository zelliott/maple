25.85 26.77 A: okay 

26.60 28.90 B: so what are your feelings on it 

28.96 30.09 A: um 

31.21 42.55 A: well i think the u._s. could change its foreign policy a bit and there'd be less anger towards [noise] um the u._s. and the middle east [noise] and in the third world in general [noise] 

43.13 44.26 B: okay 

44.36 45.35 B: um 

45.54 48.31 B: it's kind of a hard topic to talk on 

48.25 49.81 A: yeah i agree 

50.92 52.55 A: it's pretty broad 

51.91 57.25 B: yeah i was thinking when they were saying you know what would what we can do i was thinking more of um 

57.28 60.02 B: [lipsmack] security reasons than 

61.05 63.80 B: than to stop the actual act 

64.30 66.42 B: the way i interpreted the uh 

66.94 68.12 B: the message 

68.76 69.58 A: oh 

71.47 77.06 A: well what do you think we could do to stop for the as far as security to stop 

76.42 79.08 B: i'm really having a hard time hearing you 

78.86 82.66 A: oh i'm sorry what do you think we could do as far as security to stop the uh 

83.70 85.82 A: bioterrorist attacks i guess 

86.84 92.22 B: to stop the the attack that i really don't know [laughter] politics is not one of my high points 

89.66 90.38 A: (( oh )) 

91.82 92.60 A: (( oh )) 

93.13 94.31 B: how about you 

94.53 95.61 A: um 

97.41 99.07 A: well 

100.34 113.22 A: [noise] it's a hard topic because i don't think there's a whole lot that we can do to stop a terrorist attack 'cause it's not that hard to make a chemical weapon [noise] and it's not that hard would really realistically be that hard to bring it in to the country 

112.70 113.57 B: mhm 

113.60 115.09 A: and so [noise] 

115.69 120.90 A: i think that a lot of terrorism [noise] is well like caused by 

121.29 133.52 A: [noise] well like religious intolerance but i think that religious intolerance is caused um well the religious intolerance being aimed at the united states is caused by 

133.70 136.14 A: um united states' 

136.52 141.45 A: like treatment of palestinians israel and support for israel 

141.62 147.99 B: [noise] i think it also a lack of understanding of of basic understanding between all the countries 

148.21 155.74 A: yeah i agree with you there too [noise] but i also think that the united states has [noise] 

156.30 166.73 A: well ariel sharon is like a war colonel i'm not anti-semitist it's just like i think if the united states weren't so quick to back up 

167.05 176.87 A: [noise] israel which i think is going to speak for all the purposes then they would be the well i think the main motivation of the united states backing of israel it's 

170.49 171.75 B: which is what 

176.25 179.20 B: okay i'm having a very difficult time hearing you 

179.12 180.52 A: a okay i'm sorry 

180.15 181.48 B: okay that's better 

181.72 188.01 A: i think that the main purpose for the united states backing of israel is for oil 

188.05 192.91 A: [noise] so that it has a place in the middle east where it could operate 

192.68 193.76 B: mhm 

193.68 199.21 A: and i think that it tolerates a lot of abuse 

200.11 204.75 A: of palestinian citizens by the israelis [noise] 

205.19 210.38 B: [lipsmack] now i i agree you i think we the support of israel is a little bit too high 

210.20 211.05 A: uh-huh 

210.69 213.67 B: but i think it's more than just oil i think it's uh 

214.12 215.20 B: money 

215.24 223.78 B: on other things also um who owns the press in the united states who's backing the big companies 

224.05 225.53 B: and i think that 

224.44 226.45 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] that i agree with you there [noise] 

225.75 229.90 B: yeah i think it's a it's deeper than just you know oil type thing 

230.55 231.76 B: but um 

232.62 242.83 B: i think sometimes the the bioterrorism scares me that you could have one crazy person take some type of a mutant strain 

237.51 238.75 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

243.05 247.41 B: of a biological um small pox or ebola 

247.62 251.83 B: and bring it he he would be a suicide type person 

252.00 259.66 B: and be sick and bring it into the country and see how fast it would spread that's that's one of the basic fears that i have 

260.09 263.16 A: yeah i'm not really 

263.25 269.26 A: i'm not really afraid of terrorism why we've just 'cause it isn't it seems so distant 

268.69 269.54 B: mhm 

269.35 273.59 A: 'cause i live in seattle i mean you live in new york and that was 

271.63 272.59 B: correct 

274.12 277.85 A: [noise] right where the world centre trade attacks were so 

276.84 277.79 B: right 

277.91 282.95 A: it's a lot different for me 'cause nothing's ever really happened up her in seattle [noise] at 

279.64 280.50 B: mhm 

283.57 285.15 A: (( least not when i've been alive )) 

284.87 293.62 B: but they still um d- don't you find that there are certain things like uh during the holidays did they do anything to your malls so far as 

293.75 299.93 B: uh you couldn't do underground parking or you couldn't go into certain places 

300.42 303.09 A: [noise] [noise] not that i can recall 

302.47 304.38 B: oh see they did that here 

304.06 304.97 A: (( [noise] huh )) 

304.56 317.28 B: uh a lot of our underground parking by the malls they just they close it close it off during the week days and make you park outside and on weekends if you because it's busier if you want to go 

317.09 322.64 B: into the underground parking [lipsmack] they have somebody inspecting your car 

322.44 323.33 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

322.88 325.06 B: which basically is just some 

325.08 329.09 B: quote security person who is just eyeballing you 

328.80 330.43 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

329.66 336.34 B: and you know if you don't quote fit the the perfect profile i'm sure you know they're letting everybody through 

336.37 340.67 A: uh-huh [noise] do you live in like a suburb or new york or 

340.36 344.69 B: no i live upstate uh i- in the syracuse area 

344.75 345.87 A: (( oh okay )) 

345.54 348.18 B: so to get to the city i'm 

348.85 352.05 B: [lipsmack] it's about a five hour drive 

352.38 355.30 B: four and a half five hour drive to the city 

353.95 354.87 A: (( [noise] uh )) 

355.19 357.52 A: (( oh so upstate's a state of new york )) 

356.84 357.76 B: right 

357.73 359.50 A: yeah i'm not really familiar with the east 

359.54 360.65 B: yeah 

361.57 364.98 B: i've been to seattle i i love seattle [laughter] i must [laughter] 

363.25 367.78 A: coast [noise] yeah i really like it too i live in a suburb about fifteen minutes away 

368.42 369.63 B: from seattle 

369.32 371.09 A: yeah 

369.70 373.30 B: yeah um my son was stationed out there 

373.38 379.34 B: and that's how i originally got out there and uh i i really i thought it was a very beautiful area 

373.68 374.56 A: in 

379.23 381.45 A: yeah is he in the military 

381.13 382.60 B: he's out of it now 

383.06 383.95 A: (( oh yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

383.99 389.99 B: um but ironically right after nine eleven w- my husband and i were were going out 

390.17 399.58 B: uh to seattle and we passed a couple of the uh [lipsmack] military installments and it was amazing the difference in the security 

400.21 405.25 B: from the one the the time before nine eleven and the time after nine eleven 

405.72 407.01 A: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

406.22 408.16 B: so things have tightened up 

409.28 411.32 A: yeah i was well 

411.78 419.79 A: i never was really like out and about seeing anything around that time i was just kinda living at home going to high school and so 

420.17 432.16 A: like it just never really nothing ever really affected me about it 'cause i didn't i don't know anything that was on the east coast or anything so it just kinda seemed really distant far away and 

432.76 433.53 A: (( at )) 

432.79 434.55 B: you mean the actual event 

434.31 443.91 A: yeah and like all this thing all the terrorist stuff and threats it just seems really distant and like it doesn't affect me and like i honestly don't think it will 

434.86 435.69 B: yes 

444.89 447.13 B: right i can understand that 

445.09 446.28 A: (( like i don't know )) 

447.09 448.96 A: yeah 

451.66 456.86 B: i guess it's just uh very similar to when uh california has an earthquake 

456.73 457.56 A: uh-huh 

457.42 466.93 B: and you hear it on the news and you see the devastation and everything but it's it's like okay that's on a whole other end of the country and that's not really affecting 

466.76 474.77 B: me per se it happened and you just see it on t._v. i think that's the other thing you get you see so much on television 

474.74 475.60 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

475.49 479.79 B: that um after a while you become immune to it 

479.42 480.60 A: yeah it's true 

482.71 492.87 B: [noise] like if i if i see another um picture of a hurricane or a a flooded out street or something like that it doesn't really affect me any more 

493.41 494.71 B: because i see 

493.54 496.12 A: (( [noise] [noise] and it's all so sensationalized at the same )) 

495.48 498.02 B: right exactly exactly 

498.27 505.39 A: time that was another thing about nine eleven it was so sensationalized it just i got sick of it and i got sick of 

505.88 513.28 A: like all these makeshift patriots just everybody putting a flag on their car that's not really like supporting the country at all 

513.81 518.27 A: and so they just really it seemed kinda sickening the way it all worked out [noise] 

518.50 525.46 B: mhm i know what you mean to me if you you should have been flying the flag before nine eleven 

525.69 540.30 A: uh-huh [noise] and i also think our nationalism is another thing that i'm not i'm against nationalism for a moral standpoint i think that's another thing that caused the terrorist attacks it seemed like this whole cycle with all this 

540.38 550.64 A: arrogance and pride and like our just united states is people's ignorance to their own country's foreign policy that caused the attack ignorance and apathy [noise] 

550.33 554.32 B: yes yes i know i i i agree with that 

555.24 563.42 B: there uh se- a lot of it is and yo- you need just need to sit down and talk and explain what the differences are and people 

563.53 567.02 B: really you do have to be uh more tolerant but i guess 

567.44 568.64 B: most of the 

568.96 577.37 B: the wars that have been fought have always been holy wars and religious wars if you look back in history so this isn't exactly a a novel thing 

572.40 573.41 A: (( [sigh] [noise] uh-huh )) 

576.94 578.10 A: yeah i know 

579.67 590.41 A: [noise] and i think that calling this a war on terrorism is really like outrageous because you can't fight a war against terrorism because terrorism is 

590.36 595.34 A: the hatred ingrained in the minds of an oppressed people or an occupied people 

595.37 599.89 A: [lipsmack] and that's basically what i think caused nine eleven is united states' treatment
