12.89 15.19 B: oh ah well 

15.66 24.18 B: i ah i'm of the i'm of the mindset that they could ah stop attacking other countries ah without you know just cause [laughter] 

24.53 35.07 A: [mn] that's yeah that's a and that was the first thing that kind of came to my mind um you know obviously if you don't have any enemies nobody will attack you 

29.40 31.05 B: [laughter] 

34.56 48.15 B: yeah a preemptive strike ah wouldn't hold up in any court in the land i mean if ah if i thought that you were going to kill me but i had no evidence and ah i went and killed you first and called it a preemptive strike i'd be in prison for life 

48.21 53.96 A: um that's absolutely true now st- steve tell me where is it you're from what city

63.75 66.04 A: oh [noise] um 

66.56 77.84 A: well one could argue and i'm just playing devil's advocate here that you know this world has billions of people in it and that 

70.68 71.63 B: right 

75.40 76.15 B: right 

78.33 85.72 A: you know even if you're the world's nicest country ah switzerland or something out of those billions somebody's gonna not like you 

82.62 83.65 B: right 

85.54 86.98 B: right 

86.61 90.48 A: and if a [mn] you know and if enough people don't like you 

92.28 94.75 A: you know at some point they're gonna attack you 

95.74 98.39 B: possibly possibly um 

97.84 99.49 A: i mean it's kind of 

98.88 104.70 B: i mean a place like switzerland doesn't have an army to attack but i guess you mean like individuals or ah sects or 

104.45 105.32 A: indi- 

105.02 107.27 B: like ah terrorist cells and 

106.65 109.92 A: yes individuals or [mn] yeah 

107.88 108.75 B: yeah 

109.73 111.20 B: um 

110.85 113.97 A: and i've heard actually switzerland has a fairly big army 

113.43 114.85 B: is that right 

114.25 116.06 A: yeah that's what i've [noise] heard 

115.82 116.67 B: (( oh )) 

116.30 119.03 A: they don't ever have to use it but they've got one 

118.51 121.17 B: they're neutral and they have an oh i didn't know that okay 

121.44 122.68 B: um 

122.57 129.91 A: i mean it's in i in an ideal world everybody likes everybody but the reality is people don't like the u._s. [mn] 

126.76 127.72 B: yeah 

129.49 143.51 B: well you know there's there's a lot of ah history to them not liking the u._s. we've given them a lot of reason ah with our our sanctions and our unfair policies and our hypocritical stances on things um and preemptive striking doesn't help 

143.38 145.89 B: of course but um 

146.43 152.71 B: i would say that we've supplied most of our enemies with their weapons we've trained most of our enemies at one time or another 

152.72 159.35 B: we've been in bed with most of our enemies at one time or another we've acted similarly to our enemies against other countries 

159.53 161.09 B: and um 

161.37 164.91 B: when we've gone into a lot of countries and ah 

164.81 179.22 B: for whatever reason you know not necessarily the reasons purported on tv but for whatever reason we've gone into these other countries and done our damage or whatever is it a lot of times we've either left them devastated or we've left them with a dictator in place or a c._i._a. sponsored dictator or a 

179.11 192.67 B: ah leader of our choosing and ah much like we're doing right now and it doesn't give much reason for people to like us especially children who have lost their parents or parents who have lost their children you know and a lot of these generations you know as they 

192.76 194.61 B: as they continue they um 

194.91 197.34 B: [lipsmack] their their hatred is there 

196.74 198.57 A: well given all that 

198.00 199.23 B: yeah 

198.68 201.16 A: ah i am you know i'm not saying the 

200.54 203.22 B: no no i know you're playing the devil's advocate i appreciate that 

202.15 213.61 A: these these people don't like us for whatever reason whether it be a good reason or a bad reason [noise] ah they don't like us some of them have the means to harm us as a country 

205.20 206.07 B: yeah 

207.65 208.61 B: right 

213.67 214.69 B: right 

213.82 216.08 A: what what do we do to prevent that 

215.55 225.27 B: well i say let's open up the channels of communication let's let's you know saddam challenged ah bush to a debate and bush just said oh the he's stalling you know i mean let let's have these debates let's let's 

225.26 232.82 B: let's let the peace process work let's let's have a meeting as the united nations is supposed to be of the countries let's have ah a meeting of the minds 

232.90 236.45 B: and if something needs to be done i i would venture to guess 

236.53 246.12 B: well you know they've shot in so many different directions on what their goal was with this war ah if we're talking about this war i mean you know it's a broad topic but um 

246.36 257.85 B: are we going in to remove the leader are we going in to try and wipe out terrorism i i don't know it gets very vague after a while but whatever the individual issue is that's what should be addressed and if it really comes down to taking out a leader 

257.97 267.87 B: then i'd say send a special unit down there you know so take him out you know don't blow up a whole city but i guess that's off topic um specifically for bioterrorism 

267.48 269.20 A: mhm 

269.16 270.36 B: (( ah )) 

271.20 276.35 B: you know there's nothing you you can't do anything that gonna make anybody a hundred percent safe but what you can do is 

276.45 280.85 B: ah live the best live as the best example that you can 

280.85 286.51 B: and and then you'll have less reasons for people to attack you'll have less enemies 

286.50 291.66 B: you know i mean people aren't trying to attack switzerland why you know like you said even if they're ah 

291.44 293.32 B: the nicest bunch somebody's gonna hate them 

293.19 307.86 B: okay well i'm not hearing about bioterrorism attacks there i'm not hearing about countries uprising and hating these people you know it's very limited if there's somebody out there who does actually hate one of these people it's very very small and limited and it say let's limit those numbers let's be a better example than we're being 

307.59 308.16 A: (( [noise] )) 

308.23 313.27 A: well i think that is probably sound advice in the long run 

312.97 313.90 B: yeah 

313.33 315.41 A: but these people who we have 

315.54 317.68 B: it's too late for that you're saying kind of 

315.65 316.61 A: (( ye- )) 

317.10 323.99 A: yeah or or you know what we we could start doing that now and it will still take probably 

317.92 319.15 B: yeah 

324.34 327.27 A: two three generations before the hate 

326.88 341.63 B: it would depend on what kind of action we took like let's say we ah we took bush out of- ah let's say did like ah an investigation into the two thousand election and said wait a minute this wasn't just th- this went all wrong well how how did we have such a breakdown all the way up to the supreme court on this 

327.52 328.77 A: dissipates 

341.65 353.44 B: ah let's you know remove him from office or let's ah if there was some drastic action taken i think that would send a message to the world i i you know but given that that's a very limited possiblity 

354.11 355.40 A: (( i think there's )) 

354.14 354.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

355.14 356.20 B: what what 

355.51 357.54 A: zero possibility of that 

356.91 359.77 B: yeah um 

359.28 362.87 A: and then the others do they hate bush or do the hate the u._s. 

362.56 370.10 B: well i think i think they ah i think they kind of blend the two but i think for sure you know they have a hatred of the bush family 

370.18 374.44 B: um i think they're all united on that [lipsmack] um 

376.32 390.99 B: well you know again i would say let's just make as quick a changes as we can let's just you know let's just do the best we can every day counts you know i mean that that's the best i could say i mean right now peace marches are on the rise i think that's sends a big message you know i mean um 

391.00 395.91 B: it it it's not it's not a one answer thing you know but as far as ah 

396.33 408.71 B: something like bioterrorism i really don't think living a life if fear is gonna help i mean we have countries all over the world that are living in fear of this every day and it's a real threat it's more it's more than a you know code orange that they wake up to on t._v. 

408.51 421.15 B: it's it's you know it's it's something that they live with as a very real possibility from moment to moment that their their father when they go outside might be blown to pieces or that their the building right next to them might not exist tomorrow you know i mean the these 

421.25 429.64 B: we live we live in a you know kind of media bubble we don't really have the very real threats so now that we are getting a taste of it or at least we're 

429.90 432.73 B: the media's telling us we have a taste of it um 

433.13 437.39 B: you know i i don't think that we need to overreact to it i mean i think ah i 

437.78 444.85 A: [noise] oh but terrorism can i mean look at your own your own city got attacked by terrorists not bioterrorism but 

444.20 451.48 B: don't know who attacked my city you know to be honest ah all i know is c._n._n. said that it was these people in afghanistan um 

446.45 447.28 A: well 

450.93 452.08 A: well it's un- 

452.29 453.20 A: you can't 

452.38 464.50 B: you know i don't know that these weren't c._i._a. people of you know or or c._i._a. brainwashed people or any any number of possibilities and the investigation is headed by a war criminal you know henry kissinger for a while he had to step down 

459.70 460.92 A: but it but it 

462.66 466.60 A: but it's beyond it's beyond dispute that it got attacked 

466.27 469.02 B: ah yeah it got attacked it did i mean 

468.03 472.29 A: it got got attacked and a lot of people died because of that a 

470.07 471.27 B: it did 

471.43 472.96 B: absolutely 

472.38 475.71 A: lot of people suffered a lot of innocent people suffered 

475.10 484.21 B: absolutely i had friends in there myself ah it it was a devastating day it's my birthday it's just a terrible day all around i i totally would agree with that 

483.75 490.24 A: and i i think you would agree that stuff like that you wanna avoid in the future you wanna avoid having that happen 

489.39 504.12 B: i do but you know there were enough warnings issued to the c._i._a. and f._b._i. that it was going to happen and they ignored it and i feel like then they acted on it once it did happen to their own self interests i feel like they sometimes allow these things to happen and these other people like osama and people are just pawns 

504.04 517.35 B: whether they know it or not and ah that's that's you know that comes down to an opinion on the matter that that's how i feel about it um so given that i feel like the real terrorists end up being our own politicians at the top or our own corporate leaders 

517.30 524.54 B: and so um when you have that kind of climate or you believe that that's the climate that exists then it it becomes a different story you're dealing with 

524.60 525.97 B: you know i don't i ah 

526.43 527.66 B: you know i i'm 

528.31 531.56 B: my patriotism lies in the fact that i think this country could be great 

531.60 536.46 B: and i think this country could be free and i think it has more potential for that than most countries 

536.36 550.85 B: and i think in that sense you know i i find it a real violation to my patriotism or to my freedom to have these kind of leaders existing who allow these kind of things to take place or who capitalize on these things and profit from these things um in one sense or another 

551.51 556.26 A: [noise] well i i think ah mr bush definitely did profit from it 

555.74 557.07 B: yeah 

556.54 557.65 A: but i 

557.30 567.20 B: all of them giuliani profited from it i mean you name it i don't know if giul- you know i'm i'm not even trying to implicate all of them but i'm just saying in one way or another they all jumped on and profited 

566.58 575.94 A: oh i i think you're right they did although i and maybe this is just a wish on my part i i don't think mr bush wanted that to happen 

576.33 589.65 B: you know i don't think mr bush is very in the know about much i think probably his father's more in the know about what's happening or not happening his father used to be the head of the c._i._a. his father was the foreign liaison to china during vietnam his father's had his hands dirty for many many years 

589.72 599.95 B: um but i do know that ah you know that this president who starts these wars ah i don't think he's doing it out of his own mindset 'cause the guy had never been to another
