183.79 184.73 A: (( um )) 

185.04 192.53 A: no i haven't watched the volleyball on i i like the volleyball games but i haven't really watched that on television 

192.41 195.21 B: i don't even i didn't even know it was on television tele- 

195.38 199.93 A: well i'm sure on like we get a special satellite we've got a lot of 

199.88 200.66 B: (( um )) 

199.94 203.62 A: e._s._p._n. and a lot of those 

201.01 207.08 B: right right yeah we have cable but it's you know you don't get as much as you do with satellite 

207.02 208.90 A: yeah 

207.22 222.05 B: right yeah i mean actually my husband would be much better on this conversation 'cause he watches you know football baseball basketball hockey all that stuff and i never watch any of it or very rarely he'll call me in if there's something particularly exciting going on you know but 

214.43 215.39 A: [laughter] 

221.25 222.67 A: yeah 

222.94 224.15 A: that's true 

224.74 228.39 A: i i don't have too much well mainly watch news 

228.48 234.60 B: yes [laughter] i yeah me too but we're supposed to talk about sports so it's a little tough 

229.40 236.33 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

235.17 240.72 B: i guess we could talk about the sports we see on the news i don't know if that would count but um 

239.51 245.11 A: that's right yeah i guess that's how i mainly keep up with baseball [laughter] 

242.77 250.77 B: yeah that's true but baseball's sort of like that you can just like you can hear the score and the stats and you sort of know exactly where the game is you know 

250.39 251.68 A: yeah 

250.89 253.27 B: it really lends itself to that easily 

253.48 254.74 A: yeah or 

254.93 257.46 A: football a lot of times you hear that 

257.18 266.88 B: yeah now i'm and i'm not a football fan at all so i mean i like baseball and basketball a lot more so i don't even like go to football games but 

263.55 264.72 A: yeah 

267.76 268.64 B: (( [mn] i don't know )) 

268.63 271.17 B: we have the celtics here so you know that's a big 

271.08 283.95 B: draw for basketball and the bruins for hockey and the red sox for baseball so it's easy enough to go to any of those games well other than getting the tickets but i mean it's close enough that it's easy to get to 

279.27 280.65 A: yeah 

283.99 290.83 B: but um yeah don't really go watch much of it on t._v. i think because it's so easy to go to games live 

290.31 291.27 A: (( really )) 

291.36 292.74 B: yeah 

291.92 295.68 A: we every so often though my husband likes to watch hockey 

295.86 296.83 B: yeah 

296.91 298.64 A: he'll watch that 

298.58 302.42 B: yeah i don't hockey's not too bad on t._v. 'cause it's quick 

302.48 310.59 A: yeah it is [laughter] real quick and plus my um mummy sister in law's a big hockey fan too [mn] 

303.68 304.66 B: yeah 

310.82 311.59 B: ah 

311.40 313.83 A: she likes to go to the games more so 

314.48 319.57 A: than ah than watching on television but i guess if she had to watch it on television she would 

319.23 320.52 B: you're right 

321.57 323.07 A: (( but um [mn] )) 

323.38 327.37 A: ah what other kind of sports do they have a lot of on 

327.42 328.36 B: (( i don't watch )) 

327.69 329.82 A: (( bowling on yeah )) 

328.58 331.04 B: that [laughter] but i know it's on 

330.64 335.04 A: yeah i do like i i used i didn't used to watch the pro um 

336.59 337.56 A: where they 

337.60 340.99 A: the pros on ah bowling every so often 

341.73 344.37 A: and i did i used to bowl myself

354.61 356.32 A: your husband likes golf 

356.36 360.76 B: kind of i mean he doesn't even play it but i think he just likes watching it you know 

361.03 363.48 B: and i remember when my son was really little 

363.33 377.82 B: he would um you know like two years old or something he would sit in front of the t._v. and watch golf and i think he just like liked the way they talk how they taught them that little whisper you know he's approaching the seventh hole and it was very calming or something you know 

369.31 370.69 A: [laughter] 

373.18 374.77 A: [laughter] 

375.90 376.98 A: [laughter] 

378.99 379.76 A: (( ah )) 

380.08 382.68 B: but other than that we don't really watch 

383.32 391.61 B: a lot of times the t._v.'s kind of in the background on the weekends when sports are on and i'm not really watching but you know the boys in my house are kind of 

386.54 388.61 A: yeah that's true 

391.88 398.00 B: in and out of their room keeping their keeping tracks of the score and reporting to each other and that kind of stuff 

395.50 396.79 A: yeah

411.28 413.05 A: [laughter] 

412.06 419.75 B: [laughter] he bought me like a nascar deck of cards and put it in my stocking at christmas and stuff but i'm really not a fan at all

438.66 439.80 B: yeah
