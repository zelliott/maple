16.71 23.20 B: well i don't know what to lead this is about bioterrorism right and the united states i'm a canadian 

19.76 20.70 A: uh-huh 

21.35 22.32 A: yes 

24.67 26.09 B: but so i

28.57 29.94 B: yes i am 

29.08 30.70 A: i'm living in america 

30.49 35.68 B: okay well you but you probably know more about bioterrorism than i do right 

30.95 31.88 A: yeah 

34.83 39.77 A: well not yet [laughter] and i hope i never will [laughter] 

36.91 38.39 B: not yet [laughter] 

38.96 48.04 B: oh right right well that's biological terrorism right with gases and stuff like that and how can how can the united states avoid 

42.68 43.65 A: yes 

43.76 45.54 A: yeah yeah 

48.20 49.54 A: yeah i mean 

48.64 50.42 B: it that's our question right 

49.58 52.06 A: yeah do you have any ideas on that 

53.31 55.24 B: well i'm not sure i uh 

55.71 60.11 B: i was quite impressed with what george bush did there wh- in iraq [laughter] 

60.43 61.42 B: um 

60.89 68.55 A: yeah but i don't really think that's gonna do anything [laughter] you know if somebody wants to release bioterrorism agents here 

64.33 65.17 B: pardon 

68.98 70.15 B: right 

69.36 71.68 A: i think they'll just go ahead and do it 

71.09 75.17 B: yeah well i guess i think the thing is uh preventative medicine 

72.00 72.78 A: (( you know )) 

74.74 75.76 A: right 

75.38 79.72 B: to try to find out what they have before they let it go right 

78.49 82.29 A: well yeah well you've got to find the people who have it right 

82.25 84.61 B: you don't have the people 

84.54 91.69 A: well i mean they're not gonna send stuff over from you know the middle east or faraway they're gonna send it from within the country 

91.29 103.16 B: well yeah that's that's another thing the united nations would be involved in that more than because the united states only has a small part a small say in that right the united nations ultimately decides 

99.98 101.00 A: mhm 

104.34 110.31 B: what's going to happen because it was u- united nation that went into iraq to look for those um 

110.48 112.33 B: to look for the weapons wasn't it 

112.18 115.67 A: yeah but isn't america stopping them from going back now 

115.86 117.63 A: because they wanna look themselves 

117.55 120.41 B: america's stopping them from going back now 

120.50 122.56 A: isn't that isn't that the way it is 

122.56 126.21 B: i don't know i don't know what's happening i don't watch t._v. 

126.05 127.04 A: what never 

127.16 128.07 B: pardon 

127.68 128.48 A: (( never )) 

128.54 129.35 B: no 

129.47 130.61 A: wow 

130.07 131.90 B: no i don't have a t._v. 

131.74 134.50 A: gosh that's so scary do you listen to the radio 

134.74 136.10 B: (( very little )) 

135.64 137.17 A: read newspapers 

137.11 138.61 B: uh on saturdays 

138.55 140.35 A: (( [laughter] on saturdays )) 

140.81 143.47 A: not the big one on sunday right [laughter] 

142.68 145.12 B: [laughter] well our our big one comes on saturdays 

144.12 149.43 A: [laughter] okay all right well that's not so bad [laughter] at least you know what's happening [laughter] 

145.27 146.27 B: (( so )) 

148.58 155.91 B: yeah i well i've got some idea but this um you know bioterrorism i i'm not sure where they're going with it now 

155.97 168.26 B: but i think the the whole thing is to i mean they have so much intelligence they knew what saddam hussein was doing all along right like they know so much what's going on somewhere else 

168.63 170.36 B: i don't know how that works 

169.75 174.84 A: yeah but i mean it's it's more than just iraq isn't it i mean you know what about anthrax 

173.28 174.11 B: right 

174.78 176.27 B: right right 

175.25 180.38 A: you know that was a bioterrorism attack of some sort here even though we don't know who it was 

180.13 181.90 B: right 

180.41 182.11 A: (( or or you know that's )) 

182.16 186.82 A: you know if that's what's gonna happen i think what's gonna people is we don't know 

186.65 188.45 B: yeah well that's true 

187.44 191.60 A: with no agenda that we know of you know it's like a lucky 

190.12 191.18 B: right 

191.91 194.70 A: or unlucky you know if you are the recipient 

194.59 195.80 B: yeah it's 

195.04 197.04 A: i don't know that you can prevent that 

197.15 207.86 B: i well no it's a it would be very difficult to prevent it but i think the things you know looking when they know there is an enemy and they know who that enemy is 

205.78 206.91 A: mhm 

208.02 214.51 B: then they're able to go like they did in iraqi and go look at all their find out what all the weapons they have right 

214.04 215.95 A: right but did they find anything 

216.89 217.72 B: no 

217.33 219.16 A: [laughter] 

218.14 222.62 B: but but they did have some uh they did but they did know uh 

222.72 228.49 B: i don't think they found anything when they went in there but they did have information that there was some elsewhere 

228.66 229.66 A: (( so oh okay )) 

229.12 234.79 B: in another storage somewhere i think he had moved it or was moving it during the night or something like that 

234.27 235.22 A: (( right )) 

234.97 239.84 B: so uh i think with the intelligence nowadays they get a lot of information 

240.13 242.58 B: and i don't know how they manage to do that 

242.31 246.74 A: mhm but can they act on it that's the what's the step after the information 

246.43 248.21 B: rig- right that's right because 

247.16 253.74 A: you know what are are they going to prevent it crossing into american airspace or on the ground in america 

253.49 257.67 B: well yeah because that kind of stuff even you know if they're 

257.82 265.11 B: like like the anthrax right that was in the envelopes right and so that would be very difficult to detect in 

260.43 262.28 A: yeah yeah 

265.42 269.04 B: in a suitcase or luggage or anything like that 

269.65 274.77 B: and so often they have it in their body cavities right and so they can uh 

272.43 273.55 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

275.21 278.51 B: they can attack that way little by little 

278.62 282.21 A: mm do you think there'd ever be a major attack or not 

282.50 285.14 B: i don't think there will ever be a major attack no 

284.47 287.31 A: no i think it's more likely to be the smaller 

287.72 290.55 A: harder to find [laughter] person you know 

289.82 291.76 B: yeah yeah i 

290.90 292.66 A: (( do you think that too )) 

292.82 298.48 B: yeah i i i'm not too worried about it i don't think it's you know i don't think it's really imminent 

297.97 298.87 A: (( mm )) 

298.49 299.77 B: but uh 

300.50 310.40 A: um i'm not that you know these things happen with something like that i don't think you can do anything about it anyway you know i mean as an average joe you can't do anything about it 

307.01 307.93 B: (( yeah )) 

310.00 311.78 B: that's right exactly 

311.00 313.80 A: you know some idiot's going to get on the train with stuff 

313.70 314.64 B: mhm 

314.08 316.40 A: and you're on the train it's just bad luck isn't it 

316.27 318.98 B: yeah that's right that's right exactly 

316.89 317.71 A: (( you know )) 

318.57 322.06 A: and what are you gonna do are you gonna screen every person that goes on the subway 

322.41 323.64 B: yeah well 

323.27 325.67 A: you know there won't be a subway [laughter] 

324.84 335.98 B: but if they use as soon as they they start they find techniques to detect the stuff then they come up with a new plan to get it through some other way or in a different um 

333.44 334.53 A: yeah 

336.60 338.26 B: in a different form 

337.96 338.93 A: yeah 

338.36 347.04 B: where it might be powder before then it they make it into liquid and they're not watch- and the united states wouldn't be watching for a liquid they'd be watching for the powder 

342.92 343.85 A: mhm 

345.72 348.90 A: yeah i think i think they have some air detectors 

349.19 351.14 A: floating around here somewhere 

351.16 356.99 A: but i don't know how fast it is to detect stuff you know they take samples and you know yeah 

355.34 356.08 B: really 

356.57 358.06 B: air detectors 

357.51 360.12 A: yeah they can detect some stuff in the air 

359.94 363.37 B: okay i have a carbon monoxide detector but that's it 

362.34 373.36 A: right well they have you know a similar sort of thing i i can't remember you know what they were looking for but of course by the time we found out you know we'd all be dead anyway [laughter] 

366.23 367.02 B: well 

372.34 373.84 B: do they detect anything 

373.60 378.23 A: you know no not yet but i they they they're taking air samplings every day 

377.48 380.69 B: [mn] oh really oh that's interesting 

378.48 382.69 A: yeah but i i don't know what they're you know sampling for 

382.55 384.10 B: where did you get those 

384.58 386.37 B: like at the store or 

385.57 394.31 A: no i think it's a you know it's a government thing i mean we're you know it's not a personal thing i think you know in general the government is does have these things 

388.96 390.15 B: oh really 

394.98 395.87 B: oh 

395.89 400.29 A: yeah i don't think they're that advanced or you know they can't protect everything 

400.16 401.75 B: right oh yeah 

401.11 410.36 A: it's like you know you do as you said for the carbon monoxide they test for that so i think that's sort of the way forward but that's not deterrent that's after the fact you know 

409.98 413.44 B: right right exactly yeah i 

413.63 426.37 B: i don't know i think it's too difficult to detect that kind of thing because because it changes so fast technology's always changing and once once they start looking for something and they're screening for a for a certain thing 

426.34 433.96 B: or a certain substance then the criminals or the bad guys know it right away and then they just change their method or you know 

432.32 433.68 A: (( mhm mm yeah )) 

434.31 438.83 B: so i i find i think it would be very difficult to um 

439.02 441.10 B: to stop bioterrorism 

442.70 448.74 A: what do you think about having the um the anti radiation pills that they have now 

449.25 451.74 B: [laughter] i haven't heard of that [laughter] 

450.64 454.08 A: [laughter] oh you don't know that they sell them in the store here 

453.82 455.93 B: you have anti radiation pills 

455.55 462.48 A: it's uh you know the the radiation affects your thyroid or something so this is like iodine pills or something 

459.66 460.65 B: right 

462.15 463.18 B: really 

462.58 463.65 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

464.53 466.98 B: and when are you supposed to use those 

466.38 469.37 A: (( [laughter] i don't know after there's an attack [laughter] i guess )) 

469.76 471.88 B: oh that's interesting 

471.28 472.72 A: yeah 

472.02 476.37 B: well i mean you get radiation when you take x ra- when you get x rays taken right 

475.49 477.33 A: oh yeah i think it means you know 

477.11 479.77 B: but that's just not very much so i guess 

478.76 479.86 A: (( nuclear )) 

480.00 483.16 A: fallout type radiation yeah 

480.00 480.76 B: (( okay )) 

483.47 486.20 B: well that's interesting anti radiation pills 

485.65 486.88 A: mhm 

487.85 489.09 B: (( [laughter] i am )) 

488.40 491.35 A: see what you're missing up in canada eh [laughter] 

490.27 499.59 B: i know i know we do miss a lot here [laughter] i'm sure thankful for it though too i am very thankful for our country [laughter] 

492.08 492.64 A: (( yeah )) 

493.82 495.29 A: [laughter] 

499.83 504.16 B: i uh yeah well i guess we're far behind in stuff like that oh 

503.50 509.08 A: well you know we live in new york so of course everybody's you know hyper paying attention here so 

506.71 507.68 B: (( what was your )) 

509.01 517.51 B: oh new york yeah i can imagine that would be a little bit uh worse than some other places maybe [laughter] than north carolina or 

510.14 511.15 A: (( oh yeah )) 

517.17 518.24 A: (( mm yeah )) 

517.84 520.00 B: [laughter] oh that's interesting 

520.93 525.53 B: so the gover- so the government has these things out there and they're preparing they're 

526.43 529.35 B: either they're preparing or they're scaring somebo- people 

529.21 534.78 A: oh they're definitely scaring people but mostly it's the uh [laughter] civilian population 

531.24 532.20 B: yeah 

534.60 535.79 B: it's the which 

535.61 540.97 A: it's us that they're scaring you know i don't think they'd scare off anybody that wanted to do anything 

537.69 538.56 B: right 

540.25 542.30 B: no that's right exactly 

541.21 543.02 A: you know they're just scaring us 

542.86 550.92 B: that's right that's right that's the way it is even with this sars business like it's scaring the people in general not you know 

546.35 547.63 A: yeah 

551.07 555.23 B: but now with so much media attention things often get blown out of proportion 

555.62 562.18 A: yeah yeah i do think it's good to pay attention to these things but you know there's attention and panicking 

556.13 557.35 B: and uh 

562.22 565.43 A: you know and i think there's a big difference between the two 

562.68 563.67 B: right 

564.49 568.86 B: mhm mhm yeah well i have yeah but but 

568.37 574.78 A: i mean you know they had a big run on gas masks here last year you know i mean what are you going to do with a gas mask 

571.36 572.45 B: right 

574.54 576.84 B: that's right yes i yes 

575.41 587.83 A: you know if it comes and there's you know whatever horrible bioterrorist attack the chances are by the time you've breathed it in that's it anyway and you're not going to have it on you and you're not going to know until the next day what happens [laughter] 

584.03 584.74 B: right 

587.55 591.01 B: right exactly and do you want to live with all that 

587.86 588.70 A: (( you know )) 

590.45 594.62 A: well exactly i mean if it's your time it's your time you know what you gonna do 

591.82 592.61 B: [laughter] 

593.59 594.46 B: pardon 

594.65 597.04 A: if it's your time that's it 

596.23 599.89 B: that's right yeah yeah you can you can read about it forever 

597.05 598.09 A: (( you know ))
