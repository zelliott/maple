0.10 2.14 A: hi my name is diane 

1.95 5.07 B: hi it's emily i'm calling from new york 

5.04 5.77 A: (( uh )) 

5.73 8.12 B: i'm calling from new york my name is emily 

7.90 11.13 A: oh my name is diane and i'm calling from buffalo new york 

10.60 12.74 B: hi my mother's name is diane 

12.33 13.46 A: (( ah )) 

13.38 16.38 B: so let's just talk about um bioterrorism right 

16.02 17.17 A: right 

17.56 30.20 A: well i was you know this is it's kind of a scary set of circumstances when you think that it can come through the air and can be through your food or even through water [laughter] as you're drinking from the tap 

28.05 29.35 B: i never 

29.92 32.45 B: i never knew it could be in food 

32.78 36.81 A: sure because actually um they could you know 

37.10 43.90 A: let's say spray or get something in uh your actual vegetables or produce that you're you know getting from a grocery store 

43.42 44.36 B: produce 

44.41 45.52 A: yeah 

45.74 47.17 B: i didn't think of that 

47.11 49.92 A: yeah it's it's kinda scary when you think about it 

49.33 51.22 B: with the crop dusters right 

50.78 53.82 A: right or yeah that's a good point too 

54.07 56.76 A: crop dusters i never thought of that 

56.80 61.23 A: i was thinking more like people going into the store you know and just 

60.01 60.79 B: uh-huh 

61.96 66.23 A: you know like sneezing or having some kind of a small aerosol 

66.15 67.42 B: yeah 

66.80 70.21 A: item that they could spray it with 

69.44 77.04 B: i mean i i guess i used to think that they could hit uh one city at a time like literally a city but i don't they have the techno- i 

77.18 81.21 B: you know just kind of heard that i don't think they have the technology to hit large areas 

81.71 86.11 A: no just i imagine it would depend on how many people they have as 

86.29 89.74 A: whether like they're like sleeper cells or whatever but 

89.15 90.42 B: whether they're what 

90.13 94.05 A: if they have like a sleeper cell of people in an area 

92.83 93.60 B: uh-huh 

94.47 100.03 A: course i only say that because i'm close to that area where they had that lackawanna six [laughter] 

99.87 100.68 B: uh-huh 

100.63 105.40 A: that they had uh six people that were uh involved in um [noise] 

105.72 107.56 A: al qaeda training but 

107.47 109.47 B: or they could have a group of people 

109.00 115.92 A: right and it doesn't have to be al qaeda or afghanistan's it could be anybody you know that would be doing bioterrorism 

116.03 124.04 B: and i i don't really know of any ways that they could prevent this 'cause i think anybody could hide things something in a suitcase or briefcase or 

124.94 126.14 A: that's true 

125.54 138.17 B: [noise] a backpack i'd i don't there's so many people and so many i mean the world's so big i don't think i don't think there's really anything anyone can do but i i think those u._n. inspectors do help 

138.65 141.05 B: the inspectors in iraq 

140.54 141.50 A: right 

142.41 150.18 A: i agree with it it's kind of uh a scary thing because as long as you think about it in the in the u._s. there's so many in the 

150.36 162.10 A: even now with the border patrols that they have um even looking really we're talking about that sars virus coming across they said they were looking for people but still i don't know whether or not 

153.49 154.55 B: mhm 

162.38 174.36 A: they would be looking for small quantities i think a small quantity of some kind of a liquid or gas or something could be brought in you know and built up over a period time 

169.92 170.67 B: mhm 

174.45 176.94 A: and then all of a sudden used 

177.18 184.79 A: for people and i don't know whether or not it would be something if there was a bioterrorist attack on let's say through food or through 

185.12 194.02 A: um even through your water system you know that would be a large quantity i would think that they could get a lot of people with but with food i don't know what 

187.56 188.35 B: mhm 

194.77 201.48 A: depending on what they infected you with whether or not it could then be spread airborne as an infectious disease 

201.99 209.24 B: i mean maybe they could somebody could bring some tank over and pour something into the water supply into a reservoir 

209.52 211.01 B: something like that 

210.40 222.69 A: [noise] i think a tank would be a little more difficult because um in order for you to come into or um transport there are certain documents that have to be taken and especially in anything that has 

220.53 221.29 B: mhm 

222.69 229.64 A: a gas or a liquid tank uh capability um they do take samples 

226.67 227.42 B: mhm 

229.60 230.75 B: (( oh )) 

230.19 242.11 A: yeah periodically you know especially now i would think they would be doing it i'm not sure but i do know that for a while i was involved in the trucking industry um both as a broker and as um 

238.50 239.29 B: uh-huh 

242.38 248.32 A: [lipsmack] a driver and i do know that the paperwork involved in the end is pretty uh pretty strict 

243.28 244.08 B: uh-huh 

247.85 248.68 B: uh-huh 

248.34 252.35 A: so i think that would be probably less have to do it but 

252.90 257.92 A: not to say that you know they wouldn't take unless they hijack 

258.01 264.87 A: something that's already has paperwork that we are wo- moving internally for inst- 

263.88 267.45 B: i don't yeah i i think somebody could sneak in somewhere 

266.87 270.70 A: you know let's say something that was uh taken from a uh 

270.81 276.94 A: westfald uh you know like reactors or something like that that they're taking the um 

277.49 284.26 A: the liquid from there from the from the coolant agents and that where they would have to take it to a place to be disposed of 

283.68 284.70 B: mhm 

284.36 292.72 A: and then somebody could take that and possible infect the water or ground water or even just an area food or 

293.63 296.50 A: you know into a city and [mn] 

296.53 298.85 A: who knows what [laughter] 

298.58 299.53 B: i mean 

299.59 311.96 B: there are things that that we can do to prevent things with security but the generally i think if somebody really worked it out they could sneak something in somehow 

304.26 305.81 A: [lipsmack] yes i agree 

311.69 312.61 A: right 

312.03 317.16 B: i think there would be ways to do it that people wouldn't wouldn't know 

317.53 325.12 A: right it's it's amazing that they have um what they have now uh with a lot of the security systems people say they don't want 

325.11 335.88 A: a lot of the security cameras and stuff out but i think that's a good way because they were able to trace quite a bit of uh information that was going out over nine eleven just by using security cameras 

335.28 336.70 B: [lipsmack] oh yeah 

336.32 344.86 A: you know between the banks and just even the ones that monitor on the on the roadways i've become more heightened because of that of the things that are around me 

336.82 337.81 B: mhm 

342.37 343.15 B: mhm 

344.57 345.32 B: mhm 

346.03 348.39 A: but you're right i think security has a 

348.43 351.88 A: um a big part of it and think i that 

351.97 357.29 A: some of the security measures that are in place now have a little bit of um 

357.86 360.97 A: [lipsmack] uh they're not as stringent as they could be 

360.85 361.76 B: right 

362.05 366.09 A: right it's a kind of hard thing to do especially when you're trained to 

366.53 369.56 A: eliminate the bioterrorist and end of it you know 

369.41 372.60 B: right i mean nothing has happened so far 

372.87 375.08 B: and i don't really worry about it 

375.91 378.28 B: like on an everyday basis but 

378.67 382.01 B: i think something could happen and i don't think there'll be anything 

382.32 386.73 B: we any anyone could do to prevent it 'cause we're obviously not gonna 

386.77 389.38 B: you know heist it somehow so that 

390.14 392.08 B: they won't get discovered [noise] 

391.67 392.69 A: right 

393.05 402.74 A: well you're right i think it's just a matter of you know if they really wanted to do it they could do it you know and even if it was on a security level you know they could infiltrate 

398.30 399.35 B: yeah 

403.04 404.42 A: get past that p- 

404.43 411.68 A: that person or you know pretend that they were actually or even apply as a security guard and become 

412.04 415.49 A: uh an intricate part of like an inside job to 

414.98 416.73 B: right 

415.94 420.06 A: facilitate that but you're right and it would have to be a 

418.81 430.86 B: [noise] somebody could pose as a farmer and in inject poison into grapes the the toxic and have you know trucks and trucks of these grapes coming in i think that there is millions of ways somebody could do something 

431.81 434.78 B: but um i mean if they are arabs 

432.09 433.13 A: (( that's true )) 

435.92 436.88 B: (( um )) 

436.95 439.57 B: they might be seen as suspicious 

440.32 449.35 A: [sigh] well you know the other thing is too is i suppose that um other than food and even the water it could just be perhaps um 

449.53 452.26 A: like they were talking about these dirty bombs 

452.94 461.73 A: and you know having something in a car or a a small even a p- small pickup truck and if that was exploded that could be 

461.74 465.16 A: a form of getting any kind of like a gas or 

465.25 467.62 A: um liquid into the air that 

468.16 476.72 A: you know get a good windy day or something [laughter] i know i've had my garbage cans rolled around you know quite all over the yard just on a windy day and you figure if there's 

476.90 483.56 A: [noise] infectious material in the um in the air that could travel for quite a distance and get uh populace quite i- 

481.55 482.71 B: right 

482.93 488.11 B: well i also have heard i don't know if it is for i've heard that they don't have the technology to hit large areas 

490.06 493.30 B: like masses of land and acres and acres 

492.93 502.15 A: right but i think the terrorism end of it is the fact that even if they do it to a small area you know whether it be um 

502.56 504.49 A: you know just a small 

505.34 513.84 A: you know suburban or urban area that they hit and then they realize that this isn't something that's like a 

513.88 520.45 A: you know just a regular cold or flu or something like that now it becomes something else and that everybody becomes 

520.57 527.44 A: paralyzed because that's the terror of it is it gonna happen to us and what are we doing about it and people get panicky 

527.05 528.70 B: [noise] yeah like a fear thing 

528.29 529.47 A: yes 

528.97 530.97 B: yeah it will instill fear 

531.26 533.87 A: you know i don't think they have to do large 

533.96 534.95 A: uh 

534.98 537.86 A: area you know large populace just 

538.11 543.89 A: doesn't have to be in the thousands or millions of people i think it just has to be 

544.07 544.99 A: you know 

546.08 547.81 A: small groups of people 

547.54 555.22 B: or times square something in new york or in the central areas san francisco or l._a. or 

549.69 550.45 A: yeah 

555.13 556.14 A: right 

555.56 556.98 B: (( london [noise] [noise] [noise] uh to make sure that [noise] )) 

557.56 563.26 A: yeah it doesn't have to always be in the united states but it could be anywhere and you know obviously they've targeted 

563.46 566.97 A: us as being one of the one of the areas but 

567.00 579.90 A: you don't know you just don't know what they're uh you know what the plans are and that's i think the scary part of it but i think if they you brought up a good point that security is a good thing just i think awareness heightened awareness 

580.00 585.79 A: for people around i know since nine eleven i've been more aware of things going on around me 

587.07 596.18 A: and to have tried to be more careful about some of the things that i've done or that i do you know as i go al- on a day to day basis 

596.41 597.80 A: (( [noise] )) 

598.98 599.89 A: if ever if
