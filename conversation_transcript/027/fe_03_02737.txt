526.37 528.22 A: you think it's really about 

528.91 535.78 A: controlling terrorists and controlling weapons and or do you think it's about something else 

535.57 541.12 B: well i think this war in my opinion is a humanitarian cause 

535.87 537.66 A: a hidden agenda or 

540.99 541.89 A: you do 

541.73 543.14 B: yes i 

543.58 547.04 B: and i am for it i
