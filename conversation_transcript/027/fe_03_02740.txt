0.66 2.04 A: (( hello )) 

1.55 2.85 B: hello 

2.63 4.31 A: hi this is dee who's this 

4.30 8.44 B: my name is don i live in downey california 

6.10 7.07 A: hi 

8.19 11.30 A: really i live in north hollywood california 

11.22 12.30 B: (( oh )) 

11.66 14.85 A: so they didn't really go very far did they [laughter] 

13.93 21.50 B: well this is my third time the first one was massachusetts and the second one was new york i guess it's because of the time of day we called 

21.01 27.60 A: yeah well you know this is my third call too and i had one in the midwest and one in like uh the east coast too 

28.08 30.40 A: i didn't hear the topic did you 

30.16 35.34 B: bioterrorists what can united states do to prevent bioterrorism 

34.73 41.68 A: you know i had this already so good thing 'cause i already know about it [laughter] [sigh] um 

38.78 39.91 B: okay 

40.65 42.35 B: what do you think we can do 

43.08 48.19 A: i think that the first thing we should do is strengthen our immigration 

48.77 49.92 A: policy 

49.56 54.20 B: [laughter] yeah like there ain't a million mexicans sneaking across the border every day 

54.36 63.09 A: well you know i mean it's gotta be toughened all the way around because you're not ever gonna keep that kinda stuff out if you don't know who's here 

54.56 55.17 B: (( [laughter] )) 

63.05 74.64 A: not to say that a citizen couldn't do it because clearly one could but you know you have to get that stuff from somewhere and here i think we're too regulated for people to really get that kind of stuff 

74.92 78.49 B: really i think it'd be easier to make here than anywhere else 

75.20 76.21 A: so you'd have 

78.61 80.70 A: well can you make that stuff at home 

81.35 89.56 A: or i mean do you have to actually buy it i thought it was pretty well regulated where only certain you know labs you have to sign out for it and everything 

90.07 91.78 A: you can't just buy it 

91.76 94.32 B: no but i think you can make it 

94.36 97.41 A: see i didn't i didn't know you could make it 

96.85 100.94 B: oh you can make all kinds of bacteria and things anthrax [mn] 

99.54 102.55 A: yeah but let's can you make anthrax at home 

102.60 112.43 A: i mean i from what i understand from the last you know attacks we had it's incredibly hard to do it at home because it it's it's a very fragile form 

113.09 116.38 A: or uh you know it's it's not a stable form 

116.39 121.38 A: so if you do any kind of thing anything that's not exactly right it's it doesn't work 

121.32 127.82 B: yeah they haven't invented the good ones yet i think aids was really started as a bioterrorist thing 

127.48 128.86 A: well you know that's 

129.00 131.69 A: [laughter] that that sounds pretty good [noise] 

131.40 139.31 B: yeah and we can't keep crack out of here we can't keep cocaine we can't keep heroin out oh yeah 

132.71 133.46 A: that's 

138.20 139.26 A: i know 

139.79 142.59 A: so what do you think what do you think we oughta do first 

142.35 144.23 B: uh mind our own business 

144.42 147.18 A: mind our own what do you mean by that like 

146.38 150.18 B: not get involved in the middle east not getting involved anywhere 

150.24 151.52 B: and as soon as we 

150.59 155.37 A: but how does that keep it out of here i mean we got that we got it here anyway 

152.47 154.10 B: we won't be a target 

155.39 156.57 B: well who would 

155.47 157.79 A: whether we go somewhere else or not 

157.73 161.90 B: no no if we stay out of the middle east and mind our own business 

162.11 166.73 B: why would anyone bioterror us and as soon as they did we could nuke 'em 

166.14 172.68 A: because we weren't doing anything on september eleventh and they were bio- they were you know they attacked us anyway 

171.76 175.67 B: oh they attacked us because we're the great satan 

176.50 179.31 B: have you ever watched have you got cable 

176.69 179.72 A: right so and we we didn't do anything 

179.63 181.23 B: have you got cable 

179.88 180.63 A: what 

180.95 181.91 A: yeah 

181.91 186.65 B: have you ever watched the uh news channels where they give the uh like 

186.77 192.42 B: uh jordan news and and all them ones oh no 

188.86 189.85 A: right 

191.34 192.26 A: yeah 

192.43 193.98 A: (( but the whole but the whole )) 

192.65 194.13 B: they don't like us 

194.34 200.77 A: of course they don't like us but you're saying that if we just minded our own business people wouldn't bother us that's not true 

200.71 204.06 B: i think they would why would they why would we if we 

202.09 209.18 A: you just you because you just contradicted yourself we weren't we weren't bothering anybody before and they attacked us 

204.85 205.87 B: no no 

208.98 213.06 B: they are b- they attacked us because of our link with israel 

211.20 212.11 A: right 

213.74 219.18 B: that's why they hit the twin towers because we're backing israel in the middle east 

220.25 226.48 A: uh i don't think that's the reason why being it's clearly when you when you talk to those people 

223.38 224.42 B: why would 

226.52 232.64 A: it's very clear that anybody who's not muslim is their enemy and it doesn't matter who 

230.69 231.72 B: yeah but 

232.79 239.74 A: you know even if we didn't have a link with israel it wouldn't matter because they would still attack us because we're not muslims 

240.02 242.22 B: well i don't think they would 

241.01 246.26 A: i mean it's in their it's in their well that's what they say that is in their you know bible 

246.16 252.06 B: well we have no i don't think it's in there anywhere we're all heathens and they shouldn't even deal with us 

249.43 253.67 A: well it depends on who it depends on who you it depends on who you talk to 

253.36 255.28 B: (( why don't you talk to the )) 

253.85 254.75 A: because 

255.43 259.56 A: when you talk to when you talk to people who are in those sects 

259.65 260.93 A: they say 

261.27 273.54 A: it's in the koran that you should be enemies with anyone who is not muslim i mean but then when you talk to the you know muslims that are not part of the the [sigh] 

273.99 276.14 A: the you know [sigh] 

276.17 277.91 A: terrorist groups 

278.34 290.55 A: the regular people who are i guess more conservative maybe or they they say it's not in there that you know they're just taking stuff out of context but you're not gonna be able to stop those fringe groups 

290.31 300.50 B: well the main reason they attack us i think and it is because the palestinians and them and the jews and them have been fighting for about i 

300.62 313.30 B: don't know ten thousand years even though uh to me i can't really tell them apart but they say and all their news stations they're always badmouthing israel and they're calling us the great satan 

313.70 316.42 B: i watch it you know i watch it on cable and 

315.81 316.90 A: yeah 

316.58 321.20 B: they were that's what they're always saying yeah united states is the big satan 

319.36 324.42 A: yeah well b- because that but the only reason they hate them is they're not muslim 

324.30 326.44 B: why wouldn't they pick somebody easier 

326.83 327.78 A: like who 

327.76 330.22 B: oh australia oh 

330.54 334.33 B: france oh germany uh hm 

333.65 336.16 A: because those people are right next door 

337.69 341.31 A: aren't those people right and well they want their land 

341.17 343.49 B: no no we don't want their land 

343.13 346.76 A: no not us they want it that's why they're fighting 

344.96 346.23 B: yeah but i 

346.88 350.64 B: why would they the twin towers you said it was because 

351.08 354.29 B: they hate everybody well it would be easier for 

353.24 358.62 A: no i said i said that they did it because they hate anyone who's not muslim 

358.33 362.61 B: well that would be germany france they like france 

361.44 362.45 A: they do 

362.73 364.19 B: (( yeah )) 

363.59 372.62 A: well they don't you know it's not like i like france it's like it's not like they like france they they just tolerate france 'cause they're giving 'em stuff 

373.01 378.38 B: well well if we just stayed out of it they wouldn't even think about us why don't they attack canada 

379.01 380.68 B: they stay outta everything 

381.39 384.24 A: i wouldn't doubt they wouldn't attack canada 

384.34 389.05 A: i mean but there there's less to gain from attacking canada 

385.35 386.04 B: (( you )) 

389.11 400.07 B: know according to the newsreels anyway how are we gonna keep it out when we can't keep even drugs out so we're susceptible 

399.33 402.59 A: of course you are so how well how would you keep it out then 

402.83 410.71 B: well i would anybody if they if i found out who did it i would kill everybody in their entire country 

410.23 412.86 A: yeah but the problem is you don't know who it is 

412.84 415.15 B: i'd just take a guess [laughter] 

415.07 417.94 A: you'd just guess and kill everybody in the entire country 

417.79 423.39 B: well you know my policy is better a million muslims than one american 

424.14 425.62 A: well but 

425.63 430.52 A: how do you d- you can't really bioterrorize somebody unless you're there 

431.08 436.37 A: so what's wrong with keeping 'em out first so at least you know where they're co- you know if you can stop 'em 

436.65 439.96 A: if you can stop 'em at the border that's better than having 'em here 

439.72 441.73 B: i think they're already here 

441.67 448.13 A: i'm i don't doubt they're already here [laughter] the problem is you don't know who they are 

444.80 446.29 B: [laughter] yeah 

448.01 452.96 B: well that's true but why would they bioter- they'd have to tell so they 

453.06 454.52 B: they always tell 

453.56 457.47 A: well how but how do you okay so how do you tell who's a bioterrorist 

457.72 459.89 B: who has the capability 

460.48 462.94 A: who well who would have the capability 

462.46 465.85 B: anyone with millions and millions of dollars to throw away 

465.06 468.31 A: okay okay so who's got millions and millions of dollars 

468.10 469.59 B: the ones with oil 

469.85 479.40 A: okay so now we've got people with people with oil have millions and millions of dollars who wants who would have the money to to create bioterrorist 

479.65 481.29 A: you know uh 

480.36 482.83 B: i don't think it's that hard to create [mn] 

483.45 491.84 A: even still you know you have to have the money you have to have the lab so we already established like to be done and it could be done here and it's gotta be financed by somebody 

492.14 496.51 A: so do you think they're calling up u._s. citizens and going oh 

496.87 507.99 A: i'd like to make some you know i'd like to bioterrorize the u._s. could you help me out [laughter] or they're importing people who believe the same thing they believe and they're just bringing the stuff with them 

507.72 514.17 B: well i think the easiest way for 'em to do it would be call somebody in the united states who would do that for a lot of money 

514.59 517.52 A: well there are those that would do it for a lot of money 

516.55 523.26 B: you know for enough money they'd do it and i don't think it's that hard to make what about an atomic bomb would that be hard to make 

524.33 530.72 A: i think it would be hard enough to get enough plutonium to make a bomb large enough to really make a difference 

530.57 531.55 B: ah 

530.96 537.61 A: i mean you can maybe decimate a couple of neighborhoods but i don't think you could get one that would like wipe out a whole city 

538.06 539.62 B: (( hm i don't know )) 

538.94 542.03 A: you've gotta you'd have to have a lot of stuff 

543.09 544.23 B: (( oh i don't know )) 

544.48 549.43 A: you'd have to have a pretty big you'd have to have a pretty big bomb i think 

549.70 550.74 B: oh 

550.96 552.89 B: (( i don't know how big it'd have to be )) 

553.14 555.18 A: well but you'd still have to have enough 

553.21 555.77 B: (( but there are enough people here that know how to make 'em )) 

556.08 557.38 A: oops hello 

557.11 558.06 B: (( hello )) 

558.27 559.61 B: i'm still here 

559.95 561.27 A: (( did you hear that )) 

560.90 561.68 B: no 

561.96 563.50 A: (( that was weird )) 

563.88 564.66 B: (( oh )) 

565.67 566.55 B: but 

565.92 572.03 A: anyway but so yeah okay so we've established that if you if they gave you enough money that you would do it 

571.88 573.67 B: no not me 

572.98 577.08 A: you wouldn't do it not you okay i thought you said you would 

575.29 578.97 B: no i don't really care that much about money anymore you know i'm old 

579.11 581.01 A: well you know 

579.86 581.64 B: too late for me you know 

582.32 592.65 A: but you you can probably you could probably find somebody who'd be certainly willing to do it you know everybody has their their little price and some of those people's prices are pretty low 

582.33 584.61 B: you can't buy more time 

592.49 594.92 B: [laughter] some people would do it for fun 

594.96 595.94 B: (( [laughter] )) 

595.26 597.52 A: some people would do it for free 

597.58 599.90 A: so but how do we catch 'em and how do we keep 'em
