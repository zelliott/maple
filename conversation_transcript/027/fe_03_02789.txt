12.34 13.58 B: right 

13.54 15.15 A: um well 

15.87 19.00 B: um not the best [laughter] topic for me but um

23.79 26.75 A: well uh actually i don't i don't watch 

26.80 35.62 A: uh professional sports terribly often but i i must say that baseball is what i what i at least used to enjoy 

32.03 33.57 B: (( right )) 

36.06 39.27 A: uh i think i sort of followed one 

40.51 47.10 A: team for a little while but they're they're a notoriously tacky team the it's the atlanta braves so 

44.63 46.00 B: oh yeah 

46.43 47.84 B: oh [laughter] 

47.75 48.59 A: [laughter]

66.39 67.97 A: criticized uh 

68.74 73.73 A: my my choice because they say that baseball is so incredibly slow 

73.42 74.80 B: mhm 

74.81 75.95 A: but uh 

76.72 83.41 A: [noise] i think that's that's the reason i enjoy it is i can sort of carry on a conversation while watching and 

82.92 84.21 B: right 

83.56 89.84 A: so forth and so forth but no i d- i don't i don't really i haven't watched in a long time at least not since

127.11 129.85 B: mm yeah [laughter] 

130.01 132.95 B: yeah it gets pretty pretty violent [laughter] that's 

132.49 137.58 A: yeah i mean you know you hear basically the thuds when their bodies and whatnot 

136.38 138.35 B: re- yeah

139.91 141.77 A: (( you know cuts and whatnot yeah )) 

142.24 145.75 B: not for somebody that doesn't like the sight of blood that's for sure [laughter]

175.69 181.03 A: well that doesn't sound too bad i guess we shouldn't [laughter] stray terribly far from the topic 

180.61 181.85 B: right 

181.39 182.14 A: (( but uh )) 

182.12 186.25 B: yeah ten minutes on something we're not really that interested in [laughter] 

185.50 195.68 A: yeah exactly no i mean uh i i know that actually what originally spurred my interest in baseball was was just having played it and uh 

194.50 195.58 B: mhm 

195.74 198.08 A: and my my first 

198.65 204.92 A: [sigh] actually it was and then watching it with my dad so we sorta had something my for some reason i 

205.17 206.88 A: i grew up in mississippi 

206.85 208.05 B: mhm 

207.11 213.54 A: so uh and i was never terribly interested or even adept at sports and my and my dad uh 

211.16 212.15 B: right 

213.75 218.59 A: i would say was probably more athletic and is more of a good ole boy [laughter] 

217.79 219.39 B: mhm [laughter] 

218.90 223.78 A: so i felt s- sorta like i had i had an all- you know i was i was an ally with him in 

225.34 228.22 A: the sort of good ole boy activity [laughter] 

227.55 237.57 B: right yeah yeah i i've gone to baseball games i just can't really watch it on on tv [laughter] i get just bored you know but 

233.75 234.62 A: [laughter] 

237.63 243.51 B: i used to play it when i was a kid too i kinda was a tomboy about sports when i was little but 

243.53 248.57 B: i just sort of lost interest and baseball i liked i remember 

248.98 251.57 A: which sport did you excel at the most 

251.86 255.92 B: um baseball probably yeah 

254.05 254.84 A: really 

255.49 257.59 A: well i have to confess that 

257.96 264.59 A: that uh i was [laughter] i was not much of a player [laughter] as much as i as i followed it for a time 

261.29 262.46 B: [laughter] 

264.63 265.80 B: right 

266.23 276.26 B: yeah i just remember it being fun we'd go out in the field and you know play baseball and you know i wasn't really competitive or anything but i i just you know i thought it was fun [laughter] 

275.90 280.53 A: but uh no i mean i i think uh i i enjoyed it most when i was 

281.01 286.32 A: [sigh] you know playing with the neighborhood kids and uh certainly uh uh i 

283.65 284.77 B: right 

286.88 288.48 A: (( think a part of my )) 

289.10 294.25 A: um my failings [laughter] was the fact that i i got super nervous at the games 

294.24 295.29 B: [laughter] 

294.71 296.46 A: (( something something like that but uh )) 

296.14 297.22 B: mhm 

299.10 300.55 A: [sigh] but but 

301.29 305.24 A: that's that was it i mean i i was okay at soccer and 

305.18 306.19 B: mhm 

308.54 312.37 B: oh kickball i liked that [laughter] 

310.19 313.78 A: (( uh and uh and that's it [laughter] yeah a primitive sport )) 

313.66 315.02 B: [laughter] 

314.61 317.66 A: (( but i i think everybody enjoys kickball [laughter] yeah )) 

317.89 319.05 B: yeah 

320.03 325.21 B: yeah i just i completely lost interest in sports as i was growing up so 

325.78 326.50 B: (( [cough] )) 

327.63 328.88 B: but um 

328.92 337.80 B: oh hockey i like to um go to hockey games yeah i haven't really watched it too much on on t._v. but i like going to the game

337.73 340.89 A: now is that does that get violent at times 

340.64 342.61 B: it can be um 

341.69 343.79 A: because certainly that's that's what i've heard 

343.33 348.17 B: yeah yeah it can be people get slammed up against the the side and you know 

348.41 353.01 B: but they have little shows in between they had um people dressed up as um 

353.29 354.53 B: as 

354.72 358.84 B: what are they called those big guys with the um 

360.12 362.98 B: oh man i can't even think of it now [sigh] 

364.52 367.23 B: um you know the big um 

368.72 371.39 B: oh jeeze i can't remember [laughter] 

370.82 373.48 A: well well what were they the actual 

373.60 375.67 A: hm i'm not sure where you're mhm 

375.70 381.61 B: well it was a show that they did sort of like in the um while they had a break in the game 

381.76 385.18 B: and they were dressed up in these big you know the fat suits 

385.31 388.21 A: the [laughter] you mean sumo wrestling 

386.09 387.65 B: and they were 

387.98 398.74 B: yeah yeah that's it and they were falling around on the ice and like playing hockey it was it was funny they'd fall on their back and they couldn't get back up again [laughter] 

388.31 390.45 A: (( oh oh )) 

398.04 400.81 A: (( that seems to be a a a spectacle )) 

400.41 401.65 B: [laughter] 

402.28 409.36 B: but i mean i live in arizona so it's really hot here all the time and going to the ice hockey game is kinda fun 

409.24 410.47 A: (( yeah needless to say now )) 

412.83 413.93 A: uh as far as 

414.14 416.03 A: actually going to sport events 

417.37 421.75 A: (( yeah i would say i i would still say that baseball's the only one i have terribly much experience )) 

422.09 423.25 B: yeah 

422.76 425.37 A: with but no i've heard that that hockey is 

426.75 429.74 A: can can be rather violent at times 

429.98 431.54 B: yeah it can be 

433.12 436.67 A: and that sort of they're the uh crowds 

437.02 438.90 A: (( uh spur them on and whatnot yeah mm )) 

439.34 443.55 B: yeah they do [laughter] i've only gone to a couple of the games 

443.87 449.88 B: but baseball is still i mean basketball would still be my favorite to watch probably 

449.57 453.00 A: mm well certainly it's a uh fast paced game 

452.74 453.93 B: yeah 

453.40 454.49 A: (( i would give it that )) 

454.76 457.98 B: it's just easier for me to stay interested in in 

458.48 461.19 B: in something like that 

459.98 461.18 A: yeah [sigh] 

461.83 462.91 A: i guess 

463.68 468.42 A: the appeal of baseball is is that there are very few sports that are 

468.62 473.37 A: designed like like it i mean obviously you know you have 

471.53 473.34 B: mhm 

473.70 475.98 A: cricket and and whatnot but 

477.75 478.83 A: (( uh but )) 

479.37 481.31 A: (( uh i've always been interested in in in the in the sort of )) 

483.96 488.47 A: (( idiosyncrasies of uh of of baseball and the stats and whatnot but uh but yeah that's )) 

486.69 487.77 B: yeah 

497.21 498.69 A: (( that's that [lipsmack] [sigh] television )) 

497.68 499.41 B: [laughter] 

498.97 501.10 A: (( [laughter] )) 

500.02 503.93 B: yeah it's hard to think of too much to say about it [laughter] 

503.60 504.50 A: [laughter] 

504.82 505.86 B: um 

507.31 513.46 B: well um i followed a whole season of basketball with the suns once yeah so 

511.62 512.58 A: oh really 

513.62 523.13 B: i think when you you get into it and you just watch it regularly you know it it's more interesting too if you're following it you know through the season 

521.02 524.92 A: yeah and you have sort of pet pet players and whatnot 

524.42 525.75 B: right 

525.08 527.91 A: yeah no i mean [sigh] um 

528.60 532.03 A: you know as when when i was actually following baseball 

532.47 533.47 A: uh 

533.68 541.94 A: i think it was like eighty no it was must have been ninety one or something like ninety two because i was relatively young and uh 

539.01 540.43 B: mhm 

542.28 550.69 A: and it was the season uh where i think it they were sort of like it was a worst first se- season before they were basically uh 

551.97 557.24 A: [sigh] [laughter] before they got a hell of a lot of money from ted turner 

556.95 558.34 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

557.58 561.65 A: and uh and so that was really exciting actually uh so it was a 

560.31 561.35 B: mhm 

562.47 564.14 A: really a fun season to 

564.72 565.79 B: yeah 

565.28 570.40 A: (( watch and i was actually [sigh] devastated when they when they lost the world )) 

570.48 571.38 B: (( hm )) 

571.34 573.21 A: series they they seemed to be uh 

573.24 576.53 A: actually i think they've gone to the world series several times 

576.63 579.08 A: and have only won it maybe once something like 

579.69 581.31 B: hm oh really 

579.72 580.87 A: (( that they must )) 

580.92 583.79 A: (( yeah they must have gone like six or seven times [laughter] in the last )) 

583.42 584.31 B: (( [laughter] )) 

583.95 585.89 A: in the last twelve years 

586.99 588.09 B: wow
