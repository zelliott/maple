145.59 148.05 B: yeah right [laughter] 

146.43 148.10 A: [laughter] 

148.11 149.40 A: so uh

154.57 156.29 A: oh that's boring 

155.22 162.84 B: and so do my parents but they're like such nascar freaks and you know i'm just subjected to it i can't say i really like it [laughter] 

158.70 159.68 A: yeah 

162.10 166.16 A: it's that's you know it's funny because it has gotten to be 

166.21 171.40 A: such a major phenomena but you talk about boring 

168.64 169.85 B: yeah 

171.41 185.02 B: it and honestly i mean uh just don't let anybody hear me say this but i don't even see how it's really exactly a sport you know sports are usually like more of a physical thing and you're just sitting in a car driving which is so different 

181.27 182.32 A: well 

183.07 188.69 A: those guys don't just sit in a car and drive like you and you and i drive 

188.00 189.58 B: right that's true 

189.15 195.45 A: i mean they you know they work their little fannies off and y- you ever seen the arms on these guys 

192.50 193.57 B: yeah 

194.67 203.61 B: yeah that's true and and i mean i've been in those simulator ones where you drive i mean and it is kinda hard to hang on to that steering wheel so yeah okay [laughter] 

196.14 197.14 A: you know 

198.12 198.96 A: right 

202.05 206.06 A: yeah i could give it it's kinda like golf being a sport 

205.86 207.04 B: right 

206.44 211.06 A: you know well yeah it technically is you know 

209.97 212.25 B: right but it's not that exciting 

211.75 216.13 A: yeah i consider golf as much a sport as shooting pool 

212.36 213.09 B: (( course )) 

215.85 217.02 B: well yeah 

216.16 219.50 A: you know it's more a skill than a sport 

217.88 218.81 B: right 

218.84 224.38 B: right but see bask- basketball and baseball are even more boring to me so they're 

223.70 234.34 A: well i like it's funny basketball [sigh] i uh i like when it gets down to the near the end of the season and the games really start counting 

233.84 234.77 B: (( right [noise] )) 

234.62 237.17 A: uh the playoffs i love 

237.33 243.28 A: uh baseball i love college baseball i hate pro baseball 

243.04 245.59 B: [noise] 

243.72 246.12 A: [laughter] you know i mean th- those guys it's just 

246.48 256.78 A: i i don't un- you know the the football players when a football player makes x. millions of dollars it's he's putting his life on the line every time he goes out there 

255.99 258.63 B: and getting beat up [laughter] 

257.12 262.98 A: yeah baseball player what do they do they slide and get uh uh brush burns and 

261.15 264.03 B: they get they get dirty [laughter] 

263.21 275.50 A: yeah [laughter] and a lot of them don't even do that you know the outfielders you know an outfielder you know probably a a rough game might run for what 

265.86 267.53 B: right yeah 

275.92 279.18 A: uh six or seven minutes in the whole game 

278.82 279.71 B: right 

279.33 288.47 A: [laughter] you know uh you know and most of the time they're standing out there talking to each other and do de dit do de do you know [laughter] so 

280.00 281.01 B: yeah 

287.32 290.72 B: yeah it's definitely it's definitely too boring i can't watch it 

290.00 294.17 A: yeah but i love college baseball i've i had a friend of mine that went 

294.26 296.24 A: to the pros 

296.44 305.38 A: uh well he just made the farm the semi pro teams for the pittsburgh pirates and so he's a real traditionalist as far as baseball goes 

304.73 305.64 B: uh-huh 

305.39 308.24 A: and i always tell him i say man you know what we could do to make 

308.29 315.74 A: pro baseball a lot more exciting is use aluminum bats use those rubber coated balls 

315.79 321.05 A: stretch the uh fences back oh maybe another three hundred feet 

320.67 321.89 B: [laughter] 

321.06 324.71 A: and put about six or seven outfielders out there 

323.95 325.80 B: [laughter] 

325.12 337.39 A: you know that would really make the game exciting there'd be no home runs there'd be eight or ten guys out in the outfield to catch these balls that were you know because guys would be hitting 'em six seven hundred feet you know 

326.93 330.11 B: [laughter] it would make a yeah [laughter] 

333.60 334.55 B: right 

336.53 339.35 B: [laughter] that would make it a little better 

337.52 338.79 A: [laughter] 

338.87 341.53 A: yeah he's like you're out of your mind 

340.67 345.84 B: college they probably try harder too 'cause they wanna get in the pros once they're in the pros i don't know 

345.43 346.67 A: well they 

345.94 349.68 B: sometimes i don't think they try as hard 'cause they're gonna get paid millions regardless 

349.06 355.76 A: yeah and they and the [mn] and i know in college football it's the same way they play for pride 

355.16 356.21 B: mhm 

356.01 367.83 A: you know um it's not a business so much you know as as it is in in pro sports but i'm a i you know it's i it's funny because i say that and then 

368.43 372.23 A: pro football i mean college football yeah i like it 

372.47 381.38 A: but i love pro football you know and i'm just the opposite with baseball and you know so i don't know it really what the 

373.41 375.61 B: i never watch it [laughter] 

381.39 388.13 A: exact thing is in col- in pro football you just got that's the cream of the crop those guys are so good 

385.82 386.73 B: yeah 

388.10 388.85 B: (( [laughter] )) 

388.49 392.78 A: you know another thing that i think is hilarious is when you laugh you know a guy 

393.09 396.07 A: he makes third string quarterback 

396.18 405.39 A: and he never gets to play and you're always going ha what a wimp you know that guy's terrible he's still one of the best in the whole wide world
