284.51 298.51 B: yeah i was i'm i was impressed when i went to my first hockey game the sounds it sounds so like you can hear the people like hear the puck hitting or or the people skating i guess makes such a cool sound when they slam into the wall or the board that's so loud 

296.67 297.56 A: [laughter] 

298.11 299.25 A: yeah 

298.50 302.36 B: it it doesn't really come through on television the way it sounds in real life

307.14 308.74 B: [laughter] 

308.34 311.06 A: oh what was it up in the stands 

311.37 318.32 A: there's some oh what's the name of this player anyway when these two teams are playing together like when the predators play a different 

318.30 319.17 B: uh-huh 

318.44 324.83 A: there's one particular team and there's this group of predators fans that hate this particular guy on this team 

324.39 325.92 B: [laughter] 

325.68 337.20 A: and whenever he does something stupid or or something they don't like they all say what's his name i think it's lalene lalene lalene 

337.22 339.63 A: you suck [laughter] 

338.46 341.15 B: [laughter] that's fun 

339.96 343.61 A: and and something else like and it's not gonna get any better 

343.26 344.98 B: yeah [laughter] 

344.61 345.72 A: (( it's just funny [laughter] )) 

345.94 350.82 B: i went to a dallas a dallas stars hockey game and they uh they had this 

351.13 361.33 B: blimp that would fly around in the crowd and it would drop free pants on people like if if it like i guess they had it randomly sort of programmed to to just drop out pants on people 

361.22 368.08 B: and it was kinda it was weird 'cause it was like men's slacks and i was i was wondering like how do they know like what size i mean like the 

368.53 373.79 B: odds are you're not gonna be able to wear whatever pants fall on your head or whatever but it's kind of fun to watch 

372.20 373.34 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] )) 

373.98 376.44 B: pants fall from the sky on people 

376.71 379.79 A: (( pants why pants why not tee shirts )) 

378.13 386.34 B: i don't know i think it they were sponsored by some uh like dockers or some company like that so it was their pants that were falling 

383.78 385.01 A: oh 

386.15 389.75 A: were they some kind of elastic waist one size fits all pants yeah 

388.87 395.97 B: maybe so they looked like pretty much tr- traditional like brown khaki dockers or whatever so i don't know 

396.26 401.59 B: so how does this work do you just like did the little machine call you or did you call in 

401.32 402.76 A: it called me 

402.61 409.02 B: oh cool i i got a voice mail from it a minute ago and then i called it back and stuck me on here 

407.56 408.60 A: oh 

409.03 413.76 B: did did does it call you like every day until you do your phone calls or just 

413.26 417.68 A: every monday like i picked monday two to five that i'd be available 

417.36 418.57 B: (( oh )) 

417.85 426.68 A: and it'll call me during that time usually it went two or three weeks where it didn't and i thought well they must've dropped me but then all of a sudden it started again about three weeks ago 

426.92 430.28 A: and since i thought they dropped me i wasn't here [laughter] 

429.39 434.26 B: yeah so did they did they pay you like at the end or how does that work 

433.90 442.53 A: no i think they'll pay you after you've completed three calls then they'll send you your check and this is my second one that i've actually talked to someone 

438.89 439.96 B: okay 

442.61 447.90 B: yeah i think i think like i don't know how it works but you can call in yourself 

448.05 449.80 B: [laughter] 

448.43 449.99 A: so [noise] oh you can [noise] [noise] 

449.60 464.37 B: yeah i don't know if you could like ca- hang up and call in again and get it all over with or if you have to wait a certain number of time but in the email that they sent me it had like you just type in your p._i._n. number or something and it and and it connects you or it connected me with you 

464.58 465.74 A: (( wow yeah )) 

465.54 472.45 B: so i don't know i mean maybe after you hang up 'cause maybe you can call and get it over with or or again i don't know how that goes though 

472.20 477.07 A: that's neat and then i don't have to try to be home you know just in that little spot you bet 

474.65 475.86 B: seriously 

476.54 481.28 B: it seems like a good deal though for thirty bucks i'm like whatever i'll talk for thirty minutes 

481.38 483.62 B: in an afternoon or whatever [laughter] 

483.10 485.60 A: yeah and the uh 

486.38 497.77 A: the email i got initially also said there were some people you know i i don't know if it's like they like the way you do it or what but after three calls there will be some people they'll choose to do several 

497.55 499.88 B: oh to keep doing it over and over 

499.27 500.53 A: yeah 

500.31 507.51 B: oh yeah i don't uh mine said for three so i don't know maybe maybe i'm not in the the cool list or whatever [laughter] 

506.58 513.48 A: [laughter] or they might have changed that i think i got in kinda early on they might have changed their minds on that or something 

512.90 518.02 B: yeah i don't know it it doesn't seem too painless though like 

517.44 518.09 A: (( mm )) 

518.29 519.34 B: (( i don't know )) 

519.37 523.88 B: the how long have we been doing this it seems like it must be getting close to ten minutes 

523.36 524.80 A: yeah i know 

524.74 527.00 B: i didn't look at my clock when it started [lipsmack] 

524.82 525.68 A: (( um )) 

526.66 528.28 A: i didn't either 

528.75 539.44 A: it's uh usually though it calls me when they call me it's right at two thirty and my watch says two thirty nine so uh it's probably been like one minute shy of ten 

539.24 545.86 B: so it's almost over it sounds like you have a little is that a little boy you're that that you're watching wow 

543.73 544.70 A: yeah

571.57 572.69 A: wow [noise] 

572.09 574.04 B: so that's exciting 

573.42 574.74 A: that is 

574.75 580.55 A: well it'll change your life but it'll be the probably the best thing that ever happened to ya 

579.92 594.21 B: i'm pretty sure that's the truth i'm looking forward to it but i don't know i have a little niece that just turned two and she's sort of like the terrible twos and she's learnt how to like stomp her foot and say no and all that sort of stuff and that's a little bit intimidating i'm like oh
