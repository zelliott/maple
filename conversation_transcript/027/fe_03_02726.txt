8.41 10.78 B: [laughter] 

10.18 11.08 A: so 

11.23 14.30 B: um so we're supposed to talk about bioterrorism 

14.23 15.85 A: yes 

16.65 19.17 B: what is your opinion of bioterrorism 

19.54 22.85 A: (( and what i don't know i don't really have one )) 

22.53 24.13 B: [laughter] 

24.32 32.23 B: um i live i live in new york so i we have a l- there's been a lot of talking and things going on about it 

31.99 33.00 A: mhm 

32.37 38.97 B: i don't really know what they could do to protect but there's actually like the national guard and that like the major tourist attractions and there's 

38.59 39.53 A: yeah 

38.98 41.51 B: like there's a lot more police out and everything 

40.01 40.74 A: (( [noise] )) 

41.26 42.36 A: mhm 

42.46 45.87 B: so that would just be for like looking out for bioterrorists i guess 

46.52 50.45 A: yeah um i think it was what they could do to prevent it 

50.12 51.24 B: okay 

51.41 52.63 B: um 

52.92 54.96 B: see the truth is truthfully 

54.10 54.98 A: pardon 

55.10 66.11 B: the truthfully i think if if someone really wants to blow up the subway they're probably figure a way but you just have to keep living and not pretend that that could really happen [laughter] 

64.97 67.37 A: really i mean you know 

68.00 71.39 A: you can't live your life in fear yeah 

70.70 75.91 B: exactly and that's the main thing and i think that so many people believe very strongly you know 

75.69 77.12 A: (( yeah )) 

77.82 81.76 A: and i you know i don't think they can prevent it if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen 

82.22 89.19 B: i think that some of the precautionary measures i think that it is well like um i hope that it would deter people a little more when they see you know 

89.31 92.41 B: the guardsmen with like you know ak47s 

92.04 93.19 A: mhm 

92.68 104.66 B: i would hope that that would deter people a little bit but i don't i don't know how mu- i mean if you look at israel and things have you know they've gotten so much more technology in place for this kind of stuff and it still happens every day 

104.31 106.12 A: (( oh yeah )) 

105.58 107.50 B: so pretty scary 

107.40 109.62 A: it's very scary but you know 

110.00 113.08 A: like i said you can't live in fear and 

113.38 114.27 A: (( you know )) 

114.34 117.55 A: i think that they can start by getting another president 

117.52 118.63 B: [laughter] 

119.32 120.16 B: yeah 

120.74 121.57 B: yeah

125.40 127.00 A: you know i mean 

127.33 129.04 A: i think he's a joke you know

136.55 137.44 B: no 

137.63 145.05 B: and i'm actually i'm surprised that you say that because i feel like the media makes it out to be that everyone loves george bush 

144.62 147.01 A: [noise] no no no no not me 

145.90 146.97 B: [laughter]

162.29 163.81 B: oh my gosh 

163.76 165.14 A: know um 

164.65 168.97 B: that must be very scary to think when with all this stuff going on what could happen 

168.76 169.43 A: no 

170.10 171.79 A: i really don't think about 

171.17 172.41 B: good

181.09 182.02 A: and you know 

183.16 184.89 B: yeah 

183.70 184.78 A: um 

184.91 187.65 B: i think that definitely the our government 

188.31 190.31 B: i don't think they're doing the right thing 

190.20 190.94 A: no 

190.74 194.46 B: i think it's very scary that it could turn into quite a disaster 

194.17 198.18 A: mhm and they went over there and did what they did and look at all the uh 

198.19 199.66 A: weapons they're finding 

200.26 201.42 B: you mean none 

200.31 201.26 A: you know 

201.38 202.17 A: huh 

201.68 204.50 B: [laughter] you mean what few they found 

204.06 206.73 A: oh there's more than that and they've admitted it you 

206.08 207.26 B: yeah 

207.53 209.00 A: know but um 

209.61 215.79 B: even worse though everything like uh north korea now also which is scary 'cause that got put on the back burner 

216.51 218.09 A: why what's going on with that 

218.12 223.37 B: they they're pretty much admitting to having nuclear building nuclear weapons 

224.17 225.91 A: (( [mn] they did that back a )) 

226.87 228.12 A: long time ago 

227.51 228.70 B: yeah 

228.51 230.36 A: they've had their nuclear weapons for a long 

230.48 239.71 B: i know but i think that it's getting a little tense tenser i don't know what a good word is definitely some diplomacy needs to happening [laughter] 

236.54 238.30 A: time a little more tense huh 

238.80 239.59 A: yes 

240.03 241.36 A: yeah um 

240.51 245.11 B: i'm trying to think it's so hard where they give you a topic and you're just like all right [laughter] 

244.78 247.71 A: i know it's like being in college again 

245.79 246.83 B: to prevent 

247.50 248.71 B: what was that 

248.32 250.28 A: it's like being in college again 

249.65 252.02 B: [laughter] scary 

250.87 254.28 A: you know public speaking you're given a topic and that's it 

254.93 256.14 A: but um 

256.84 257.91 B: um 

257.42 260.60 A: there's no way they're gonna get everything that everybody else has 

260.48 261.36 B: no 

261.49 262.89 A: (( you know uh )) 

263.39 275.61 B: and you can't i don't think they can go about it like we're america and we can rule everyone and we can because i think all they've got is the right way to go about the diplomacy of everythin- of you know trying to work this out with other countries 

275.31 276.29 A: mhm 

276.47 279.81 B: but it's scary i have like a friend who works at um 

279.87 283.02 B: like a middle eastern like think tank kind of thing 

282.74 284.32 A: oh middle eastern what 

284.23 288.39 B: like think tank i don't know it's like you know a bunch of academics like

288.47 289.56 B: and um 

289.84 292.06 B: he was saying like the war 

292.19 298.80 B: a lot of middle eastern people already didn't really like america so much and now they they really really hate it [laughter] 

298.72 299.67 A: (( yeah )) 

299.44 302.97 B: which is scary because what could they do then 

301.26 303.04 A: (( it is it's very scary )) 

303.32 308.26 A: yeah when we have all of them that have that have moved here to the states 

307.59 308.88 B: mhm 

309.09 312.29 A: you know what are we going to find what are they going to do you know 

309.75 311.35 B: yeah 

312.09 313.13 B: (( i don't know )) 

313.40 320.06 A: yeah i mean i drive i drive a bus and i took last summer i had to take a bunch 

320.47 322.21 A: almost into vermont

329.64 330.93 A: scary yeah 

330.28 332.69 B: that must have been so frustrating 

333.49 337.38 A: yeah you know because they didn't know where they were going i didn't know where they were going but still 

337.40 339.27 A: the thought was there what are they gonna do 

339.50 340.73 B: yeah 

339.97 343.75 A: you know when when they're outside the bus and my door's closed i don't have to worry 

343.68 345.13 B: exactly 

344.65 346.82 A: (( now i've got 'em on here you know )) 

346.17 347.48 B: yeah 

347.50 348.18 A: (( yikes )) 

349.49 350.91 B: (( i never knew )) 

350.64 351.50 A: pardon 

351.15 356.60 B: that i think it's so strange to think that lithuanians are coming to america [laughter] 

356.04 357.55 A: well they came to work 

357.35 359.89 B: yeah yeah 

358.17 359.57 A: you know um

364.18 365.77 A: you know um 

367.68 369.28 A: now that they're getting 

370.11 375.70 A: you know especially in boston area and they're start- they're turning against all of these people

384.70 385.65 A: they just 

387.17 388.91 A: all right they're here what's gonna happen 

389.40 391.02 B: (( i don't i don't know )) 

389.95 396.56 A: you know and then you have these that these that got arrested because they got in they got in with fake ids 

396.93 399.20 B: (( say that )) 

398.02 400.94 A: people that get into the states with fake ids 

400.28 402.09 B: again oh yeah 

401.66 406.94 A: you know [laughter] it's like wait a minute here you know are we going to be safe or aren't we 

404.51 406.00 B: mhm 

407.36 411.15 A: you know but if we have everybody over there who's going to be here protecting us 

410.89 412.17 B: exactly 

412.02 412.87 A: you know 

412.80 414.53 B: that's a very good point 

414.90 416.18 A: yeah i mean 

417.75 423.48 B: and the biggest thing too is i don't where are they it all where did they get the money for all this protection also 

424.92 432.59 B: you um you know they pretty much doubled the cops like in times square and um you know places like that and the national guards are there too 

429.34 430.30 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

432.43 433.44 A: mhm 

432.78 437.03 B: but now they're saying that they can't afford it so they're probably just going to have to take them all away 

437.27 438.11 A: (( mhm mm )) 

437.79 441.32 B: so you know okay fine then what happens 

441.23 443.97 A: yeah yeah definitely you know i mean 

444.53 445.52 A: um 

446.91 448.13 A: it's gonna 

448.24 450.33 A: you know it's gonna get worse you 

451.23 454.32 A: know but i think that's what these people want they want us to live in fear 

454.18 456.17 B: which is what we have cannot do 

455.93 456.77 A: pardon 

456.57 458.61 B: yeah that's just what we can't do 

458.61 460.65 A: no we can't you know 

460.68 461.60 A: um

480.96 483.37 B: not scared but just um 

483.57 497.11 B: you know like pay attention a little more instead of just like running through the subway you know what i mean if they see something weird or like see something out of place they they tell someone like they'll go to like the transit police or you know something like that 

487.92 489.06 A: mhm 

496.55 497.55 A: right 

497.53 502.73 B: i guess i mean that's i guess that's good the whole the scary thing is you know people then get too paranoid
