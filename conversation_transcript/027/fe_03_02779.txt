31.57 34.03 B: oh this is gonna be an interesting one [laughter] 

32.83 42.01 A: [laughter] i mean once in a blue moon i might watch basketball or baseball but that's about it i have a nineteen month old so it's hard for me to watch anything 

41.83 43.44 B: ah yeah 

42.57 48.69 A: [laughter] that's t._v. or on my computer so i mean on my t._v. so i have to record everything and watch it later [laughter] 

48.06 53.05 B: when they said what's your favorite sport on t._v. and then how often do you watch it is that what they said 

52.47 53.41 A: uh-huh 

53.80 56.04 B: so what's your favorite [laughter] 

56.16 58.97 A: i guess my favorite would be basketball [laughter] 

59.34 63.46 B: okay that's probably me too i'm probably the same so 

62.77 67.19 A: i used to watch it all the time when i was growing up but i don't watch it any more hardly ever 

66.49 76.21 B: nup i do i i mean probably because the mavericks have been in the playoffs i've been watching it a lot and i've got two boys and they both play a lot of sports so 

72.44 73.49 A: mhm 

75.44 76.75 A: oh yeah 

76.39 82.66 B: i do watch more than i should probably i watch the dallas cowboys even though they're crummy um 

82.95 85.10 B: but and you don't watch much at all 

85.27 88.45 A: mm once in a while i'll watch it but not normally 

88.49 89.42 B: ah 

89.31 94.39 A: oh and actually i do like to watch auto racing i forgot about that i do like to watch on sunday 

94.29 97.46 B: you see i've never watched that i've never watched that before 

96.96 104.47 A: yeah i hadn't watched it in a long time and then the one time i did watch it i was over at a friend of mine's house that was the the race that dale earnhardt got killed in so 

104.55 106.34 B: oh that's that's great i 

105.04 106.37 A: i watched that race 

106.72 108.66 B: (( don't know if i'd watch any more )) 

107.97 112.30 A: oh but the one day i decided to watch it in so many months and he gets killed 

111.68 113.49 B: (( well you know )) 

112.35 116.11 A: it was really unusual 'cause they had a really bad wreck before him 

116.12 122.69 A: and um that one i thought somebody would have got killed in and then when his happened we never would have thought he would have got killed in 

122.48 126.05 B: oh yeah there were i think there was one that ah 

126.31 133.90 B: right here in dallas at this ah new race club up here i don't even know what it's called 'cause like i don't watch it so 

134.16 139.27 B: so how long how often do you watch it i think they want to ask that they talk about how often 

137.58 138.57 A: (( that )) 

139.56 140.85 A: (( one [laughter] )) 

139.66 141.37 B: how many hours a week 

140.95 146.65 A: once every couple of months and i think when the it'd probably be what two hours i guess two or three hours 

145.64 149.42 B: yeah you know i think it depends 

149.50 151.71 B: to me it depends upon 

151.85 162.22 B: which sport you know what's going on and like during the playoffs like for right now i'm probably watching it you know gosh probably 

156.65 157.63 A: yeah 

162.56 169.92 B: four to six hours a week because of basketball playoffs that's probably why i'm doing it and during football season i'll sit down and watch 

165.65 166.46 A: mhm 

169.96 173.09 B: you know one game on a weekend which is like three hours 

172.75 174.09 A: right 

173.49 179.64 B: um i watch a little tennis i actually i do watch quite a bit of sports i guess i don't watch t._v. very much at all 

179.46 180.34 A: [laughter] 

180.25 184.96 B: but when i do it's sports or you know like news stuff 

180.47 181.42 A: it depends 

184.44 193.31 A: yeah well um during the um braves uh baseball season when the braves are winning i'll i'll watch them but [laughter] if they're not winning i'm not gonna watch them 

190.30 191.57 B: (( yeah i )) 

193.37 200.11 B: wonder if they're trying to figure out what sport's most popular among us [laughter] or they're just listening to how we talk um 

196.83 198.37 A: (( [laughter] i don't know )) 

199.10 209.14 A: i think i think they're they're studying more i think how the conversation can get off subject probably 'cause that's the end of this lot with me [laughter] 

208.38 213.08 B: well probably so with women talking about sports [laughter] 

211.23 214.78 A: yeah [laughter] i almost didn't take it 

213.08 221.65 B: i play tennis so- i i well i thought about that too but then i thought you know i started thinking i was like i do watch a lot of sports more than i- 

220.60 221.59 A: [laughter] 

221.64 228.23 B: but you know what i play of all sports i play tennis but i probably watch it the least isn't that funny 

227.00 227.80 A: yeah 

227.95 231.35 A: [mn] well i love to um watch to play volleyball 

231.43 232.73 B: oh

236.55 238.10 B: yeah 

239.08 240.50 B: (( that is fun )) 

239.45 242.50 A: not on the team or anything but in the classroom 

242.52 248.75 B: i do think it matters it makes a difference because if you have a nineteen month old you wouldn't have experienced this yet do you have a boy or a girl a 

248.32 249.61 A: i have a little girl 

249.40 261.57 B: little girl well then you might not experience this as much because you have a girl but i i have two boys and one's thirteen and one is eight and they both play soccer basketball you 

250.01 251.01 A: (( yeah ))

265.90 267.01 B: (( ah )) 

268.98 271.98 B: yeah that's my that's my older one so 

270.99 282.24 A: and my next my next door neighbor he is in college now but um i knew him when he was like thirteen and he's played in like every sport there is he actually got a football scholarship to a college in florida 

281.79 282.91 B: (( wow )) 

282.45 285.22 A: yeah but the um he went to 

286.30 288.17 A: (( i don't know it was it was )) 

288.76 301.36 A: i can't remember it was like a ninety eight percent black school and he's white and he did not feel comfortable there at all and then his coach ended up being crooked and everything so he's back here in georgia now so 

295.64 296.55 B: (( aw )) 

298.82 300.81 B: (( oh that's too bad )) 

301.47 302.81 B: (( that's too bad )) 

301.87 312.40 A: he had a he had to forfeit his scholarship which is really sad but anyway he's now he's having to pay to go to college so [mn] he's really having to work hard but but he um 

312.43 316.33 A: he went i found i found a school where he could play football in so 

316.60 323.61 A: so he is still doing football yeah yeah but that that coach was into um some drugs and stuff and 

317.75 318.93 B: (( so he's happy )) 

323.49 324.93 B: oh that's great 

324.25 327.81 A: yeah and he was arrested while my friend was there 

327.44 328.48 B: you're kidding 

327.92 331.98 A: and it's just i i thought he may needed to report him 

330.45 331.46 B: (( [mn] )) 

331.97 333.65 B: oh my goodness 

332.09 332.99 A: have him 

333.01 334.80 A: really have him locked up but 

334.82 336.51 B: that is really 

334.94 338.51 A: he was he was just happy to get out of there [laughter] 

338.58 341.89 B: yeah i bet you know where we live it's 

342.50 345.91 B: everybody holds their kids back for sports 

345.88 346.70 A: (( yep )) 

346.19 348.73 B: so you know hold them back a year 

348.42 349.57 A: hm oh yeah 

349.07 355.51 B: well which you know we didn't but there's a lot of people that that will hold their kids back for instance the 

355.21 356.06 A: yeah 

355.72 356.51 B: um 

356.52 363.19 B: the high school coach football coach his son is in the same grade as as my son 

359.39 360.13 A: mhm 

363.04 363.81 A: mhm 

363.47 370.27 B: and my son is an older seventh grader 'cause he's got a september birthday and they cut off september first 

370.11 380.13 B: and he this kid's almost a year older than my child so she should be you know one grade higher than he is and he would still be an older eighth grader so 

370.20 370.83 A: (( mm mm )) 

380.51 384.27 B: you know everybody hold them back for sports and ah 

384.22 385.11 A: yeah 

384.44 387.23 B: um which is not right but they do 

386.42 387.95 A: mm yeah 

387.41 392.85 B: (( and then they do well you know we won state in football so that's just that's just how it is )) 

392.89 393.58 A: (( mm )) 

394.06 398.88 B: well anyway well so you you have a girl so you'll probably 

399.83 402.93 B: do the gymnastics first with her [laughter] 

401.91 405.56 A: yeah well i was actually she loves to dance every time the 

403.97 406.46 B: to dance or yeah 

406.00 419.50 A: music comes on like if it's just a commercial or something on t._v. or whatever and i can even sing and she'll start dancing [laughter] she's just funny so i think i want to get her into like jazz or something like that

427.57 429.96 A: doing that when i think she was three or four 

430.09 444.74 B: you know i did though i did dance and i did athletics and you know i really think that that really rounds you out i really do that way you're not too sissy but then you're not too much on the boy side or so 

433.40 434.17 A: mhm 

439.30 440.77 A: yeah my husband 

443.93 450.42 A: i stay at home with her so i want to put her in something like that so she'll have the other interaction with other kids and stuff
