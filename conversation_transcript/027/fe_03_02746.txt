88.05 93.41 B: no i go to some of them then the ones that i don't go to i try and watch 

93.52 96.23 B: but um life things get in the way 

96.37 99.60 B: like like having to make dinner and 

96.51 97.45 A: yeah 

99.68 107.20 B: things like that but i try to have it on even if i'm in the kitchen making dinner i try and watch it this year they're so bad 

100.79 101.65 A: yeah 

107.21 114.36 B: that um it it's hard to watch sometimes and i will turn it off if they're looking really stupid 

107.92 108.56 A: (( it's )) 

114.12 115.90 A: very disappointing [laughter] 

114.91 124.52 B: yeah which is a lot of the time um this year but we had such great teams in the passed that everybody's just kind of just waiting for that to happen again so 

116.00 116.85 A: yeah 

124.64 127.44 B: um but you know i figure if you're a fan 

128.00 129.79 B: (( um um [mn] )) 

128.19 128.96 A: (( yeah do )) 

129.07 132.06 A: you like to watch it live better or on t._v. 

131.78 139.09 B: um well there's i like both i like to go to the stadium because you're really feel like you're a part of it and it's a lot of fun but 

137.60 140.10 A: yeah that's what i like [laughter] 

139.29 144.11 B: you see so much more when you're on t._v. um 

141.27 142.63 A: yeah definitely 

143.46 146.23 A: (( unless you're willing to spend the extra money [laughter] )) 

145.56 155.77 B: yeah i what i do when i go to the stadium is that i usually take head phones and listen to it on the radio while i'm watching it because otherwise you have no idea what's going on 

152.14 153.07 A: oh 

155.64 156.53 A: yeah 

155.97 164.18 B: unless you're lucky enough to be right behind home plate um which most of us aren't um at least you know you feel contact with it 

158.66 159.50 A: yeah 

164.16 174.23 B: um but i i like hearing the commentary at home on the t._v. you know when they're cause they give you a lot of information that you don't get when you're just sitting there watching it 

174.15 180.49 A: yeah it seems like the hardcore baseball fans really know their stuff and you don't get that like going to the the stadium 

179.93 182.73 B: oh no cause you have no idea what's happening 

182.65 183.55 A: yeah 

183.02 191.18 B: you know and you get they they give you a lot of background information on t._v. and i i'm sure it's the same for other sports as well i'm sure it's the same thing for football 

191.16 195.75 A: yeah like whenever i do watch sports on t._v. i watch football but um 

196.02 201.30 A: uh usually like the superbowl like i don't have a team or anything i'm from connecticut originally 

199.08 200.04 B: uh-huh 

200.71 201.69 B: (( oh are you )) 

201.64 205.25 A: we're not tied to any any pro team at all 

204.88 205.88 B: yeah 

205.69 208.98 A: are about the only uh the only team i watch on t._v. 

208.63 209.85 B: yeah 

209.69 210.58 A: but 

210.64 215.56 A: that's pretty much the same for all of connecticut everyone in connecticut loves the women [laughter] 

214.95 220.70 B: oh really that's they're they're really good at basketball right that's the team that are really good at basketball 

216.28 217.25 A: yeah 

218.29 219.35 A: (( yeah )) 

220.47 221.44 A: yeah 

220.77 229.11 B: yeah i think we had a one of our high school kids here from cleveland that went there no wait no she didn't she went to kentucky or something

230.66 232.59 B: woman's basketball 

232.89 233.93 B: school 

233.99 235.46 B: but it wasn't i 

235.54 239.55 B: don't think i watched a little bit of the um n._c._a._a. tournament 

239.68 245.25 B: um when it was on but only because i was running a pool here 

245.24 246.35 A: [laughter] 

245.84 248.10 B: and um i felt i should 

248.50 249.38 A: yeah 

249.12 255.10 B: watch and see how my teams were doing but i don't really have much interest in basketball 

255.12 261.78 A: yeah me neither it's not one of my favorite sports i mostly because like i'm i'm really bad at it [laughter] 

257.21 258.22 B: no 

261.21 276.08 B: oh well i'm not good at any of it um i would never play any of it but i don't know there's something about baseball it's it's when in ninety five when the indians were so good um i started watching and i started learning about it cause i'd never watched it before 

276.09 281.05 B: um much and um you sort of really you really get into it 

281.02 282.00 A: yeah 

281.31 288.88 B: you know and and a lot of people did um people that were never interested in baseball before when you have a team that's really good 

288.90 294.75 B: um the stadium sold out for six years straight the only place you can watch it is on television 

292.08 293.08 A: (( wow )) 

294.33 296.14 A: [laughter] yes 

294.88 296.92 B: [laughter] so 

297.44 304.56 B: um you know i really got used to watching it and and getting used to listening to the broadcasters so 

304.58 306.36 B: um it was lot of fun 

306.76 309.12 A: do you watch e._s._p._n. also 

308.60 309.65 B: um 

309.90 317.05 B: i don't watch a lot i watch it if something happens to be on um we had a i don't know how much you 

316.94 328.14 B: follow high school basketball or the n._b._a. drafter and any of that but we had a a kid here who um is going to be drafted by the n._b._a. who just finished high school 

327.74 329.00 A: oh my goodness 

330.25 331.85 A: i've heard that name actually 

330.96 340.19 B: yeah and he's just like kid and a lot of his games were they televised on e._s._p._n. the high school games 

340.35 348.97 B: because he was such a phenomenon and there was so much hype about him people wanted to see him so i did watch it i did watch e._s._p._n. when he was on 

348.87 349.80 A: mhm 

349.22 353.12 B: just to see what all of the was about and um

357.63 359.44 B: watch much

379.64 380.71 A: (( oh wow )) 

379.75 387.04 B: and um all of his life from the time he was a little kid you walked into their house and he was watching some type of sports 

387.10 389.13 B: i i said if there was 

389.29 401.01 B: on e._s._p._n. he would be watching it and he to this day i mean he's thirty two years old he's still is huge sports fan all kinds of sports everything doesn't matter what it is

419.69 420.75 B: yeah 

420.81 422.15 A: [laughter] 

421.75 423.72 B: pretty much is his life 

423.92 426.58 A: i think it would be fun to be a sports caster out 

426.35 430.47 B: yeah it's a crummy job though because it's um 

429.06 430.03 A: (( there really )) 

430.71 437.01 B: you're pretty much at the mercy of ratings and how your general manager likes you 

433.77 435.06 A: yeah 

437.21 440.95 B: and sometimes it is based on who knows what 

441.05 449.86 B: and it's a tough field there it's there's not a lot of opportunity because there's not a lot of sports gifters it's not like hard news where you need a lot of people 

448.29 449.42 A: yeah 

449.88 456.34 B: and um you have to he started out in idaho in some small idaho fall oh it 

456.34 469.77 B: was awful for a year and then now he's in south florida in a secondary marketing florida and it's um you know i it's just tough and he does weekends you know he can't get a week day job and 

469.87 478.10 B: um they need a reporter during the week and um you know he'd love to break into the international sports stuff but how many people could do that 

470.30 471.26 A: yeah 

478.34 480.09 A: yeah that's really hard 

479.51 480.63 B: yeah 

480.37 484.74 A: although it seems like they are adding so many more e._s._p._n. channels like 

483.93 484.93 B: (( mhm )) 

485.09 490.63 B: yeah but there is a zillion people out there wanting to do that which is the problem so 

488.66 489.67 A: yeah 

490.70 498.95 B: um he just signed a three year contract i think to stay where he is unless he gets a job in a bigger market and then he's can opt out of it but 

499.16 500.08 B: um 

500.19 504.20 B: yeah it's tough i mean i guess he's been fortunate to get as far as he has 

504.45 508.40 B: and be on air which is what everybody wants to do so 

505.85 506.81 A: yeah 

508.43 512.18 A: but does he like actually go to the games or is he in a studio like reporting 

511.55 517.90 B: no he's in a studio reporting um during spring training when all of the teams were down there he will um 

518.06 525.08 B: you know during the week he reports so he goes and he does interviews and and stuff during the week to the spring training 

522.14 523.46 A: oh wow 

525.38 533.93 B: um but he was very excited because we won nineteen hundred dollars on the kentucky derby so he was wildly excited about that 

530.77 532.07 A: [laughter] 

533.32 534.27 A: wow 

534.18 535.09 B: so 

535.45 538.24 B: it's just what he does and you know 

538.46 541.13 B: he gets paid to do it which is i guess 

540.45 541.84 A: that's great 

541.29 543.16 B: yeah fortunate 

543.40 545.87 A: but do you watch the kentucky derby a lot too 

545.28 552.92 B: no well i usually do watch it and really i probably wouldn't of watched it this year except i happened to be my brother was visiting 

552.88 563.40 B: and um he really wanted to watch it and we were at uh somebody's house and he was adamant he needed to be somewhere to watch the kentucky derby so i watched it 

563.24 568.17 B: and usually i i if i'm home i'll watch it but i wouldn't stay home to do it 

567.98 568.88 A: yeah 

568.32 570.29 B: you know but it was fun 

570.51 578.60 B: and um then his son called about three seconds after the horse won to tell him that he'd won nineteen hundred dollars so that was kind of fun 

576.51 577.59 A: wow 

578.98 585.76 A: yeah i used to really want to be a jockey like horse racing looks like so much fun i've never actually watched it on tv
