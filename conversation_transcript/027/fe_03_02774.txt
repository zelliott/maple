204.10 215.33 A: okay but see i was pretty lucky with erie because i mean i had the cleveland browns the steelers or the buffalo bills [laughter] so i had all three to choose from and i ah i think i went with my dad cause he's a steelers fan so i think i followed that route 

208.54 210.26 B: (( all right )) 

213.90 218.81 B: i think most ah [noise] erie people are steelers fans yeah 

216.56 217.88 A: are steelers 

218.00 223.42 A: well i don't know i like buffalo i at least liked when he was just playing for them and now you guys have who 

221.79 222.61 B: uh-huh 

223.64 226.48 A: used to be with the patriots so that's 

226.61 233.59 A: that's an interesting thing but you know there are other pro sports i mean i kind of got away from baseball too when they went when they went on strike a while ago 

233.21 234.28 B: yeah 

233.83 239.53 A: um to me it was like you you know you're making too much money you're you know a bunch of crybaby millionaires and 

236.66 237.68 B: (( yeah )) 

239.06 252.17 B: it's ridiculous as it is the last topic that i had was about [laughter] the prices that ah the pro athletes get so high yeah and uh-huh [laughter] that was that was my first phone call 

240.77 242.44 A: exactly 

246.55 249.75 A: oh yeah that's so did i about a month ago 

249.82 251.59 A: yeah they were talking about it 

251.68 256.02 A: mine too and i and i talked to a girl from philadelphia [laughter] 

252.38 253.80 B: [laughter] 

253.96 256.82 B: [laughter] i talked today a guy from texas yeah 

256.31 257.46 A: oh 

257.74 272.12 A: oh so but no i mean i mean i'll watch i mean i like sports and i'll watch on t._v. but i mean i don't go into like the you know drag racing i know there's a lot of drag racing fans up here and you know i may i may kind of watch it but it doesn't 

268.27 271.40 B: yeah nascar and all that 

271.75 286.46 B: see that bores me too it's just like round the track yeah woo hoo unless there's a crash which you really don't w- you know that's that's not good plus there's a crash it's not very interesting and that's you know scary because when somebody could get killed so 

272.70 277.19 A: that yeah it's like round in a circle you know 

279.72 281.33 A: no no 

284.88 285.98 A: right 

286.40 290.66 B: yeah it's not the same as the action with hockey where people are fighting 

289.07 290.70 A: ah hockey it just 

290.99 300.16 A: well i i don't like the fighting in hockey they can do without that i mean there's such a thing as good checks and and good play but i mean the fighting i think they can they could still do without it 

291.26 292.68 B: it's just kind of funny 

292.74 294.07 B: no but it's 

294.20 295.62 B: yeah 

299.51 301.77 B: well that happens in basketball too 

301.56 302.76 A: yeah 

302.13 306.31 B: not so much hockey is like one of one of the infamous 

306.55 307.55 B: fighting 

307.58 308.57 A: yes 

308.07 310.03 B: um sports 

309.46 312.31 A: and i haven't figured out why they always thought they had to fight [laughter] 

311.76 317.66 B: it's always so you know like all the all the gear goes gets thrown on the ice and [laughter] 

315.54 316.62 A: (( yeah you know )) 

316.77 322.43 A: you know and you're punishing your helmet and you know you're doing yourself a lot of damage there probably more than you do to your opponent 

318.37 319.39 B: [laughter] 

321.77 323.52 B: yeah 

322.83 337.59 A: but ah but in other words i mean i i that's one thing i'm i'm glad of i mean i love sports and now i have my husband will laugh 'cause he'll tell everyone yeah she's more into it than i am and you know i go to more hockey games than he does and um i've got season tickets next year [laughter] 

337.60 340.39 A: and he'll tell you she's more into it than i am [laughter] 

340.11 344.91 B: that's then that's kind of unusual usually yeah usually it's the men 

342.02 343.77 A: yeah it's the other way 

344.58 353.85 A: but then again he turns around and has to call me to watch the the football draft and i'm going how boring is that they sit there for four hours and say okay you know 

349.86 351.79 B: oh yeah 

353.04 354.36 B: i pick you 

354.06 359.63 A: yeah woo okay okay carson daley okay he was the or whatever his name was 

354.58 356.75 B: [laughter] 

359.53 369.36 A: trophy so that's the first pick okay that's exciting now will they sign him or not well just sit here and you know every fifteen minutes waiting for who's gonna pick who [sigh] that's boring [laughter] 

368.58 369.68 B: yeah 

369.55 380.38 A: well but then but i mean there's some you know there's some games you can watch on t._v. and be fine with and other ones they just seem to lose it i mean i love watching hockey but even on t._v. it- it can get a little 

370.02 371.31 B: i agree [mn] 

380.24 389.72 B: it's harder to follow i think it's you just don't have the excitement of when you've got the crowd going and but it's so like with basketball i 

381.58 383.03 A: it's a little harder 

384.97 387.29 A: oh yeah oh yeah 

389.68 403.11 B: actually prefer watching the playoffs on on television rather than just the regular games it's it's it's more exciting there's a lot more action going on it seems like everybody's trying harder or something i don't know it always seems like it 

398.16 399.36 A: yeah 

401.29 404.43 A: well well they want that extra cash [laughter] 

403.06 416.31 B: yeah it's just it seems so much more you know exciting when you get into the playoffs and that's usually when i really get into it but yeah and you're passive like glued to the t._v. for every game [laughter] 

410.49 411.66 A: yeah 

414.59 417.25 A: (( [laughter] you know it's not )) 

416.25 430.21 B: i have a l- i have a l- infant now though i have a two year old and an infant an eight year old and a seventeen year old and um i have a twenty two year old that's not living in the house any more but so i'm just like i'm busy [laughter] 

418.65 419.56 A: oh 

420.96 422.04 A: oh my

431.38 433.53 A: i mean i only have a five year old so 

433.73 434.57 A: but 

434.07 435.93 B: well that keeps you busy too [laughter] 

435.48 440.48 A: (( yeah i mean i could have a twenty two year old well i'm not telling you how old i am [laughter] )) 

439.07 441.92 B: oh well we must be close to the same age 

441.08 445.75 A: (( must be yeah so so you know it's it's like ugh )) 

445.97 458.15 A: but i try to get her you know try to get her in- involved with sports and you know last time i try to get her to play to play soccer and i've been to a couple of soccer games now that that is an interesting sport to watch 

457.56 465.87 B: yeah well it's fun to do too i remember in high school i liked soccer was my favorite and field hockey i loved field hockey 

458.26 459.04 A: (( ah )) 

462.93 464.17 A: oh okay 

465.13 467.93 A: oh we didn't have that in harbour creek 

467.07 472.59 B: [laughter] really oh we had field hockey i loved it but i was very lethal with the stick [laughter] 

471.01 473.36 A: (( oh oh i know why she likes hockey )) 

473.15 475.69 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] yeah it's true )) 

473.42 475.81 A: (( out of my way [laughter] )) 

475.74 478.59 B: get over excited that sticks are dangerous 

478.09 480.09 A: yeah oh yeah 

478.67 485.24 B: [laughter] but it was it was fun it wasn't you know on ice but it was it was it was fun to do 

485.11 490.73 A: yeah no i played the only time i played sport was was was basketball and then 

490.99 493.64 A: i helped manage helped manage the football team 

493.93 502.44 A: 'cause i was like i wanted to be a kicker and you know but you know no girls were allowed to play on the team so that was the closest i could get was helping helping out the co- the coach and being a manager so 

498.09 499.25 B: oh 

502.59 506.87 A: i doubt even you know that got old after a while it's just like i can't play 

506.64 509.46 B: [laughter] yeah that's not fair 

507.07 509.20 A: (( [laughter] you know basketball )) 

509.60 513.51 A: yeah and i liked baseball better than softball and i didn't want to play girls' softball 

513.23 521.68 B: oh i was so bad that i i just tried everything to get out of it [laughter] i was really bad at softball [laughter] not my game 

514.69 515.89 A: (( ah yeah )) 

516.82 517.99 A: [laughter] 

519.31 520.35 A: (( well )) 

521.28 523.27 A: well i liked baseball 

522.57 534.33 B: that's probably why i just really hate baseball i have bad memories from literally nobody wanted me on their team cause i was so bad i mean i was good at most of the other sports but you get me in softball and it was just like so bad that 

525.87 526.91 A: oh 

528.87 530.22 A: oh 

533.65 534.64 A: (( no )) 

534.37 535.48 B: [laughter] 

535.61 541.31 A: so i take it otherwise you're not you know well with all the kids and everything it's it's tough for you to watch any sports on t._v. right now 

541.49 553.92 B: oh it yeah it's just kind of hard to concentrate um on a on a game because the little one's giving us a lot of attention and then the two year old is jealous of the the baby now he's just started that he was fine 

543.91 545.14 A: yeah 

548.04 549.51 A: oh yeah 

553.84 554.89 A: (( oh okay )) 

553.91 560.15 B: and um now the baby's eight months old and um noah's decided that he's 

560.20 561.29 B: he's jealous 

561.37 562.13 A: (( okay )) 

561.47 575.49 B: if i sing to the baby then i have to get him up and sing to him which is fine [laughter] but it's just like now it's like constant you know whatever i do to the baby then i have to do the same thing because he gets and he does the same thing with daddy so it gets [laughter] 

568.20 569.40 A: yeah 

572.70 573.58 A: (( um ah )) 

574.32 575.30 A: oh 

575.86 576.84 B: funny 

576.93 578.44 A: well they are that way 

578.35 581.51 B: so it- it's even demanding more time now 'cause it's 

578.50 579.21 A: (( [mn] )) 

580.73 581.64 A: yeah 

581.78 582.79 B: [laughter] 

581.90 590.50 A: it's like if we watch it well we've been watching the pl- the hockey players on t._v. and of course my daughter just goes for the [sigh] you know the team in white she thinks it's us 

590.52 593.46 A: because she's so being you know home home in white 

593.16 594.16 B: uh-huh 

593.49 599.89 A: so she watches you know she we're watching the tampa bay she's oh that's the team you know luckily for us it was tampa bay in wearing white so she was like oh there is
