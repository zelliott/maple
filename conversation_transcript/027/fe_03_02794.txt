196.23 197.22 B: (( uh huh )) 

196.88 209.04 A: but unfortunately my husband drank a great deal and i'm not going into that but there was a great deal of rivalry there because he didn't it was supposed to be his team to win 

202.90 203.84 B: yeah 

209.20 216.40 A: and i got to the point after i divorced him and everything else that i don't i never took up football again it was like 

215.22 219.15 B: yeah i can i can see that you know there's a lot of 

219.11 229.42 B: probably not very good memories associated with it [laughter] so yeah and you know what's what's bad is i think that 

219.16 220.38 A: yeah 

222.44 225.04 A: mhm mhm and and 

229.27 241.46 B: around here people are so crazed about especially the college basketball teams that you know they might not like somebody just because he went to that school or something like that [laughter] 

235.35 236.34 A: (( mm )) 

240.93 242.84 A: but i mean i've never seen this 

243.15 248.04 A: so bad people virtually are like children and they're grown up 

247.91 249.41 B: that's right 

249.09 256.62 A: i mean and it's like don't you understand that this is only a sport this is not a a matter of life and death

273.47 286.92 A: no no you know god has reasons for everything and and i say to someone he's not gone from me i'll just see him when i go to heaven as far as that goes but his theory was that people were too serious 

276.90 278.36 B: yeah 

287.14 295.92 A: he said you you play to win yes but he said you play against yourself not against other people he said that that's not it 

293.80 305.79 B: right and it's to enjoy it the love of the sport not you know i think it's gotten crazy because i had an uncle who played baseball before world war two

325.27 339.16 A: i mean i know that the sponsors and all that did for the super bowl i mean that's millions of dollars worth of advertisement but look at it man that's nothing but stress stress stress and it's not a game any more it's like

339.49 350.02 A: ah years ago my father used to talk to me and i'd watch boxing i love boxing and and all that but my father told me he said sissy he says this is all fixed 

344.13 345.36 B: mhm 

350.20 360.75 A: he said they know who's gonna win this championship before they even put it on i said dad that's a and then when i did an investigation and everything else you know when i grew up and did some 

361.51 364.68 A: you know investigative work and paper work and stuff like that for 

364.70 366.13 A: different things like

371.64 373.08 B: mhm 

372.47 384.80 A: and my son told me that he said mummy he says don't you realize he says a lot of times that the college ball games are fixed he said the coaches virtually take money i said i don't wanna hear that [laughter] i really don't wanna go that way but it's it's terrible 

384.56 388.20 B: well you know that ah tommy morrison 

388.30 390.47 B: that guy that was a boxer 

390.04 390.94 A: (( uh huh ))

395.00 395.90 A: mhm 

398.00 401.28 B: um husband's um 

401.43 415.54 B: coworkers some relative works for him and he kept on asking you know oh can you get tickets really good tickets again to his fight and he's like oh no i'm not going well he already knew what was going on [laughter] 

404.33 405.66 A: mhm 

414.69 416.51 A: mhm mhm

424.01 426.07 B: and um 

426.34 433.99 B: [lipsmack] you know i guess he got it from a bad lifestyle and and now he's like crazy must still live in some 

430.81 432.17 A: (( mhm )) 

434.06 439.65 B: i think he bought some place with a cave down in arkansas is what i read in the paper just the other day

451.79 458.97 A: yeah well that's like anybody though in any any kind of if you're in competition i know because virtually 

459.08 463.51 A: competitiveness has to be in your blood to be able to win 

463.38 464.77 B: yeah that's true 

463.52 475.92 A: but you have to have the right heart in the sense of knowing when to stop and when not to stop people nowadays have too much stress i mean they don't have the right heart in hardly anything [laughter] 

465.91 467.19 B: mhm 

475.18 476.25 B: no 

476.13 480.28 A: and all it's a matter of ah i'll do it to you before you do it to me

480.56 481.92 A: (( not )) 

482.48 486.87 A: yeah it's not a matter of doing to others as you would have him do unto you any more

487.10 488.62 A: (( [laughter] )) 

487.99 498.19 B: no it isn't people are afraid and you know people lose their jobs and and ah you know th- i think everyone experiences where they see backstabbing 

498.08 499.28 A: mhm 

498.62 499.94 B: and ah 

500.06 501.15 B: you know people

504.51 511.39 A: well gee whiz you know if i get out and do something in own yard i've got a neighbor that virtually she has to go do it faster sooner 

511.16 512.50 B: (( uh huh [laughter] )) 

511.88 513.00 A: and copy 

512.94 526.25 A: and i said i don't like people that have the same thing i'm a i'm an individual and i like unusual things and i got to the point where i wasn't ugly i just didn't associate with her any more and i just couldn't 

513.15 514.36 B: yeah 

525.03 525.95 B: sure 

526.17 532.66 A: and i spoke to my husband he said what's the matter i said i'm so tired of people coming over using my library blah blah 

532.46 541.65 A: this that and the other doesn't matter we're getting off the subject but anyway the competitiveness was a matter of i want to i want to beat you i want to do better than you i want to have a better yard 

534.57 535.48 B: (( uh huh )) 

541.46 548.71 A: and in sports and things like that when they come over and play you know horseshoes or croquet or something like that it was i'm gonna beat you 

548.83 550.21 B: right 

548.92 556.02 A: and not it didn't matter if they cheated it didn't matter if if we played fair or not it was like i'm gonna beat you 

555.64 560.12 B: yeah that's what my husband said about this guy that he used to golf with he would 

560.73 569.22 B: you know have several more strokes than my husband and my husband would say well i shot a five on that oh i did a four [laughter] you know 

569.41 576.95 B: and you know that's just the way it is with some people and it got to the point where he didn't even want to play golf with him any more it was any fun 

576.34 583.55 A: [mn] well no you see it's not it's supposed to be fun that's the whole thing people have lost the ability to have fun 

583.43 584.73 B: mhm 

584.47 585.92 A: (( and all that i think so )) 

586.07 593.46 A: too and um when you sit down and watch your football game or basketball game or i sit down and watch ice hockey to me it's graceful 

593.66 599.95 A: it's entertaining it's not a matter of okay my team's gonna win and yours isn't
