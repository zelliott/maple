89.08 92.03 A: i went to a small technical college 

91.79 95.16 B: oh so you didn't have like a basketball team or anything

94.59 97.73 A: no no in fact they didn't have any 

98.27 104.26 A: profess- like any sports teams at all it was just a very small rural technical college so 

104.45 106.87 A: we didn't have any teams to root for 

106.64 111.37 B: well i guess the most exciting thing [laughter] that happened to me when i was in college 

111.58 115.26 B: i was uh i was in r._o._t._c. i was in the drill team 

114.90 115.84 A: mhm 

115.41 122.93 B: and uh before the games start the basketball games this was at new mexico state university i grew up in new mexico 

123.50 138.00 B: um i was part of the color guard and we would march out and we'd present the arm the the uh united states flag and walk out and march out into the middle of the court you ever seen those guys do that i was one of those guys and so uh i mean i guess that's 

133.93 135.31 A: mhm 

138.02 145.74 B: not really professional sports we should probably be talking about professional sports but that was you know i always watch like watching those basketball games after that 

146.19 147.38 A: yeah 

147.58 148.89 A: do you watch golf 

148.89 149.89 B: well 

150.05 161.65 B: you know about ten years ago i i played golf for a while and i did start watching it for all my life i thought golf was the most boring [laughter] thing to in the world especially on t._v. 

161.12 162.49 A: [laughter] yes 

162.01 163.96 B: and then when i started playing 

164.00 168.26 B: it seemed to be somewhat interesting how 'bout you 

166.41 167.38 A: mhm 

168.14 169.91 A: my husband is a golfer 

170.02 175.58 A: and we live you know like i said in central ohio so we get to go to the memorial tournament 

170.07 170.98 B: yeah 

175.72 183.94 A: just about every year so it's more interesting for me to watch golf now that i have gotten to go to see you know a tournament 

184.02 184.93 B: yeah 

184.40 192.10 A: in real life than it was before because i always watched golf with him and i thought it was just so unbelievably boring 

191.60 195.15 B: oh yeah it really puts you to sleep it really is good at putting you to sleep 

194.37 200.38 A: oh yeah so but it is much better after you at least know a little bit about the sport and have seen the people 

200.86 202.86 A: you know face to face 

201.52 202.40 B: (( i )) 

202.56 204.04 B: yeah i guess so i 

204.10 211.21 B: i think i'd have a hard t- unless i started playing on a regular basis i'd have a hard time watching uh any of these guys on t._v. 

210.74 212.05 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

211.42 220.38 B: but i don't know i i do like now several years ago i used to watch the uh professional basketball and i used to like the celtics they were pretty good 

219.70 220.75 A: mhm 

220.37 226.51 B: this was i don't know maybe ten years ago and that that was pretty exciting when this was when all the real famous guys were playing 

226.46 227.36 A: right 

226.79 230.20 B: like larry bird and kevin mckell and all those guys like that 

227.87 229.02 A: mhm 

230.43 232.94 A: yeah probably i would say 

233.61 235.04 A: the the most 

235.07 239.18 A: the main show i watch is baseball and nascar 

239.44 241.46 B: baseball what

259.77 261.10 B: how was that 

259.88 260.71 A: so 

260.89 272.62 A: that was very interesting i liked going to the baseball games and we have in in columbus here we have the columbus clippers and they're a minor league baseball team but it's it's even neat going there to see them 

263.89 265.02 B: now did 

272.47 286.04 B: now we have a uh one of these triple a teams uh in in norwich connecticut and they're the the norwich navigators and they were a a yankee farm team but now they're the san francisco giant 

278.36 279.45 A: mhm 

286.06 287.83 B: um farm team 

287.36 288.25 A: mhm

322.16 323.15 B: uh-huh 

322.81 328.01 A: we haven't taken them to the ballpark yet here locally but i think it would be fun for them too 

327.68 330.33 B: yeah once they get a little bit older probably 

330.04 337.06 A: yeah right now my two year old would just wanna run up and down the steps and my daughter would probably just wanna eat a hot dog and go home [laughter] 

336.50 341.77 B: well eating hot dogs is uh is high on my kids' list [laughter] 

340.52 342.10 A: [laughter] that's right 

342.40 344.25 B: that that is kinda fun

379.18 380.14 B: now there 

379.61 380.35 A: so 

380.42 386.48 B: i was just thinking about all the different range of professional sports now there is one professional sport that i like to watch 

386.54 396.47 B: 'cause uh see i i since i grew up in new mexico uh there were a lot of cowboys round where i grew up and you know we we have horses and i like watching the rodeos 

396.09 398.80 A: [noise] i used to like watching the rodeos 

397.97 403.75 B: 'cause those that i mean that is really that's a cool sport 'cause they have all these different things that they do 

401.39 402.94 A: mhm 

403.71 408.55 A: yeah i'm i like watching that on t._v. i think that's very interesting watching the rodeos 

408.04 413.18 B: yeah as long as i you know the stuff like when the when the girls get up and they do the uh 

413.24 422.26 B: the barrel racing that's that's pretty good 'cause you know that no one's gonna get hurt but some of those things are pretty just kind of brutal 

414.50 416.34 A: mhm 

418.39 419.46 A: yeah 

421.05 422.27 A: it's amazing 

423.05 424.26 B: yeah 

423.91 426.51 A: amazing that they can live through it some of those 

426.07 428.16 B: 'cause oh yeah 

427.33 431.47 A: mishaps that they have i'm like good grief i don't know i don't think i would ever 

431.63 432.98 A: [laughter] 

432.00 433.97 B: you don't think you'd ever wanna do that 

433.32 434.79 A: i don't think so 

434.77 437.14 B: now have you ever ridden a horse 

434.95 435.55 A: (( [laughter] )) 

436.86 438.46 A: i have ridden a horse 

438.54 442.22 B: well could you imagine yourself being a barrel racer that's what the girls do 

440.87 441.87 A: no 

441.90 451.64 A: no i can't imagine i i think i i was very intimidated riding a horse i i guess just having feeling like no control over the animal 

446.47 447.48 B: really 

452.15 455.66 A: but i i rode one a long long time ago 

452.20 453.33 B: yeah 

455.93 456.79 B: well that's 

455.94 457.11 A: and uh 

458.23 462.17 B: yeah well i think that's a learned thing you know my my kids are nine and 

462.06 474.59 B: my son he uh he rides on the horse and man he uh he at first he was real scared then after a while he gets you know more and more into it and maybe some day he'll be at one of those rodeos i don't know [laughter] 

473.36 475.27 A: [laughter] 

475.72 479.20 A: yeah that's that's that's true you never know what your kids are gonna 

479.52 483.11 A: we keep telling our kids that they have to go to ohio state [laughter] 

483.04 485.18 B: oh of course they gotta be a buckeye
