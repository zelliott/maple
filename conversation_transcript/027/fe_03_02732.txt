1.32 3.92 A: hello this is lisa 

3.32 4.93 B: hi this is carmen 

4.96 6.15 A: carmen 

5.93 6.99 B: how are you

7.75 8.76 B: i'm okay 

8.59 11.39 A: good where are you calling from 

11.11 12.88 B: uh seattle washington 

12.55 16.20 A: oh okay i'm in vancouver b._c. 

15.35 16.62 B: [noise] oh 

16.58 18.03 A: yeah 

17.44 20.18 B: and so the topic is about how american can 

20.60 22.81 A: prevent bio 

21.77 22.93 B: bioterror 

23.60 24.93 B: bioterrorism 

24.86 26.08 A: yeah 

26.32 28.25 A: have you done this before 

26.92 30.11 B: [noise] [noise] no i haven't actually 

29.52 31.39 A: oh i haven't either 

30.92 32.19 B: oh okay [noise] 

31.46 34.29 A: i've missed a couple of phone calls 

33.60 34.82 B: oh i see 

34.55 38.71 A: and um anyway here we are so 

35.17 36.16 B: (( [mn] )) 

39.23 42.91 A: i don't know if it's a topic that i have given a lot of thought 

42.93 44.10 A: have you 

43.79 49.94 B: [noise] uh yeah actually i i have i i have children and so i live near the water 

50.39 54.59 B: and so i've um uh often wondered about what we could do 

54.90 63.50 B: to prevent any type of attack uh other than having uh the police force or the military um 

64.28 65.61 B: what is it 

66.15 70.67 B: police the or guard our water supplies um the bridges 

70.75 71.81 B: uh 

72.79 75.09 B: what is it what else what else could be 

75.37 78.57 B: another way that bioterrorism can be 

77.84 84.06 A: well the air primarily is what i'm really concerned about well water as well of course 

84.79 86.16 A: and uh 

85.52 87.08 B: and yeah i 

86.64 88.58 A: and the air that we breathe 

89.66 93.05 B: um i know that i know that um 

93.51 95.79 B: but also with the mail 

96.00 97.38 B: is another thing 

97.73 99.42 B: uh but with 

99.55 101.70 B: what you suggest about the air 

103.00 105.94 B: i mean that's really can't can't really control that 

103.02 104.30 A: i don't know 

105.68 114.96 A: no i don't know that that that can be controlled i i i think it it there would have to be some sort of 

115.09 120.80 A: uh gosh what can i say anti antibodies developed um 

116.43 117.76 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

121.06 125.08 A: the the uh vaccine type of thing perhaps 

125.59 127.20 B: to have it on hand 

126.94 128.26 A: yeah 

127.41 129.23 B: in case that's a good idea 

129.00 135.39 A: yeah that's that's pretty because it really is each individual that would be in- affected 

135.04 136.15 B: that's true 

135.50 137.59 A: all at the same time 

137.62 139.80 A: like you say it's not something that 

141.39 143.33 A: w- we have can control 

143.68 149.98 B: my my one concern is about the water and uh the water primarily second to the air 

143.77 144.58 A: but 

150.05 157.00 B: and um you know policing the water raising the dams it's kinda hard [noise] but i think you'd have to get um 

157.81 159.48 B: enlist local 

159.65 165.78 B: citizens to patrol who are trained [noise] who get some type of training to [noise] what to look for 

166.09 168.85 B: or is that too uh too general [noise] 

166.33 167.24 A: yeah 

169.28 170.44 A: um 

170.59 171.93 A: (( [mn] )) 

172.50 179.76 A: prevention would have to for me anyway when i think of prevention it it it's catching it before it happens 

179.97 186.87 B: [noise] [noise] b- but usually bioterrorism that's that's kinda hard because i'm looking at a reactive how to react 

187.96 189.00 A: yeah 

188.04 189.73 B: as a secondary measure 

190.21 191.46 A: yes 

191.19 194.11 B: and so that's another thing that i i i 

195.27 200.89 B: i don't know that's kinda hard and it's kinda scary when you think about it um well how we [noise] 

198.67 199.51 A: (( oh )) 

199.52 204.89 A: well it is because i don't know enough about it but but as far as water water supply 

204.95 206.01 A: um 

206.11 212.65 A: the tried and true is is distilling boiling everything before before we consume it 

212.80 215.27 A: um or use it 

215.31 219.21 A: uh i i don't know that that really would be an option either 

217.72 218.64 B: (( [noise] )) 

218.98 220.08 B: (( [mn] uh )) 

219.29 221.54 A: it it's pretty scary the whole thing 

221.55 225.53 B: yeah i don't i don't know if that would be that would be more well 

225.85 231.04 B: that would be more for um diseases i'm thinking of poisons [noise] 

231.26 235.60 B: and i think the only thing that you can really think of is every possible 

231.72 232.54 A: yeah 

235.81 238.40 B: uh poison that they could put in the water 

238.71 241.56 B: and [noise] like you said developing developing 

241.57 242.45 B: um 

242.37 243.30 A: (( yeah that's true )) 

242.57 244.11 B: an antibody 

243.48 251.97 A: an antibody has to be developed because how how once we have it well a cure is a cure i suppose is number two 

252.40 262.96 A: uh prevention to me is is the first step and then if if uh prevention fails then cure comes second 

254.90 256.06 B: (( [mn] )) 

263.70 274.40 A: but as you also mentioned earlier pre- prevention with having um qualified people patrol and and police patrol and that but uh again 

274.51 278.16 A: how does one do that it it sort of goes back to 

278.80 280.90 A: [sigh] to industrial pollution 

280.78 282.45 B: yeah yeah 

281.40 286.09 A: if you remember that that that took some time before 

283.14 284.24 B: mhm 

287.03 288.71 A: before it 

287.13 287.94 B: befor- 

289.04 290.48 B: was implemented [noise] 

289.29 295.31 A: solutions were found and and then the solution really is prevention not letting it happen 

290.95 291.96 B: yeah 

295.18 296.08 B: true 

295.82 297.73 A: so uh 

299.43 301.81 A: gosh what a difficult subject 

301.70 305.33 B: well i think i think it's difficult because it's real 

306.56 310.48 A: it's real and it's it's very difficult to control 

307.55 309.08 B: it's a real threat 

310.41 312.85 B: yeah but i um 

313.05 314.48 B: and too pro- 

315.87 320.01 B: immigration has to step up even more i know they have now 

319.61 321.63 A: oh absolutely 

320.07 325.52 B: but they have to step up even more um i know on the canadian border they're really sharp up there 

325.69 328.04 B: how they've been able to catch people 

325.82 326.83 A: yeah 

328.21 329.22 B: um 

329.27 339.19 B: you know what here's another thing about when when you talk about bioterrorism in the air we breathe is the animals 'cause it usually will affect animals faster particularly birds 

335.15 335.90 A: (( yes )) 

338.71 343.09 A: yeah but that's not just but that's the whole food chain you see 

339.58 340.78 B: (( [mn] )) 

342.92 344.17 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

343.21 350.52 A: that's what makes it so scary it's it's it's the water and the air and yes it starts with the animals and and the plants 

350.23 353.09 B: but at least the uh animals can alert you 

353.73 354.83 A: (( that's right )) 

353.92 359.24 B: you know how the how the canaries when they took 'em down to the mines they alerted when methane gas was 

359.61 360.82 A: that's true 

359.64 360.68 B: (( but uh )) 

360.85 363.29 B: that's another thing to uh 

363.54 365.54 B: [noise] unfortunately but 

366.13 369.03 B: you know i love i have a bird and i love animals but 

366.18 367.82 A: to be aware 

369.44 372.76 B: i'm the higher one [laughter] so 

371.23 372.55 A: yeah 

373.35 378.87 B: that's one of the things i i look at and i've often wondered um getting on the site ready ready 

378.84 389.60 B: about just in case we are attacked about preparing for the uh worst and getting a water some reserve water supplies canned food 

390.08 400.53 B: uh plastic to seal the windows and the doors et cetera et cetera yes i've certainly considered that 'cause we we already prepare the for the earthquakes around here um in washington 

394.26 395.23 A: yeah 

399.27 400.49 A: right 

400.59 401.45 A: yeah 

400.71 402.60 B: (( [noise] so )) 

403.18 406.17 B: it's it's weird because you watch it on t._v. 

406.52 412.48 B: and it's really happening and i think a lot of times um hollywood helps it 

412.69 417.76 B: help help the terrorists think [noise] of creative ways don't you 

412.80 413.63 A: yeah 

416.84 423.94 A: yes yes absolutely absolutely the music industry the the the a 

418.56 420.50 B: yeah and so 

423.98 425.64 A: lot of things but 

425.72 430.18 A: but i think it's always been like that there's the good and the bad and 

431.10 436.61 B: [mn] but don't you think that with bioterrorism though you'd also have to protect your 

436.66 437.59 B: um 

438.59 445.33 B: uh transportation like the transportation way for example the bridges because if they can take that out 

442.62 444.27 A: oh yes 

445.43 449.04 B: even though we have air and air support 

449.19 451.67 B: you know what i mean it's harder for 

451.73 455.05 B: ambulances to get to certain places 

454.53 465.52 A: absolutely yeah no that certainly has to pro- be protected but but i also do believe that um a a stricter immigration 

455.97 457.09 B: so 

465.68 468.14 A: policy is in order 

468.20 474.22 A: and yes it's it's coming into effect but there are always loopholes 

471.33 472.20 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

473.87 475.07 B: mhm 

474.40 477.41 A: as there always will be um 

478.15 478.92 A: uh 

479.39 485.05 A: that's it's like it's almost bordering on i'm at the point of bordering on xenophobia 

485.23 486.50 A: almost 

486.59 487.72 B: oh really 

488.18 490.71 A: (( well yeah because i don't know )) 

491.16 493.44 A: all these people that come in that 

494.27 497.23 A: i don't know how properly they're screened 

496.89 498.02 B: yeah 

497.73 498.75 A: (( you know )) 

498.03 500.13 B: or but then also the uh 

500.86 504.52 B: um the the american islam- islamic 

504.69 507.26 B: people [noise] like there's a guy in in 

507.56 512.58 B: seattle that admitted i don't know if he was coerced but he admitted that he helped the al qaeda 

512.46 513.80 A: yeah 

513.31 514.25 B: uh 

514.51 524.37 B: and he was a prominent young man he was you know he did a lot for the community but i think he was disillusioned without realizing how much it'd infringe on his personal rights 

524.86 526.50 B: and i think a lot of people 

524.93 526.43 A: that's right 

526.92 529.60 B: um don't realize that 

530.22 532.27 B: um it's more than 

533.16 537.96 B: um if if you're religion infringes on a person's [noise] can you hold on a minute 

537.68 538.95 A: yes 

538.85 539.47 B: (( [cough] )) 

540.09 544.25 B: excuse me if if it infringes on a person's 

544.32 545.93 B: right to live [noise] 

546.18 547.84 B: according to 

548.87 552.07 B: just the basic human rights and it's something you might wanna 

553.08 553.74 B: (( uh )) 

555.00 568.05 B: uh take a step back so it i there's a lot of that i know i used to live in an area where we used to see a lot of the islamic guys passing out stuff to the to the general public and well dressed young men 

564.06 565.23 A: mhm 

566.05 567.12 A: mhm 

567.83 568.87 A: mhm 

568.52 572.28 B: and i think um hey i think they became [noise] 

572.31 574.23 B: from what i read in the media 

574.56 576.24 B: uh pawns 

576.17 578.05 A: yeah yeah 

577.08 580.23 B: and you know was using it like that one gentleman that got arrested [noise] 

580.25 581.43 A: yeah 

580.69 585.77 B: and his whole life has forever changed [noise] because of a belief that he once believed in 

585.64 586.91 A: yeah 

586.07 591.03 B: but um as far i i know that i i guess what i would do is um 

591.78 594.14 B: watch what the israelis do 

594.92 599.95 B: [noise] what what do they do to prevent bioterrorism because they're in the heat of it
