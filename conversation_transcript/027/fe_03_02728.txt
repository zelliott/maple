87.03 89.99 A: so how has nine eleven affected you 

90.89 99.91 B: well actually at the initial stage it was the travel of course you know did people did that but uh you know i've been travelling a little bit i mean uh 

100.15 106.09 B: the airlines here it's you know the screening process that's the main thing that you know you have to go through 

105.75 107.68 A: mhm 

106.97 112.31 B: as far as i'm concerned uh right now is as it's concerned with bioterrorism 

113.33 123.04 B: i don't know you know they had that scare with the anthrax thing but that was you know basically it was a deranged uh disgruntled employee of uh a company 

122.86 125.79 A: well have they ever found out who did that i didn't think 

124.87 129.59 B: i think they did yeah the guy i think he was caught some place in maryland i'm not sure 

129.60 132.38 B: i think around that area but he was the one that uh 

132.88 138.67 B: he had access 'cause you know it's it's a hard product to get access to so he had access to it and uh 

138.11 139.79 A: mhm 

139.05 143.32 B: i think he was just trying stir up things that's you know it's like you remember when people 

143.68 148.71 B: were tampering with products that's what caused uh with paranol 

146.01 149.01 A: yeah then they started putting safety 

149.13 155.82 B: exactly because if those things that what they had all this special uh thing yeah that's that's been happening there 

149.89 151.75 A: yes all that stuff 

152.34 153.71 A: that's been a while 

156.19 165.16 B: the one thing that's been affected here in the west coast of california uh and i hear it from my friends and relatives in uh the east coast new york 

165.44 169.89 B: that was the sars you know you heard about the sars 

168.27 170.63 A: mhm oh yes 

171.15 172.37 B: now i think 

171.17 175.43 A: but don't you think that's about blown out of the wat- i mean out of perspective i mean 

175.48 185.63 B: yeah it's well it's funny you know you know what the um in the chatrooms right now the latest thing they're saying is that they think i don't know they think this is the bioterrorist uh 

176.65 177.76 A: (( really there's )) 

185.71 189.82 B: virus that they you know spreading sars i don't know 

188.60 192.96 A: i thought i heard on t._v. that totally it absolutely was not 

193.40 201.93 B: well i don't know they put it in a chatroom so some people have been saying that but that's a lot of bar- you know why would they do that uh 

202.08 209.28 B: in the far east and start it there i don't know where you know they say it'll in china then it went over there 

202.26 203.49 A: mhm 

209.12 210.93 A: mhm 

210.26 218.00 B: the only thing it's hurting is the economy of uh mostly uh certain cities in certain areas communities 

217.88 224.11 A: so are you thinking i know we're not supposed to talk about this are you do you see any hope for the economy turning around 

223.81 227.13 B: no uh i mean you know 

227.87 236.89 B: i mean i hate to say it i mean you know bush was here in california this past week you know and you know he that he doesn't like california

254.92 255.83 B: wow 

256.58 257.98 A: gee 

257.35 266.22 B: that's just it when they say yeah san francisco's the highest highest city that's paying the most the the funny thing is that almost all the oil refineries are in the bay area 

266.43 267.62 B: and they're here 

266.72 267.68 A: (( mm )) 

267.69 269.97 B: but so we're paying the most but they're not 

268.99 270.86 A: so well that don't make sense 

270.81 273.77 B: i know it doesn't but you know it's it's well 

274.80 289.13 B: the economy what what's happening i don't know with with the bioterrorism things and all the scares it's hurting the sars thing is hurting the economy a little bit in some of the uh communities some people aren't uh travelling and some people aren't going to restaurants it 

287.44 289.53 A: you're right it affects travel 

289.74 291.27 B: affects restaurants 

291.28 292.54 A: right 

291.47 297.83 B: you know people are not eating not in certain uh restaurants a lot of them are like the chinese communities they're not going there 

297.59 299.19 A: mhm

300.74 302.09 A: mhm 

301.46 308.40 B: so the you know it's hurt- the politicians are you know saying that you know there's there hasn't been any cases here but i guess people just you know 

309.26 312.87 B: you know feel like it originated in china or 

311.89 316.28 A: well has there ever been a confirmed case in the u._s. of of sars

334.84 336.12 A: (( mhm )) 

337.66 339.44 A: mhm 

338.79 351.36 B: the united states has controlled it pretty well i've got a feeling that i i think uh see i don't know how it is in your community i mean you're probably so well you're such a small community that everybody knows each other so nothing could go through there 

351.04 354.95 A: [laughter] yeah we're pretty sheltered here actually 

353.10 353.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

354.77 358.30 B: well you're controlling it and that's good because you know what's going on 

358.30 362.74 A: i like small towns i mean i think they have a lot going for 'em but 

360.39 361.40 B: (( oh yeah )) 

362.77 367.89 A: i know with culturally and everything it's not here but that's not everything
