205.79 206.85 A: (( oh okay )) 

207.24 214.28 A: so how many i mean i guess one of my hobbies is doing things like this and mystery shopping 

213.81 215.83 B: oh you actually mystery shop i've had 

215.21 216.79 A: oh yeah 

216.17 221.78 B: i've had a lot of experience with mystery shoppers because uh one of my jobs i used to have was 

221.84 229.49 B: as a a as an uh manager at a disney facility so we used to always have to make sure that the mystery shoppers were happy [laughter] 

228.71 230.74 A: [noise] oh really 

230.36 231.56 B: yeah 

231.67 235.32 A: yeah i um [cough] i actually sell for a living i sell insurance 

234.77 236.83 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

235.84 236.88 A: but 

236.96 242.83 A: i have an incredibly flexible schedule so i pretty much go when i want go where i want and do what i want all day every day 

242.72 243.63 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

242.87 253.11 A: and i just had always wanted to be a mystery shopper when i was younger 'cause i thought it was so cool and i'd also been on the other side of that because most of my part time jobs [noise] when i was a kid were in service [mn] 

246.35 247.30 B: (( mhm )) 

253.13 253.94 B: okay 

253.16 254.37 A: and um 

254.51 260.71 A: [noise] one day i just [noise] you know f- i got this newsletter a some sort of parenting newsletter i subscribed to 

260.77 261.46 B: (( mhm )) 

260.86 266.26 A: and that was i was off i literally do now anywhere between 

266.30 268.92 A: [mn] five and ten mystery shops a week 

268.91 269.80 B: wow 

268.99 270.93 A: for all sorts of places 

270.93 276.79 B: how much how much is uh how much do they expect you to spend at a when you shop somewhere [noise] 

275.00 275.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

276.67 281.54 A: it really depends and i can honestly say that because [noise] yesterday 

281.62 284.76 A: i went to a mystery shop at um [mn] 

285.24 293.33 A: what's that [mn] place called um walmart i had to i had to mystery shop their optical department and the compensation was 

290.93 291.77 B: (( yes )) 

293.43 305.89 A: up to a hundred and twenty five dollars towards a pair of glasses so in that case i actually wear glasses so i had to wind up [noise] um spending a hundred dollars of my own to get exactly what i wanted 

296.50 297.44 B: okay 

303.98 304.88 B: okay 

305.75 306.70 B: mhm 

305.88 315.79 A: but you know [noise] for a free pair [laughter] for what you know the rest is going to be charged out to my insurance [noise] so it kinda works out totally in my favor 

311.62 312.59 B: right 

316.44 321.07 A: and i'm pretty happy about it and but for other things i spend four bucks 

317.74 318.56 B: well that's 

321.10 321.95 B: wow 

321.51 325.52 A: [noise] so it really depends if you're genuinely interested in mystery shopping 

325.33 326.18 B: uh-huh 

325.54 327.37 A: go to um [cough] 

327.78 335.93 A: in fact the way i got hooked up with this study [noise] is because there's a national database called mystery i'm sorry money and shopping dot com 

335.77 336.69 B: okay 

336.44 344.33 A: i know the woman that runs it and um she actually posted this project on her website 

344.70 348.99 A: [noise] in order to open it up to her membership and 

347.12 348.75 B: (( uh-huh oh okay )) 

348.86 363.84 A: i was just a little late on the draw because apparently now they need [noise] all male voices and things like that so i finally decided to get involved [noise] but you know i don't earn a ton of money mystery shopping but i do it i really do it because i have a genuinely fun time doing it 

354.26 355.08 B: right 

363.62 364.49 B: mhm 

363.84 367.08 A: and you know some of the things are [noise] really cool like my wife and i 

367.58 375.73 A: you know there was one month when went to fridays like almost every single weekend and they require you when you do a friday shop 

371.87 373.05 B: (( shi- [laughter] )) 

375.36 376.58 B: (( yup mm )) 

375.93 377.91 A: they require you to 

378.33 392.65 A: go to the bar get drinks and an appetizer then go to the table and get drinks [noise] and dinner [noise] and desert and coffee i mean that's like at fridays that's a fifty [noise] to sixty dollar meal all for free so it's pretty slick [noise] 

384.85 385.93 B: oh boy 

389.23 390.09 B: (( mhm )) 

390.64 391.47 B: yeah 

391.63 401.01 B: yeah 'cause i was i was always wondering that because that it seems like a really good gig and it's a great part time gig you're not going to make a living on it but it's a great great perk so 

399.19 403.82 A: right although i'll be honest with you whereabouts are your located geographically 

402.67 403.42 B: uh-huh 

403.83 406.07 B: oh i'm i'm located in chicago 

406.01 410.64 A: oh my gosh i went to school in chicago at depaul university 

409.10 412.88 B: oh where oh you went to depaul that's where my wife went to graduate school 

412.91 414.69 A: really [noise] 

413.92 416.28 B: yeah she she was in the theatre program there 

416.06 418.58 A: ah boy she must be good at what she does 

418.44 420.10 B: yeah well she was she was 

418.89 421.17 A: [noise] they don't let any old slouch in there 

420.90 423.52 B: no you have to be pretty good there she was um 

423.64 427.21 B: she was a a director uh working in 

426.02 427.36 A: when did she go 

427.67 430.90 B: uh let's see that would be ninety three ninety four 

430.99 433.67 A: [noise] okay see and i entered depaul in ninety four 

433.62 434.51 B: (( oh okay her )) 

433.71 435.22 A: um what's her 

435.85 438.03 B: (( name is uh elaine dawson )) 

436.34 439.22 A: (( name )) 

438.44 442.05 B: and so she was there for ninety three ninety four and then she left 

442.27 443.39 B: and uh 

443.68 450.48 B: then she went spent the rest of her life uh for a while trying to get into theater and then she got tired of it she is now a freelance editor 

450.47 452.50 A: (( [mn] ha okay interesting )) 

453.01 456.44 A: [cough] small world huh i'm in grand rapids michigan 

454.01 455.05 B: (( mhm [cough] )) 

456.35 457.94 B: oh you are okay 

457.28 467.50 A: yeah i met my wife [noise] at depaul actually and she was from grand rapids after we graduated from college she had an internship with the european commission [noise] 

460.27 460.97 B: uh-huh 

467.35 481.61 A: and i'd never been abroad and she actually had [noise] been to france but you know it was an opportunity we really couldn't pass up and so i went with her to belgium [noise] lived there for four and half months and then we came back to grand rapids 'cause that's where we left all [noise] our stuff 

481.03 482.23 B: (( mhm uh-uh )) 

481.79 487.50 A: at her mom's house 'cause she'd lived here her entire life [noise] and um just decided to stay 

487.54 488.42 B: wow 

487.57 491.68 A: but in a place like chicago there have got to be 

491.86 500.89 A: tons of opportunities and [noise] quite frankly if you wanted to live a modest lifestyle in a place like chicago you probably could live off of [laughter] mystery shopping 

493.74 494.64 B: (( m- )) 

497.06 497.82 B: (( yup [laughter] )) 

501.22 506.28 A: 'cause a lot of shops that you go to not only will they pay you but you'll get a meal out of it [noise] 

505.82 507.00 B: (( right wha- )) 

507.00 509.40 A: so it's fantastic [noise] [noise] 

508.93 522.75 B: yeah because then i was thinking about that but unfortunately right now i'm i'm gonna have to deal with mystery shoppers again because right now i'm a a software engineer but i'm going back to work for disney soon [laughter] and so [mn] i'm gonna have to 

520.04 521.02 A: okay 

523.30 530.24 B: keep my eye out on the on the shoppers even though even if it's always a fun game to play trying to find think who's gonna be the shopper 

527.95 529.61 A: [noise] mhm 

529.90 530.46 A: (( [cough] )) 

531.39 533.44 B: so i i was pretty bad [noise]

543.46 544.38 B: mhm 

543.76 547.20 A: and um it was in some situations that were just 

547.16 559.17 A: y- you know out of my control it was so obvious when i turned in my report that i was a mystery shopper they'd have to be like stupid to not realize it [noise] oh i'm sorry simon here let me wipe your hands 

552.53 553.37 B: right 

555.84 556.67 B: [laughter]

567.32 569.66 A: [noise] 

570.60 572.33 A: right

580.33 581.34 A: (( oh okay )) 

581.12 586.59 B: and uh it's always i actually like doing studies like this because i usually like try to 

585.21 587.80 A: oh i do too i totally believe in researching 

587.58 593.48 B: right and i usually try to look up the research after they're done so in about a year or two i'll yeah 

591.19 592.99 A: oh really [laughter] [noise]
