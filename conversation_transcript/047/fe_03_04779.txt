220.73 222.09 A: yeah 

222.65 225.10 A: but still i mean that's that's up there 

224.81 226.07 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

225.81 230.00 A: that's crazy you can go out and buy a six pack of beer for cheaper than a pack of cigarettes

229.69 230.96 B: yeah 

231.05 232.66 B: (( [sigh] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

231.31 239.43 A: jeeze yeah i i um i never have smoked um cigarettes before that's that's for sure um 

239.61 250.52 A: and and kind of the the way that i feel about the whole situation is is everybody kind of has a vice that they need and and you know i think that people 

250.65 255.00 A: some people they like to eat food when they get nervous or 

254.98 266.22 A: like to smoke or drink or go fast in their cars or whatever it is and i think that people that don't smoke really point fingers at smokers and go that's bad that's bad that's killing you it's killing you 

266.17 270.21 A: when in reality probably their vice is killing them also 

270.67 271.91 A: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

271.45 272.79 B: mhm 

272.49 280.28 A: and and i just i i find it i find it strange that people that that don't smoke have almost an anger 

275.75 276.62 B: [noise] 

277.41 278.64 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

280.15 287.87 A: towards people that that do smoke and ah you know i i don't know are are you a smoker yourself 

288.59 293.28 B: um no i'm not a smoker i [noise] don't um 

294.58 298.00 B: [noise] i don't smoke but i used to work in an office 

298.74 300.34 B: [noise] on an office 

300.47 301.60 B: where 

301.80 314.81 B: the the majority of the people are smokers and [noise] you know it's like i i have a choose i have a choice not i mean ah i choose not to smoke [noise] right 

314.01 315.35 A: right 

314.97 317.36 B: and and and i you know 

317.41 318.94 B: [noise] other than the 

319.22 326.29 B: other than rec- other than the research and stuff you know bef- before even like before i even read why the health reasons 

327.05 333.59 B: [noise] you know it doesn't it it doesn't suit me you know it it so [noise] you know 

330.11 331.17 A: right 

333.66 343.16 B: and then when the research kicks in and stuff it's like why should why should i tolerate [noise] why should i tolerate um [noise] the the smoking 

342.87 344.21 A: absolutely 

343.61 344.88 B: you know i [noise] 

345.75 354.55 B: [lipsmack] so you know it's their it it's their choice to it's their choice to smoke but you know when you put me in a situation where i have to choose between 

355.01 357.36 B: the air i breathe or 

357.63 360.69 B: i mean yeah between the air i breathe for work 

360.52 362.25 A: yeah 

360.88 363.54 B: [mn] it's um 

363.93 367.39 B: [noise] it's um it's a stressful situation 

367.49 374.79 A: absolutely absolutely yeah and and and i grew out grew up out in kansas um 

372.89 374.28 B: (( [noise] )) 

375.60 385.65 A: where you walk into a restaurant and there's smoking and non smoking section and they're basically divided by nothing ah you know one booth could be smoking the next booth could be non smoking 

385.57 398.54 A: and from from all the research that i've read and and just recently i guess new research has come out ah but but previous to this research it was been mainly said that second hand smoke is 

390.74 391.64 B: (( [noise] )) 

393.34 394.52 B: (( [noise] )) 

399.19 413.55 A: as bad or worse than than first hand smoke and and i just recently heard of research that said that second hand smoke's not as bad as what we're making it out to be and and either way i i think that no matter what 

402.30 403.51 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

413.59 416.62 A: it's it's not a a healthy thing to do 

416.71 418.46 A: and and i think it's ah the 

417.71 418.55 B: [noise] 

418.53 428.77 A: difference between a a bad situation and a worse situation i think those are your only choices and any time you smoke the amount of nicotine and the amount of of 

429.06 441.50 A: all those bad ingredients in there just just mess you up that's for sure and with ah with all the no smoking and eight hundred lines and the hotlines that help you quit 

441.33 449.23 A: i think it's great i think that the awareness is getting out there a little bit more and and there's more help for people because i feel 

447.92 449.22 B: yeah the 

449.49 459.59 B: my um my my my fav- my favorite among those things is is basically um ah c- commercials and advertising from truth 

459.45 460.64 A: yes 

459.87 461.75 B: [noise] they i mean ah 

461.91 464.16 B: their mission is to 

464.61 478.58 B: [noise] is ba- their mission is not to help people quit smoking [laughter] their mission basically is to inform the cust- the cust- consumer about about the things that cigarette companies are not telling you 

468.84 470.03 A: (( right mhm )) 

478.92 480.04 A: right 

479.40 481.06 B: [noise] and um 

481.62 486.23 B: [noise] you kn- if the person choose to quit they have they have um 

486.53 491.75 B: [noise] they have um information [noise] they have other resources on how the person can quit 

491.72 502.43 B: but i went to the i i went to their website and that it the websites are basically about about the truth about about tobacco 

502.29 503.56 A: yes 

503.55 511.99 B: [noise] and how and how and and how many people get killed from second hand smoke and and the you know the long term effects of it 

512.04 513.20 A: absolutely 

514.89 516.49 B: (( so )) 

515.25 517.82 A: yeah it's it is it's um 

517.60 518.56 B: (( [noise] )) 

517.90 524.58 A: i think it's really good i think it's really good that you get awareness out there and and 

524.40 538.06 A: make sure that people do know what the truth is and do know exactly what they're they're doing to their bodies and and if they are informed and do know the education then it's completely up to them it's their own right of whether they wanna smoke it or not 

538.27 545.70 A: but the more awareness i think is really gonna help and it is gonna prevent a lot of people from starting to smoke 

540.05 540.98 B: (( [noise] )) 

545.76 549.93 A: and the more hotlines to help people quit smoking the better too 

550.00 564.78 A: because i know that it's an addiction and like any other addiction it's always difficult to to quit and it seems like such a huge task and a huge obstacle to even start taking steps towards quitting 

564.61 567.08 A: and you don't know who to call you don't know what to do 

566.85 567.99 B: mhm 

567.35 570.78 A: there's so many different options out there that it it's 

571.03 579.84 A: overwhelming and and i just think that the that the more options out there the better that they have and and they can really start approaching it 

579.80 584.71 A: and and thinking about quitting and and you know i i used to um 

584.62 589.48 A: chew to- chew tobacco and i did that for about four weeks 

589.38 599.89 A: oh no no not four weeks sorry about four months and and quit cold turkey because i didn't know of any other way to do it and and now i i look at websites j- 

591.47 592.58 B: [noise] right
