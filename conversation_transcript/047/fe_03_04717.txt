38.37 46.75 A: well i'm a person who likes a lot of interesting things but alternative [mn] health right now is a big hobby of mine 

46.98 50.57 B: really is that because of um a medical issue [mn] 

50.06 55.40 A: oh i have a lot of medical problems [laughter] yeah i do but they're um 

51.96 52.74 B: (( ugh )) 

53.03 53.88 B: yeah 

55.80 68.05 A: they don't keep me from doing everything i want to do and i have no pain or anything [mn] but five years ago i had a heart attack and after that i got very interested in alternative health 

59.93 62.70 B: hm 

68.62 69.71 B: (( oh )) 

68.82 69.37 A: (( [mn] )) 

69.50 70.66 A: mhm 

70.05 73.89 B: is there a lot of information on the internet about that or something [noise] 

72.81 78.46 A: there sure is and i've got books and all sorts of things there's a lot of information 

78.50 81.35 A: i'm interested in electronic health 

81.55 83.25 A: electronic medicine 

83.21 86.38 B: what what does that mean i don't know what that means electronic 

83.41 84.21 A: (( [cough] )) 

84.24 84.99 A: (( [cough] )) 

85.30 86.30 A: no 

86.31 94.31 A: i guess you wouldn't uh there are ways of killing bacterial viruses parasites moles and fungi 

94.75 99.64 A: using electronic apparatus that you can build yourself 

99.99 101.21 B: oh 

99.99 102.22 A: and and um 

102.21 105.87 B: like those ion zappers that you put in a house and it 

104.94 109.40 A: well this is a zapper but it's not an ion zapper you have to [noise] 

109.67 114.26 A: uh either wear a special a bracelet that um 

114.66 118.15 A: that allows contact with your skin you know 

118.36 123.04 A: or you use um hand holds copper hand holds 

123.73 126.11 B: hm 

124.08 127.87 A: that are attached to the wires yeah to the leads 

128.24 135.00 A: and it's very interesting because i had lime disease and by using my zapper 

135.52 141.48 A: in three days i zapped for three consecutive days and [mn] the lime disease was [mn] 

141.53 149.97 A: was uh uh a- well was proven by a lab test which showed very high lime disease activity 

150.22 152.67 A: [mn] and um so 

152.69 155.58 A: [cough] i didn't take antibiotics 

156.18 159.78 A: [mn] my doctor gave me about ten days 

160.18 169.90 A: before she prescribed the antibiotics and by then i'd zapped for three three days [mn] and i had a second blood test and the 

164.57 167.34 B: hm 

170.04 172.07 A: bacteria were gone 

173.49 174.67 B: (( mm wow )) 

174.35 179.67 A: she said you zapped it away mhm [mn] so 

178.82 184.43 B: and and is is lime disease not something the body can generally fight off on its own 

183.20 197.76 A: never never never it never fights it off [mn] have you [mn] the lime disease bacterium i gather you're not sc- in science the lime disease bacterium [mn] is called a spirochete 

185.24 186.42 B: (( wow [mn] )) 

198.06 201.85 A: (( now syphilis is also a spirochete [mn] )) 

201.31 202.69 B: yeah 

202.08 206.07 A: and these are bacteria which are 

206.10 210.22 A: interesting in that they go to different organ systems 

210.91 213.34 A: and to different types of tissue 

214.03 219.58 A: that's why uh the lime disease if it's not treated immediately becomes 

219.91 225.49 A: a chronic disease which affects all sorts of different organ systems 

226.10 228.14 B: wow serious stuff 

226.89 230.66 A: so it it can it can kill and it does 

230.86 234.54 B: [mn] what did your um do you have do you have children or 

231.19 232.27 A: and 

233.29 236.14 A: it never goes away by itself 

236.03 242.49 B: d- what did your family think of um think of your approach did they think it was sort of uh controversial 

236.83 237.77 A: never 

240.55 243.95 A: oh they understand and they use the zapper too 

243.93 246.60 B: oh they support your decision good 

245.69 255.03 A: well because they saw well it's one thing i i did go to medical school i'm not an absolute fool i did tremendous [mn] amount of scientific research 

255.46 259.32 A: so that when i read a book and i see that the woman is using 

259.56 264.52 A: um scientific research to uh to get her results 

263.90 264.94 B: right 

265.28 278.61 A: uh and when she uh clearly is not interested in just a money making aspect with this not at all she uh her book her name is dr hulda clark c. l. a. r. k. 

279.09 280.36 A: and she 

281.05 284.06 A: she uh she's in san diego 

284.35 287.56 A: she has uh something called the self health 

287.79 291.83 A: research institute but she also has a clinic 

291.84 293.78 A: in tijuana mexico 

293.40 295.91 B: hm 

294.58 299.30 A: and she treats cancer that is absolutely terminal 

299.77 306.86 A: she's done a lot of very interesting research but since you have no science background you might not [mn] be a 

306.01 309.42 B: oh i didn't i didn't say that i don't have any science background 

308.75 310.68 A: oh you do ah 

309.87 310.81 B: yeah 

311.20 312.16 A: uh-huh 

311.21 313.27 B: i'll uh i'll check her out 

313.09 318.34 A: check her out dr hulda h. u. l. d. a. clark without an e. 

318.63 320.27 A: dot net 

320.36 326.96 A: and uh d- [mn] also you can look under zapper they're an awf- there's a been an awful lot of work done 

327.09 331.20 A: on electronic medicine and i think it's the uh 

331.58 341.69 A: it's a medicine of the future it's a type of [mn] they but it it's going to definitely cut away from doctors on um incomes 

332.73 335.54 B: (( hm )) 

341.77 343.52 B: [mn] well that's a good thing 

343.18 349.21 A: yup [mn] and you won't [mn] of the way she treats cancer is extraordinary to me 

349.24 354.22 A: [mn] uh i follow uh most of her suggestions because uh 

354.23 363.41 A: i don't want to have cancer [mn] uh but the first time i used a zapper i noticed that uh parasites 

356.41 357.32 B: right 

363.44 367.94 B: did you feel something when you were holding the the zapper thing you don't feel it mhm 

365.40 366.86 A: no you feel 

366.88 374.64 A: nothing sometimes there's a slight tingling but really slight i mean no pain whatsoever or anything nothing 

374.19 376.79 B: how long do you have to hold on to the 

375.43 380.04 A: [mn] oh that's what's interesting it's uh seven minutes on 

380.43 388.82 A: and then twenty minutes off seven minutes on and another twenty off and then one last seven minute session 

387.90 390.47 B: hm 

389.27 404.17 A: [mn] uh but she has she's been doing experiments all along and uh for people who actually have cancer they have to [mn] as- uh [mn] they really have [mn] especially if they've had it [mn] and it's spread 

404.43 409.11 A: uh there there's much more involved than just that and one of it is 

409.16 416.78 A: isopropyl alcohol what she found through the use of radio shack kits apparatus 

416.82 423.85 A: uh that she calls a syncrometer but she tells you exactly how to make it in ten minutes from a radio shack kit 

423.67 424.56 B: oh 

424.07 429.28 A: [mn] and uh with that she can t- through resonance 

429.47 431.72 A: she uses speakers 

431.73 433.59 A: and through resonance 

434.67 438.37 A: uh you can tell whether some substance 

438.49 443.21 A: any substance is in let's say your drinking water 

445.01 448.66 A: you use resonance to test your drinking water 

449.00 454.00 A: against a specimen of that substance for example she finds benzene 

454.27 456.69 A: benzene in uh 

457.32 458.81 A: in sodas [noise] 

458.97 465.54 B: hm oh yeah i've seen that as an ingredient in sodas i guess it's i don't know a preservative or something 

463.99 465.60 A: no that's benzoate 

465.63 469.58 A: that's benzoate but that's quite different from benzene 

466.04 468.15 B: oh oh it's sodium benzoate 

469.08 470.91 B: oh right benzene if like a 

469.98 473.54 A: she finds a petroleum product benzene [mn] 

472.29 474.30 B: yeah that's not good 

473.74 485.08 A: no and she finds isopropyl alcohol in pretty much all soaps and [mn] uh cosmetics and creams and lotions and so on 

485.59 487.10 A: and um 

487.21 496.72 A: she tells you how to make your own soaps [laughter] she gives you recipes it's really funny [mn] but she does and uh 

496.80 506.32 A: she gives you um uh well she tests everything she tests fruit for example [mn] she finds asbestos 

506.96 511.15 A: in a lot of fruit that you buy and use and 

510.44 512.18 B: that's really strange 

511.55 517.43 A: yeah well she figured it out she realizes that the conveyor belts 

518.14 520.00 A: the old conveyor belts 

520.03 522.19 B: they're not made of asbestos though 

520.96 522.32 A: yes they are 

522.82 524.43 B: oh my god 

523.80 525.91 A: they're made of asbestos 

526.33 533.39 A: and therefore as the fruit is rolling along the asbestos fibers get into the fruit 

528.78 531.26 B: (( mm )) 

533.64 535.12 B: wow 

534.66 536.89 A: and she tests everything 

537.31 539.42 B: so do you do this too do you have one of these 

539.13 540.90 A: i you know 

540.02 540.94 B: resonance 

540.81 546.61 A: [laughter] [mn] you think i would have i went to a radio shack place they didn't 

546.40 560.56 A: have that kit available i should have gone to others or should have asked them but i'll have to do it too because [mn] uh there's no question that she says with with this simple syncrometer 

552.51 553.45 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

560.60 567.68 A: [mn] you can when you hear the sound of resonance you know that whatever substance you're testing for is present 

568.60 570.97 A: [mn] and it's it's fabulous 

571.40 574.29 A: [mn] she tells you of that uh 

574.33 576.17 A: american [mn] 

576.62 580.85 A: uh dryers are better because their belts 

580.91 583.79 A: uh don't have asbestos 

584.79 587.27 B: (( hm )) 

586.39 596.25 A: all sorts of she uh [laughter] you know she's just to me she's just fabulous her books are called the cure for all cancers [mn] 

595.67 598.00 B: that what is it called the cure for all cancers 

596.54 599.95 A: the cure for all cancers then 

598.88 599.75 B: huh
