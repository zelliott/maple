416.43 419.27 A: well they did leave a cliffhanger on it 

419.05 425.32 B: well [mn] i felt like it was more than a cliffhanger like i i like a cliffhanger i felt like ti was just like 

426.15 429.41 B: like it was paused for an advertisement and then they just never 

428.68 432.41 A: and then it was over huh [laughter] 

430.04 431.16 B: yeah 

431.88 433.44 B: that upset me 

432.92 441.29 A: yeah i can i can i can dig that now i have been to movies like that like the star wars trilogies leave me hanging like that there's there's there's one that they just been running 

441.17 448.75 A: uh you're expecting something else to go on and then it's like you know [mn] boom here comes the credits and everything and you know [mn] 

448.77 463.75 A: and the saga continues you know that kind of thing i'm like oh don't do that to me you know they doing it in cartoons now i'm i i've watched i i have another hobby that's another little hobby i do too is watching cartoons i still watch cartoons and i watched this new cartoon this called yugio 

463.43 464.71 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

464.12 476.39 A: it's about these guys that fight with monsters with using decks of cards i guess it'd be a good las vegas game huh [laughter] but uh i watched it and it seemed like you know like out of the five days out of the week 

476.30 486.20 A: [mn] two of those days are going to be from a continuous you know like the you'll get a whole cartoon monday a whole cartoon tuesday then wednesday they'll slap a to be continued on you 

485.80 487.01 B: right 

486.40 495.01 A: you know and then they take and then they go ahead and keep you and so for- uh saturday and then saturday it comes on twice so the first time it comes on there's 

495.11 503.75 A: to be continued and then you got to wait almost two hours for the next time it comes on you know and i don't like i don't like to be left hanging [laughter] i don't 

498.76 499.65 B: oh 

503.25 505.28 B: it's in the middle of the story 

505.38 508.70 A: yeah yeah you know just give me give me the whole thing 

508.49 511.06 A: i would rather they had just went ahead 

510.86 513.49 A: and made a six or seven hour movie 

513.34 527.36 A: of the whole thing you know those that are fans of it will sit through it you know they would they will go ahead and take the intermissions and all of that there because fans don't care nothing about you know the time you now what i mean so uh uh 

526.38 527.71 B: probably true 

527.55 536.92 A: [lipsmack] you know i would sit i i would sit right through it even though this matrix movie the uh way they took they say on t._v. it is a little uh little lengthy it is over two hours 

536.82 538.42 B: yeah it's about two and a half 

537.97 548.80 A: yeah a little over two hours so you know uh um the [mn] the consensus i got from a couple of people that went and say you know it was good but they left you hanging and it was and it was 

548.57 553.31 A: like they shouldn't have let us watch that long of a movie and left us hanging 

553.21 567.16 B: that's what i thought well i think even like the star wars movie i still feel like there's a story there's a a rising conflict there's a climax there's some sort of resolution and that there's still stuff to be com- and then there's like a 

562.20 564.13 A: mhm 

564.75 567.13 A: (( yeah )) 

567.01 575.21 B: an overall resolution that waits 'til the end of the saga but there's still like a resolution within this portion of the story 

570.65 572.79 A: right right 

574.67 585.49 A: yes and well yes and what [mn] yes i can see what you're saying where uh uh at least at the with the star wars things e- even though they they they're leaving you for part three or part two 

585.60 596.42 A: you you feel comfortable with being left where you were you know you can hang for another two years another three years until the next one comes out you know like that mhm 

593.35 599.89 B: yeah 'cause it's like it's still an it's still an independent story within a greater story this matrix one 

598.34 599.52 A: yeah
