36.21 39.20 A: how much time we should spend to pursuing them 

38.51 44.39 B: [mn] yes do we yeah and do you think that just one everybody should have at least one hobby 

44.64 47.05 B: that they're into and um 

47.91 50.62 B: [mn] things like that do you have hobbies or 

50.47 62.64 A: [noise] uh i'd like to say yes [laughter] i i i th- i think just depends on i mean i think everybody needs an outlet and if they want to put that in form of of a hobby i think that's what they should do 

53.28 54.27 B: mm-kay 

62.79 63.79 A: (( um [mn] )) 

63.05 64.14 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

64.53 68.02 A: but i mean a a lot of times in a hectic world 

67.72 68.97 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

68.19 71.90 A: you know sometimes you you may not get to put as much time as you'd like 

71.95 83.30 A: um i know for myself i you know ten hour days or twelve hour days and then i go home and spend as much time as i can with my kid by the time i get around to doing something for myself a lot of time i'm tired you know 

82.84 84.59 B: right yup i 

83.74 86.12 A: so i mean [mn] but you know 

84.72 92.65 B: [mn] i totally agree with you on that i think that [mn] i think that a lot of people would probably do more with hobbies if they had more time but i think time is a big issue 

92.66 94.44 A: yeah 

93.49 101.59 B: and as far as hobbies go i think that [mn] that can really expand i think there's a lot of things i like i like photography 

101.93 103.03 A: right 

102.01 104.81 B: and and i like there's lots of things i like 

105.10 106.22 A: (( right [noise] )) 

105.98 107.16 B: but um 

106.42 113.81 A: same i mean i i like for a a while there i mean i carried a camera with me everywhere and my goal was to actually you know um 

114.06 117.06 A: decorate my home with my own pictures you know 

116.15 117.03 B: (( [mn] oh )) 

117.23 126.14 A: so i yeah i just thought it would be cool you know down the stairways and whatnot and you know th- that way people can say like wow you know this is yours or oh you did this and you know just conversation pieces too 

125.76 127.33 B: right right 

126.57 135.01 A: and um and that way you can put up exactly what you want but you know it it just got without having your own little uh darkroom 

135.10 136.80 A: i mean it gets pretty expensive 

136.94 140.45 B: yeah we i know it does [mn] um 

137.17 138.28 A: and uh 

139.91 142.55 A: so and then everything is digital now too so [noise] 

142.42 155.83 B: yeah that's true too i don't think that for digital well i don't know that much about that that end of it but i don't think that some of these pictures [mn] when you get copies made you take it in some place and they do it digitally i don't think the quality's as good 

144.07 145.07 A: [mn] i [noise] 

147.60 148.51 A: right 

155.50 163.74 A: [noise] [noise] right well y- you'd be surprised i mean i have my my son in law just picked up a twelve hundred dollar nikon body that's actually a digital camera

174.02 175.04 A: and uh 

175.18 181.58 A: they change out the lenses all the time just like a regular camera would but it's digital so it it's pretty nice [mn] i
