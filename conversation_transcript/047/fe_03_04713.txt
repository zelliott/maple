226.38 229.36 B: [laughter] right exactly 

236.30 244.42 A: i'm sixty and uh i uh i i've gotten into programming with computers and i just it's what i'm doing right now [mn]

242.65 247.25 B: yeah tell me some- tell me something about that is wh- exactly what you're doin' 

247.01 255.26 A: well i i i've invented a anti-theft device for uh diesel trucks there's about sixty billion dollars a year 

255.24 263.15 A: that's stolen from you know cargo goods and we all have to pay for it so i program in uh what they call visual basic 

259.16 260.16 B: uh-huh 

263.11 276.83 A: and uh what it what you do is is you write code out and you control the computer which which i just love to do i've got like four of 'em sitting in front of me i get a little ridi- i'm about as ridiculous with computers 

267.78 268.77 B: uh-huh 

276.72 281.23 A: as you are with that football game [laughter] 

278.23 279.78 B: [laughter] yeah 

280.02 283.61 B: sounds like you have a better chance of making some money off it 

281.94 292.32 A: well it you know it it will start making some money but i've been working on it a long time and haven't made a lot like i say my [mn] occupation is a i'm a mens' hairstylist or barber 

292.04 293.07 B: uh-huh 

292.41 299.43 A: and uh that's that's what i eat with [laughter] but uh as far as computer programming goes 

295.26 296.45 B: yeah 

299.45 314.27 A: [mn] i'm really independent that way i can't work for a company because when you write a line of code you have to document why you li- wrote that line of code and when you're writing two thousand lines of code [mn] it becomes a pain in the ass 

313.66 315.48 B: yeah yeah 

314.30 321.68 A: so that they can copy it and all that sort of stuff but i don't know i j- i just got into it in the last ten years and it's just uh 

321.79 323.52 A: i i love it 

322.89 335.21 B: well it's a you know i mean it's a good thing to get into that's for sure because i mean it's something that [mn] you know has taken off in every aspect i mean there's so much computer wise it's 

334.91 336.43 A: oh yeah 

335.33 341.34 B: [mn] i also [mn] i also i mean i guess as far as another hobby goes even though it used to be 

341.37 353.53 B: my main interest is was music i've played in bands and written songs and [mn] oh i play bass and also sing and and write songs but you know i i went full force 

344.28 345.20 A: oh 

346.14 347.41 A: (( what do you play )) 

353.43 365.11 B: at it when i was in my thirties even though i still you know had to work a job but you know i was in a band that did a lot of stuff but never quite got over you know the 

363.95 367.44 A: isn't that a b- yeah music is a bitch 

365.20 366.72 B: the hump i mean it was 

367.04 380.90 B: so close but you know i'm still in fact i have a rehearsal tonight y- -m playing with a band again and and i i'm still writing songs so now it's it's more of a hobby um you know because 

379.55 384.50 A: you have to love it you do you have to have a passion for it i see you do that you d- really do 

384.28 398.43 A: and you know the enjoyment l- like the computer even the football it it gives you pleasure and that's [mn] and that is our basic profit is is the pleasure that it gives us and and pe- s- a lot of people are lucky loving something and making money at it too 

391.42 392.50 B: right 

398.42 401.39 A: that's [laughter] [cough] that's really good 

399.00 405.49 B: right that's well that's that's the key in fact i i recently recorded um 

401.74 403.59 A: that's the secret 

405.51 417.30 B: about five five original songs that you know i'm starting to get around on a c._d. to for record companies and publishing companies in hopes of you know maybe selling a song or 

411.26 412.17 A: good 

415.50 416.46 A: yeah 

416.54 419.35 A: have you watched the star search thing where you just 

418.44 424.06 B: oh yeah yeah i see that th- this stuff is a little more um 

423.53 425.31 A: sophisticated 

424.72 435.10 B: [mn] well a little more you know i mean that's very very commercial and this stuff is has you know it it's it's a bit commercial but it's also a bit uh

464.01 465.09 B: yeah 

464.25 477.72 A: now the actuary tables as you close in on them [laughter] have a has a tendency to make you wait a minute i've got fifty years worth of things to do and i don't have that many years to do 'em in
