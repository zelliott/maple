290.61 291.85 A: oh well they 

291.02 295.27 B: i switched from the lakers be- be- because they they were just too much 

295.35 299.36 A: oh really well the lakers get all the calls i mean you know that's 

297.87 302.95 B: [mn] oh yeah they lost last year to the kings they lost flat out 

299.55 300.97 A: lakers get all the calls 

301.63 306.04 A: no well the referee didn't call any fouls on shaq that's why the problem 

305.28 311.54 B: not only they would make up calls against debock now he's the biggest pre- pretender there is 

308.30 310.13 A: oh yeah yeah 

311.32 313.24 A: oh yeah i know i know 

311.58 315.15 B: okay but some of those calls were not even there 

314.87 320.79 A: yeah that's true because i saw shaq just whack him as hard as possible and they didn't call anything and i'm looking at how is that possible 

318.95 320.01 B: yeah 

321.18 326.10 A: because they want the lakers to win i mean they make their money but i knew it this year lakers ain't going to win 

326.34 331.99 A: i mean you know what i'm saying i mean lakers ain't gonna win this year that's for sure uh shaq was crying i think 

332.02 335.18 B: so who are you going to make book on who's going to win 

335.23 336.78 A: detroit pistons 

336.56 337.80 B: oh no way 

337.83 343.49 A: yeah nobody on this planet think they're going to win but i'm telling you i think they have an excellent chance 

338.64 339.48 B: no 

343.56 346.86 B: new new jersey's going to take it 

346.67 349.39 A: that's what everybody thinks but this ain't going to happen 

349.13 351.06 B: [laughter] 

350.46 354.33 A: ain't going to happen you watch what i new jersey's going to win it all 

354.58 356.66 B: so you you you don't think 

357.05 359.31 B: san antonio has a prayer 

359.39 361.86 A: no see there's a great team 

361.23 362.75 B: (( it is a great team )) 

362.08 373.99 A: something wrong with them mentally you know they have tendency to choke i mean remember how they choke to the lakers that that one game um the fifth game i mean come on they had a twenty point lead and they almost lost i mean twenty five point lead and they 

374.14 376.18 A: (( [laughter] almost lost )) 

375.80 380.71 B: yeah but you're you're you're you're right about that but it's seven games it's not one game 

380.18 387.28 A: yeah but you could tell right away sometimes if a team's going to choke or not by those occasions you can't give up they had a sixteen point lead again 

387.59 392.33 A: or eighteen point lead against uh freaking mavs and they can't beat the mavs at home 

392.76 394.02 B: yeah that's true 

393.43 395.36 A: why do they keep choking 

395.35 396.90 B: that's true that's true 

396.25 406.50 A: they choke i mean come on twenty five point lead let me tell you when they had a thirty point lead against the lakers that's the only time i was celebrating and that was like two minutes left 'cause i figured they couldn't choke that game away 

407.25 408.79 B: no tell you the truth [laughter] 

407.45 413.54 A: i mean i mean they get these crazy [mn] i knew it i mean look they were dominating the lakers they should've won in five games 

414.29 417.25 A: but they made it into six games why 

414.44 415.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

418.11 423.10 A: i mean come on they could've one that series so easily they were so much better than the lakers but 

422.90 437.80 A: they were so like so stupid they stopped playing when they were winning twenty five okay well okay okay let's just not play anymore i'm sure lakers are going to start missing now hey you're wrong i mean come on they played tight i mean they get nervous when they're winning they should be losing all the time 

431.91 434.73 B: [laughter] 

438.19 442.60 B: i think the reason why i don't like the lakers that much now is because of kobe bryant 

442.92 444.92 A: what the wanna be michael jordan 

445.10 449.45 B: he's just attitude you know he's gotta come back down to earth 

449.24 455.53 A: yeah i know well what don't you like about him just curious i don't like kobe bryant either but what do you don't like about him 

454.52 455.81 B: his attitude 

456.08 460.22 A: yeah sure he thinks he's michael jordan and he's not 

460.03 463.91 B: yeah and after the game he uh loses tomorrow's another day 

464.07 465.96 B: (( uh bullshit [laughter] )) 

464.23 467.34 A: uh i know that he was like saying well it's another challenge 

466.78 468.26 B: (( [laughter] )) 

467.72 479.33 A: man fucking he didn't do i mean you didn't do anything you did not do anything in that game and you're telling me when you didn't do anything against it i mean he was be honest shaq was the one that was m._v._p. 

469.12 469.89 B: [laughter] 

479.72 490.35 A: uh because he's so big but still you know kobe's like well you know we can accept it as a challenge and now what he was crying like a little girl because i guess the challenge wasn't accepted 

481.33 482.43 B: yeah 

490.20 495.01 B: well if do you remember last year i think when he tried to take over the team

527.90 537.50 A: well uh yeah well i mean i'm not saying anything bad about i'm not saying anything bad about the chinese guy i mean he's a good player but i mean you got to understand he's just tall and he has some
