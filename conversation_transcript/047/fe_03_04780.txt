12.60 13.99 A: have you ever 

13.88 17.37 B: um i tried ah peer pressure

27.11 29.79 B: yes it it is my both my parents smoke 

29.98 32.27 A: ah my father did yes 

33.25 38.62 A: but ah yeah i as far as the law trying to ban it from public places i would be all for it 

38.71 45.07 B: absolutely i i agree totally i i really hate to be around people that smoke especially in restaurants when you're trying to eat 

45.17 50.51 B: you know and when you when you trying i know they have the all the no smoking section and the smoking section 

50.65 55.13 B: but it's it's just horrible when you're sitting somewhere and you've got other people's smoke 

55.04 56.88 A: yes it's terrible 

55.23 61.91 B: waft- wafting over i mean i i grew up with it my both my parents smoked in the house all the time and we lived in a small house 

61.78 63.38 A: right 

62.45 63.50 B: (( so ah )) 

64.10 67.66 B: you know i but i i think it gave me asthma actually [laughter] 

67.21 68.47 A: really 

67.95 73.51 B: yeah but my my mother never quit you know i got this asth- starting getting asthma attacks and she wouldn't quit but 

74.09 80.26 B: [lipsmack] um i definitely think it should be banned everywhere ah i thought it already was banned in most places 

79.89 87.72 A: ah i think the only places that i've like for sure like bars and restaurants in new york and los angeles i think are the only places they've done it 

88.08 91.76 A: and that's a wonderful thing because you go in there and you don't even have to worry about it 

88.11 89.03 B: really 

91.53 93.57 B: yeah yeah where do you live 

93.38 94.89 A: in philadelphia 

94.58 96.79 B: philadelphia oh i'm in miami 

96.59 98.08 A: okay [laughter] 

97.33 98.67 B: (( and ah )) 

99.43 103.60 B: no do we yeah in bars there's they definitely still smokers 

103.55 110.49 A: yeah all round here there are too and it's definitely you you're clothes reek like it it's just terrible 

111.40 117.95 B: that's the worst when you don't smoke and and and you walk out of there and you smell like cigarettes 

112.66 113.53 A: yeah 

118.90 121.40 B: that's that's that's pretty horrible 

118.99 120.73 A: yeah i can't stand that 

123.27 130.57 A: it's a definitely a um and and it's like i guess the other thing they had mentioned was ah do they think the ads help 

130.72 135.55 A: i think it's up to the individual to really quit i don't think anybody can help them but themselves 

136.07 137.23 B: (( [mn] right )) 

138.29 144.87 A: my experience is been with people that i've known that smoke it's once they decide they wanna quit that's the only time it works 

145.63 148.15 A: and they had to be very serious about it 

147.33 153.16 B: right oh yeah absolutely like my my dad my dad quit smoking cigarettes 

154.22 160.88 B: um but he only smokes cigars and usually only socially he doesn't smoke in the house anymore but my mother will never quit 'cause she doesn't want to quit 

160.76 162.55 A: right 

161.99 170.51 B: you know we we all told her you should quit um my parents are in england so i i don't i don't know if they have any ads over there 

170.67 171.80 A: right 

170.90 172.54 B: but um it doesn't 

172.92 178.30 B: if they do it hasn't done any good for her i i think maybe it helps prevent 

179.51 181.82 B: um somewhat 

181.93 183.74 B: in in teenagers 

183.94 185.14 B: picking it up 

185.02 186.15 A: right 

185.51 187.72 B: and not having it out there so much 

188.34 191.45 B: i mean when i was a teenager it was everywhere everybody smoked 

191.19 193.11 A: yeah 

192.35 196.91 B: and and i guess ah now there's a lot more education about 

196.99 203.34 B: what damage it does to the body and i think teenagers are a lot more aware of it now 

201.88 203.07 A: yeah 

203.39 206.42 B: and and the ads the ads that you know of 

203.55 204.52 A: i think when 

206.63 208.40 B: what it can do to you 

208.68 210.74 B: it's probably a little scary 

210.76 216.05 A: yeah when my father grew up there was no they knew nothing about that it was the socially acceptable thing to do 

216.32 217.14 B: right 

217.97 221.93 A: now it's kind of not acceptable as much anymore which is a good thing 

223.21 224.03 B: (( yep )) 

223.44 227.42 A: and the fact that making you what you gotta twenty one to buy 'em in a store now i think 

227.58 228.82 B: is it twenty one 

228.49 232.41 A: i think so or definitely eighteen it might get 

230.41 232.34 B: eighteen yeah i thought it was eighteen 

232.76 234.72 B: wow if it's twenty one that's 

234.90 236.07 B: that's really good 

235.95 237.19 A: yeah 

237.22 244.18 A: then they got they always make you show i._d. so that's a good thing too but luckily i don't have to worry about that 

244.38 250.72 A: but yeah it it's it's something that i can't stand to be a round people that smoke 

250.94 257.43 A: and i i basically choose friends that way if if if they're a smoker i won't really hang out with them 

258.53 259.66 B: really 

259.21 260.33 A: yeah 

259.67 263.92 B: i don't have oh i have a few friends that smoke a little bit not too much 

263.69 270.07 A: right yeah i mean even my family i don't think anybody in my family smokes any more and a bunch of 'em did for a while 

271.13 274.00 A: i have nine brothers and sisters that's a lot of people [laughter] 

273.91 276.88 B: oh my gosh that is a lot [laughter] 

277.77 279.66 B: that is good that they don't smoke then 

279.77 283.61 A: yeah i think all of 'em quit but maybe one smokes occasionally 

285.25 286.03 B: wow 

285.26 287.44 A: so yeah it's it's it's ah 

287.73 290.06 A: a bad habit 

290.41 294.82 A: and that i even worser for the health problems that it can cause 

296.07 300.92 B: what i what i don't understand though is all these people that sue the tobacco companies knowing 

300.96 302.95 B: that it it's damaging 

303.13 307.72 A: yeah it's that's unbelievable to me too how they win those cases too 

307.07 310.54 B: [laughter] but win millions of dollars 

310.03 314.70 A: yeah that's definitely very bizarre 

314.06 315.71 B: i mean everybody knows 

315.87 316.97 B: it causes 

317.44 318.62 B: problems 

318.45 320.29 A: yeah 

319.00 323.89 B: yet they continue you know continue to smoke and then sue the company after 

323.96 327.63 A: yeah peop- people don't wanna take responsibility for themselves 

329.45 331.70 A: they wanna blame it on somebody else 

332.27 333.72 B: oh that's crazy 

333.99 339.60 A: and if it's somebody that sues after they get lung cancer or something i mean money's not gonna get you your life back 

338.97 339.98 B: right 

341.50 343.44 A: but i guess that's america 

343.16 344.37 B: [laughter] 

343.75 344.75 A: [laughter] 

345.20 349.79 B: yeah it's get- it's it's it's gone it's getting beyond ridiculous though 

349.56 351.18 A: yeah that's for sure 

351.54 355.67 A: you know like somebody tried to sue mcdonalds for spilling coffee of themselves 

355.18 356.85 B: yep i heard about that one 

356.64 359.19 A: [laughter] 

359.23 362.40 B: [laughter] but i i guess that's getting off the subject of cigarettes 

359.64 360.83 A: yeah 

361.69 364.15 A: that is that is we have to talk cigarettes 

362.56 367.29 B: [laughter] i don't know what more we have to say we both agree that it's nasty 

366.13 366.86 A: it 

367.02 370.86 A: yeah do they allow you to smoke in mcdonalds i i don't even know i don't think so 

369.71 371.89 B: i don't think so no 

371.80 376.93 A: so at least a lot of those type restaurants have have not allowed it which is a good thing 

376.34 379.50 B: right i don't think any fast food allows smokers anymore 

378.52 379.23 A: (( [mn] ah )) 

379.56 391.84 A: the more the merrier as far as i'm concerned but i think there's no the places where they don't outlaw it it's nobody's gonna take that initiative because they're gonna lose a lot of customers they'll all go to the places they're allowed to smoke 

391.74 392.55 B: right 

392.38 397.18 A: 'cause that's the biggest place for people to smoke is when they're drinking they always wanna they always wanna smoke 

396.48 400.89 B: yeah yeah that's that's the thing with most of my friends you know when they drink is when they wanna smoke 

400.52 406.07 A: yeah so no bar's gonna take that initiative to be a non smoking bar 'cause they'll lose too many customers 

406.66 407.74 B: that's true [mn] 

407.92 410.93 A: but if it's a law then they have no choice 

412.30 417.17 B: right and what they what are people gonna do quit drinking 'cause they can't smoke [laughter] 

416.10 418.01 A: [noise] [laughter] that's not gonna happen 

417.58 418.81 B: [laughter] no 

418.77 422.36 A: they've tried that before they outlawed that and that didn't work 

421.95 426.77 B: [laughter] right no they're not gonna quit [mn] quit drinking they might 

426.85 430.57 B: i was gonna say if they ban it everywhere then what can they do just have to go outside 

430.50 433.43 A: and ah the other thing is like at work people 

433.77 437.25 A: to be non productive because they always gotta go have their smoke break 

438.88 441.26 A: so it's a definitely and 

443.50 445.25 B: definitely what i missed that 

444.86 452.77 A: all round bad thing smoking 'cause it it deters people from being productive at work because they gotta have their smoke break 

453.98 454.93 B: right 

456.09 456.98 A: so 

457.00 462.78 B: yeah but that that's you know if they're gonna c- continue sm- unless they quit they're still gonna need their w- their break 

457.03 458.14 A: it's 

462.68 467.11 A: right man it's always gonna be smoking 

467.22 468.21 A: (( [mn] )) 

468.49 474.09 A: but ah it i think the worst part for me is just that smell i just hate that 

474.86 480.95 A: and i like yourself i had to deal a lot with a lot of that second hand from my par- from my father 

481.41 485.99 A: and they said that's probably even more damaging than regular just smoking yourself 

485.80 488.07 B: i know that's scary 

489.15 491.56 B: all the smoke i must've inhaled 

491.13 492.12 A: (( yeah i know )) 

491.59 493.16 B: growing up [laughter] 

493.61 498.39 A: but i think the good thing is that ah you do see less and less people smoking these days 

500.15 501.41 B: that's for sure 

502.51 509.68 A: yeah so so i guess the ads are helping in a way but they're certainly not i don't think they deter people that are currently smoking from from 

509.71 511.19 A: smoking any more 

511.86 519.03 A: i think that's definitely and individual type thing man it takes a lot ten minutes is a long time when it's a subject you don't have a lot to talk about [laughter] 

512.03 512.81 B: right 

518.15 519.66 B: [laughter] 

519.17 519.78 A: (( ah )) 

520.00 522.10 B: how long has it been are you counting 

522.51 527.05 A: i have not c- counted i should i should do my timer 

527.34 531.31 B: no i wasn't di- will will somebody say when it done you think 

530.79 535.69 A: yeah yeah they come on and they tell you when ten minutes is up we gotta be close 

536.51 543.23 B: i would think so i she she spoke the the voice at the beginning it went so fast that i i didn't catch a lot of what she said 

543.04 545.02 A: right 

544.16 545.87 B: i i caught ads 

545.88 548.16 B: but she she just was so fast 

547.91 550.10 A: yeah yeah 

549.09 551.05 B: so we're supposed to talk about the ads 

550.97 558.10 A: right the ads and and just generally how you feel about smoking and that kind of stuff and or or smoking in public places 

559.68 568.14 A: so yeah i definitely think they should ban it form everywhere not just restaurants just any place where there's a gathering because it just bothers most people 

570.12 572.84 A: and if they wanna smoke they should have their own designated areas 

575.32 577.64 B: very true my i agree completely 

578.06 579.77 A: [laughter] 

578.80 581.25 B: the designated smoking area [laughter] 

580.59 584.94 A: yeah there are plenty of those around 

585.92 588.35 A: i thi- i see they even do it out at airports now 

589.24 590.27 B: really 

590.31 593.96 A: some of the airports i've been to they've they're doing that 

592.84 595.10 B: i i thought they were all non smoking 

595.39 599.89 A: um non smoking but the one i think it was in ah myrtle beach they had one where
