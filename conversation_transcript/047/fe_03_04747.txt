266.75 281.72 B: i think he's just tired and he's three hundred and fifty pounds or more and [mn] it's i mean it's just not healthy and it's taxing i think i think it's got to be really hard to be up there on stage singing all those songs and when you're not used to 

269.07 269.98 A: yeah 

281.78 283.60 B: having that kind of schedule

283.87 284.83 A: yeah 

285.32 285.94 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

293.78 304.21 B: there's you know a couple of shows she was great and then a there were a couple where she wasn't you know she did- she was- she had to be twice as good as clay to beat him 'cause 'cause of all the teeny boppers [laughter]
