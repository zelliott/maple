0.38 1.53 B: hello 

1.16 3.23 A: hi my name's neil 

2.02 4.72 B: i just how you doing neil this is chris 

4.26 5.41 A: hey chris 

5.22 6.52 B: what's going on 

6.26 10.41 A: oh not much um i guess they picked the most ah 

10.86 14.55 A: the most ah controversial topic they could find in new york right now 

14.26 16.41 B: i guess so are you in new york 

15.82 17.39 A: yeah yeah 

16.58 20.61 B: okay yeah me too me too um where do you live 

19.38 22.43 A: um up in harlem 

21.84 25.38 B: oh all right i'm i'm not far from you i'm up in washington heights 

25.02 26.41 A: oh okay 

25.89 29.25 B: yeah yeah [sigh] so smoking huh 

26.87 27.91 A: yeah 

28.77 30.36 A: yeah um 

30.45 35.80 A: yeah i i think i i have mixed feelings actually about ah about the ban 

35.73 36.90 B: oh yeah 

36.32 44.53 A: just 'cause i i used to be a smoker and you know when i'd go out to drink it just was seemed like sort of sacred ground you know you don't 

44.71 58.72 A: you you shouldn't ah ban smoking in a in a in a bar because people choose to go there and i don't know it it just seems a little drastic on the other hand i went out the other night in my brand new cashmere sweater and came back reeking ah 

52.41 53.45 B: mhm 

58.75 60.58 A: a few weeks ago 

60.30 61.36 B: uh-huh 

60.74 65.98 A: and had to had to you know have it cleaned which cost like six bucks so i was kind of pissed off 

63.09 64.25 B: right right 

65.42 72.17 B: ri- exactly yeah that that's sort of my feeling i mean i was a smoker i was a smoker for a long time um 

66.43 67.19 A: (( [noise] [cough] )) 

72.62 77.67 B: so i definitely understand that people like to smoke but i'm not a smoker now and ah 

77.85 80.33 B: i mean i think ultimately it's ah 

80.95 83.80 B: ultimately everyone's better off with a smoking ban 

83.89 95.65 B: [lipsmack] because ah you know less you're breathing in less ah second hand smoke and you don't stink when you get home and ah you know i know smokers are pissed now but you know it's like they'll get over it [noise] 

88.38 89.47 A: mhm 

91.18 91.93 A: (( [noise] )) 

95.38 107.87 A: [noise] yeah no i mean i think it's a good idea the only the only thing that really bugs me is that i kind of feel like the vibe in certain underground bars that i go to um that have that kind of edgy crowd is different now 

103.85 104.87 B: uh-huh 

106.52 107.44 B: uh-huh 

107.82 119.08 A: and i don't i don't like that whole you know scene with people going out to the street to smoke i think it's it's a public health hazard also um or just sort of like a public nuisance 

107.91 108.83 B: yeah 

118.88 120.22 B: right right right 

119.51 126.98 A: so i think the transition's gonna be bumpy and i just i just mm i'm kind of getting a little tired of all this legislation of public 

126.78 139.83 A: um space you know or like over legislation of it i think it's i think it's a dangerous trend and i think that the the the reason that they used to pass this law was totally bogus i i really think that you know 

128.44 129.41 B: mhm 

139.75 149.77 A: that bloomberg was probably at a cocktail hour and some friend of his mother's probably said michael you have to stop this smoking in a bar in the bars i went out the other night and you know 

149.39 150.63 B: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

149.94 152.24 A: so i don't really buy his his 

151.35 156.02 B: you you wait you think that's why he passed the smoking ban oh really oh 

154.10 159.79 A: yeah yeah i think it's bullshit i think he travels in a completely different realm then we do 

159.45 160.76 B: right right 

159.73 165.66 A: and his view of reality is totally you know he wearing a different set of ah glasses as it were and just doesn't 

164.68 166.25 B: right right 

165.56 178.24 A: it just isn't with us in reality and i also think that it'll hurt tourism because one of the i lived abroad for a couple of years and europeans are very irritated as are asians by the american anti smoking attitudes 

177.70 179.30 B: right right right 

178.33 192.26 A: so i think that it was really poor timing i could see doing this you know a few years down the road and i think it's a good idea you know i i mean as somebody who benefits from not stinking and not smoking not getting second hand smoke i mean i really hate second hand smoke 

187.89 188.74 B: mhm 

191.67 192.85 B: yeah yeah 

192.22 194.33 A: so it's i i feel like um 

194.34 200.25 A: [lipsmack] you know it's kind of silly to be arguing the point that i am but i i i feel like it was bad timing but ah 

199.38 203.37 B: uh-huh so you wait you think it should have been passed l- later 

202.75 215.43 A: yeah i think they should wait i think that you know i think that new york should try to make itself friendlier to its inhabitants and to people from from out of the country and just not be so uptight right now i think they just need to live and let live 

213.24 214.34 B: right right 

215.28 216.21 B: uh-huh 

215.31 225.78 A: um and what they're doing is making it harder for us to live here and that's just one of many things that is happening that's making each new yorker feel like their rights are constricted you know 

225.48 226.93 B: yeah 

225.54 230.71 A: once just a little bit more so but i i i mean again i i will benefit [laughter] 

229.97 231.62 B: right right right right 

230.78 241.59 A: but i feel bad and and and i feel like i feel like it's disrupted social patterns a little bit and um you know i mean ah i'm not single so i don't go out as much as i used to so 

235.38 237.80 B: (( mm )) 

241.30 242.33 B: (( uh-huh )) 

241.71 246.01 A: ah i i don't notice it as much as i as i would have say a couple of years ago 

245.66 247.33 B: yeah yeah 

246.34 247.46 A: (( but ah )) 

247.88 252.62 A: but ah i'm glad i'm i'm a i'm a swimmer i quit smoking like six years ago and i'm you know 

252.21 253.33 B: oh really 

252.69 254.61 A: life has been so much better yeah 

253.84 255.94 B: how how long did you smoke 

255.53 261.54 A: um i smoked um from age like twenty to age twenty 

261.92 265.08 A: six or seven so yeah like a good six years 

264.79 266.24 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

265.40 267.39 A: you know a pack a day pretty much 

266.67 268.48 B: yeah yeah yeah 

267.73 279.77 A: and i um and finally just you know i woke up with serious chest pains one morning and that was it fear of death really cured me yeah [laughter] yeah yeah it was really easy after that mhm 

275.00 276.12 B: oh really i 

276.38 278.55 B: hear that pretty yeah 

279.07 287.44 B: it's har- it's ah yeah that's a that's a that's a that's um that's the truth i mean when i was smoking i never thought twice about it you know but ah 

288.10 294.92 B: but i mean down the line it's it's all gonna catch up with you you know so not smoking's a lot better i mean i think like ultimately like 

294.70 304.09 B: ah it it's like almost like doing a favor to people to like stop them from smok- like if somebody was gonna go out and smoke but they can't because there's laws against it 

303.64 304.70 A: right 

304.12 315.15 B: it's almost like doing a favor to them but i mean it's true [lipsmack] i don't think the government should be you know putting all those restrictions on people but the truth is they put restrictions on people anyway 

314.71 315.63 A: mhm 

315.03 324.36 B: so if they are gonna put restrictions on people at least i mean to me i'd rather see them making restrictions like that [mn] but i mean at the same time i'm i'm i don't know i'm i'm 

324.39 328.88 B: i'm for the loosening of most restrictions you know so k- kind of like 

327.16 328.36 A: (( right [noise] )) 

329.15 334.14 B: i i the truth is if if bars had the right to um 

334.60 349.13 B: actually it's a tough call i was gonna say if bars had the right to choose whether or not to be smoking bars or not and there were just some bars that were smoking bars and some that weren't my first thought is that the non-smoking bars would probably just not be as fun or more boring or something like that but 

339.41 340.41 A: yeah 

342.36 343.42 A: right 

347.73 348.73 A: right 

349.23 357.92 B: on the second hand i i'm not sure that that's the case you know i mean there's plenty of people that that would go out and have some drinks and have a good time and not smoke and 

357.23 358.30 A: of course 

357.96 359.16 B: (( so )) 

358.22 372.26 A: yeah i mean they could just choose it's like choosing non smoking or non smoking section you know it's like a lot of times people say well i'm not a smoker and smoking annoys me but the smoking section has a better view of the bay so let's go [laughter] you know i mean that's happened to me or there's a shorter wait 

361.73 363.76 B: um right right right 

369.32 370.79 B: right right right 

372.11 384.38 A: you know um i yeah i i find it a little obnoxious that the the sort of high falouting cigar bars are allowed to remain in existance yet the sort of every every everyday you know sort of 

383.79 385.28 B: right right right 

384.24 388.40 A: regular joe pubs are are being being hurt i think that's fucked up 

387.02 393.86 B: i think it has something to do with if you're business um makes a certain percentage of its profit from smoking 

393.45 394.52 A: right 

393.94 400.36 B: then you could still smoke because then otherwise they'd be like shutting down complete businesses you know [noise] 

399.32 409.01 A: oh well hey you know what i mean if if that's the the case then cigarettes are seven dollars a pack um you know if you just sell cigarettes at your bar [laughter] 

405.06 406.00 B: yeah 

407.65 413.92 B: yeah exactly then you could then you could argue that but um have have you been to um bars where um [noise] 

409.99 411.34 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

414.33 416.23 B: people are still smoking anyway 

415.83 416.79 A: no 

416.44 417.51 B: oh really 

416.94 421.90 A: no i i i was at one the other night where i smelt smoke but it was hard to tell where it was coming from 

421.78 423.18 B: yeah yeah 

422.17 423.81 A: nobody was smoking have you 

423.68 433.21 B: yeah actually just the other night i was at um smalls you know that jazz bar down town and and um someone was smoking like right next to me and it was kind of like 

426.61 427.49 A: mhm 

427.74 429.06 A: oh yeah yeah 

433.26 442.61 B: surprising you know what i mean because ah you know n- now that people don't smoke anymore it like to smell smoke in a bar is kind of like strange you know 

437.74 438.48 A: [noise] 

442.33 443.42 A: yeah 

442.53 457.23 B: and it and it actually bothered us i mean i was there with my girlfriend and it bothered us but i mean i'm not the kind of i i wouldn't like tell somebody to stop smok- you know what i mean like that's not my style i'm not like a policeman but but yeah there was nobody doing anything about it the guy was just smoking and doing his thing you know [noise] 

450.28 451.15 A: right 

456.59 462.47 A: yeah it's that jazz mentality hey man i'm doing my thing don't try to stop me from doing my thing yeah 

458.32 459.53 B: yeah i guess 

459.87 461.11 B: i know i guess 

461.21 470.31 B: and and some- somebody was smoking in a bar at pier two in washington heights like but this was a few weeks this was like right after the ban so may- maybe they were just still kind of being um 

467.34 468.24 A: right 

470.51 477.36 B: [noise] lenient about it but um but they still had ashtrays out and all that so it's like it seemed like that bar just didn't even care you know they were 

476.38 479.13 A: yeah it seems like the heights is a different kind of scene 

478.93 480.41 B: yeah yeah 

479.48 488.38 A: they don't police as much like i mean even here in harlem just i mean i drive like a fricken maniac here you know like i i do things here that i wouldn't do downtown 

485.24 486.31 B: really 

487.98 489.71 B: where where do you live 

489.04 491.92 A: um one hundred and seventeenth by eighth avenue 

491.88 495.60 B: all right do you do what kind of do you have an apartment or brownstone or 

494.78 495.78 A: apartment 

495.76 498.10 B: that's cool how long have you ah been there 

497.60 500.65 A: um we've been here about two and a half years 

500.40 502.01 B: really you like it 

501.68 509.72 A: yeah yeah it's cool i mean we have construction everywhere now as of a few months ago so it's yeah seven a._m. every morning there's just tonnes of construction 

509.40 516.34 B: yeah are are you from new york or um oh really okay so they don't smoke out there either 

511.66 513.18 A: no i'm from l._a. 

513.52 514.41 A: mhm 

515.75 528.68 A: oh hell no no no no and i and and i started at school in philly and then ah um ended up you know living in spain and it didn't really matter chicago i lived for a few years and they're pretty pro smoking out there 

517.53 518.38 B: yeah 

528.09 529.51 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

528.80 541.77 A: so it was you know when i came to new york it was already over i you know i mean i got over it and it was really easy to quit smoking 'cause i just realised that once you accept that certain feelings and certain moments are just shit and once you accept that 

532.78 533.85 B: yeah yeah 

541.19 542.07 B: uh-huh 

542.14 544.68 A: you don't have to try to control your mood as much anymore 

544.30 545.86 B: [noise] what do you mean 

545.61 548.81 A: well really when i was smoking i was trying to control my mood 

548.51 550.07 B: right right 

549.47 552.84 A: and once i realised that certain moods just come and go 

552.93 553.90 B: right 

552.98 564.47 A: once you you realise that you feel uncomfortable you don't know where to put your hands at a party or something you just accept it okay i feel awkward and weird or i just feel like crap and instead of trying to change it you just say oh oh 

557.29 558.53 B: (( right right )) 

560.61 561.68 B: right right 

564.01 565.30 B: just go with it 

564.33 576.17 A: okay i want a cigarette right now big deal you know you just wait it out i'm and you accept that you may feel shitty all night and then as soon as you accept it like two minutes later you're on to the next thing and you've totally forgotten that you wanted a cigarette at 

566.03 568.03 B: (( right yeah yeah yeah )) 

575.61 576.44 B: (( oh )) 

576.02 579.94 A: least that was that was my experience it wasn't easy but that definitely 

580.38 584.60 A: you know was part part of um getting over it was making that realization 

584.28 586.34 B: how how did you quit 

585.74 587.88 A: that i just quit i smoked 

586.96 588.62 B: you just said that's it 

588.22 599.90 A: yeah i smoked really heavily for two weeks i gave myself two weeks and i said all right i'm just gonna burn out i'm gonna smoke like a madman for two weeks and then i quit and then i spent a a weekend just by myself in my apart- 

591.40 592.40 B: uh-huh 

595.53 597.05 B: [noise] that's cool
