479.03 491.89 A: oh well yeah if you like country music i mean you know um i've had i've had a few people ask me if i would be interested in promoting rock and roll and the older rock i can deal with but the new stuff i told 'em i wouldn't know

491.63 496.83 B: [laughter] i don't know who's who i don't know their names [laughter] 

491.95 494.42 A: what was what was good and what wasn't 

495.32 506.83 A: right yeah but uh brian is i i feel that he's he's he's on his way he's he is quite a bit he's forty five so he's quite a bit older than clint but uh 

506.93 508.33 A: he's um 

508.64 514.91 A: i think he would've had a better career if clint wouldn't have made it before him 

514.56 515.50 B: (( oh )) 

515.50 518.60 A: because brian is real 

519.32 528.32 A: bad about not wanting to use clint's name as a stepping stone and that kind of keeps him from promoting himself at times 

528.04 530.50 B: oh man he probably could help him out 

530.24 535.58 A: well yeah and it does i mean we are using it for the the the benefit 

535.54 548.51 A: uh clint's gonna sign some things and send down with brian and kevin so we can give 'em away at the benefit and and things and we have a link to clint's website on mine and of course brian's got his own website too and then there's links on there to 

548.51 556.30 A: different things now brian doesn't have any links to clint's but if you go to clint's website and go to his links there's a link to brian's and kevin's sites
