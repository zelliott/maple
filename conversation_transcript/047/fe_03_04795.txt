31.00 32.10 B: it's okay 

31.85 33.16 A: yeah okay 

32.76 35.10 B: but i feel sorry for a smoker [laughter] 

34.47 36.10 A: right [laughter]

39.82 40.38 A: (( [mn] )) 

40.52 43.57 A: so they allow like smoking in bars and that kind of stuff 

42.80 44.46 B: right now they do yeah 

43.88 57.63 A: yeah i live in california and they banned that like maybe [lipsmack] oh four years ago something like that something around there it was a pretty big deal 'cause i don't smoke but i do like to have a cigarette now and again when i'm drinking beers or something like that with my 

50.35 51.26 B: uh-huh 

56.81 59.40 B: right i used to smoke a long time ago 

59.25 63.29 A: yeah so did i not a long time five years ago or something but uh 

60.94 62.33 B: socially yeah 

63.93 78.05 A: i mean th- when they when they passed that law i was bummed but but af- but i but i l- i think it's much better to be honest without having 'cause you come out when you come out of a s- a bar nowadays you just don't smell like complete crap inside it's not like 

67.02 69.69 B: [laughter] i bet [laughter] 

76.53 77.62 B: (( [noise] right )) 

77.90 82.22 A: disgusting smoke all over the place and you don't miss it and honestly i might 

82.24 91.49 A: i'll go you know i can go to a bar and car home and not have a cigarette and not even think about it whereas in the old days if somebody was smoking right next to you you're bound to ask him if you could bum one 

89.32 91.85 B: right [laughter] exactly 

91.87 97.33 B: yeah i was out in california and actually watched and witnessed that so uh this year so it was pretty interesting 

97.11 100.01 A: yeah and they just did it in new york too i think 

100.13 103.06 A: they just passed the same law in new york city 

102.42 103.78 B: yeah 

103.14 108.92 A: so i heard so what do you think of uh the the help lines and all that stuff 

108.79 109.68 B: (( um )) 

109.76 112.38 B: [noise] i think it's a good idea you know 

111.34 113.08 A: yeah 

112.72 119.45 B: i mean i i quit smoking for a reason so you know i i see the detriments of smoking 

119.46 123.73 B: so i think anything they can get out there to help people to quit is a good idea 

119.51 120.69 A: yeah 

123.11 129.28 A: yeah i think the same thing i mean you can't fault somebody for trying to help somebody quit smoking you know what i mean it's like [mn] 

126.97 129.29 B: exactly that's what i think so 

129.36 137.32 A: it's not easy it's really hard for some people to quit smoking especially if they've been smoking their whole lives so it anything they can get to help 'em it's a you know it's a gnarly addiction 

133.72 134.59 B: (( mhm )) 

135.95 140.55 B: yeah and i don't mind being around people who smoke either it doesn't bother me 

139.23 141.91 A: y- yeah yeah 

141.10 154.01 B: you know uh just 'cause you know i'd be a hypocrite if i said oh i don't wanna be around smokers so i'm never like ugh ugh smoke [laughter] it's it's it's fine with me but you know i just i personally choose not to smoke 

145.94 147.03 A: right 

147.97 149.66 A: yeah yeah 

153.43 163.27 A: yeah same here i guess i i well i don't really love [laughter] being around about smokers if i'm like i was in europe last year and they're still you know everybody's smoking 

154.29 155.14 B: so 

162.36 164.23 B: there everywhere it's acceptable 

163.30 166.40 A: all over the place i mean it's just like 

164.95 166.06 B: yeah 

166.61 168.42 A: it's just kinda gross 

166.79 171.53 B: in canada t- too everybody smokes even all the kids and i think that's what's depressing 

171.33 174.00 A: really like the little fifteen year old kids and stuff 

173.19 175.48 B: oh yeah all of them everybody smokes 

175.14 177.02 A: you're kidding wow 

175.93 177.85 B: like two out of every three 

177.68 179.07 A: oh my god 

179.43 181.56 A: that's crazy i didn't know that 

180.98 184.11 B: yeah it's pretty ridiculous 

182.31 183.70 A: [lipsmack] wow 

184.51 187.83 A: what else did they ask us to talk about smoking and 

186.06 187.31 B: (( [noise] uh )) 

187.39 193.43 B: the help line the w- just our feelings about it like that was [laughter] pretty much it uh 

192.43 194.20 A: yeah 

194.23 195.83 A: how come you stopped smoking 

195.85 197.54 B: how why did i 

197.22 198.39 A: yeah 

197.77 212.48 B: um [lipsmack] because like you said i didn't like the way i i would come home and smell um the next day how i would feel you know it felt good at the time but then the next day you're like what did i do that for 

211.87 213.85 A: right say totally [lipsmack] 

212.49 226.04 B: so i finally just made a conscious effort to just like you know stop beating up on myself and it was like if i stop smoking and you know when i drink which is what was happening then you know everything will be fine so eventually i just in the habit 

225.68 231.64 A: i think that's yeah same here it's made you feel so crappy the next day [laughter] 

227.46 228.62 B: now did you 

230.17 233.05 B: right now would you have done it anyway or 

233.14 241.79 A: uh yeah totally i stopped smoking bef- like i stopped smoking smoking i used to smoke like i would actually i used to buy packs of cigarettes put it that way 

241.52 242.39 B: yeah 

241.73 254.61 A: you know what i mean and i'd smoke in the daytime occasionally and when i was in college particular and then i stopped doing that and now i just won't buy 'em it's like a rule i'll bum one every now and again so i end up having like a cigarette a month it's that way 

250.22 251.11 B: (( mhm )) 

253.51 260.54 B: now most of my friends have quit smoking but i still have one friend who buys doesn't even buy cigarettes by the pack buys them by the carton 

260.13 264.86 A: see that's see that's that's for professionals [laughter] that's like 

262.02 263.41 B: [laughter] yeah 

263.64 266.76 B: but we're all just like you know he's the only one that smokes he 

266.57 279.74 B: most of my friends now see they have a different opinion about smo- smoking in their in their house or whatever like i will still invite a smoker in my house i will not make them go outside all of my friends make my one friend feel like an outcast 

271.30 272.22 A: uh-huh 

274.07 275.11 A: yeah 

279.32 282.04 A: yeah yeah it's but it's tough for him but i yeah 

280.52 283.74 B: and so he has to smoke outside but he doesn't care 

283.47 285.12 A: yeah yeah 

283.91 291.40 B: you know which is just so funny like i was never that far into the smoking to for to like go out and freeze myself to death just to have a cigarette 

290.82 296.31 A: right and i don't i don't like people smoking in my house i mean 'cause it just stays around so long you know 

291.57 293.36 B: [laughter] 

295.20 300.49 B: yeah yeah you usually gotta do the air freshener and everything else to try and cover it [laughter] 

299.68 306.51 A: exactly uh you know it stays around for a good couple of days and it gets in the furniture and it gets a little nasty so that it 

303.94 305.02 B: yeah 

305.42 307.45 B: it's a nasty habit 

306.87 308.73 A: is it's not good for ya 

308.42 310.64 B: no but you know 

308.81 310.12 A: that simple 

311.02 312.71 A: what are you gonna do huh 

312.07 314.75 B: well if you stop smoking then you're gonna have other vices 

313.99 317.28 A: [laughter] that's right yeah i guess yeah i suppose 

316.22 328.16 B: [noise] you know i mean if you if you're that far along as a smoker like it sounds like it didn't affect you you know like you know but a lot of people either eat more or they'll drink more or both or you know 

319.68 321.43 A: right 

327.24 333.04 A: yeah yeah some people are just addictive you know and they gotta have some something bringing 'em down 

329.43 330.32 B: yeah 

331.64 334.99 B: addictive personalities right gotta have something [laughter] 

334.97 336.35 A: which is sad uh 

335.19 337.24 B: more partying more something 

337.00 339.24 A: right right for sure 

339.06 340.35 B: yeah 

339.90 347.93 A: but i i mean i would i quit smoking cigarettes just because they weren't good for ya that's basically what it came i mean it's no joke it's gonna kill ya someday so you'd 

345.83 346.58 B: that's 

346.93 348.34 B: that's the bottom line 

348.00 352.24 A: better get over it while you can and you know i was also like i don't wanna be like 

352.82 365.95 A: it's a you gotta get away with it when you're young [laughter] you know what i mean so you're in your early twenties and you're smoking and having fun it's just like you're partying but then once you get ol- a little older it's like you're a smoker you know what i mean so [lipsmack] 

356.00 356.92 B: uh-huh 

364.19 365.10 B: yeah 

365.22 369.19 B: do you do you think they should keep doing that i mean banning it everywhere or 

369.09 375.56 A: uh you know [sigh] it's hard to say i think i do honestly because it's you know it's america 

372.85 373.80 B: mhm 

374.39 377.67 B: see personally i don't think they could do it in new york [laughter] 

377.37 379.76 A: [mn] yeah well they did i'm i'm 

378.72 385.57 B: they did but i you know just new yorkers are so tough i just that's the one place i can't imagine that taking place you know what i mean 

384.70 397.71 A: i know and there's still a lot of places in california and stuff where you can smoke indoors they don't really care you know the bar won't like kick you out they will get in trouble but i think the co- you know it's mostly places where cops actually have stuff to do they're not like 

390.11 392.09 B: oh really they won't get in trouble 

396.12 398.51 B: right if the c- if the police enforce it 

397.89 405.45 A: right the cops aren't out cracking down on skateboarders or taking care of like real crime so they couldn't care less if people are smoking cigarettes in a bar 

402.70 407.28 B: right because for a lot of businesses it must really hurt them not to have smokers around 

406.63 414.69 A: oh yes i would imagine especially so on the east coast where you have real winters and people aren't gonna you know you can't go freeze your butt off outside 

413.65 416.68 B: (( [laughter] exactly )) 

414.85 421.55 A: you're gonna smoke it's uh in california you know you can handle fifty degrees but ten degrees a whole different ballgame 

420.98 424.79 B: exactly [laughter] it's a whole different story [noise] 

424.14 435.36 A: but i do i think it i think it's good 'cause it it's like it's just bad for everybody to have smoking indoors so you know if it inconveniences twenty percent of the people could benefit eighty and i guess that's what i'm 

432.89 433.81 B: mhm 

434.11 444.69 B: i think part of the challenge is that a lot of places well at least when you're out socially like don't have a lot of air ionizers and stuff and in some restaurants i mean it c- it gets pretty darn 

441.11 442.87 A: yeah absolutely 

444.76 457.64 B: thick you know with the smoke and and what not but some places at least have fans and ceiling fans something that just kinda like move it around but you know i feel sorry for people that don't smoke that have to be put in that position 

445.38 446.38 A: yeah 

452.69 453.56 A: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

457.59 459.32 A: yeah 

457.61 466.62 B: you know but what's amazing is that you got the restaurants some people who don't smoke won't sit in the smoking section they'll they'd rather wait like an hour and a half you know 

466.52 469.43 A: yeah yeah yeah i i know 

468.32 471.12 B: [noise] just because they don't wanna be around the smoke 

470.52 481.90 A: yeah when i go to vegas like i don't that's where the that's when the animal comes out [laughter] when i go to vegas when i'll be sitting at tables and smoking my brains out but then i won't care about sitting in the smoking section 

474.52 477.62 B: [laughter] as far as smoking 

481.52 482.47 B: yeah 

481.85 491.22 A: you know to eat dinner but they don't have they don't even have that anymore out here there are no smoking or no smoking sections you haven't been able to smoke in a cigarette in california my gosh for ten years 

489.79 498.08 B: now i just i thought it was so funny 'cause my friend that i was talking about that's such a heavy smoker you know at the airport i'd never been in an airport smoking lounge before 

497.43 501.63 A: oh the aquarium where they yeah [laughter] 

498.52 499.98 B: oh my god 

500.32 509.69 B: you wanna talk about ready to pass out i felt bad for him you know until i was in there for a while and i'm like oh my god this is ridiculous it was like a rehab place 

502.51 503.39 A: oh 

507.88 509.22 A: it's like a 

509.46 515.80 A: it's like uh it's like being in a zoo and looking at the apes inside the glass cube [laughter] 

512.08 518.09 B: yeah what the the the smoke was so thick it was unbelievable 

517.48 525.52 A: have you ever smelt somebody when they come outta one of those things did have you did you smell the guy when he came outta that thing it's like they've been hung out to dry 

520.00 521.26 B: what's that 

523.36 532.67 B: oh i smelt horrible i went in with him and i don't even smoke [laughter] i just just trying to keep him company but i didn't realize what i was getting myself into 

525.55 528.08 A: it's nasty oh oh okay 

532.16 534.40 A: it's it it sticks to you you know 

534.00 535.62 B: [laughter] 

534.64 536.19 A: it's pretty nasty 

535.87 540.63 B: well 'cause you know there's no way you can get on a plane and you know once they've craved that cigarette 

540.46 543.25 A: right right right 

540.68 545.53 B: you know they can't land i mean it just makes them makes them crazy [laughter] 

544.59 548.93 A: yeah they got to n- get they got to like get some nicorette or something like that for the plane flight 

548.32 551.65 B: right [laughter] just while they're in flight [noise] 

549.31 550.93 A: (( they used to be able to sm- )) 

551.02 556.17 A: they used to be able to smoke on airplanes and stuff in the old days not anymore though 

555.84 556.80 B: no 

557.00 559.00 B: no um not like the old days 

558.93 562.34 A: no they used to be able to smoke at work and 

560.17 566.27 B: the old days you could smoke anywhere and and do anything and they wouldn't care the women smoked the men smoked 

564.23 565.01 A: no 

565.64 572.14 A: totally but they didn't know and they were being lied to that it was okay for them they had no idea that it was gonna cause cancer until 

566.47 567.23 B: yeah 

570.77 573.15 B: oh that that's true too 

572.86 576.36 A: you know it's like my dad when i talk to my dad about it 

576.49 582.01 A: he it's just like he said yeah it was a different ballgame because he's not a smoker but he was when he was a kid it's everybody was in their 

581.98 591.63 A: their twenties back then and he said you know we had no idea and he's a educated guy and he's smart and he went to college and grad school you know he's just you know dummy 

585.76 586.64 B: mhm 

589.51 591.92 B: right back then you believed what you were told he 

591.58 599.89 A: he just said yeah that we had no idea that it was cancer causing and in fact they lied to us and told us otherwise so that's why everybody did it 

593.26 595.39 B: had no reason to expect otherwise 

595.63 596.58 B: (( true ))
