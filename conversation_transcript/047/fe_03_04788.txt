0.32 4.42 A: hi my name is william and i i'm at u._c. berkley 

5.71 9.18 B: hi i'm aaron and i live in gainsville florida 

11.09 13.31 A: (( [noise] yeah so what's up )) 

12.97 13.85 B: um 

13.99 17.44 B: not much um i think that um 

17.54 28.37 B: that some like maybe help quit prevention and hot lines are a pretty good idea but i'm not too sure about the whole legislating the whole thing 'cause it just kinda reminds me of like the prohibition era mhm 

29.47 44.12 A: i think that uh all the ads they have on t._v. are really useful for just sell- just get the message out there that people should quit uh i think i think like prohibition they they actually should be more active in trying to get people to stop and not forcing them to stop 

36.27 37.22 B: right 

43.62 46.21 B: right right becau- 

45.48 48.08 A: like they shouldn't yeah 

47.51 58.04 B: 'cause i know like when i'm out if i'm a bar or a club a lotta times i sometimes i don't even go just 'cause of the smoke at least um and like in florida they just passed this law 

54.84 56.10 A: yeah 

57.97 71.49 B: that bans smoking in bars but like it's just kind of this law that's on paper and now no one knows how to actually implement it or you know what does this mean what does this mean they're like picking it apart sentence by sentence so it's just wasting all this time 

70.64 76.84 A: [noise] uh i think you know if they're gonna pass a law they should just enforce it but then like most laws they just go out and go 

76.80 77.85 B: right 

76.90 78.97 A: they get passed without being enforced 

78.87 79.73 B: right 

79.09 85.32 A: um yeah w- whatever whatever people smoke at bars stuff like that i i don't really like to go either just because 

85.39 88.72 A: uh i don't really like it when when people smoke 

87.94 89.39 B: (( mm mhm )) 

88.82 101.53 A: so uh i really like fishing at the i just wish they'd do more uh for it [noise] um i also wish that the tobacco companies would reveal more information and if not that then the um 

101.98 109.27 A: then just you know an independent organization should get research and sell it uh on adverse effects of smoking and then they should publish the results 

108.56 123.03 B: mhm [noise] yeah there should definitely be more out there about that kind of stuff i think the companies should be it should be more enforced on like the companies to provide this stuff than cracking down on people i mean i know [mn] we like people have 

112.23 113.13 A: yeah 

122.73 123.93 A: (( [noise] )) 

122.98 134.34 B: they have we have a like part of the responsibility i'm not a smoker but i mean i'm including myself because we're all affected by secondhand smoke and everything like we have a responsibility but the companies they have like 

130.08 131.24 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

134.13 142.55 B: they have you know the airwaves and they have commercials and they ha- movies and all this stuff they should definitely be more like 

137.66 139.15 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

142.31 150.61 B: more legislation telling them that they need to make it up front like what what all the stuff that's in here is and what it'll do to you 

148.84 149.94 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

151.61 156.88 A: oh i i think the government should do more like just put more taxes on cigarettes 'cause they 

156.81 164.13 A: it'll it'll induce the people who do smoke to to try and stop or they could also make like nicotine nicotine gum cheaper 

163.76 164.69 B: right 

163.96 175.62 A: so then that that'll just like make them say oh yeah cigarettes are really expensive and we shouldn't buy cigarettes and since they gum so cheap it's a really good tool to quit because right now nicotine nicotine gum is like really expensive you know 

171.86 172.74 B: right 

175.31 176.48 B: definitely 

175.64 186.35 A: so yeah they should make the gum cheaper and cigarettes more expensive plus the taxes raised from selling the cigarettes they could really like benefit education um the roads social security anything like that [noise] [noise] 

183.23 184.44 B: mhm 

186.07 188.64 B: mhm the unfortunate thing is like 

188.67 191.41 B: th- it's kinda like the lottery where 

191.92 193.31 B: people who 

194.47 198.76 B: who like who are benefitting the least from 

198.78 210.06 B: from what the money the tax money would be used for they're the ones who are like who are hit like 'cause at least in florida the lottery is like mostly people who 

202.08 202.93 A: yeah 

210.20 214.48 B: can't really like be able to afford to be buying lottery tickets all the time 

210.42 211.00 A: (( [noise] )) 

213.61 215.18 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

214.56 229.38 B: but and then like so most of the lottery money goes to education but like a lotta people who buy lottery all the time they probably don't go to college so it's like but i guess it's different with smoking though so i don't even know why i brought that up because 

217.43 218.06 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

218.46 219.07 A: (( [noise] )) 

228.95 229.99 A: yeah 

229.25 235.42 B: the people who are buying cigarettes they're like directly affecting their health in doing that so it's 

234.74 236.19 A: [noise] and the health of others 

235.89 237.83 B: right right 

237.85 242.11 A: (( so uh that's why i said like if you just made nicotine gum you know a lot cheaper )) 

241.64 244.69 B: yeah that's a good idea try to balance it out 

242.37 243.25 A: yeah 

243.31 245.18 A: (( yeah )) 

245.38 256.40 A: because um like e- even if you can't like y- your your l- your income's really not that high then like the smoking like three packs a day that's really a drain on your income 

250.33 252.09 B: mhm 

255.65 257.10 B: definitely 

256.48 260.95 A: so then just by buying like the gum then you can quit the habit and then you'll save like hundreds of dollars a month 

260.67 261.78 B: that's true 

260.97 264.23 A: just from yeah not smoking through like three or four packs a day 

264.12 272.20 B: that's pr- that'd probably be a good angle for like anti smoking groups to to look at too is the whole like look how much money you'll save you know 

269.59 270.66 A: yeah 

272.05 273.00 A: yeah 

272.10 276.34 B: look how much like you could put this money to something else or 

275.66 276.43 A: (( [noise] )) 

276.11 288.83 B: you could like save it for your retirement or whatever you know just like use it for anything except smoking and they they might look into doing that i'm sure they might have already but it seems like a good angle to approach it from [noise] 

279.36 280.58 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

288.03 295.67 A: yeah i i hope comes in soon 'cause i mean like you should have a picture of like a pyramid of cigarettes like versus like a car you know 

295.10 297.32 B: right right that's true 

295.92 297.21 A: yeah 

298.06 310.70 A: you know like uh in california like people they're they're not very open about just telling people not to smoke since california's supposed to be like really liberal so pretty much yeah like you you just have to be cautious about other people and just 

306.25 307.08 B: really 

310.73 318.95 A: if you do smoke try not to smoke out i mean i'm a non smoker and then i really hope that other people would like think about other people and not smoke out there and it's like this will do 

313.40 314.41 B: mhm 

318.73 326.01 B: so you mean like people don't feel comfortable asking someone if they would mind quit smoking you know like 

324.36 326.48 A: yeah because yeah 

326.28 328.96 B: like when you're at a restaurant or something 

328.17 333.00 A: yeah because if like uh the person does ask it's like they seem you know like a jerk so you 

332.59 343.68 B: right right i think it's kind of the same here but i don't i don't know i usually just like i usually don't even bother asking i just like go to another part of the hou- to the other club or 

333.06 335.00 A: (( know oh yeah [noise] )) 

343.20 347.01 A: (( yeah that's i do yeah [noise] )) 

343.70 352.30 B: i'll just cough really loud and like you know [laughter] make a couple of like of indirect things like that 

347.48 349.31 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

351.15 353.63 A: (( [noise] just like and coughing )) 

353.85 357.88 A: and [noise] um pretty much yeah oh 

358.00 361.98 A: uh you know just tell people you can't smoke here and stuff like that 

358.95 359.68 B: (( [noise] )) 

361.42 366.97 B: right like on just on public transit it would be a good spot to have it 

362.25 363.09 A: yeah 

366.28 367.94 A: yeah yeah that'd be great 

367.54 372.67 B: in restaurants and everywhere i guess like on menus maybe [noise] 

370.93 371.85 A: yeah 

373.67 378.81 A: (( well j- just in terms of like what are uh i really wish they they were just like that and )) 

378.42 385.56 B: right 'cause uh a lot of 'em i mean i've i've heard bits and pieces here and there or what's in 'em but i've never seen like a 

379.14 381.00 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

385.95 388.03 B: an actual study or anything 

386.12 392.90 A: yeah [mn] yeah a nice detailed diagram all you all you see is like oh yeah it has nicotine tar but you have no idea how much or 

392.10 395.86 B: [noise] right and uh i always hear that um 

393.19 394.42 A: (( yeah something like )) 

396.59 400.83 B: [lipsmack] like embalm like the stuff they used to use to em- 

400.04 402.30 A: that [noise] embalming fluid 

401.72 405.66 B: yeah yeah i've heard that that's in some of 'em maybe just that's 

402.35 403.42 A: yeah 

404.92 407.03 A: (( yeah i i heard that too )) 

406.65 408.46 B: that just seems crazy 

408.35 410.55 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

408.78 409.93 B: but then i 

410.36 424.23 B: i saw this one thing in a magazine that was talking about other additives in 'em and it was all just like it was all these herbs and it all sounded like really good stuff so it was like they are trying to say like look this is what's in cigarettes it's you know 

420.16 421.04 A: yeah 

424.39 431.31 B: like strawberry leaves and all this shit like that but they didn't say what w- they didn't say like all the bad stuff that's in it either 

427.39 428.94 A: (( yeah strawberry leaves )) 

431.08 440.30 A: yeah uh i i think for sure like smoking it and then you're inhaling it like even if it is good stuff there it really wouldn't help you as much as if you did something else 

439.64 441.82 B: [noise] [noise] right right definitely not 

441.21 448.49 A: yeah but like if you you probably had like a tea or something and you could drink it but then if you smoking it you you're inhaling like burned fragments you know 

443.70 445.39 B: mhm 

445.73 447.00 B: (( [laughter] )) 

447.73 452.42 B: [laughter] yeah yeah it burns your your you know your lungs and all that stuff 

448.98 449.96 A: yeah 

452.00 453.51 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

453.23 458.15 B: [noise] [laughter] that'd be pretty funny if all the smokers started just drinking tea all the time 

457.53 458.96 A: [laughter] yeah yeah 

458.38 460.04 B: [laughter] 

459.37 465.09 A: yeah have you seen the the truth ads on t._v. and stuff 

464.12 469.34 B: [noise] yeah i've seen some of 'em i've seen like billboards and stuff and in magazines 

467.18 468.55 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

469.56 475.35 A: uh i i mean the ad like their there's this sort of aimed and they're directed at teenagers uh 

474.83 489.83 B: right and w- some of the magazine ad they're just like over the top man they got like really graphic pictures and it just kinda it's just more like a s- like they're going on shock value than trying to like make sense 

475.59 476.82 A: yeah 

481.38 482.49 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

486.03 487.03 A: like a 

487.80 490.29 A: yeah a a scare tactic 

489.75 492.76 B: yeah yeah that's it scare tactics [noise] 

490.45 491.32 A: yeah 

492.13 494.94 A: (( yeah big scare tactic yeah um )) 

495.14 497.73 A: like i i any any 

498.14 507.53 A: right now that wa- what was people have to resort to is scare tactics because no one really pays attention to the ads anymore you know so they they have to scare 'em into not smoking 

505.19 506.23 B: right 

508.29 509.06 A: [noise] 

509.54 518.57 A: and also in terms of like education when you're when you're in middle school like elementary it's it's not that good children telling you to stop smoking i mean they just basically a detail like 

514.52 515.80 B: (( [noise] right )) 

518.61 522.13 A: really really like biological like defect 

522.44 528.51 A: like they they don't really actively try and get you to stop or to just get you not smoking 

524.10 525.89 B: mhm 

528.34 542.16 B: and even even when they did i remember in middle school we were just like oh i wanna try that you know 'cause they would they would bring like samples in of all this different stuff and tell you exactly what it is and like exactly how to use it and we're just like oh that sounds pretty cool 

533.07 534.25 A: yeah 

536.06 536.62 A: (( [mn] )) 

537.44 538.42 A: yeah 

542.22 542.93 A: (( [mn] )) 

542.55 549.04 B: so i mean even if they would've told us not to i don't i don't know maybe it was just like the age i was at or whatever it was pretty 

548.56 557.20 A: yeah by something new and then it's um i- it's like you're not it's like taboo so if you wanted yeah 

549.09 550.49 B: (( i don't know [laughter] )) 

554.84 564.52 B: [noise] right yeah that's that's probably what it is it's taboo like no one really talks about it so when when you see it for the first time in it's really intriguing to ya 

564.01 568.33 A: yeah like you just you just wanna do it yeah 

566.88 570.04 B: mhm 

568.97 571.16 A: i i think um just 

571.53 579.47 A: people ought to 'cause it's just like people ought to be more considerate when they smoke uh i think it's just a a lot of it comes from inconsideration uh-huh 

576.20 577.38 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] [noise] )) 

581.13 582.13 A: oh 

581.54 583.01 B: i'm sorry 

582.86 583.97 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

584.16 585.07 B: um 

585.66 589.54 B: [lipsmack] i was gonna say something earlier i forget what it was now 

589.93 591.35 B: it was um [lipsmack] 

591.52 599.89 B: oh it was just about how the legislation it's like it's it's good to raise the prices but it seems like in certain
