4.44 5.73 A: hi roger 

5.87 7.32 B: (( how you doing )) 

5.96 8.92 A: it sounds sounds like this is the first time you did this 

8.83 10.84 B: uh no i done it a couple of times 

10.16 18.73 A: oh good good yeah [laughter] ban smoking huh well i don't smoke but i don't think i should have a government tell me what to do 

11.20 12.03 B: uh-huh 

14.82 15.62 B: uh-huh 

18.58 19.77 B: [laughter] 

18.90 21.80 A: i really don't i think if people were courteous 

21.89 27.24 A: that um you know it wouldn't bother anybody what what what is your feeling on that 

26.97 36.57 B: um well i i guess so the topic contains several different parts um so i'm definitely for the ban on smoking in public places um 

36.58 37.14 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

37.40 43.69 B: i i'm i live in california where i guess california was the first place in the states to adopt the ban and um 

41.92 43.40 A: that's where i live too 

43.89 48.49 B: what's that uh-huh yeah and 

44.47 45.74 A: i live there too 

46.44 48.36 A: i i live in thousand oaks 

48.75 51.33 B: oh okay i'm in i'm in uh park 

50.93 52.15 A: uh okay 

52.11 53.49 B: yeah um 

54.86 56.70 B: i don't know i mean it's just a law 

56.46 70.45 B: you know i i i mean i g- i guess the ban started right before i moved to california and i uh i mean i noticed the difference it's much more pleasant to g- you know to go out into i mean the main the main place where it really matters is like restaurants and bars you know 

70.26 72.19 A: yeah oh i can understand that 

70.53 74.12 B: um i i know i mean i don't i don't think that you know 

74.31 74.98 B: so 

74.89 90.51 B: i i i don't think that there should be a ban on people smoking all together that would that would be ridiculous and no also i think it would be really counter productive i don't think that would stop people from smoking but a- and the issue to me is that you know smoking in a public place isn't something that affects just you it affects other people around you 

83.90 84.71 A: well 

90.48 93.24 B: and i i definitely feel the difference and you know so 

93.08 107.34 B: i.e. my fiancee is much more sensitive than me and i know when we travel a lot up state it's actually a real issue to her um going to places that you know where where smoke where smoking there are plenty people of smoking it's just a lot more difficult to stay there 

107.14 112.27 B: um you know to so that you can go out and eat at a restaurant or go out to a jazz club or whatever 

111.63 113.87 A: well i i think that um 

113.73 122.85 A: i- i i look at it uh uh differently i think that uh smoking in a restaurant uh true i believe that uh i i think that that 

118.97 120.97 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

122.67 133.32 A: that could be an annoyance and it does it's distasteful when people are are and and in a grocery store i could i can condone that uh in a bar there are several 

124.55 125.11 B: (( [cough] )) 

128.21 132.40 B: mhm mhm 

133.37 141.33 A: cities in this in this country where the where the bar industry or the uh uh whatever industry the entertainment industry has diminished 

138.07 139.74 B: mhm 

141.21 153.68 A: up to forty percent because of the ban in smoking uh a- in a bar it's uh it's something that smokers do when they drink they wanna they wanna smoke and uh 

153.54 163.66 A: i i think that that that is um i- is going a little bit too far now if if sometimes uh or i've heard that waitresses who don't smoke 

163.80 176.80 A: uh have a problem or have a respiratory problem there are concerns absolute concerns i and i and as your girlfriend i- is annoyed by uh uh uh cigarette [mn] especially cigar smoke 

169.11 170.86 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

176.75 180.27 A: uh and and i can see their point of view but i'm 

177.04 178.71 B: mhm 

180.31 191.80 A: um i'm i'm a conservative and i don't like the government telling me what to do at all i really don't and when it infringes on other people's rights 

183.53 185.20 B: mhm 

191.67 204.17 A: and there are other people see i don't i well when i did smoke i didn't smoke in those areas so that uh i i'm i'm a courteous type person but i know that there's a lot of people out there that are not 

195.89 197.59 B: mhm 

200.39 202.14 B: right 

204.13 212.87 A: and i i don't know i just uh i would i would suggest that they banned it in everything but bars and if you go outside that's just fine 

204.23 205.94 B: right 

213.03 220.91 A: uh but i i i don't know i i don't w- if people wanna kill themselves that's that's their business [laughter] 

219.30 225.49 B: [noise] uh-huh so you sort of see it as an infringement in a place like a restaurant but not an infringement in the bar so it sort of [noise] comes with the territory in the bar 

225.29 233.05 A: uh yeah kinda i do and i understand that's there's still issues there with you know if you wanna go into a bar and you don't smoke it's uh 

227.83 228.90 B: (( oh yeah you know )) 

233.06 238.14 A: uh maybe they can have smoking sections or s- or something of that nature some sort of [mn] 

236.49 242.33 B: uh i i could see i could see that as a reasonable uh middle ground you know because it's a restaurant you know 

242.32 256.30 B: i mean i'm from arizona and in arizona when i was growing up restaurants had non smoking sections and that was you know that was okay although some of them were a joke you know sometimes the non smoking section and the smoking section was just two two different walls that are adjacent to each other but i mean i think that you know 

252.13 253.48 A: true and it's 

253.88 258.36 A: true and it just blows right in there own way anyway it just does it anyway 

256.84 262.08 B: yeah and i but is it i mean that'll that'll be better than no yeah 

258.32 267.60 A: and you know i i and when i was when i was a kid i i was a box boy and i remember cleaning up the store and cigarette butts all over the floor 

266.93 268.96 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

267.49 276.04 A: was annoying as hell and i i think in a public place close like that that that is acceptable not to smoke there because 

269.50 271.07 B: mhm 

275.96 281.43 A: if people were courteous we wouldn't have to have these [laughter] laws but they're not 

280.00 281.03 B: (( of course )) 

281.35 291.42 A: that's the problem so uh that that's that's my you know smoking is a dirty filthy habit anyway and it took me a long time to to to quit 

282.80 284.79 B: mhm 

290.00 294.91 B: uh-huh well congratulations that you quit i [mn] were you seriously addicted or i mean 

292.24 294.15 A: (( well yeah )) 

294.22 294.78 A: (( [mn] )) 

295.90 297.97 A: w- was i addicted 

297.75 300.88 B: sorry i a personal question i don't wanna 

299.45 314.17 A: no no [laughter] no ask personal questions i like personal questions well uh mentally i think i think i- i- it uh mentally addicts you because it it gives you uh some sort of uh satisfaction there for your mind wants to uh 

314.03 320.66 A: uh have a uh i i for one smoked cigars which were even stinkier and uh 

317.84 318.69 B: uh-huh 

319.60 324.88 B: right but it's probably less physically addictive right because you can't smoke that many of them isn't that sort of the way it is 

323.95 335.15 A: that's true and and you don't inhale them uh per se but i have seen some people but as far as offensive goes uh you know again if people were courteous we wouldn't have this problem 

327.33 328.08 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

331.86 333.55 B: mhm 

335.00 344.16 A: but since we do have the problem i would i would suggest that they started uh [mn] we can't do it in stores and in restaurants now and i feel that that's 

343.92 353.24 A: reasonable but in a bar i don't go to many bars anyway um i used to as a younger but uh i i think that that's that's pushing it a little bit too far 

344.71 347.29 B: mhm 

348.06 349.22 B: uh-huh 

353.43 363.18 B: yeah i don't know i mean you know i never used to go to bars or anything which i don't go that often now but i go to listen to music and it's really nice to be able to go and not have to deal with the smoke i mean and then 

363.49 369.31 B: [mn] it's not something i noticed so much before and i personally i mean i'm i'm asthmatic but i've never had a huge problem with 

369.30 380.83 B: cigarette smoke although i know other asthmatics who have but it's really a [mn] now that i'm used to it it's really a noticeable difference when i go out in a place that there is smoking in bars and it it's much harder to deal with now 

378.71 379.67 A: sure 

380.38 381.51 A: (( i can )) 

380.75 395.29 B: i don't know if you've heard about about the situation in japan i guess they put a smoking on j- in japan but it's a ban on smoking on the sidewalks [laughter] rather than smoking inside yeah and the reason it doesn't have anything to do with public health but it has to do with men brushing their cigarette butts against because [mn] 

388.18 389.61 A: is that right 

395.33 399.13 A: yeah [laughter] isn't that isn't that you see 

395.37 396.21 B: uh 

396.54 400.54 B: are much tighter so it's about men destroying other people's school uh clothes 

399.93 405.39 A: there we go with the people being inconsiderate you know i always used to cuff my uh 

403.14 404.91 B: mhm 

405.49 414.89 A: uh because i didn't wanna burn somebody i remember one time that i even brushed up against my own son on his arm and i felt like hell i was terrible and that brought me to the realization 

408.27 408.96 B: (( yeah sure )) 

411.61 413.51 B: oh dear uh-huh 

414.65 416.60 B: yeah yeah 

415.00 426.32 A: that you know it's just it's [laughter] it's just not working but again people are inconsiderate n- and [mn] and it does hurt i'll tell ya when somebody it brushes up against you 

419.61 421.34 B: mhm 

424.10 425.69 B: yeah 

426.19 429.27 B: mhm d- oh yeah 

426.45 430.51 A: so you know i- it is it's it's it's and issue that uh 

430.50 443.52 A: a- again my endeavour not to have the government butt into my life uh plays a big part in the decisions i make in voting and everything but there are reasonable areas where that is uh 

439.77 441.45 B: mhm 

443.49 448.71 A: palatable you know it's just it's just whatever is reasonable and it seems as though be uh 

444.73 446.07 B: well exactly 

446.73 448.86 B: (( [cough] mhm )) 

448.55 462.77 A: eating i don't like to smoke i don't like to be around smoke when i'm eating and i you know i just that's just i don't like that [laughter] and i don't i i don't think any courteous person wouldn't do it but they do you know so 

452.71 454.37 B: mhm 

454.55 456.21 B: yeah 

456.75 457.98 B: mhm 

462.78 467.94 A: um this ban on smoking it must be for other states because in california we 

466.40 471.38 B: [noise] well it it's getting more widespread so in new york they introduced it a couple of months ago 

471.98 479.77 B: um i guess it's a pretty big deal in new york i mean [mn] it it's complicated so i think the r- the real problem with bar- i- it's complicated with bars because bars 

480.24 488.71 B: their revenue doesn't just come from their customers smoking or uh tobacco companies actually who give them the big subsidies 

488.19 489.19 A: sure 

488.60 499.83 B: to put up advertisements and i think actually in new york uh part of the whole deal was that i mean of course you can't put cigarette machines in a bar anymore right if there's a smoking ban 

499.45 500.53 A: mhm 

499.97 501.32 B: but um 

501.81 506.38 B: oh no well i'm not i'm not so sure that you can't you that you still can't do it because um [lipsmack] 

506.92 512.23 B: i mean i can imagine you could buy cigarettes within the bar and then go outside which is still fine 

512.14 526.61 B: but um i guess there's [mn] there's some kind of restriction and i'm not sure what the [mn] whole situation is but there's some kind of restriction i i think there's some yeah i think they introduced something in new york where actually they can't or they also can't advertise in bars and that's a serious loss of revenue for the bar 

512.15 512.86 A: [laughter] 

515.89 519.56 A: i don't know either i haven't been in a bar in a long time so i don't know for 

526.86 538.91 B: um it would sort of be the natural thing to go along with the ban on smoking but the the bars actually got revenue or maybe no no no no i remember now the the the tobacco companies have stopped advertising in general 

527.35 528.41 A: it is 

538.65 540.30 A: uh what kind of that w- 

539.07 540.18 B: um becau- 

539.94 552.51 B: they have they've stopped advertising their own products like r._g. reynolds uh the big companies they've stopped advertising their products in bars and that was a major source of revenue for bars so it's sort of an i- it's an issue for the bar i mean i guess there's just a lot of uh 

541.39 542.92 A: oh stopped huh 

552.42 556.12 B: you know uh it's all in terms of smoking non bar industry revenue 

556.15 569.51 A: y- and i and i hate to equate i really do hate to equate people's annoyance and or their health or life with money because i mean uh we could go writing the airlines if it cost them ten million dollars to uh fix something 

556.44 557.97 B: um that [noise] 

563.10 565.67 B: mhm 

569.25 570.77 B: yeah exactly 

569.36 576.39 A: and it's only going to cost five million dollars to settle a law suit well they won't fix it now that that that's hard for me to stomach 

573.57 575.32 B: yeah 

576.26 587.30 B: yeah well i mean hey you know bars that adopt a no smoking policy are gaining revenue from people like me who were less likely to go to bars that you know i think it's a temporary effect like if we can cut down the rate of smoking in the country then 

576.52 577.98 A: that type of stuff 

587.43 597.54 B: then smoking bans are going to be less e- less of an issue economically and so i i agree with you like the long term prognosis has you know you take people's health into consideration and the economics will follow it 

587.72 589.11 A: that's possible 

590.81 591.37 A: (( [mn] )) 

597.77 599.89 A: (( yeah uh uh well you ))
