391.14 392.65 A: yeah it was very good 

392.91 406.22 A: but most people say that you know if you wanna cook a coot you throw it in the oven you put a brick in beside of it and when the brick is tender enough so you can cut it you throw away the coot and you eat the brick so [laughter] 

394.07 395.32 B: oh go ahead i'm sorry 

402.08 405.53 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yup exactly that's what my grandfather used to say )) 

405.93 419.96 B: but yeah that's just a a bottom feeder nobody eats that [noise] you know and but there's one lady here that my grandfather [noise] knew that she could cook a coot to be yeah so [mn] it was really good [noise] but i've never tried it myself [noise] 

409.41 410.30 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

420.18 424.11 A: [mn] well the way that the way that this guy cooked 'em they were fine and

424.52 425.52 B: [noise] 

425.28 435.30 A: i could have it every meal of the week the way he did it yeah but he wa- he also was a rather exceptional cook [mn] uh he was on a fishing boat and he was the cook on the fishing boat and [mn] 

427.11 429.85 B: (( really okay )) 

431.07 432.30 B: (( [noise] right )) 

432.71 433.71 B: [noise] 

434.52 438.48 B: oh so he had to [noise] learn how to do things on there 

437.49 444.95 A: well i thin that's right yeah and that's how i happened to meet him because i was engaged in commercial fisheries when i was younger yeah 

439.58 442.05 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

443.41 444.55 B: oh really

454.92 455.96 B: i'll be done 

455.92 461.10 A: that was something he always ate he always liked it when we went bird hunting and brought him home a bunch so 

457.40 458.65 B: [noise] 

460.74 463.54 B: yeah so [noise] 

461.81 462.69 A: [mn] 

463.47 476.15 B: yeah it's see i like what is trying different recipes and [noise] different things and you know when you heat 'em [noise] and uh see how it turns out 'cause if you get enough of this stuff you don't have to worry about wrecking it if you wreck you then you can always [noise] 

475.99 479.85 B: make up for it the next time you know after you get some fish and stuff and [mn] 

478.78 479.67 A: right 

479.97 484.45 A: [mn] yeah when i was much younger than i am now probably twenty years ago 

480.14 481.06 B: [noise] 

483.85 485.63 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

484.96 488.14 A: uh i had a friend that i used to hunt with some and 

489.28 491.00 A: he was into bird hunting 

490.91 491.87 B: uh-huh 

491.20 492.83 A: though mostly grouse 

493.27 494.78 A: [mn] and uh 

493.35 494.03 B: yup 

495.28 498.20 A: oh pheasants and things like that he had bird dogs 

498.43 502.07 A: so we always used to get together with him and another 

502.71 511.48 A: couple the inn we'd have a game dinner you know that night when we'd do a game dinner and he'd always bring birds and usually i'd bring deer meet and somebody else would bring fish and 

505.09 507.15 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

511.47 512.29 B: yup 

512.05 516.27 A: and we'd all get together and share recipes and we always had a good time when we did that 

515.65 518.89 B: yeah those were those best we'd get the wild game season going on 

518.10 527.92 A: oh yeah yeah we had a great time enjoyed it a lot but i moved away from where i lived then so i kinda lost contact with those folks over the years 

519.37 520.31 B: yeah 

524.73 525.36 B: (( mm )) 

525.56 526.12 B: (( [mn] )) 

526.52 527.90 B: oh sure 

528.05 531.07 A: it's easier to get out of touch after you relocate so 

528.26 529.45 B: (( yeah well )) 

530.68 538.48 B: [mn] yeah i hear that you know it's i [mn] was in the service for a while and then i had friends there and i lost touch after we left so that kind of sucked but 

538.38 539.44 A: yeah 

538.50 539.10 B: [mn] 

539.25 549.31 B: no [noise] it's it's like here though a wild game feast 'cause we got everything from rocky mountain oysters to the [mn] the bear the raccoon you know and the b- different birds and 

549.32 551.23 B: moose and elk and all that stuff and 

551.32 553.54 B: sometimes i try different things after ya 

552.97 564.48 A: oh yeah yeah anytime we ever do any travelling we always look for something that's unusual in the recipe you know if there's something that we if we don't know what it is we're more inclined to try it [laughter] 

557.67 559.82 B: [noise] [noise] yup that's it 

562.42 572.04 B: [noise] [noise] exactly just a i always like to do that and and you know get the taste of everything i try [mn] my oldest one he's picky about we're not trying but the youngest he 

572.23 575.36 B: eats anything you put in front of his face you know so 

575.08 576.39 A: [mn] well that's good 

576.22 577.14 B: (( yeah )) 

576.82 578.57 A: yeah [laughter] 

577.73 579.81 B: (( so yeah [mn] an- )) 

578.62 581.86 A: you won't have to worry about keeping him filled up 

581.63 582.57 B: (( [laughter] no )) 

583.14 587.63 B: no that's something i like about the fishing and hunting part is if you get something different you can 

588.08 595.65 B: not if you can't if you don't eat it yourself you can trade it off to somebody else for something you know and [noise] and uh try what they've caught or or shot so 

595.34 598.51 A: [laughter] [mn] that's right yeah that is that's true [noise] [mn] 

597.71 599.24 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] ))
