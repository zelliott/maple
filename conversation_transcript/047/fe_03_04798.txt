0.82 1.95 A: (( [lipsmack] hello )) 

1.38 2.79 B: hi 

2.75 5.12 A: hi this is ted and i'm in virginia 

4.73 8.54 B: hi ted this is simone i'm in connecticut [laughter] 

7.12 10.88 A: oh well hi [laughter] hope it's not raining up there 

10.33 14.73 B: well it still is it's gonna last through memorial day weekend they say but 

13.75 16.24 A: so oh [laughter] yeah well same here 

16.35 19.30 A: well anyway we're supposed to talk about smoking i guess 

18.46 22.59 B: right i'm a non smoker what about yourself 

21.52 27.59 A: uh i have never well actually that's not true i was gonna say i've never smoked in my life but i had one cigarette when i was sixteen 

27.72 33.14 B: i did that one when i was in mexico with friends and it was like oh why did i ever try this thing [laughter] 

31.84 37.73 A: yeah [laughter] so so i'm gonna come to this from a very very negative sense 

37.07 38.42 B: (( wh- okay )) 

38.37 42.41 A: um i i think that people who smoke are idiots 

42.57 46.25 A: i think the smell of cigarette smoke is horrible 

45.72 51.45 B: well i can't sta- you know i can't g- i can't stand going to a restaurant and you know they say that i mean it's a it's 

51.32 58.45 B: embarrassing when they say want the smoking section or non smoking section and there's no walls dividing it when i walk out of a restaurant 

56.15 57.21 A: mhm 

58.32 67.34 B: be it a one star a not even fast food let's say a one star up to a very expensive restaurant i still smell like a an ashtray when i walk out 

67.07 73.24 A: well a- and yeah i agree with you and and the the hard part is if you're going with friends let's say you're going with three or four friends 

73.29 84.34 A: um the problem that i have is i i'm you know a pretty vehement anti smoker but i have friends who do smoke and if you're gonna go and you're gonna be courteous to that person 

84.66 89.37 A: you know theoretically they should be courteous and say oh i'll i'll sit in the no smoking section 

86.99 87.89 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

89.20 93.56 B: or i or i you know ex- yeah well exactly or not smoke in your presence 

92.86 96.43 A: right or or yeah or they'll just forego it for that hour or two 

94.66 95.68 B: yeah 

95.71 103.82 B: i mean my all my friends know i i built a house in ninety six and i will not let one one cigarette walk through this house with being lit 

103.15 104.69 A: more power to ya 

103.97 107.32 B: and the hardest thing about that ted is my dad smokes 

107.27 108.17 A: (( mm )) 

107.60 118.41 B: and i being only thirty two telling my father dad thank you for everything you've done for me but please don't light up in my house is a very powerful thing a very hard thing to do but he respects my wishes 

117.80 127.74 A: yeah well that that's good that's good fortunately um actually nobody close to me family or whatever does smoke so [laughter] so that hasn't really been that much of an issue [laughter] 

126.39 128.26 B: oh that's g- [laughter] 

128.02 135.00 A: but uh i mean yeah i mean the whole concept i think that is it new york i think that just passed a very strict law 

134.82 140.80 B: well w- connecticut were passing a law uh the first of october that banned smoking in in restaurants and bars 

140.53 141.62 A: mhm 

140.99 148.28 B: which i'm counting the days i mean there's there's i mean as i say i just i just entered my thirties and i 

148.24 159.50 B: hated being in my twenties and you know going with the friends and smoking and and you know n- going with my friends with to the bars and they smoke and everybody else smokes and um you know i used to come home and jump right in the shower because it was like choking me to death 

159.24 160.16 A: mhm 

159.50 163.64 B: but i and i kinda just you know swayed away from that social aspect of 

163.64 176.40 B: you know being social and hanging out with friends and everything because i don't i don't like going home stinking like an ashtray so i'm i'm counting the days down basically until this smoking law you know passes in connecticut where where they cannot smoke in public places 

176.40 184.01 B: and so i can go back out again there's a lot of places that i've basically turned my cheek away and said i'm not going in your place because you look like uh you know you have smoking 

182.19 187.34 A: [mn] do you ever let the places the know th- why you're not gonna go back 

187.04 192.39 B: oh i do but they have such the following of you know other regulars 

192.64 196.01 B: that you know they'll put ashtrays and they 

196.29 199.30 B: i mean friends that used to work in the old do do like 

199.45 210.09 B: cocktail waitressing or you know serve drinks at the bar like simone it's a it's a job i need the job and i'm like well you're killing yourself at lea- they're smoking through a filter you're breathing it in straight 

201.81 202.71 A: right 

209.42 210.82 A: yeah right right 

210.12 217.14 B: and is that money that you're collecting now be you know all tip money that you a lot of them they don't report uh you know all of it obviously most people don't 

216.77 217.79 A: right 

217.18 221.29 B: the the tip money is it really worth your health 

220.64 230.14 A: yeah uh actually that that's an interesting point that you bring up uh my my my daughter's in college and she had to do a uh some sort of a paper on a public health hazard 

229.46 230.21 B: mhm 

230.09 237.24 A: and she happened to choose uh secondhand smoke as her as her topic for this one paper 

233.83 234.61 B: (( okay )) 

237.19 246.98 A: and she did some fairly good research on that and and the bottom line is that you are e- even though you may be you know a foot away or two feet away from a person who's smoking 

246.98 255.55 A: um you're getting all kinds of nasty stuff um it just sort of stays in the air for several minutes before it it dissipates 

249.20 251.19 B: you're getting it straight right 

255.62 260.89 A: and you can you can be just you can have cancer whatever just as bad 

260.90 264.06 A: as uh as the person who's actually puffing 

264.16 271.20 B: mhm right exac- 'cause you know they have they have a filter and you don't and another thing was um i love it that they they banned smoking on planes 

264.78 265.51 A: w- 

271.77 285.64 B: 'cause i mean i thought it was absurd that you know up to row twelve is smoke free and thirteen to you know twenty five is smoking i'm like it still travels there's no windows on the airplane you cannot roll down your window to get fresh air 

271.77 272.74 A: yes 

281.14 283.49 A: that's [laughter] 

285.36 293.08 A: but how mu- you know l- you think back to this 'cause i'm of course as are you old enough to remember those days but uh so much of that was the tobacco lobby 

293.44 295.22 B: (( r- r- right )) 

293.50 296.64 A: remember how hard it was to get those laws passed 

296.24 305.94 B: yeah but and you know the the irony one of the ironies i think ted is that the forefront is a lot of the tobacco companies are are putting out the no smoking and don't smoke ads 

305.87 306.97 A: yeah but 

306.01 309.04 B: i mean that that that is an irony to me i don't under- i 

308.11 316.86 A: well uh but but it's i and i'm a very cynical person and i think the only reason they're doing that is so they don't get sued even worse than they have been already 

313.22 314.68 B: to save their tail 

316.10 320.46 B: well we're putting all this money into the anti smoking don't do it campaign 

319.85 325.60 A: yes but if they were serious about it they wouldn't be manufacturing twenty billion packs of cigarettes every day 

320.49 322.35 B: here's our here's our donation 

322.84 326.02 B: right they could stop manufacturing it mm 

327.41 329.04 A: yeah so i i 

327.72 339.90 B: and then i mean i love it every time the the the state uh pushed puts more money on taxes for smoking and i and the new and the company or the interviewing people it's like well when it reaches this amount we'll stop 

339.87 343.56 B: well how much higher is it gonna go it's like five dollars a pack right now 

342.70 345.83 A: yeah but but but they're not gonna s- some people 

344.39 346.57 B: and they're not stopping they can't 

346.30 348.62 A: are just addicted 

347.63 354.66 B: i mean if you put i mean and i don't understand all these you know the different w- you know hypno- hypnotism and the patch and everything else i don't know 

354.97 362.91 B: of course since i'm not a smoker i was j- i don't know how well they work or if they or if it's all just willpower i mean i've had friends that you know did some of these 

363.43 372.75 B: commercials ideas to quit and they just one day just just started turning back and i'm like well why did you start well i felt like i needed it you haven't smoked for how many months 

372.75 374.83 A: mhm [lipsmack] yeah but [mn] 

373.43 377.49 B: i mean and i i'm a i'm i'm [mn] i 

375.40 379.58 A: but i've heard similar things from people who say they've stopped drinking 

380.18 384.99 A: and then they go back to it just that one time and then they're back to it full time 

382.67 383.55 B: yeah 

384.74 389.01 B: yeah it's like well why'd you try why'd you go back that one time you knew how bad it was when you were you 

388.70 392.42 A: yeah yeah so i think a lot of really is self control 

390.42 391.53 B: (( know mm )) 

392.92 398.87 A: but of course that's why people start started in the first place they started because they think of it in their teens and they think it's cool 

398.39 407.50 B: cool but also they think it's something they think it's something that you know a right of passage or something to do i mean a right of passage was you know underage unfortunately going to a bar 

407.40 408.32 A: right 

407.65 417.12 B: i mean and and then once we're there it's like okay w- what's the big deal now i'm overage but okay so i've had my drink i've had my un- my underage drink i had my overage drink and i'm like 

410.50 412.70 A: yeah b- been there done that [laughter] [mn] [noise] 

416.94 424.36 B: now i'm choking on these people's smokes and i really don't you know their cigarettes and i don't feel like being here anymore i'm like well you know then i lose out on my social aspect of 'em you know 

424.54 430.54 B: the t- tw- you know in the mid you know the mid twenties growing up it's like forget it i you know i have to look past this 

430.47 440.36 B: moment of now of you know enjoying the music and enjoying people's company and dancing and choking on their smoke to hey wait a minute i don't need this in my life [laughter] 

438.70 443.98 A: well yeah but how many people are are that introspective how many people really you know yeah 

442.10 447.72 B: no very few very few 'cause we most most people you know the society of united states is live in the moment 

447.76 450.67 A: that's right uh yeah i- instant gratification 

447.80 449.07 B: live now mm 

451.41 453.76 A: and that's just not the way it should be 

454.31 459.43 A: so uh uh to answer their question i'm all in favor of laws [laughter] 

458.43 468.96 B: oh i can't wait i think it's i think they should start with just um closing down the tobacco pla- buildings you know putting them out of business or w- you know somehow i know i mean that's a m- a miraculous 

465.90 466.80 A: yeah 

468.90 479.19 B: dream let's call it but just some way of saying okay you know what the the world society is not acc- you know not stopping because we keep taxing them left and right h- h- you know let's 

470.41 471.30 A: yeah 

479.29 485.89 B: let's stop let's fine you you know you know you're making illegal product uh a legal product that people are dying from 

480.75 481.68 A: mhm 

484.80 487.14 A: i- it's uh legal but dangerous 

486.75 488.70 B: we should stop doing this 

488.16 491.24 A: yeah well good luck good luck 

489.82 501.32 B: i mean you cut on the you cut down on the old nuclear war and every- nuclear warheads and everything 'cause you know that's a product that you are making that will kill people this is a product that you're making that are killing killing the children off the street 

500.90 504.40 A: yes but but hey it's not it's not seen that way 

503.87 517.08 B: yeah but you know a couple of years ago when a lot of this hoop la was coming around they they did a study on with children and they said that um the joe ca- joe joe camel was one of the top recognized cartoon characters 

516.60 518.95 A: that's right mhm i remember reading that 

517.52 528.08 B: i mean right up there like with mickey mouse i'm like how could the- you know this is something that they see day in and day out i was happy when the magazines took smoking ads out of them 

527.76 528.77 A: right 

528.16 530.45 B: (( i know it was one of the you know the best things )) 

530.96 533.67 A: well and when they stopped showing them on t._v. to watch 

532.38 534.62 B: on television right 

533.71 534.93 A: yeah 

536.07 541.18 B: but uh i am totally for [laughter] the whole world [laughter] stopping their smoking 

538.04 539.19 A: [laughter] 

539.87 544.82 A: yeah i mean i i have another i have another pet peeve about the way that smokers act too 

544.85 550.08 A: and that is at least the building where i am there's no smoking in the building in my office building 

548.46 549.84 B: (( mhm [cough] )) 

550.15 558.46 A: but what you do is you get people who have to smoke what they do is [noise] they stand outside the door literally right outside the door 

558.03 560.51 B: and they litter and they make a mess [laughter] 

559.69 571.77 A: right so so if i want to go out of my building to my car for instance [noise] i've gotta walk through this gauntlet of people who are puffing well you know what's the point of banning them from inside the building 

571.41 583.84 B: if they're gonna stand right out the s- front door and make the and make the cloud and you know what you know what's pretty i think it's pathetic i mean i virginia i don't know how cold it gets in your winters i don't know what part of virginia you're in ted but 

572.34 574.37 A: if they're gonna be right outside there 

582.81 586.11 A: uh well n- northern and it can get cold [laughter] 

585.40 598.42 B: well being in connecticut we've had basically since november to the beginning of may with end of april beginning of may with snow these people standing outside hovered around this little lit fire that's the size of their pinkie 

598.07 599.58 A: [laughter] yes 

598.50 599.89 B: you know it's shivering
