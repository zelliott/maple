24.00 25.79 B: [laughter] 

28.67 30.12 B: well that's good 

29.26 34.62 A: some some aren't so good and of course but anyway uh our topic is smoking in uh 

30.79 31.88 B: yeah 

34.76 35.89 B: correct 

35.11 36.46 A: something that i 

36.55 38.97 A: despise myself 

37.95 39.77 B: well me too 

39.16 45.75 A: i'm not a smoker and uh really kinda glad about some of the things they've been doing although i am somewhat sympathetic to 

45.83 53.30 A: you know people who who smoke and and you know like can't smoke in bars and gotta go outside and but um you know it's uh 

54.08 55.92 A: i i think it's a good thing 

56.01 62.69 B: [noise] [noise] i don't like smoking and i have a tremendous aversion to it and allergies 

62.12 63.39 A: oh yeah 

62.85 67.01 B: and they have not banned it in public places here 

67.41 68.58 B: uh 

68.69 71.82 B: but we have a college town very near 

72.20 75.86 B: and they're thinking about banning smoking in the bars 

75.24 76.53 A: (( uh yeah )) 

75.96 78.10 B: and i'm like 

78.64 82.31 B: [mn] i i don't see any problem 

82.43 88.23 B: you know if you wanna have a non smoking bar and cater that clientele great 

88.26 91.61 B: so if you wanna have a smoking bar [laughter] you know 

91.36 93.18 A: (( yeah )) 

91.83 94.66 B: i don't think there should be laws against it 

93.93 103.04 A: yeah well see it's it's starting to do that around here they've done it in uh in new york city um but they it just got enacted i think in boston 

98.77 99.71 B: uh-huh 

102.77 103.88 B: wow 

103.29 110.59 A: and uh it's um sort of on the docket right now here in the state legislature in connecticut and so 

109.10 110.02 B: yeah 

110.64 114.32 A: um you know so it's kind of a hot topic around here um 

113.16 114.05 B: sure 

114.19 125.95 A: and uh you know uh i- it one thing that bugs me is when you go into a restaurant say and you know there whether there's a smoking section or a non smoking section it always seems to filter its way over and and and you know 

124.11 125.64 B: oh absolutely 

125.82 139.50 A: bars i can kinda see that you know it's probably a good idea you know if it's just a bar to you know then there should be maybe non smoking bars and smoking bars but it's kinda hard to do i mean i i don't know i mean it's um 

135.80 136.80 B: right 

139.82 140.79 A: so 

140.80 144.46 A: but um in terms of all the other stuff they talked about like um 

145.07 154.10 A: banning uh no excuse me about uh you know advertisements and and i c- i forget what else i don't know if you heard that um stop smoking programs or 

153.38 154.72 B: right 

154.08 168.84 A: stuff i mean obviously i think that's that's a great idea i mean you know they've had not that people are gonna necessarily pay attention but if it helps some people i mean we have had that warning on cigarettes for you know forever and who pays attention to that you know 

162.92 163.86 B: uh-huh 

166.11 167.35 B: right 

168.22 170.50 B: uh obviously they don't 

170.79 177.05 A: on- once you're hooked on it i guess you know you're pretty hooked on it's it's hard for people to quit and so 

177.14 187.11 A: um you know if if it'll if any of those ads and things will will keep people from starting then i think that's a good idea 

186.58 191.47 B: right i think that maybe legislation 

191.63 198.00 B: that would [mn] like a couple of years ago where they came out and said okay no joe camel we aren't gonna 

198.19 199.98 B: because the target 

200.36 202.24 B: area is 

202.32 203.67 B: teenagers 

203.07 208.38 A: oh yeah yeah yeah i'm all for that that you know it shouldn't be uh 

204.49 205.56 B: you know 

209.34 210.77 A: made to look 

210.87 211.90 A: you know 

211.75 219.63 A: exciting or sexy or whatever you know like they like they are trying to like that's what sells you know so to to target it towards kids or 

215.22 216.84 B: oh exactly 

219.48 230.95 A: or whatever to make it look you know like it's cool or something that's that's definitely sending the wrong message and it's it's it's that i believe that you know should be legislated against um [lipsmack] 

224.92 226.76 B: (( [noise] right )) 

229.90 232.21 B: right exactly 

231.16 240.16 A: um in terms of going so far as to banning it from like you know sponsoring races or or things like that well you know 

240.94 246.75 A: i don't know i you know alcohol's just as bad for you and they're not gonna ban alcohol you know or 

247.13 248.02 A: (( or so )) 

248.36 249.91 A: that i think is sort of a [lipsmack] 

251.14 252.41 A: i don't think that that's 

252.45 255.29 A: really deserving [mn] that that's right but 

254.41 256.88 B: [mn] right right 

256.92 258.86 B: but i agree [mn] 

257.47 268.60 A: i mean they're businesses and cigarettes are legal still and so they're a business and they wanna advertise well you know they've got to be able to advertise somewhere i mean so 

260.99 261.57 B: (( [cough] )) 

265.85 266.77 B: right 

266.87 268.59 B: (( mhm )) 

268.63 270.98 B: as long as they do it to the right market 

270.35 274.06 A: yeah i mean they've stopped advertising on t._v. you know um 

273.06 274.48 B: right 

273.88 287.11 A: and so but if they're gonna have you know billboards or they're gonna have you know sponsor racing or or whatever t- you know i don't think they do sports anymore that i can remember it's just [mn] i mean like uh football or basketball i think you you don't see ads on t._v. i think it's just for 

287.03 292.29 A: like racing there must be some other i would say they have it in magazines and stuff i think that's fine 

292.01 295.40 B: [noise] correct yeah but [sigh] 

296.04 298.90 B: probably the the money should be 

298.92 302.36 B: spent towards prevention versus rehab 

303.33 307.60 B: you know if if government money is more aimed towards that thing then 

308.29 313.68 B: probably my thoughts are it should go towards preventing to stop 

314.53 317.07 B: people from taking that first smoke 

316.48 319.15 A: yeah yeah well you know there is um 

319.16 324.08 A: yeah they they've won these big lawsuits in separate states and money is being um 

324.52 325.36 A: (( you know )) 

325.44 338.02 A: given to each state and yeah i think they're they're using programs f- for prevention i don't know about if some of the money is supposed to be aside to help you know people who now have say emphysema or whatever whether whether it gets 

338.83 353.29 A: you know i don't know about that i'm not quite i haven't followed that that closely is is that case do they some of them get like or you know do insurance companies who have to pay medical benefits to these people who have emphysema and have to live on oxygen all the time 

352.59 354.06 B: (( huh [cough] right )) 

353.46 357.00 A: i don't know how if some of that money is going to that or not i 

356.47 359.34 B: um [lipsmack] i don't know uh [mn] 

358.61 360.35 A: yeah 

359.96 363.71 B: i know that west virginia which is very close to here 

363.87 369.42 B: got its fair share of that and they haven't spent any of it 

370.01 370.94 B: i 

370.07 383.24 A: well you you hear about that some too you know they give the state our state of connecticut's got you know got so many millions or a billion whatever and and they're always you know the papers are always saying well you know where is this money being spent how is it being spent what kind of accountability is there 

380.32 381.64 B: right 

382.78 383.70 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

383.10 386.90 A: i don't follow the issue that closely that uh you know to know if 

386.92 389.17 A: if where the money goes you know 

388.92 390.44 B: (( um i )) 

389.50 395.73 A: could just be put into the general coffers and then you know it's up to the legislator to to fight over you know 

396.46 403.54 A: putting more money towards that kind of stuff and if it doesn't it doesn't i i i don't know i'm not really highly politically uh 

400.30 401.56 B: yeah 

404.05 409.81 A: charged or motivated to you know to follow a lot of that kind of stuff yeah it's 

406.47 407.36 B: i 

407.70 410.10 B: i can't say that i am either it's 

410.09 421.83 A: funny i 'cause i talked to somebody the other day w- one of these things but a totally different topic but this guy was like very political and very uh well versed on the topic and he just i i couldn't stop him talking you know 

410.17 410.98 B: (( you know )) 

421.15 422.16 B: uh-huh 

421.74 434.32 A: he barely let me get a word in edgewise but you know he was very intelligent and stuff i mean i didn't actually agree with his opinion but he was very good at you know defending his position you know and i'm not such a great arguer i wasn't about to like get him all [noise] you know 

423.50 424.16 B: (( w- ))

479.70 482.61 B: and what can you say 

482.26 482.95 A: mhm 

482.78 493.63 B: uh it sounds like down here in ohio things are a lot more liberal i was in san antonio several years ago and they took smoking out of restaurants completely 

489.88 491.50 A: yeah 

492.99 494.27 A: oh they did 

493.57 499.12 B: yeah i don't think they did it in the bars but i think they did in the restaurants and 

497.03 498.70 A: (( yeah )) 

498.73 500.16 A: yeah i think that's 

500.18 505.33 A: most of the country i mean for the you know i think that maybe it isn't necessarily 

505.54 509.81 A: a law but a lot of the restaurants are doing it voluntarily if it isn't a law it's i'm i'm not 

509.05 510.11 B: uh-huh 

510.68 514.44 B: well if it's a family restaurant and you know 

514.41 525.01 A: quite sure about that mm because i've been a restaurant recently and they were still smoking so it's not banned in the state it's it's they are thinking about doing it i think and and i know they've done it in new york city and and i think it's just happened in boston but 

514.97 515.53 B: (( [mn] )) 

518.74 520.53 B: right 

523.27 524.02 B: uh-huh 

525.02 527.30 A: (( you know i i i don't )) 

528.01 536.27 A: it's good for me and i think it's good for the workers who are you know who get or how much secondhand smoke really i mean i guess they've proved that secondhand smoke is sort of you know 

531.48 532.52 B: right 

536.18 544.91 A: isn't good for you huh and you know i mean but my father smoked two packs a day and we sat around the table with him smoking we sat in the car with him smoking 

544.49 545.52 B: oh yeah 

544.83 549.37 A: he didn't die of lung cancer he died of other totally unrelated cancer you know but 

548.57 549.52 B: uh-huh 

549.23 560.06 A: but i i know we breathed in a lot of smoke and we probably smelled like smoke when we wore our own clothes and stuff which i notice now my sister's kids smell like you walk in the room and they smell like smoke their hair their clothes 

558.43 559.65 B: right 

559.90 564.29 A: which i never noticed that before when i growing up but i'm sure that's how we smelled 

562.35 563.05 B: uh-huh 

564.09 573.20 A: and all that that we breathed or whether it's gonna you know kill me or not i don't know but you know maybe that wasn't as much as somebody who's working in a bar or a restaurant 

573.00 580.93 A: eight hours a day and is is breathing the smoke constantly you know it's possible so they have rights too and they're entitled to a workplace that's you know [noise] 

575.02 576.27 B: (( well it's )) 

576.95 577.83 B: yeah 

581.08 582.75 B: exactly 

581.26 584.26 A: so so maybe that's cool but you know 

583.41 589.14 B: yeah well our company went smoke free why ten years ago 

588.82 599.89 A: yeah but you know like out in california places where it's warm people can go outside and smoke you know and it's not a big deal here the people are saying well like in the dead ass cold of winter you know you gotta go outside to smoke a cigarette in a bar 

592.94 593.98 B: right
