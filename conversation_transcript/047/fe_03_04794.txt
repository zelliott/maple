76.82 79.25 B: smoking is banned everywhere 

78.78 89.60 A: but i but i tell you the truth i can't understand why they doing it i mean because it like if you work as a waitress or a bartender people smoke in your face twenty five you know like uh three or four hours a day you know 

88.92 99.96 B: well that's that's their reasoning behind it and do you know i part of me understands that i i but to me if you're gonna take on that job you know what i mean it's like you know that if you're if you're gonna be 

91.22 92.17 A: mhm 

93.75 94.64 A: mhm 

97.08 97.90 A: uh-huh 

99.74 109.70 B: um you know if uh uh a brain surgeon you're gonna have to be staring at people's brains all day if you're gonna be a bartender smoking goes along with the territory 

102.16 103.00 A: uh-huh 

106.46 108.20 A: [sigh] yeah but you gotta underst- 

109.14 118.86 A: i'm not arguing with you that's your opinion i'm not arguing i'm just saying that uh even with what you said yeah i understand if you're brain surgeon you're gonna be wor- looking at brains but you don't die from looking at brains you could die through 

118.15 120.64 B: (( all right we'll use a better analogy a )) 

119.60 121.52 A: (( okay better let's go )) 

120.70 127.84 B: better analogy all right you do you do construction work you choose to do construction work on a high rise building 

124.17 125.11 A: uh-huh 

125.34 127.78 A: yeah and that is dangerous of course 

127.77 134.77 B: there is a good chance that the scaffolding you're on could fall you take that chance you do the job regardless of what the 

134.63 142.60 B: uh consequences to your health could be and something that like that stuff like that happens all the time scaffolding breaks you know something 

137.29 138.18 A: of course 

142.39 152.58 B: when you take on an occupation like that now i'm not saying bartender is is a dangerous occupation but you go into it knowing what you're up against do you know what i mean it's not a surprise 

147.18 148.44 A: mhm 

151.20 156.43 A: oh i understand that but you you gotta understand from where they're coming from i mean i truly believe that 

156.23 169.54 A: even though i have nothing against smokers i ain't done they can do whatever the hell they want but i mean i understand how you could af- because you're technically are affecting the bartender and you are technically affecting that waitress even if she doesn't know it because smoking has been proven you know 

169.05 173.03 B: [noise] [noise] oh no i under- secondhand smoke is as dangerous as 

171.07 179.69 A: yeah very my friends used to smoke all the time so i know how the second i used to smoke like crazy all the t- i used to smoke a pack a day yeah 

179.42 183.67 B: well what do you think about stuff like you know um like [mn] 

183.73 191.40 B: all the programs to quit smoking do you think that they're worth it do you think i i mean i think i mean no 'cause i'm a smoker i have tried to quit 

191.03 192.38 A: it's difficult 

191.84 200.59 B: it's very very difficult espe- and now i d- now i take it back now i'm also i work in a nightclub and y- pardon me 

197.65 199.61 A: mhm well luck to you 

200.01 203.07 A: (( luck to you i love nightclubs in new york they're the best )) 

201.73 204.23 B: all right so you know so uh [mn] 

204.12 218.12 B: uh since i was a smoker it never bothered me but now what's happening is you know when i go to work or whatever there are more people outside smoking than there are in the club i don't even know how these people are making money anymore 

205.64 206.76 A: mhm 

211.01 211.85 A: (( mhm )) 

214.20 215.58 A: (( mm yeah )) 

217.74 218.56 A: [sigh] 

217.99 229.81 B: it's like it's insane i mean you'll you'll sit you'll be looking at the dance floor you'll be looking around and there might be fifteen people inside the club but if you look outside there's a hundred people outside smoking [noise] 

226.71 227.60 A: mhm 

229.13 243.80 A: oh i understand what you're saying but you've got to understand but it'll eventually change 'cause those people realize one day they gotta get out of smoking it just it's just for now it's like everything changes you know like anything in this world i mean smoking okay you i could give analogy that's very simple 

244.06 247.41 A: okay i have nothing against smokers my parents used to be smokers but [lipsmack] 

247.57 251.44 A: smoking costs united states of america do you know how much money 

250.86 252.55 B: oh g- oh yeah 

251.98 261.11 A: okay well let's forget all these uh say all the bartenders and every restaurant goes out of business it still wouldn't even cover ha- i mean ten percent of whatever smoking costs 

260.97 264.14 B: true you are right no you're right you're absolutely right [noise] 

262.74 271.79 A: yeah yeah because all the healthcare all this money is going to basically treat all lung cancers and all of that and you [mn] you know how much it costs to treat somebody who has lung cancer 

271.71 274.65 B: yeah i mean but i what i see what i think sh- 

272.66 273.60 A: yeah 

273.77 284.08 A: i understand what you're saying i understand what you from commercial but it's a lot cheaper if they don't you know j- deals 'cause the healthcare is the one that where the smoking's the most expensive 

283.86 291.86 A: you know that's where it basically is the killer i mean it's gonna cost billions of smoking they're gonna take their people out of no no it's gonna stay billions [mn] 

291.11 297.89 B: [noise] [noise] [sigh] yeah but see i don't think these you know these like quit smoking help lines and stuff i don't think that they work 

295.57 300.08 A: no i'm not buying in on that i don't believe that stuff will work i think it's up to the individual 

299.75 312.61 B: yeah and i think i mean uh and i h- i really think that you need some kind of medical intervention i think if you really wanna quit smoking you need a patch you need some kind either zyban is that the zyban that you can take 

306.72 307.49 A: uh-huh 

308.53 310.06 A: (( yeah you need something )) 

312.51 322.86 B: because i don't care who the hell you are unless you a. really wanna quit smoking i've yet to meet somebody that that just threw away a cigarette and said i'm never smoking again it doesn't happen 

322.66 325.79 A: well my parents did my father he doesn't smoke anymore 

325.75 327.90 B: but he just stopped cold turkey 

325.96 326.88 A: (( he )) 

327.23 332.55 A: yeah he just stopped but he was he was like he was used he smoked for about twenty years 

332.18 335.87 B: wow god bless him then i mean if you can just quit like that 

333.35 334.69 A: (( yeah he stopped )) 

335.24 339.29 A: well first of all it's one becoming so expensive you almost have to quit 

338.65 343.67 B: well i i d- i i don't know what it's like there but here cigarettes are now seven f- seven fifty a pack 

342.70 344.33 A: here it's five bucks 

344.47 347.85 B: five bucks to me is a bargain say seven fifty a pack 

346.36 351.42 A: [laughter] i mean that that's insane how can you keep paying all this money for cigarettes 

350.94 360.54 B: well you can't and that's the that's the weird thing about it aside from i know that l._a. is an expensive place to live but you also know coming from new york that new york is a real expensive place to live 

357.74 358.59 A: mhm 

359.02 367.43 A: well new york is the most expensive place in america i know that i know it so you gotta be insane everything is like you have to make something you know you it's money's like water there
