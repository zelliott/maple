3.49 8.30 A: yeah hi my name is robert and i'm here in ah brooklyn new york city how are you 

8.02 11.44 B: hi i'm from california inglewood california 

10.78 13.74 A: oh wow so we're this is a long distance call 

13.20 16.04 B: yeah [laughter] [laughter] 

14.11 15.21 A: wow 

15.24 17.69 A: um the topic i guess is 

17.86 28.76 A: smoking and so forth um i guess i can begin or you can begin it doesn't really make a difference i guess i would say that i used to be a smoker about twenty years ago 

19.46 20.57 B: yeah 

28.23 29.24 B: uh-huh 

29.17 39.50 A: and ah after smoking for a couple of years i found my chest started to hurt so i stopped smoking i became a heavy coffee drinker instead 

34.61 35.88 B: oh 

38.91 39.95 B: oh 

39.70 46.49 A: and ah but but it worked because i i have never had ah a cigarette or anything to smoke since then 

40.04 40.66 B: [laughter] 

46.71 49.76 B: oh me myself i'm not a smoker but 

49.06 50.38 A: have you ever been 

50.25 60.79 B: no my mother she's a smoker my brother my sister mostly everyone ah that i've been around they they smoke but i really don't like to smoke cigarettes i 

60.07 62.88 A: oh in other words you've tried it but you don't like it 

62.28 64.32 B: yes when i was younger 

64.34 65.85 B: it made me sick 

66.45 78.81 A: yeah i had tried it a few times and i didn't like it at all but then for some strange reason i stud i suddenly decided that i liked it after all i think it had a tendency to calm me down a bit maybe that was the reason 

78.75 82.79 B: oh you have um the the smoking helped you calm down mhm 

82.49 85.27 A: yeah [mn] i would smoke a cigarette 

85.31 90.61 A: and i'd feel slightly lightheaded i think but also a little calmer somehow 

90.54 94.86 B: oh that's what happened to me i felt lightheaded and and sick and um 

95.01 100.18 B: and and i really don't like smoke because my grandmother she passed away from ah lung cancer 

99.66 107.26 A: oh so you so you may have ah a tendency to to get lung problems if you smoke so you have to be especially careful 

106.83 117.65 B: yeah every my everyone just about everyone in my family they like to smoke at one period of time they weren't a smoker then later on in life they became ah a cigarette smokers 

117.84 122.01 A: yeah my father has smoked cigarettes all his life 

121.50 122.40 B: (( hm )) 

121.94 134.27 A: but miraculously it doesn't really seem to bother him very much i notice that he has ah a minor cough which is probably due to his smoking but other than that he's never been sick 

126.93 127.52 B: (( yeah )) 

131.66 132.69 B: uh-huh 

134.08 135.42 B: yes 

135.25 146.07 A: so he's but he's lucky 'cause i've known other people who ah who also developed very serious problems they either got lung cancer or a friend of mine developed emphysema 

146.39 150.86 A: so ah there's no doubt about it it's it's a very dangerous habit 

150.57 155.68 B: yeah my stepfather he developed emphysema too and had to move out of california because of it 

155.45 159.21 A: and and i understand that's something you really never recover from 

158.61 160.38 B: yes and ah 

159.57 163.02 A: and there's really no effective treatment either i don't believe 

162.67 164.34 B: no um 

164.57 168.44 B: a lo- my mother she tried the patch and the the chewing gum nicorette 

168.49 171.30 A: oh right i know people who've tried those things right 

170.96 175.46 B: they stopped she stopped for a while but um she she started back again 

175.72 177.98 B: so it really it really didn't help her 

178.10 181.54 A: yeah my boss i believe tried the patch 

181.18 182.18 B: uh-huh 

181.90 191.50 A: but he had been a very heavy smoker and he said that it didn't seem to really do him any good he may have stopped very very briefly but but then he started again 

189.67 190.56 B: uh-huh 

191.74 201.77 B: yeah and i think the reason why it's hard for her to stop is because of you know she's a very nervous person and um like stressed and it helps calm her down too 

201.49 212.60 A: [noise] yeah i think that's one of the reasons people get addicted 'cause they have the experience i had where when i got got kind of nervous it very definitely calmed me down 

204.78 205.81 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

212.49 217.37 B: yeah um and so the cigarettes coffee does ah coffee calms me down 

217.77 222.48 A: cof- yeah well coffee ah i feel good when i drink coffee 

221.99 223.31 B: yeah 

222.81 236.02 A: and fortunately i haven't had any bad results from that some people get you know severe stomach problems for example but i but i've been okay and i guess it's better to be a heavy coffee drinker than to be a smoker 

229.77 230.83 B: uh-huh 

232.19 233.31 B: yeah 

235.67 240.93 B: yeah 'cause um people think i smoke because i'll be around my mother and my clothes smell like cigarettes 

240.78 242.08 A: yeah 

241.49 244.07 B: yeah [laughter] they ask me 

243.15 248.10 A: i think the ot- i think the other topic we were supposed to touch on is smoking prevention programs 

247.48 248.50 B: uh-huh 

248.88 249.90 B: (( ah ah )) 

249.00 253.56 A: um well needles to say i've never been in any kind of a smoking program 

253.38 254.39 B: uh-huh 

253.95 260.12 A: but i but but but one of my jobs is in the ah substance abuse rehabilitation agency 

259.50 260.99 B: oh okay 

260.48 264.73 A: and i know these programs in regard to substance abuse 

264.75 273.17 A: they can be pretty effective for some people so i guess smoking prevention does have possibilities but i don't really know that much about it personally 

267.03 268.08 B: uh-huh 

272.95 277.90 B: yeah i think if if it can help people um i agree on having 'em also 

277.62 278.71 A: yeah 

277.98 281.90 B: if if if it can cure people from um smoking cigarettes 

281.95 284.31 B: because they it can save their life too 

284.32 288.78 A: do you avoid going into places where there's a lot of smoke around 

288.17 289.99 B: yes i try to uh-huh 

289.75 299.46 A: yeah because here in new york there used to be a lot of places like that and it would really bother me where i'd go into a restaurant and it was really very smokey sometimes it would even burn my eyes 

299.33 300.55 B: (( yeah )) 

299.41 305.25 A: so i would walk out but now sm- the smoking is banned in in new york city in public places 

305.30 315.62 B: oh they they um i don't think they banned it here but it like you know if we have the metro system you can't smoke on the platform you have to go off and um 

311.88 312.84 A: yeah 

315.60 326.00 B: when when i get into a public place and there's a lot of smoke i start coughing and i just can't stand it i have to roll down a window or ah it get it gets in me and i'm afraid of getting second hand smoke 

325.59 332.96 A: yeah it's the same with me are you saying that when you go into a restaurant in california there are people there who are who are smoking 

327.00 327.81 B: uh-huh 

329.98 330.96 B: uh-huh 

332.74 339.81 B: n- well they have a area where um ah people can smoke and then a another area where there's non smokers 

339.47 346.36 A: oh okay because i think it works the same way in new york if a if a if a place has a separate location 

340.34 341.42 B: (( yeah )) 

346.25 360.23 A: wh- which they wanna have for smokers only the smokers are allowed to go in there and smoke but in the main areas this is both in a restaurant and even in a bar you you can't you can't really smoke so a lot of smokers are really angry at our mayor for this 

348.52 349.57 B: mhm 

354.18 355.71 B: mhm 

359.92 365.80 B: oh yeah i i don't think they they have a law here for ah for ah not smoking 

365.52 376.59 A: yeah i think new york city is fairly unusual it's one of the few places in the united states where you have this smoking ban but needless to say now that i'm not a smoker i really appreciate it 

376.00 380.46 B: yeah [laughter] i wish [laughter] i wish they passed that law here too 

376.77 377.70 A: [laughter] 

379.07 380.82 A: doesn't bother me at all 

380.91 389.15 B: yeah 'cause a lot of people even um in areas where they're not supposed to smoke they always ah sneak a cigarette or something they go in the bathroom and smoke [mn] 

388.54 397.24 A: yeah it was it's particularly terrible when the person sitting next to you is smoking and the smoke is going your way that's particularly terrible 

394.96 396.31 B: (( yeah )) 

397.11 408.16 B: yeah that's what happen to me when like if i'm in the room my mother she has she'll have she'll smoke a cigarette but she has the fan on and the smoke seems like it follows me it goes right by yeah and i 

405.23 407.28 A: oh yeah that could be bad 

407.34 411.70 A: and it's especially bad if it's the summertime and you and you're in a hot place 

411.83 415.16 A: the smoke then seems even worse than in the wintertime 

414.88 416.68 B: yeah [laughter] 

415.84 418.74 A: but i don't know why exactly it just seems that way 

419.86 421.59 B: yeah she um 

421.81 425.77 B: even though they went up on the cigarette prices she just found a cheaper brand to smoke 

426.72 430.37 A: but it still must be fairly expensive in california isn't it 

429.79 438.88 B: yeah but um she she goes to the cigarette store and um for a carton of ah scenic one oh one menthol one hundred she only pays nineteen ninety nine 

432.88 433.72 A: yeah 

439.85 442.39 A: [noise] a carton of one hundred for twenty dollars 

442.05 448.32 B: no um scenic one oh one menthol the the cigarettes yeah she gets a carton for nineteen ninety nine 

444.51 445.50 A: right 

448.94 453.68 A: okay i'm pretty a carton is ah as i recall ten packs right 

453.07 454.22 B: yes 

453.93 455.99 A: yeah so that's like two dollars ar pack 

455.50 456.66 B: yes 

456.16 467.49 A: yeah i'm not sure what the current price is in new york city but the taxes have gone up tremendously and i believe someone told me recently that you can't really get a pack of anything in new york for less than about four dollars now 

461.40 462.30 B: uh-huh 

467.19 469.14 B: yeah so yeah they 

468.39 470.30 A: which is really incredible 

470.09 475.94 B: yeah they they have cigarettes for four but she found somewhere cheaper where she can buy 'em off brand 

476.21 482.55 A: yeah well what some people do in new york is that they get cigarettes from out of the state where taxes are cheaper 

481.88 483.18 B: yeah 

483.19 488.34 A: but if you're a heavy smoker in new york city you spend a fortune ah supporting your habit 

488.34 490.87 B: yeah she she buys a a 

490.96 494.32 B: like carton ah i think every 

494.83 499.73 B: week or every ah wee- every ah almost every two weeks 

499.20 501.52 A: well how much does she s- smoke in a day 

501.77 509.48 B: ah sometime sometimes she's smoking a cigarette and without even knowing she's lighting another one i mean one is already lit 

502.76 503.99 A: a pack 

507.91 510.94 A: oh so she's really got a serious problem there 

510.17 513.50 B: ye- yeah yeah i'm really concerned 

513.14 516.92 A: yeah you have reason to be that's really ba- ah bad 

516.28 518.32 B: yeah 'cause you know her 

518.33 523.05 B: her it was her mother that passed my grandmother from smoking cigarettes 

522.33 524.31 A: so that's especially bad 

523.71 525.57 B: yeah and she had asthma too 

525.99 530.24 B: and it and it went to lungs and from her lungs it went right to her brain 

527.84 528.93 A: yeah 

530.52 534.87 A: does ah the smoking make asthma worse i don't know about that i'm not sure 

534.72 539.05 B: um she wasn't supposed to smoking but she would sneak 'em yeah 

536.81 540.85 A: oh really okay so in other words it added to the risk of of asthma 

540.35 542.05 B: (( yeah )) 

541.74 548.88 A: yeah it's amazing people even if they know it's terrible for their health somehow they can't control themselves and they continue to smoke 

548.30 552.33 B: yeah and i don't understand that and i'm i'm scared for her 

552.06 554.47 A: yeah no i agree with you 

554.42 556.19 B: yeah and um 

556.35 562.20 B: [lipsmack] um and and i'm afraid too because i i'm around and then like that's like second hand smoke 

562.92 566.27 A: yeah which supposedly is is rather dangerous 

565.74 567.10 B: yeah 

567.76 573.22 A: at first i didn't believe it but i guess the scientists scientific evidence is must be accurate 

573.71 575.58 B: ye- and i guess f- 

576.19 582.50 B: when i'm talking i'm [mn] well okay wait when i'm talking and it comes in i think i'm breathing it in 

582.17 583.22 A: yeah 

582.59 586.88 B: and and then it goes into my lungs because i'm coughing i'm cough- 

587.45 590.00 A: oh so second hand smoke makes you cough 

587.70 588.50 B: (( [mn] )) 

589.41 590.77 B: (( yeah )) 

590.15 594.45 A: yeah see that it it it hurts my eyes but it doesn't actually make me cough 

594.20 599.89 B: yeah it does that to me too and it makes me sick i can't be in the room or or the car with the windows rol-
