53.34 55.73 B: where you can smoke inside i guess 

55.24 63.76 A: yeah probably huh i don't think there was yeah 'cause when i i was out in california a couple of years ago and we couldn't believe we couldn't we found actually two bars on uh 

56.20 57.70 B: yeah 

64.87 68.05 A: on uh [sigh] oh it was near hermosa beach i guess 

67.93 71.14 B: oh hermosa i used i just moved from manhattan beach 

68.50 69.70 A: [laughter] 

70.31 76.09 A: we we were down there for a trade show i can't remember where we were but you know we were not running along one of the boardwalks 

76.54 82.22 A: and we di- oh yeah because we were their office is near hermosa beach and i was staying on the in a motel right on the beach 

81.73 82.83 B: right 

82.37 87.21 A: and we were trying to find a place and that's right when they had passed it too it was probably like four years ago now 

86.58 88.19 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

87.30 92.41 A: and uh we found one bar that was there that you could still smoke in but i think it was just because 

92.78 97.04 A: they were gonna get fined [laughter] [laughter] 

92.90 105.54 B: right yeah right right exactly you know it's funny a lotta people there's some bars where uh you can smoke inside even though it's against the law and it is like a total attractor for people like people are like oh we can smoke inside there let's go there tonight 

105.18 106.15 A: [laughter] 

105.41 110.19 B: 'cause they like the fact that you don't have to go outside to smoke and feel like an outcast 

109.70 116.41 A: well that's exac- i'm a smoker um like n- i'd like to quit but i'm not quitting right now 

111.55 112.97 B: i am too 

115.88 116.98 B: (( huh huh )) 

116.69 123.63 A: and yeah i mean i'm a pretty polite smoker i don't you know if somebody's sitting down outside i don't go plop next to them and smoke you know 

122.71 124.83 B: right right 

123.75 128.09 A: but you still get uh such crap from people [laughter] 

127.37 142.24 B: yeah oh i know people will just make the biggest deal you know and you and i think there should be a compromise you know if you're not blowing it in their face and you've found your own area then i think you've done enough i don't think people need to make a special trip up to you and say oh would you please put that out you know 

128.36 129.90 A: [laughter] 

136.24 137.04 A: right 

141.80 143.81 A: or they make little snide remarks 

143.32 145.06 B: right exactly 

144.23 157.16 A: but so i don't know if well i haven't been i'm going into boston in about two weeks so i'm gonna have to see what happens whether everybody's hanging around 'cause the worst thing is when people hang around the outside of the doors then you everybody has to walk through it 

156.48 158.37 B: right right 

157.16 161.67 A: and i agree i don't like the smell of it either i mean it gets it is pretty gross at times 

159.23 162.99 B: right right true true 

161.87 171.55 A: and if there's fifteen people standing outside a place i do go to one place up the road in the town next to me that you can't smoke in 'cause most of the restaurants and bars you can't smoke in around here 

170.67 172.62 B: right right 

171.70 181.54 A: or they have weird laws that you can only smoke starting at eight o'clock at night or ten o'clock at night [laughter] i got caught with that one a while ago 

177.55 179.25 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

181.04 187.01 B: do do they fine the the just the restaurant or do they fine the individual person who's smoking inside there 

186.01 193.93 A: i think they fine the restaurant i would think oh jesus they'd be making a killing if they fine [laughter] 

188.06 189.15 B: (( i )) 

192.06 197.99 B: know it you know it would be like jay walking tickets they could just hand them out everywhere and make lots of money off the people 

195.95 210.17 A: [laughter] well as long as they pay i don't know i think i'd put up a fight about paying that one [laughter] [laughter] but yeah it's when this i got it's a nice restaurant it's a nice bar and restaurant no smoking good food you know good music 

201.08 204.41 B: yeah yeah [laughter] 

209.79 210.96 B: right 

210.30 222.81 A: but if you walk in the front entrance with the where the porch is you would just be fumigated with the smell because people all hang out there and smoke and it is kinda gross and of course it's the front of the building too 

216.72 217.78 B: uh-huh 

222.41 223.71 B: (( right )) 

222.88 228.17 A: and people drive in and all you see is a bunch of smokers [laughter] hanging out on the porch [laughter] 

225.20 229.83 B: yeah yeah and then like they turn right around and go down the street 

228.51 231.02 A: [laughter] this is like a healthy place 

230.48 233.40 B: [laughter] right right it's funny 

231.74 237.53 A: [laughter] but it is kinda i mean i agree it's gross it costs too much money it's way too expensive nowadays 

237.03 240.01 B: yeah it's true do you guys have the big tax out there 

239.38 242.23 A: uh it's went up to like five something a pack 

241.54 243.30 B: yeah that's what we have too 

242.75 256.79 A: yeah so but i can go up to new hampshire though and that's what i do i'm only twenty minutes from the border fifty the border so you buy a carton of cigarettes down here and it's gonna cost you i don't know thirty four something like that no it's gonna cost you more than that i think it comes to like forty something odd dollars 

246.61 247.86 B: oh okay 

256.13 257.16 B: right 

256.75 264.10 A: i never buy cartons down here but in new hampshire i still can get a carton of something of something you know like your basic ultra light it's not a marlboro but a basic cigarette 

263.60 264.59 B: right 

264.27 267.47 A: i could get a carton for twenty four twenty five dollars 

266.89 268.00 B: uh-huh 

267.67 271.94 A: so [mn] you know i can still drive up there and get them so that's what i do [laughter] 

270.78 279.87 B: right right see me i have to go i have a four hour drive down to mexico if i want to get the cheap cigarettes and even then it's you know mexican tobacco it's you know there's 

276.09 277.08 A: oh god [mn] 

278.87 281.20 A: have you tried it through the web yet 

280.61 282.20 B: sorry no i haven't 

281.84 290.19 A: i saw it they i went up to a website and they do you can get you can get the name brands way cheaper i don't know i don't think the shipping was too much 

288.25 289.45 B: wow 

289.93 291.34 B: that's cool 

290.67 295.24 A: yeah so you can but even though you should be quitting anyway [laughter] 

293.21 302.15 B: yeah we'll check that out you know the high price of cigarettes is a total deterrent 'cause i don't n- smoke nearly as much as i used to before they had that huge tax that was enacted 

301.41 305.80 A: (( well i started smoker cheaper generic brands [laughter] i )) 

304.46 311.56 B: yeah i mean that's the way to go it's the only way you know so they forced us to do it yeah [noise] it's true 

307.75 309.92 A: mean they all have additives anyway 

310.49 315.08 A: so unless you get the ones without additives and those are from uh england and canada 

314.35 319.48 B: [noise] yeah uh what is the deal with that like isn't it winston that has the no bull campaign out there 

319.12 325.81 A: with no additives yeah supposedly there they do have one out there but i haven't try i mean you know at this point 

319.95 321.72 B: yeah no additives 

325.95 333.63 A: if you've been smoking for that many years i don't think switching to a cigarette that doesn't have any is really gonna i don't know maybe it would 

331.53 332.55 B: yeah 

333.09 334.12 B: right 

333.71 336.81 A: but uh i don't know i've tried the patches and stuff 

336.54 337.82 B: oh have you 

337.28 338.55 A: yeah oh yeah 

337.92 339.76 B: do they work at all or no 

339.36 344.64 A: i i quit for about six months when i used the patches and they probably would've worked but i kinda let myself 

345.56 347.69 A: talk myself back into smoking again 

346.76 348.61 B: right right yeah 

347.78 353.98 A: you know i got tiffy about something [laughter] 

349.58 359.54 B: [laughter] have you used uh any other like uh quitting methods beside the patch any gum or anything like that 

358.29 364.64 A: i i these are i tried the gum years ago i didn't like that i had quit for eight months before and i think that was using 

360.94 362.04 B: really
