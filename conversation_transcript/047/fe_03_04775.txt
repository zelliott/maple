9.10 10.49 A: is this better 

11.29 12.57 B: (( ah no )) 

12.59 20.01 A: hold on a minute let me change i've got a i've a got another phone i'll change and see if that's see if that's any better 

17.17 18.05 B: okay 

19.46 20.59 B: all righty 

24.78 25.49 A: (( [noise] )) 

25.72 27.35 A: can you hear me better now 

27.70 30.72 B: um no can you hear all that static 

30.32 32.63 A: yeah i hear a lot of static 

32.02 35.07 B: yeah 'cause i didn't even hear what the topic was 

34.82 47.82 A: oh okay they said the topic was ah smoking bans whether we agree with 'em or not and whether we like ah what what we think about smoking education commercials and things like that [noise] 

46.91 47.82 B: okay 

48.74 63.58 A: i ah i i don't i don't think we should s- ban smoking in all public areas in some areas i would understand things like ah coliseums or ah big venues for concerts or things like that i would i would be ah ah 

63.70 67.14 A: for smoking bans and things like movie theaters 

67.14 71.15 B: yeah i agree i i think that people should be able to breathe 

71.30 80.83 B: ah smoke free air but then i think people should be able to smoke somewhere as well you know it's kind of a we've everybody should have their rights 

80.30 83.54 A: i agree with you i i agree completely ah 

83.39 88.75 A: you know i i don't smoke myself ah other than an occasional cigar on the porch but 

88.58 102.45 A: you know i think if i wanted to go out to a restaurant and i want to enjoy a cigarette afterwards i would go a a a a restaurant that per- ah that permitted smoking but if i didn't wanna smoke i'd got to a restaurant i knew that wasn't wasn't a a smoking venue 

96.97 98.36 B: (( yep )) 

102.15 114.68 B: yep i actually i do smoke and i have always been called a respectful smoker i do not smoke until about six o'clock or six thirty when i'm heading home in the evening 

114.89 119.68 B: i don't have one in the morning i don't have any at work and i wait until the evening so 

119.72 133.12 B: 'cause i i don't like the smell and i just i don't think it's the most professional thing in the world but what i do in my own time that's okay and i agree with the restaurant i will if there's a restaurant that's non smoking 

133.27 136.23 B: i might go to it 'cause i don't have to have a cigarette 

136.64 138.12 B: (( but )) 

137.91 151.96 B: you know i think that they should offer it in most places if if a place wants to be smoke free that's fine let 'em but i don't think that there should be any kind of legislative acts for every single place 

152.09 166.40 A: i agree with you i think we're getting too far along the road of the nanny government where they make all the decisions for us i i think that we have free will and in a free society we can make the decisions we we want and ah we can 

165.52 166.63 B: (( yep )) 

166.35 167.90 A: you know i i 

167.03 169.31 B: what what part of the country are you in 

168.74 171.76 A: i'm in the i'm the south i'm in alabama 

171.28 174.67 B: okay i'm in kentucky so yeah 

172.50 173.50 A: are you 

173.92 183.07 A: i ah ah i tell you i i i think that if more smokers were like you and like i said i smoke ah cigars and i'm like you i'll smoke 'em out on the porch 

182.75 183.70 B: (( yeah )) 

182.94 190.81 A: where i know i won't that i won't offend anybody but if if people were respectful smokers like you i don't think we'd have any problems at all 

190.36 201.04 B: yeah we have a i travel out to california quite a bit on business and it's absolutely crazy out there that you can't find a place to smoke 

201.36 215.14 B: and it's kind of funny 'cause i always i mean in you know there might be a ten storey hotel and only half of one storey is smoking which that's fine but it you know at least they offer it 

215.05 228.07 B: but they're i always stay in the same hotel now because there's a bar that i can walk to in about three minutes that has a cigar room where you can smoke cigarettes as well 

228.36 233.67 B: but it's the only one i i of all my friends that live out there 

233.71 240.32 B: no one knows any other places you you have to go outside in every bar and i think you know i just think that's a little crazy 

239.93 248.97 A: ah i do too because i i believe that if li- like you're saying i and i've been to cigar bars before and i enjoyed that i think if you 

248.96 251.05 A: know if that if a bar 

251.04 260.83 A: advertised the fact that they are smoker friendly that the people that go there know what they're going there for and the people that don't want it th- they won't show up you know 

257.94 258.68 B: yep 

260.10 261.16 B: yeah 

260.72 271.98 A: i i i can i ah agree with you completely and i'm a little surprised to be honest with you said you were able to find anywhere you could smoke in california from from all the news i'm hearing about that 

271.36 273.26 B: yeah it's actually 

273.32 276.18 B: it's its own little separate room 

276.47 278.98 B: and i mean it's 

278.77 285.11 B: you know it it's got a door that closes behind it and there's just a little just a window where you can go to order your drinks 

285.12 296.69 B: you can order them from inside the smoking room so ususally when i go there they've got t._v.s in there and some you know couches and it's a it's a nice little room it's a very tiny it's probably got ah 

297.30 307.99 B: ten little like two person tables in it and a couch and a couple of lounge or not lounge chairs but real big leather comfortable chairs and um 

305.91 307.20 A: yeah 

308.29 319.32 B: you know and and the funny thing is is some of the nights when i go out there there'll be about fifteen or twenty of us in that room and there'll be maybe five or six people out in the other section 

319.60 327.05 A: [laughter] i i tell you i a lot of times i think that that's that's more the the rule than the exception because i think that there 

326.96 338.78 A: there are a lot of people that would like to be able to enjoy their night out they just don't have any any place they can do it like look at new york city the way that mayor bloomenthal has waged the war against smoking there he 

338.76 347.93 A: ah some of the restaurants there they're running him out of business because said they're not gonna go out and smoke a cigarette after they've finished their meal if they can't smoke at the table they just won't go 

347.69 348.91 B: yep 

348.39 358.10 A: and you know i i tell you i'm just all about personal choice i i don't like the all these bans and all these prohibitions on everything 

357.94 359.27 B: yeah 

358.86 360.70 A: i i think that they 

360.74 372.83 A: i think that we had enough education i believe people are pretty ah pretty up on the dangers of smoking and the hazards of smoking i i don't know if if all these public service announcements and all the ah 

372.86 377.22 A: all the education does much good 

376.68 383.86 B: yeah it's um i think we do need to keep it in in the minds of very young kids but 

384.68 396.19 B: i don't know it it's there is good there is good publicity against smoking but there's also a lot of bad out there that i don't think does any good so they need to be real specific 

396.33 398.67 B: um i was actually i got a 

398.70 412.03 B: a call the other night it was somebody asking about cigarettes and and the training and all this good stuff and i said you know make sure that it gets to the to the youth of america and and it's a really powerful message 

412.10 415.88 B: you know the things that you're saying some of 'em when they're say oh it's got 

416.05 423.69 B: all these toxins and all this good stuff in it you know that's that's a good start but maybe they need to 

424.24 438.65 B: actually show more pictures 'cause i know i'm almost forty i know when i was a kid they they weren't afraid to you know show us pictures of black lung and you know the real lungs the things that that should really scare you 

439.28 446.29 A: now you know that that is a good point i'm forty four and i'm like you i can remember in school i think it was in 

446.22 456.31 A: in health and or something like that i do remember them showing us pictures of of the black lung from smoking now i i think you're right i i think if you ah 

456.08 466.21 A: and i agree with you that the children are the ones that we need to target because i think that's the that's the ah growing ah majority of smokers now and if we target if we 

466.01 471.17 A: educate them smartly and and give them facts i think i do agree with that you know 

470.42 471.63 B: yeah 

471.12 482.62 A: and and i th- and thinking about it i think you're right i think they ought to if they're not doing it they ought to bring back showing pictures of things like that the real effects of it where where cause maybe some of the kids will think about it 

482.22 490.84 B: yeah they ah you know i'm an adult if i wanna quit i will if i if somebody tells me it's gonna hurt me i know it and you know i haven't quit yet so 

491.02 494.72 B: i i have cut down but that's just because i wanted to 

495.06 499.82 B: and it's getting expensive to smoke but you know with ah 

499.79 510.21 B: with the kids if we can get those messages across i think sometimes the commercials that you'll see there'll be those they'll show a cartoon character that takes a drag of a cigarette and he turns green 

509.87 511.27 A: [laughter] that's right 

510.61 514.54 B: that's stupid show me somebody that's got a black 

514.58 520.10 B: rotten lung you know and i think political correctness is really 

520.21 529.68 B: that's another topic in itself but it's it's gone a little over the deep end bring back some of those things when we were kids that were scare tactics and you know i i 

530.42 533.49 B: i think that's where we need to target it i think we need to be 

533.72 542.14 B: much more upfront about it and you know as for teaching adults you know we're gonna do whatever we wanna do anyway 

542.58 556.42 A: now now that is right ah i i i'm like you i think adults can make their own decisions ah we have enough information and and i agree with let's let's target the children and the kids the the young teenagers because 

556.37 562.35 A: they're the ones that think it's cool and and they may they may not understand all of the all of the ah 

562.60 575.08 A: ramifications of smoking and and then like you said the way they put all the taxes on cigarettes man if you've got somebody that's a real heavy smoker i'm not sure they can they can afford smoking anymore 

574.59 578.30 B: yep i know with my ah my stepdaughter 

578.83 584.98 B: she when she lived with us she's moved out she's grown up now and when she lived with us she'd 

584.92 599.89 B: you know we wouldn't smoke in the house we wouldn't do anything like that but when she grew up and moved out on her own and she always said she would never be a smoker well now she smokes and that's what i was talking about being an adult she made up her mind you know but we all
