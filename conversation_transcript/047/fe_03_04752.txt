295.40 306.57 A: um with the blazer it's like there are some people that really get into it and like put big four hundred you know four hundreds in those blazers which is a really hard thing to do 'cause if you've ever seen one like there's not much room in there at all 

300.78 301.83 B: mhm 

306.21 307.22 B: yeah 

306.58 307.45 A: you know

328.60 333.93 A: mhm yeah me you know i i've i don't have that much money so i can't you know do that much 

328.98 329.56 B: (( oh )) 

332.56 335.72 B: oh [laughter] it's [laughter] it's not like you 

334.82 337.27 A: i do what i can yeah [laughter] 

337.35 345.26 A: basically what all all i'm putting in mine i'm going to put a three point four in there it's a basically bored out two point eight ro- what was in there so it's going to bolt right in 

344.96 346.08 B: mhm 

345.34 352.26 A: it's going to be really easy i was going to do a three fifty but i don't have the time or the money for that there's i know a guy who's done it you know 

352.40 353.67 B: yeah 

353.78 361.80 A: so anyhow it's it's a big job a really big job i had to change the computer and everything in it and just really a pain with all the wires and what not from go to 

361.95 363.92 A: followed by the carburetor you know 

363.63 364.65 B: (( uh-huh )) 

364.03 365.98 A: that's that's a pain right there 

365.93 367.17 B: (( yeah that's )) 

367.24 369.87 B: tearing all that stuff back down and 

367.27 368.70 A: computers 

369.27 383.71 A: yeah see like with the lincoln you know that would be pretty easy with the wiring but with this blazer it's like a eighty seven i got now i used to have a eighty eight but i sold it um it's like it's got a computer in there and everything so it's like really pain in the butt you know to work on putting an engine there 

372.56 373.79 B: mhm 

383.54 385.92 A: unless it's you know from the factory 

385.32 387.96 B: (( well are you shade tree mechanic or )) 

388.36 389.44 A: am i what 

389.09 392.47 B: a shade they call them here shade tree mechanics 

392.41 395.48 A: what's that just like [mn] do my own time 

394.12 399.06 B: uh do doing your own uh repair work on your cars 

398.44 408.66 A: yeah mostly unless it's something major like when i had when i took the engine out of this blazer i'm ordering an engine from florida actually is where i'm getting it and you know up in idaho you know it's [laughter] going to be a while before i get it 

408.86 409.80 A: (( but i don't )) 

409.95 417.57 A: know when we took the engine out i couldn't do it myself and we had uh a mechanic do it [mn] we had to lift the body off a the frame to get the engine out 

417.19 418.76 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

418.19 421.41 A: took him like seven hours it's not a small job 

420.97 422.66 B: i know [laughter] 

421.42 426.88 A: so that's something i couldn't do and we had to use a lift you know i mean we had to use all the shop equipment there 

426.47 427.67 B: (( uh-huh oh )) 

427.69 435.93 A: so like if i do any work like i do at the shop you know because my uncle owns a shop so it's pretty nice you know i just get free use of the shop anytime i want 

435.90 440.46 B: well around here they just pull 'em up on the oak tree and [laughter] throw a chain acr- 

438.80 440.23 A: [laughter] 

440.60 444.81 B: across a limb and go from there 

443.41 444.72 A: [laughter] 

444.77 456.02 A: yeah there's a few people that do that around here too but you know but you know the fact i got free access to the shop and all the equipment and all the air tools and what not it's kind of nice makes [mn] things a lot easier 

453.45 454.77 B: mhm 

456.35 457.51 A: that's for sure 

457.64 461.33 A: like we had to replace the clutch on there a while ago and my other 

461.50 464.99 A: i have an automatic and i used to have a five speed an eighty eight 

464.66 465.77 B: (( uh-huh )) 

465.19 469.36 A: and replacing the clutch and that was a big job we you know we had to take out 

469.51 472.51 A: everything the the whole drive tree components 

471.99 473.25 B: yeah 

472.76 476.36 A: the transmission everything had to come out and it took quite a few hours 

477.04 481.25 A: it was a big job i put a big clutch in there so it's going to last a while 

481.56 487.67 B: well that's good [mn] i had a friend that had a seventy eight g._m._c. truck and i 

487.71 498.60 B: we couldn't keep the tran- he couldn't keep the transmission in it and i mean i bet i put three pressure plates in to help him put three pressure plates in it 

490.68 492.19 A: [laughter] 

496.16 497.01 A: mhm 

499.01 503.19 B: and when he can chew well they he would tear the gears out of the 

503.31 509.68 A: [laughter] yeah you see that's afraid 'cause the way i bought this blazer i got it for four hundred bucks 

504.09 505.12 B: [laughter] 

509.88 514.67 A: um about four hundred bucks i i didn't the engine was ruined in there he thought you know [mn] 

514.64 521.69 A: i got three cylinders work but two other cylinders had you know cracked um well actually they were all the way broken piston rods 

521.36 522.37 B: mhm 

521.66 530.86 A: and [mn] you know we took it out we first thought it might just be a head gasket you know we was hoping we took it out we looked at it the piston rods the thing was ruined but i got it four hundred bucks 

531.54 539.26 A: and but i guess the guy totally tore it apart all over it's only had ninety thousand miles on it which you know really isn't much for that condition the engine was in 

539.21 542.35 B: no uh-huh no for that model anyway 

539.59 542.36 A: but yeah it's really not 

542.18 556.71 A: yeah and the guy said it had holes all over through the exhaust they just ruined the crap out of that thing so i'm hoping the transmission is all right i drove it in you know even though the engine was shaking a lot 'cause you know the three cylinders kind of makes it shake a little bit you know this 

555.40 556.28 B: yeah 

556.87 566.09 A: but it shifted it seemed to shift fine but i'm just afraid i might have to buy a new transmission soon because of how they treated it i just hope i'm getting a shift gear for it 

562.21 565.72 B: [noise] well have you tried did you try the 

565.80 570.77 B: uh motor mounts different type motor mount on the rear 

571.29 576.47 A: well actually i don't think it's the motor mounts because like i said it's three cylinders but you know 

574.77 575.75 B: uh-huh 

576.30 591.29 A: we'll we'll put the new three point four in there [mn] and we'll probably change everything you know just like totally redo the whole thing but um i just like i said you know we're going to look at the transmission make sure it's all right 'cause i don't know i don't want to spend mi- money for another transmission really when i 

581.87 582.98 B: (( uh-huh )) 

591.12 599.89 A: don't need to because ninety thousand miles you know that's not much on transmission on an automatic at least but i know i'm hoping it's all right but they just the hell out 

596.29 597.56 B: (( no uh ))
