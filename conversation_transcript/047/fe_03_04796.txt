57.10 67.04 B: i used to go i used to go to bars when i was younger you know and that was synonymous with smoking i just think it's hysterical now because you walk by you see all these places

87.76 97.56 A: i mean there's no point in smoking inside it really makes it a problem for me when i'm there and when i'm in there um i don't know if you go to bars but i go and

97.64 98.75 A: okay 

99.64 110.31 A: right well i'll go to a bar and now it's much more pleasant there's no you know there's n- someone's cigarette smoke isn't like billowing under my nose and uh

113.69 124.29 A: [laughter] no actually uh no i well i haven't been in bars for that long like uh in in any particular time like i used to myself but 

124.42 134.29 A: but even for a short time though even if it was just a short time i'd go into a bar have one or two drinks and then leave i'd smell my clothes stinking away 

133.08 136.13 B: oh i know it was it was terrible it was terrible 

135.88 137.45 A: (( yeah )) 

136.45 140.33 B: i know but what did they ask about something what the cancer society i mean i don't 

139.84 140.41 A: (( [sigh] )) 

140.57 152.07 B: i i didn't quite get all of that you know i i know they said that about not smoking in public places but do you think it should be ba- i mean you know i remember it's we i used to be able to smoke at work and now 

146.11 147.14 A: right 

152.24 165.41 B: they s- you know i used to people would leave work and i would be there overtime and i'd be able to take out my ashtray and smoke you know now and i remember when they stopped here in the city you know when they said you can't smoke in the office anymore 

159.35 161.73 A: [laughter] 

162.97 164.06 A: (( oh right )) 

165.42 169.75 B: and i was still smoking at that time so i had to stop you know and [mn] and i said 

168.95 172.86 A: and it was an inconvenience for you i mean and that was kinda like 

170.99 185.19 B: well no i w- i was sneaking out into the um shaft way you know where the air vents are and i would be smoking there me and all the other smokers you know until they caught on you know that they found cigarette butts all because people were so stupid 

180.01 181.27 A: right 

183.21 186.00 A: [laughter] 

185.25 195.62 B: they were so stupid they wouldn't realize don't do that you know hey put your cigarette in the garbage don't leave it on the floor no no that sucks it's easier to put it on the floor you know 

187.45 188.75 A: right 

193.39 194.84 A: right 

195.48 201.95 A: well i think i think the the streets will be a little more dirtier i mean there'll be a lot more cigarette butts on the floor 

202.00 207.19 A: uh because there's no ashtrays they won't have unless they put ashtrays outside i don't know what they've done 

205.29 217.80 B: well some guys some co- some places are i happen to live in a neighborhood where there's a lot of restaurants and some of them are putting in a big pot like huge uh vases with sand in them 

210.97 212.46 A: oh really 

217.95 226.32 B: and yeah so i have a feeling that maybe that will be okay you know i mean i i don't really i don't really know i mean i don't 

217.97 219.23 A: oh that's good 

225.32 238.02 A: well you know if it curbs if it curbs somebody else from smo- i mean smoking is dangerous that's just we know we know that already it's been proven it's bad actually my mom died of lung cancer 

230.41 233.41 B: well it's been proven well it's been proven 

237.66 239.26 B: really 

238.66 246.95 A: so it's one of those things that i you know i'm i'm i'm you know i'm not gonna tell someone i can say look don't smoke but i'm not gonna be i'm not 

239.49 240.34 B: oh 

246.97 252.87 A: you know adamant about it but at the same time you know in my in my house in my um 

248.36 249.17 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

252.94 266.16 A: [lipsmack] in my car if you're gonna smoke just be just tell me look i i need to smoke well stop you know you can have your cigarette just don't include me in your secondhand smoke that's all i mean that's that's pretty convenient 

263.91 268.95 B: well i remember i mean my mother died of emphysema which is you know pretty serious and 

268.40 270.57 A: yeah yeah 

269.10 270.49 B: and um 

270.40 284.19 B: i i i feel bad about it now because i remember i didn't smoke in her presence but i used to go in the kitchen or open the window and smoke there and she used to come alongside me and yell at me why are you smoking and she'd stay there and scream at me all the time 

280.99 282.74 A: [laughter] 

284.03 285.58 A: yeah 

284.15 289.26 B: and now i realize that probably she was catching some of that smoke too you know [lipsmack] so i feel 

288.07 296.85 A: yeah well you you know there is there i- there was a long period when no one knew or maybe everybody they they didn't advertise 'em a- as much or 

296.78 306.27 A: m- whatever the case so there there's a lot of people who just didn't know but now we know and so there's no ex- i don't see an excuse to do it continually and you know 

305.04 313.35 B: mm but you know what's very sad i see young people and i'm talking young i mean i'm talking about teenagers i don't know how they get the cigarettes in the first place 

309.21 310.29 A: (( m- yeah )) 

313.26 314.28 A: yeah 

313.26 324.67 B: i mean you're supposed to be twenty one and i've owned the stores and i mean i if used uh the you know they mean it pretty much they won't sell you a pack of cigarettes at seven dollars a pack i mean you know let's face it 

323.84 327.61 A: [laughter] it's not cheap that's for sure 

325.02 330.03 B: i mean i stopped smoking i stopped smoking when it wa- went up to three fifty 

329.86 331.77 A: yeah yeah 

330.91 340.37 B: and that was it i said forget about it goodbye charlie but um but i see these young people and [mn] i don't understand where they're getting the money for the cigarettes 

340.07 344.21 A: [laughter] well the allowances are all bigger i'm sure of that 

341.18 345.57 B: (( no no no i i don't understand where they're even getting the cigarettes )) 

345.29 346.82 A: yeah 

345.62 350.99 B: i mean if nobody's selling to them where are they getting them probably on the on the on the uh internet 

351.10 356.62 B: 'cause they you know if they just go on the internet and have cigarettes delivered uh they were trying to stop that but that that can happen 

356.56 370.72 A: [sigh] oh absolutely i think uh the they're easily gotten i don't think it's a big problem uh i mean as far as getting them the thing is also you can have a friend of yours who's you know twenty one let's say or what's the legal age to buy cigarettes now 

369.97 371.32 B: oh it's twenty one 

371.15 382.43 A: twenty one so if you're if you're eigh- eighteen or you know or you're you're brother's twenty one he gets you your cigarettes and you turn on your sixteen year old friends you know that's how it goes 

371.87 373.16 B: just like drinking 

381.61 382.46 B: (( mhm mhm mm )) 

382.45 386.75 A: um if i remember you know when i used to smoke um you know 

386.78 394.96 A: it was just always like that you know if i couldn't get them there were some places that wouldn't sell to you either when i was younger but um 

394.54 398.85 B: [mn] i don't remember how i got cigarettes i know i was smoking young when i was younger 

398.78 405.32 B: but i don't remember i don't remember i i always looked older i think and i don't think i had any problems getting cigarettes i think it was 

405.14 415.07 B: it was a sign you were an adult if you could get cigarettes even though you weren't i think you know and i guess i must have just passed that test but i don't remember having any problem getting cigarettes 

412.12 413.18 A: (( [laughter] sure )) 

414.68 415.89 A: yeah 

415.10 419.01 B: in fact i don't even remember having any problems getting a drink when i well it wasn't a problem 

417.69 421.87 A: [laughter] that's right drinks weren't a problem either 

421.59 428.90 B: (( well no you were eigh- eighteen you know so f- no no between the between the two i [cough] i with all that stuff when i was younger )) 

423.35 424.54 A: yeah 

428.73 429.73 A: right 

429.15 431.76 B: not any more though i'm afraid [laughter] 

430.48 431.48 A: (( no )) 

431.87 440.84 A: now they did ask us something i i know t- about the smoking ban but oh i think it was the advertisements about um anti smoking maybe 

440.92 446.66 A: if they're working at all or well it guess it comes down to teenagers how 

445.89 446.71 B: well 

446.82 460.51 B: i guess yeah i know what you're gonna say i agree with you there but i you know what i feel i really feel that um with this ban on the cigarettes here in in the city especially and i live in manhattan so you know i mean it's like 

450.66 451.68 A: (( mm yeah )) 

457.54 458.54 A: yeah 

458.86 460.59 A: right 

460.46 462.81 B: i think eventually people are gonna stop 

463.03 464.56 B: (( i mean i would've thought they )) 

463.22 465.71 A: well i think it's good yeah 

464.79 467.88 B: i wouldn't you have thought that at seven bucks a pack 

467.94 469.12 B: i mean not 

468.20 470.14 A: people would stop right 

469.09 479.93 B: yeah i mean not everybody makes a hundred thousand dollars a year you know i mean let's face it that's a lotta money i mean and they're talking about a lousy economy going out to buy cigarettes that cost seven bucks and how much 

471.97 473.56 A: no no 

476.66 478.01 A: (( sure [laughter] )) 

479.72 485.18 B: a carton i don't even wanna think about it well no no i have i have i know people who'll go up to the 

485.03 495.54 B: casinos but they're stopping the casinos now not the casinos but the indian places you used to buy cigarettes without paying tax and taxes will be- three dollars a pack on cigarettes 

491.79 492.88 A: right 

495.41 496.68 A: right right 

495.61 499.56 B: and now i understand they're selling it uh in new york the in the in 

499.58 501.17 B: (( [mn] reservations )) 

500.81 502.04 A: mhm 

501.45 505.37 B: they're gonna be 'cause they don't have they have to pay the tax to the to the state 

504.83 506.15 A: oh really 

505.66 511.71 B: yeah so that means they're not gonna be any big uh huge break i mean they'll be some break but not a not a huge break 

511.77 522.48 A: yeah uh i mean i think the i think the advertisements are wor- i mean i i'd like to think that eventually everyone would understand look this is really bad uh for you 

522.71 529.86 A: but then you know you have people who are not gonna listen to that that's just the way it's gonna be i think that it's always gonna people who smoke but i think it's gonna be 

529.73 540.06 A: you know there's gonna be a minority now who are gonna who smoke and people who don't you know it's not gonna be completely eradicated but um you know we can only hope 

538.71 548.31 B: i don't think it's gonna be eradicated at all to be honest with you i mean a- in all these in and all these companies are going out of business supposedly or a- and then you know they just 

541.00 543.25 A: (( no no i don't think so )) 

548.34 561.65 B: um a while ago put a a um a cap on the amount of money you could col- you could collect on a lawsuit so even if you sue because there's you know even though you did smoke and stuff like that 

561.35 562.24 A: right 

561.55 573.36 B: uh th- you're not gonna get that much money so they're they're doing everything they can to keep these big companies going uh they're not going out of business they're not going bankrupt and they've got all of europe to sell to now 

573.36 574.33 A: right 

573.76 578.27 B: if you if you've ever been in europe you would understand that everybody smokes i mean 

575.33 576.37 A: right 

577.57 591.38 A: yeah but even there it's changing a little bit i was just there last year i was two weeks in italy and and there's a little bit of a downgrade of uh people smoking there's still a lot a lot more than we are here but there's uh it's going there too 

589.71 599.89 B: yeah well they but they smoke in restaurants and i mean they smoke all over i mean even in offices i mean i mean no matter where you go everybody's got a cigarette in there i mean it's i mean even
