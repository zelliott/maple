1.73 2.94 A: (( hello )) 

2.11 4.14 B: [noise] hi this is david 

4.09 5.68 A: hi this is philip 

5.71 7.20 B: how's it going 

6.62 9.38 A: not too bad nice to meet you where you from 

9.08 12.46 B: um dulzura over by san diego 

12.48 16.03 A: oh okay i'm on the east coast i'm in philadelphia 

15.45 17.18 B: where i- where's that at 

16.94 18.96 A: uh philadelphia pennsylvania 

18.55 20.64 B: oh philadelphia i couldn't quite hear ya [laughter] 

20.22 26.11 A: yeah that's okay i'm the cellphone sorry about that uh anyway so uh what what's their topic of the day 

26.35 31.08 B: it said uh how do we feel about banning smoking in public places 

30.56 34.96 A: oh you're from san diego right so they're all they're all health freaks over there [noise] mm 

34.62 42.19 B: yeah well they did that um a few years back where you can't smoke in bars or restaurants or or any of those places anymore 

41.97 50.07 A: yeah i'm originally from new york and uh they just they just recently about a month ago passed a similar a similar law 

50.69 53.51 A: um i don't i don't know are you a smoker 

53.64 55.41 B: no are you 

54.59 56.74 A: no i oh you used to be 

56.89 57.89 B: you quit 

57.92 61.22 A: uh no no no i i i've never smoked 

60.66 62.49 B: (( oh i thought you said you used to be )) 

62.11 64.55 A: no i asked you whether you ever did 

64.02 65.73 B: oh no never 

65.60 77.65 A: never yeah so i mean i really couldn't care less care less i mean i think i think um well i mean i think it's good because i guess when i go out to bars or whatever you know i come home you know i'm smelling of smoke all over 

68.17 69.84 B: (( no [laughter] )) 

76.94 78.70 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

77.72 84.78 A: uh you know my clothing you know s- reeks of smoke for the next few days um so i guess in that way it's good 

83.77 87.24 B: [noise] yeah i guess they say you can even get cancer [noise] from secondary smoke so 

87.34 91.60 A: that's true that's true i guess if you're there for a while yeah i mean 

87.49 89.68 B: i guess i guess for a reason 

91.34 92.70 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

92.78 94.05 A: (( i don't know [mn] )) 

94.63 97.27 B: [laughter] that's kinda weird since neither of us smoke 

97.32 100.04 B: not really a priority for us 

99.99 111.73 A: no not not at all i mean uh it's just not it's not a big deal to me i don't know i have some friends though that even though they don't smoke uh they're still very upset at the law because they feel that you know 

100.19 100.78 B: (( [noise] )) 

110.69 111.50 B: [noise] 

111.57 123.35 A: when you're going out to you know a bar or to you know just kind of like a social activity that there's they kind of imagine a place as being you know smoke filled and everything that it just adds to the atmosphere [laughter] 

122.65 129.70 B: right well it's weird because we we live out here and we we don't get cable where we live so we have to get the direct t._v. the satellite 

129.26 130.47 A: oh really [noise] 

130.00 135.63 B: yeah and so we don't get like the local um you know affiliates like a._b._c. n._b._c. c._b._s. 

135.23 136.39 A: right 

135.81 142.03 B: so we get like um we get like actually like the east coast feed so we sometimes watch the new york channels 

141.75 142.84 A: right 

141.88 154.03 B: and and i guess you know sometimes we watch the news and i guess there's like a big you know everybody's all mad about it and b- when it was when it was out here it wasn't that big of a deal at all people just said okay we won't do it [laughter] 

151.38 152.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

153.44 166.35 A: [sigh] well the thing i think the reason that's because is because i think so few people in southern california actually you know still smoke um but in new york you know we have a lot of people who are uh 

166.20 178.70 A: international who come over from overseas and they all still you know smoke a lot so i guess it [noise] it affects uh affects a lot more people over here on the east coast than it does maybe around your area 

172.08 173.28 B: mm 

178.37 180.57 B: yeah yeah that's probably true 

180.84 182.01 B: (( hm )) 

182.30 183.17 A: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

182.93 186.54 B: well my dad was a big smoker but he died of cancer so 

186.81 188.48 A: (( oh did he have lung cancer )) 

188.33 191.24 B: (( yeah so i don't think i'll be taking up smoking any time soon )) 

190.57 199.15 A: [laughter] yeah no i'm sorry to hear that um no i uh i i d- i don't understand why people i mean um 

191.79 192.65 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

199.19 202.91 A: you know i'm a i'm a recent college graduate and so you know 

203.06 211.04 A: the at college a lot of people a lot of people smoked but it was more in terms of like a social thing in terms of they didn't smoke you know 

211.03 212.21 B: right 

211.41 224.72 A: day in day out but when they went out to a bar or whatever they felt like you know if they were drinking then they should you know have a cigarette as well i could never understand it i mean i just don't under- understand why you would wanna inhale smoke into your lungs in the first place on any level [mn] 

223.73 233.99 B: [mn] [laughter] it seems it seems so ridiculous to me you know you're it's gonna kill you eventually but you you know you it's not like you know you you can get anything out of it it's just 

233.23 234.75 A: right right 

234.36 235.84 B: it's ridiculous 

234.77 241.44 A: and it is it is quite ridiculous and um you know it's in in in philadelphia they've 

241.52 253.09 A: they've made it so that it's impossible to uh i mean it's not affordable to smoke either you know 'cause uh the cigarette prices have gone way way up 'cause they keep taxing it 

247.85 249.29 B: (( [laughter] right right right )) 

252.98 259.73 A: um and you know that's that's good in that you know it's becoming more expensive to kill yourself so uh 

258.79 260.98 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

259.55 268.37 A: you know you so people maybe maybe it acts as a deterrent but that's the sort of problematic because you know these people who um 

268.87 273.62 A: [lipsmack] you know a lot of people who are still smoking tend to be uh 

273.65 275.70 A: you know low income people 

275.54 288.80 A: and uh if they don't have a lot of money and they're addicted then it's a problem because they're just spending more and more of their small amount of income on cigarettes instead of you know family needs or their kids' needs or something 

288.34 291.35 B: right right hm 

290.03 296.13 A: so it's a it's a tricky issue over what to what to do to to stop smoking you know i 

296.13 301.63 B: yeah but then on the other hand you know people know what it does so it's what you know it's a free country if they wanna smoke 

301.92 303.35 A: right well i mean 

302.11 305.00 B: there's probably not much you can do to stop 'em right [noise] 

303.91 310.48 A: i i mean i sort of i sort of agree with that but the other thing is is that like it's really a victimless crime you know it's 

310.30 320.74 A: you know it affects it affects people not only you know as you mentioned before the idea of secondhand smoke is a problem but even in public places where there's lots of air or something 

320.59 322.98 A: it also affects you know 

322.79 331.19 A: uh people who don't really you know [mn] are not really in control yet like kids that they see you know coolest people smoking adults smoking 

330.96 339.49 A: then they figure you know then it's acceptable for me to smoke and before they're really old enough to develop a mind of their own they're already smoking and they get hooked 

339.38 344.78 B: right it's almost like that's part of the main reason why people start is 'cause they think it's cool or something 

344.66 350.70 A: right which i mean i think is getting a lot better i think now the idea of like you know smoking is cool is 

350.58 355.96 A: is less of a big idea i mean but i think it's still it's still a problem and um 

355.75 369.91 A: [noise] but i think i think like peer pressure is still you know a big reason why young kids start um i guess if all their friends are doing it but then i feel like you know these kids you know not only do they think it's cool or whatever but they also feel like 

361.23 362.26 B: right 

370.03 379.80 A: they start smoking because you know their parents might do it and they wanna be you know sort of grown up and they wanna act like their parents do and if their parents are smoking then they're gonna do it too [noise] 

379.52 388.65 B: [mn] right right i think it's i think it's good how they they're having those have you seen those commercials where they come out and they're kind of bashing the tobacco industry about 

387.54 389.47 A: oh yeah yeah 

388.90 390.86 B: those are kind of funny i think 

390.49 398.91 A: no they are and they they also have all these billboards and you know like they uh they have this um ad i saw recently with 

398.96 406.79 A: a uh kind of a nineteen fifties style kind of humphrey bogart like type character with a tuxedo um 

407.11 413.62 A: saying to this you know very well dressed woman sort of looking like marilyn monroe and she and the guy says to her 

413.45 422.98 A: uh you know mind if i smoke uh with this kind of cigarette and lighter and the woman responds in the ad like with a bubble saying care if i die 

422.86 426.57 B: [laughter] that gets right to the point huh [sigh] 

425.65 431.87 A: yeah yeah yeah and so i mean i think i think that's uh that's pretty effective um 

432.60 447.12 A: [lipsmack] it's really good and um so i don't i don't know i don't have much more to say about smoking we both kind of agree that uh it's a bad idea and that uh we don't really care if it's banned so you might as well right [laughter] 

438.63 439.97 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

440.41 441.26 B: [laughter] 

445.83 450.31 B: yeah [laughter] i think we're running out of smoking things to talk about [laughter] [laughter] 

449.60 454.34 A: absolutely so uh why why did you choose to uh 

454.42 455.76 A: do this study 

455.54 459.31 B: oh well my wife's into stuff like this so she kinda 

458.77 460.42 A: [laughter] 

459.40 462.92 B: she kinda dragged me [laughter] how about you 

460.59 462.94 A: yeah sure sure 

463.07 476.91 A: um i don't know i figured you know it was interesting to meet you know different people see what their views are i wonder i've never really took the time to figure out what this is all about like i know it's to do with some like linguistics program but i'm not sure what the goal of the study is 

476.75 479.64 A: did you take the time to to read about that 

476.97 477.99 B: yeah 

478.98 483.44 B: no no not at all i've this is only the second one i've done so i'm just kinda 

480.60 482.04 A: (( yeah )) 

482.79 488.34 A: yeah me too me too i mean i did one like months ago or something and uh 

486.52 489.11 B: right that's ex- that's exactly what i did too 

488.65 493.81 A: right right uh well well the thing is that they ask you to list the times when you're available 

493.57 504.08 A: and like i put you know the evening but then of course like i'm never home when they actually call me so like every night you know i usually come home and check my messages and invariably there's you know a message from 

503.93 510.16 A: these linguistics people saying you know if you're willing to accept the call la la la but uh i you know i've just never been around so 

509.75 510.63 B: right 

510.01 520.69 A: you know it's just never worked out so finally i was like all right you know it seemed silly you know you really wanna do one i might as well just give 'em my cellphone number so i gave 'em my cellphone number and so they finally tracked me down 

521.88 524.09 B: yeah plus ten bucks what the heck huh 

523.73 529.47 A: [lipsmack] yeah sure i mean if you're gonna you know be available to talk anyway you might as well collect the ten bucks 

528.95 532.40 B: [laughter] and where'd you go to school at 

530.26 531.45 A: (( yeah so )) 

532.31 536.17 A: um i just graduated from the university of pennsylvania 

535.76 537.42 B: wow congratulations 

536.51 543.61 A: uh thank you very much um yeah i uh this past weekend so now i get to enter the real world which

553.76 556.93 A: oh really interesting interesting i uh 

554.48 555.45 B: yeah 

556.77 570.09 A: you know it's really hard i mean i love golf but it's just difficult to find the time to or or the space really you know in philadelphia and new york where i'm originally from there's just no links so you have to drive you know far aways away 

570.11 571.84 A: to get out on the course 

571.60 583.84 B: yeah because golf golf courses take up so much land especially places so populated land is at you know at the utmost premium you could have a million people living where a golf course is practically 

579.46 580.69 A: right right 

583.46 593.97 A: exactly exactly so i mean it's just such an effort but um you know i i try to get out there my my long game's all right you know what i really need to work on is kind of my pitching i 

593.73 594.80 B: right 

594.01 599.89 A: think that's uh and and my putting my putting is atrocious but i i don't know how to wor- i mean i guess that's just practice
