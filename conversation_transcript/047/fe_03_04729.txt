220.19 232.18 B: oh actually from people have accused me of being from the midwest but since i've been in [mn] in the deep part of the south down here in the brunswick area for the last week i i probably sound a little more southern 

231.42 232.82 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

232.18 244.93 B: than normal and so that's true [mn] i have a second hobby that kinda ties in with the first a little i love to travel my husband and i are just [mn] uh impassioned [mn] travellers and 

241.03 242.16 A: mhm 

244.77 250.33 B: we take usually about forty five to sixty days to travel 

250.36 253.20 B: every year internationally and so that's 

253.28 254.88 B: i love it i 

253.96 255.86 A: fantastic fantastic 

255.08 256.58 B: really do 

256.13 265.22 A: is that um you know that's one that you sorta either have to have the time or the money to do wi- did you always have that or did you reach it later on is it something 

263.30 274.28 B: [noise] [noise] well ye- we just basically live like little paupers during the year literally and we don't we don't we don't we save our money and do [mn] 

268.14 269.20 A: [laughter] 

273.53 274.76 A: uh-huh [noise] 

274.12 284.17 B: all kinds of extra side jobs and odd jobs and we don't run the heat in the winter until it's under fifty and we don't run the air at home until it's over ninety three 

283.28 285.23 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

284.27 289.70 B: so we have no utilities so that that takes care of one month of travel by itself 

288.25 295.07 A: well it seem- i can see why you might uh like it abroad more cause you live better [laughter] 

293.14 304.75 B: yeah yeah we do but you know when you save well now we're roughly saving [noise] twenty five hundred a year uh just by tapping the little bit on utility so that literally gets us 

300.38 301.40 A: (( [noise] okay ah )) 

304.78 313.59 B: from home and depending on where we stay either about five or six months in in south east asia i mean five or six weeks so 

312.75 314.02 A: oh wow 

313.70 321.63 B: so for that trade off living in the south and we both like heat so that doesn't bother us it's [mn] really we you know 

318.92 320.49 A: (( mhm [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

321.53 332.55 B: [mn] [noise] you don't need to if you don't have children you you you know you don't need all that and when we have company we will we'll turn on the heat and air for them but then the minute they leave it's off you know [laughter] it's like 

324.07 324.98 A: yeah 

331.17 333.92 A: (( [laughter] )) 

333.02 338.05 B: every day without heat is another five to six bucks in the pocket you know 

337.09 349.59 A: [noise] there you go now tha- that's that's a pipe dream of mine that's one where i would always like to travel i i admire that you can do that i i'm always interested in different cultures different la- [noise] everything the food and everything 

338.31 339.48 B: so anyway 

340.90 342.77 B: [noise] 

347.83 361.21 B: [noise] well it is incredibly cheap we've been to bali the last two times in a row and we just got a notice from our travel agent that we could get over there and she could get us a whole week in a luxury hotel for six hundred bucks 

360.64 361.94 A: [noise] you know 

361.10 363.28 B: [mn] all the way from atlanta [noise] 

362.56 368.20 A: i believe it because i'm sure bali is hurting since [mn] the uh terrorist strike that was there a few months 

366.68 373.58 B: yes and then the sars scare and then the second the second bombs threat so it's just been 

373.58 374.82 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

374.20 380.72 B: it's been [sigh] it's been rough on them and [mn] and nobody's visiting and the airlines are hurting so yeah it's 

380.72 389.39 B: now we do have friends that we met that travelling the world they were they're actually on the fifteenth month of their tour and they're both accountants 

388.82 390.12 A: mhm 

389.47 394.93 B: and they save every penny [mn] and like and are live in a co-op situation and then 

391.08 394.04 A: (( mm )) 

395.01 404.12 B: every two years they strike out and they're gone usually they're only gone three months but this time they had so much fun they just got a line of credit and they're just 

397.69 398.25 A: (( [noise] )) 

404.18 409.18 B: [lipsmack] maxing it out and then they'll pay for it and save a little longer then they're gone again [laughter] 

406.34 407.53 A: (( wow that )) 

408.45 415.16 A: well that's that's [laughter] that's more than just cutting the tr- the the heat down [laughter] [laughter] 

411.80 425.56 B: that's more than the heat and the uh making your your meals and teaching piano lessons on the side yeah that's [mn] i'm not on an accountant payroll i wish i were but i the other thing i want to do is i just i think i'll uh um 

418.00 419.36 A: [laughter] 

425.39 431.64 B: um i've been lucky with my pictures so far and i think i just want to [mn] start publishing um 

431.85 442.58 B: but pictures hardly sell i mean [mn] the magazines aren't selling because of the internet so but i do want to somehow hook um second career into into travel you know 

441.72 443.45 A: (( uh-huh mm )) 

442.95 447.65 B: i i i you know it's just that's the that's the harder piece of it is uh 

447.74 450.08 B: thinking of doing like a custom um 

450.12 458.12 B: [mn] travelling for people that really want to go to exotic places and then i would go out and kind of 

453.72 454.66 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

458.14 465.31 B: chart the path come h- come back with a couple of different travel options from them and then go out and be their personal you know 

465.03 465.84 A: mhm 

465.21 474.16 B: accompany person throughout and of course that would have to cater a little bit to the rich or the you know the early retirement dream type kind of people 

473.09 474.77 A: sure sure 

474.14 480.59 B: but uh just en- just enough to travel not enough to have a fat life on it just just enough to keep travelling

494.45 502.20 B: don't want to travel i think that's one group i have a hard time [laughter] believing that and and i just don't understand that [mn] 

497.78 499.83 A: (( [noise] [laughter] [mn] )) 

501.22 506.71 A: ha well let me ask you this you always notice you never visit your backyard how often do you go to atlanta [mn] [noise]
