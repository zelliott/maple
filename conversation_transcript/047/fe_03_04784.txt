28.96 32.20 B: oh see i'm glad you're not in same room with me [sigh] 

32.24 33.50 A: i see 

32.85 37.43 B: [laughter] so i guess we have an adversarial relationship here 

37.59 40.25 A: [laughter] well if we choose to 

39.80 41.52 B: [laughter] true true 

41.85 44.85 B: uh and how many years have you smoked 

44.21 46.25 A: maybe you already made your choice 

45.88 48.99 B: (( no [laughter] but how many years have you smoked [noise] )) 

49.64 52.61 A: oh too long let's see 

51.25 53.72 B: have have have you ever tried to quit 

54.40 59.69 A: i quit once for a few months maybe ten years ago 

59.35 60.48 B: mhm 

59.82 61.05 A: thirteen years ago 

61.69 64.05 B: just through um willpower 

65.45 69.22 A: uh i well yeah yeah i suppose 

68.76 69.56 B: okay 

69.33 70.94 A: is there any other way 

70.35 73.32 B: well uh the patches or things like that 

72.56 77.11 A: right it was pre patch i think or well maybe it wasn't but uh no 

77.26 78.75 A: i didn't use that 

79.03 82.85 A: uh it was painful liter- literally 

80.90 88.20 B: [laughter] withdrawal oh i i totally agree with you it is withdrawal it is it is a um addiction 

82.93 84.17 A: yeah yeah 

87.24 87.80 A: (( [mn] )) 

87.95 90.03 A: so you've never you've never smoked 

89.42 98.02 B: no i haven't but i've watched a number of [noise] of friends and family members that have and the results that they've gotten um 

97.83 104.77 B: you know my my grandmother well my vision of my grandmother was that she was a dragon because smoke came out of her nose and her mouth all the time 

105.40 107.02 B: [laughter] but 

105.43 113.77 A: well grandmothers are [laughter] they always have strange things coming out of their noses and mouths and 

107.06 108.08 B: uh but then 

109.66 110.95 B: (( but then i also )) 

111.76 115.02 B: [laughter] well sometimes true 

113.99 115.95 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

115.06 124.60 B: but uh but then i watched her painfully die from uh lung cancer so you know [noise] so that that sealed my uh impression of smoking i think 

119.20 120.48 A: (( oh )) 

124.67 138.54 B: but uh you know i i still say to each their own but i i don't appreciate it in public places particularly in restaurants where you know it drifts over when you're eating i i uh i especially find it annoying when i'm eating 

138.26 145.26 A: we should switch because in in l._a. you can't do that [sigh] and apparently in pittsburgh you can 

144.75 153.50 B: well they have non smoking sections of restaurants but again they're not totally separate so the you know things drift [laughter] 

147.72 149.05 A: oh see 

150.96 152.43 A: right 

152.77 156.44 A: i swear you should move to l._a. and i should move to pittsburgh 

154.74 155.77 B: [laughter] 

155.80 159.31 B: oh i guess so i'm gonna have to check that out [laughter] 

158.16 160.77 A: (( [laughter] [lipsmack] )) 

159.91 172.61 B: but you know some day and i i'm not sure if all these programs they have nowadays or patches are effective i think they can help but again i think i think it is a struggle it's a battle particularly when you've smoked for a long period of time 

173.33 174.73 A: this is true 

175.86 176.80 B: (( [noise] [noise] and [noise] ))
