12.37 12.95 A: (( [mn] )) 

12.82 15.67 B: so what do you think about banning smoking 

15.63 19.31 A: i think the smoking ban is extremely stupid 

18.97 19.84 B: (( you do )) 

19.60 22.01 A: yes what do you think 

21.63 22.54 B: um 

23.37 24.46 B: i 

24.60 26.12 B: think that 

27.20 32.92 B: ah yeah i think it's i don't think it's stupid i think it's partially a good idea 

33.05 34.16 A: do you smoke 

33.20 36.28 B: i smoke but i enjoy going to places where 

36.30 41.79 B: you you can't smoke inside except for places like bars and like parts of restaurants 

41.63 42.98 A: mhm 

42.42 44.61 B: um why do you think it's stupid 

44.53 47.89 A: um the the government is now telling 

48.18 55.08 A: you know owners of their own restaurants that you know you own this property but we're gonna tell you that people can't smoke in it 

54.70 56.03 B: that's a good point 

56.03 68.75 A: and actually i was i was reading a a great editorial yesterday that said that that the bars will make more money because of the lack of smoking and i i don't think that they are 'cause i'm not gonna wanna go to a bar if i can't smoke 

68.46 71.64 B: yeah definitely not definitely not to a bar 

72.97 73.77 B: ha 

75.00 80.33 B: [lipsmack] yeah i think that you've ah a good point with the government i didn't really um think about it that far 

80.46 81.79 B: ahead um 

84.12 89.98 B: [lipsmack] yeah i guess it should be up to the the person who owns the the the business or the property or whatever 

89.26 99.50 A: mhm i mean and and as far as business goes i mean they're worried about you know the people in the buildings and like the employees but it's like if they just if they don't want the smoke there's there's always other options 

98.96 100.04 B: that's true 

100.51 102.37 B: there are a million jobs 

101.78 102.95 A: exactly

174.35 175.35 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

177.00 177.88 B: yeah 

177.24 181.46 A: but if they took that money and invested it into making so that people like myself 

181.49 189.33 A: could get like nicotine patches and gum and those commit lozenges they'd be a whole lot better off because those ads aren't stopping anyone 

185.97 186.87 B: yeah 

188.70 192.73 B: yeah it's yeah it's ridiculous that's a good idea too
