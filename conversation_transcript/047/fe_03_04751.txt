252.12 259.35 A: something strange to me so [lipsmack] but i d- i didn't i didn't have the courage to ask those guys 

258.58 267.37 B: [laughter] [laughter] oh no it's kind of it's kind of scary see the thing is that people think that that those people are um 

260.75 263.15 A: (( something like that [laughter] [mn] )) 

267.18 274.97 B: [lipsmack] are sort of females with with male parts they [mn] they call them chicks with dicks [laughter] dicks th- that's the term

273.10 275.41 A: [laughter] 

274.84 288.88 B: but they aren't but they aren't they're men and and so they they think like men and they act like men and they they respond as men respond they don't respond as me- women respond so even though they they they look female they aren't [lipsmack] [mn] 

276.11 278.86 A: [laughter] [mn] oh okay 

281.39 282.64 A: mhm

310.37 324.03 A: actually i am trying to reduce weight and if i want to remain fit i have to reduce my weight that's a part of it but it's not because of my passion or my inner self that wants to do something i would term my hobby as 

324.15 333.82 A: what my passion is because i see some people have hobbies like woodworking and they do it with a passion and zeal and devote for hours and hours together 

333.87 334.69 B: yes
