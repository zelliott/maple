7.15 10.55 A: um well i guess we're supposed to talk about smoking [laughter] 

10.38 13.36 B: oh okay my my ah person 

13.43 17.65 B: or the the recording i i had said to talk to talk to hobbies [laughter] 

17.38 18.64 A: hob- oh 

18.10 20.01 B: (( yeah )) 

18.82 24.66 A: that's very interesting [laughter] well i guess we can kind of combine the two maybe [laughter] 

23.39 25.26 B: okay okay sure 

25.18 28.96 A: um well how do you feel about ah smoking first of all 

28.95 33.84 B: ah well i think i i don't do it myself but i i guess i'm a 

34.13 36.91 B: i'm kind of like 

37.62 46.12 B: [noise] inbetween about it like i kind of feel you know like young people shouldn't be exposed to it but as an adult you can choose whatever you wanna do so that's why 

46.42 48.56 A: yeah i think i feel the same way 

48.59 58.34 A: and ah the the the voice that i heard [laughter] it said um to talk about ah public smoking bans and i i know they're trying to do that here in philadelphia 

50.37 52.59 B: mhm 

58.08 59.21 B: oh okay 

58.50 68.71 A: um you know like in and oh basically banning in all public places which i i think that's kind of going too far because ad- like you said adults have the right to make their own decision about that 

62.16 63.03 B: uh-huh 

68.12 69.90 B: mhm mhm 

68.69 76.75 A: yeah but you know i i don't like the idea of young people smoking either i don't smoke but um i guess if you know consenting adults wanna do it then that's 

76.72 87.44 A: really their business and and i don't think it's a good idea to like tell restaurants and bars and places that they can't allow anybody to smoke in them you know i think that's going a little bit too far and yeah 

85.80 87.60 B: mhm mhm 

88.63 92.09 B: yes yeah ah yeah i totally agree with you 

90.52 91.35 A: (( so mhm mhm ))

102.73 103.66 B: okay 

104.04 112.57 A: ah i i spend a lot of time li- going to the library um and i'm a member of a ah an online book club where they they recommend books to read each month 

112.25 114.70 B: oh really what what's it called 

113.03 114.13 A: yeah so 

115.14 120.99 A: um it's it's a yahoo group um just called um ah men reading [laughter]

126.30 138.56 B: yeah i was just about um i was just about to say that too myself yeah it takes up a lot of time actually and one of the follow up questions was like how um how often do you spend time doing that 

130.67 132.00 A: (( oh right )) 

138.89 148.69 B: and so like i've just calculated it in my head like probably spend at the very least probably at least ten hours a week doing that so 

147.78 153.08 A: right wow i would say about the same yeah yeah i spend a lot of time reading too 

150.51 151.51 B: oh really 

153.06 154.07 B: mhm 

153.39 154.34 A: (( i ah )) 

154.60 163.24 A: i i usually check um maybe three or four books each month that i just wanna you know try to go through the whole month and read all through read through all of them 

162.84 163.60 B: (( mm )) 

163.34 168.86 A: i don't always succeed but um yeah i probably spend that amount of time each week reading

168.73 169.94 B: oh okay 

169.54 176.05 A: yeah and i like to go to the library because i i don't think people make ah as good a use of the public libraries as they should i 

175.81 177.22 B: yeah yeah 

176.15 189.12 A: mean you know that they're there for a reason for people who you know if you don't have to money to to buy a book that you really want or you know if if you just would rather read through the book first to see if it's something that you really wanna buy for your own personal collection you know 

187.22 188.56 B: exactly 

189.60 191.80 A: what kind of things do you like to read

250.34 251.34 B: (( oh okay )) 

250.98 256.23 A: um so i just decided to do you know read something that's kind of like the completely the opposite you know with 

256.46 263.37 A: aliens and [laughter] you know time travel and things like that they're you know that's completely off the beaten path so

384.01 385.84 B: mhm mhm 

384.76 387.08 A: mhm what was your major when you were in school

389.19 390.35 B: mhm 

391.87 401.17 B: yeah yeah i couldn't finish everything ah on a timely basis but like it was it was good it was good like um 

399.70 400.34 A: (( mm )) 

401.56 409.79 B: [noise] yeah i realise that that's probably one of the reasons why i enjoy reading is just it's the information of it the narrative the story telling so 

408.83 419.01 A: mhm so did ah that major follow in line with your ah your personal reading habits like do you read a lot of history in your personal time 

418.56 423.00 B: actually no actually no um i actually read a lot more um 

419.49 420.67 A: (( yeah okay )) 

424.80 430.84 B: no actually maybe maybe not i'm not sure actually i'm starting to read um a lot more 

431.39 435.13 B: what would you call it non fiction no i mean 

435.25 440.07 B: but yeah history is non fiction too so like yeah yeah so it's yeah it's the same 

440.11 443.55 B: in that sense but um i think i enjoy like more like 

443.64 450.59 B: titles that address like common like modern day struggles and stuff kind of 

449.20 450.97 A: (( okay all right mhm )) 

450.78 452.22 B: like um 

453.09 455.32 B: another book that i'm reading is ah 

455.68 458.93 B: it's like a new book that just came out it's like called the 

459.86 468.70 B: what is it the dirty girls social club [laughter] and it is it's a- about la- like the lives of latino women and stuff so that i think that's pretty interesting 

468.51 470.35 A: (( okay that's sounds interesting [mn] )) 

470.35 478.11 B: yeah so it it's just kind of weird like i'll i'll just take out something different and i don't have a set thing in mind 

471.18 471.84 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

479.34 481.83 A: sometimes you can learn about um 

482.15 485.67 A: ah like a particular time period by reading the fiction of that period 

485.31 486.58 B: mm mhm 

485.74 491.19 A: 'cause i mean ah even though the the stories are aren't about fictional characters they reveal a lot about 

491.07 501.85 A: what's actually going on during that time what people are concerned about and ah you know things like that so yeah i i read a a lot of historical fiction while i was in school 

494.81 495.69 B: mhm 

497.07 498.17 B: yeah 

500.57 501.45 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

501.75 503.08 B: oh really 

502.08 503.95 A: um yeah you know like um 

504.27 508.14 A: for one course i i had to um it was a woman in literature course 

507.74 509.09 B: mhm 

508.15 509.80 A: and we were reading um 

510.11 514.64 A: um novels by women of different ethnic groups in the united states 

514.09 514.96 B: uh-huh 

514.68 526.73 A: and so you know that ran the gamut all the way from um the early nineteen hundreds up to the modern day it was really interesting to read different perspectives that the women had of um of american society and life in in united states 

520.46 521.42 B: (( oh )) 

523.82 524.64 B: uh-huh 

526.47 529.80 B: oh okay wow any favorites

539.93 541.49 B: mhm mhm 

540.91 549.65 A: ah and have you read that before yeah okay yeah so i i enjoyed that a lot because um i really don't think that there's been that much emphasis on 

542.90 543.97 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

549.71 552.05 A: on the asian american experience 

551.63 552.75 B: mhm 

552.14 553.39 A: in um 

553.57 563.11 A: at least the u- i haven't been exposed to much ah you know in in my readings so it was really interesting to read ah her perspective on growing up in the united states as a chinese woman 

555.82 556.80 B: mhm 

562.62 563.91 B: mhm 

563.30 573.92 A: and um and you know the kinds of problems she had with a ah cultural clashes between her family and you know the expectations of the society around her so i enjoyed that one a lot mhm 

571.74 572.75 B: mhm 

573.58 575.14 B: yeah yeah 

575.31 579.51 B: yeah definitely it was it was yeah one of the first books i was oh my god

586.77 587.98 B: mhm 

587.32 597.98 A: but um you know i i mean in the modern world today you you you have to interest with all kinds of people in all kinds of settings and you know it seems like the world really is getting smaller and and um i

598.35 599.89 A: i i was just ah
