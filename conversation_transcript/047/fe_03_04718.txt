392.70 393.77 B: [laughter] 

396.55 408.82 A: um in in his early twenties and he is uh he used to play the piano but he gave that up when he was uh when he graduated high school but he's still i mean but he still knows how to like he he can he remembers 

402.44 403.26 B: (( okay )) 

404.84 405.62 B: okay 

408.49 409.37 B: yeah 

408.68 420.94 A: like you know it hasn't completely gone he hasn't completely lost his touch whatever and he still plays a little bit but he doesn't take lessons or is actively playing and my sister sings and she's still in high school and so she takes lessons 

412.06 413.02 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

420.60 421.51 B: (( okay mhm ))

423.48 425.04 A: yeah so th- 

425.62 432.84 A: they kind of my my brother's kinda growing out of it and i think my s- i don't think my sister is going to continue singing after high school i think they just needed something to do 

432.48 433.94 B: [noise] oh yeah 

433.30 434.27 A: (( you know )) 

434.12 435.28 B: yeah 

434.69 441.57 A: during high school or whatever 'cause i think i guess it's like when you're in high school that's pretty much the time that you really develop an interest in 

441.55 442.88 B: in things yeah 

441.85 452.23 A: actually focusing on it so i guess that's what they did but i'm the actually the one that stuck with it [mn] and i've played the piano for a couple of churches around my town and everything so 

451.90 453.58 B: (( okay mm-kay that's )) 

453.62 455.02 A: [sigh] so 

454.23 455.13 B: (( pretty good )) 

455.67 456.90 A: (( [lipsmack] yup )) 

457.36 469.01 A: but that but i just right now i u- i really use my hobby as a um to make money because with the show choir i mean i get a scholarship to the college i'm at and when i play at churches i get paid for that so it's like a job 

468.63 473.33 B: okay that's pretty good so you you like it and you get paid for it so like you're having fun and get paid 

469.61 470.50 A: so 

472.37 475.22 A: right do what 

473.65 474.52 B: okay 

474.54 477.27 B: so y- like you get paid to have fun basically 

476.61 478.03 A: pretty much yeah 

477.29 479.63 B: yeah play the piano and everything 

479.09 489.72 A: yep that's yeah [noise] and it's i guess it's kind of ironic seeing as how i majored in art because i didn't want my job to be music and it's my part time job to get through college so 

486.23 487.19 B: (( yeah )) 

490.07 491.78 B: mhm 

491.16 492.74 A: but anyway 

492.33 494.86 B: i wish i could [noise] get paid to play basketball [laughter] 

494.74 498.74 A: yeah well you you might same day if you keep working at it but 

498.19 505.03 B: ah no m- my time is over [laughter] yeah my time is over i had had that dream in high school but not anymore

510.25 511.05 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

512.08 513.55 B: (( well )) 

514.19 519.25 B: [mn] so do you do you do you write poetry or or short stories did u- how did that come out 

514.78 516.32 A: so [sigh] 

518.36 525.90 A: um i've written i've written a short story i i took a creative writing class my senior year in high school i just because i needed to fill up my schedule 

525.55 526.74 B: uh-huh [noise]

531.65 538.13 A: that i wrote about um [noise] i'm a pretty negative person i suppose you could say or pretty depress- i don't know how you'd say it but 

537.49 538.71 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

537.91 548.92 A: like i wrote a poem about how um the worst part of my day is when i wake up because my dreams i can do anything and be anything i want and that's like the happiest time for me is when i'm asleep and i'm in my dream 

548.90 556.87 A: and because [mn] in my dreams i'll be a my own hero and you know be loved by everybody and et cetera et cetera [noise] and so uh

561.70 574.56 A: about how i like i said the worst part of my day is when i wake up in the morning but i know that i can face it because i've already i i know i can face whatever the day brings because i've already [noise] i've already gone i've already lived through the worst part of my day 

564.40 565.42 B: waking up 

574.20 575.38 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

574.49 587.49 A: which is working through if that makes any sense and then i wrote a short story [mn] um since i don't have i mean i don't really have anything else to talk about so i'll just kill time and go into detail about this one too but um my short story that i wrote about was i uh [noise] 

587.60 592.36 A: two best friends and um one is a christian and one is not a christian 

592.37 596.57 A: and uh the christian goes out and you know 

596.76 599.88 A: does everything that a normal guy would do like you know drinks and
