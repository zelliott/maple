401.17 401.99 B: yeah 

404.06 409.91 A: [noise] cheap one you could probably rent a houseboat for like fifteen hundred dollars or something but if you divide that between ten people

425.68 427.08 A: [sigh] probably ten 

426.82 427.78 B: wow 

427.62 441.25 A: but you know d- depending the type of people that you have with you who don't mind roughing it [sigh] you can cram a whole lot more 'cause people can sleep up on the roof and stuff we slept outside a lot of nights up up top and [sigh] it's 

436.99 437.82 B: sure 

441.84 442.84 A: i i

476.22 477.26 B: (( uh-huh right )) 

482.50 492.34 A: [sigh] i think the most ah probably the most expensive part is the gas for the [laughter] boats [laughter] you really burn through a lot [laughter] [sigh] but [sigh] unfortunately 

486.84 488.20 B: (( [noise] cool [noise] oh yeah )) 

491.23 494.49 B: [noise] [mn] and were there a lot of other house boats on the lake or uh-hum 

493.70 501.93 A: oh yeah yeah there were but [noise] i mean it seemed like few and far between we felt like we were [sigh] 

501.95 511.94 A: coming out on our own it was and granted this is probably six plus years ago it's been a while [sigh] and so w- who knows if it's [sigh]
