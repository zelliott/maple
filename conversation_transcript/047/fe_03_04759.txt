388.92 389.96 B: (( you know )) 

388.95 394.55 A: uh-huh [mn] do you regard that as is that enough to make it a hobby isn't there some sort of requirement that you have like could 

392.23 405.84 B: well i think what makes it a hobby is not maybe how [mn] well [mn] i'm sure how many of something you have but i think it's your interest in it i mean you know it's something that i look at all the time say i would go 

404.72 409.43 A: i have a could i could i like have a hobby of having girlfriends even though i don't have a single girlfriend 

408.70 411.97 B: i think you possibly could 

409.75 412.80 A: [laughter] 

412.09 423.18 B: i i mean i go to doll shows and i go to um doll fairs and things so i think that where there are other collectors and hobbyists [sigh] 

421.50 428.44 A: what are you are you what kind of dolls are you talking old dolls or new dolls or [mn] the the reason i'm asking is that my uh my uh 

425.28 426.48 B: um 

428.69 433.87 A: i know some of those old dolls are worth a lot you know i know that some of the um you know like uh 

431.24 432.27 B: mhm 

432.96 435.16 B: oh yeah i mean those are [mn] 

433.64 447.85 A: forties like dolls from the forties people are [mn] i guess it sort of it depends on the [mn] the the uh sort of the sensibilities and and the amusements nostalgia of the collectors but i i think the pri- maybe those d- dolls are are popular amongst people that have them as children 

441.20 442.74 B: oh 

445.89 453.23 B: [mn] oh th- they are popular they are dolls made in germany for example are are very collectible 

453.07 466.97 A: is the dolls made in germany correct me if i'm wrong but they use like glass eyes that are almost [mn] like exactly like human eyes when you look at 'em they look almost exactly like a human face and sort of and a little bit odd because they're so human compared to what [mn] compared to the way we do it 

453.30 454.43 B: um 

459.18 461.30 B: yeah 

461.64 462.77 B: mhm 

465.53 476.14 B: i saw- um [lipsmack] i saw once on like good morning america they were they showed some a doll collector who had some very expensive you know 

471.03 472.12 A: mhm 

476.17 480.40 B: uh very expensive collection of dolls and teddy bears and 

480.26 481.13 A: (( mhm )) 

480.42 482.10 B: and um 

482.26 485.98 B: right the ones with the glass eyes were were very 

486.20 488.92 B: very valuable and um 

487.99 492.80 A: yeah they were they're also re- amazingly lifelike you know you look at 'em and you know 

491.46 503.77 B: exactly black dolls are very very [mn] older black dolls are very rare and very collectible and very expensive worth a lot of money because they didn't make as many 

503.64 508.27 A: yeah no that well that kind of that kind of you'd expect in this country huh 

504.26 505.71 B: and uh 

507.99 510.82 B: yeah and um 

509.94 513.57 A: what uh what as far as the black dolls go do they what are they uh 

512.94 517.12 B: well it just depends on how well preserved they are how 

517.33 518.50 B: you know 

517.37 520.89 A: did they make them did they make them sort of um um 

518.59 519.69 B: (( well for )) 

521.02 524.22 A: authentic in terms of like the hairstyles and all that or did they make 

523.42 526.84 B: well in say in germany 

524.27 529.15 A: make kind of make a white version a white version of a of a or a black version of a white doll 

527.40 532.92 B: no i think some [mn] i think some of maybe the german dolls were 

532.93 539.65 B: were were authentic uh had authentic um black features that sort of thing 

539.34 540.31 A: (( mhm )) 

539.70 540.90 B: um 

541.07 542.38 B: um 

542.78 546.80 B: you know there it's it's it's it it depends i think 

546.85 548.87 B: i i think now 

547.24 552.09 A: and and is it is it is it also true of asian dolls did they make did they make fewer asian dolls 

552.40 553.40 B: (( asian )) 

553.36 561.33 A: yeah i'm just thinking black and white is that and i i i would just assume that just from the m [mn] because of the market in the united states that they'd they'd make dolls that 

554.21 554.99 B: (( um )) 

558.86 559.85 B: uh-huh 

561.49 564.95 A: look white for white people 'cause that's what white people buy 

563.25 576.13 B: well that's all the [mn] say for example right now they're they're bringing they will bring back you know a right now i don't know if you remember the cha- um my play pal or my 

576.76 582.17 B: pretty play pal or something like that that was made like you know 

579.09 580.04 A: (( mhm )) 

581.33 586.94 A: no the only dolls that i remember are is that is that i can recall uh yeah chatty cathy i recall and baby first step 

582.51 584.32 B: chatty cathy 

586.70 599.89 B: well see those will if you like if your sister or somebody has uh has one of those say they were made from nineteen sixty through nineteen seventy those dolls 

598.34 599.89 A: yeah exactly exa-
