61.07 61.95 A: (( oh okay )) 

62.32 63.79 A: (( well good for you yeah )) 

63.28 64.57 B: yeah 

64.68 69.53 A: uh well i guess for myself i've just uh you know i'm asthmatic so 

69.21 70.00 B: (( oh )) 

69.70 72.37 A: smoking is not exactly a good idea 

71.76 73.09 B: yeah [laughter] 

72.77 81.69 A: and uh when i do go out it's it's kind of [cough] i don't know i try to i if i if i can or if i'm in p- if i can i'll try and get a non smoking section but uh 

81.71 87.43 A: whatever for as if i'm really impatient i'll just get the first available table but you know if i was 

84.91 85.87 B: yeah 

86.10 88.48 B: do you guys have smoking in buildings 

88.44 95.84 A: uh here in atlanta uh i think it's like atlanta's split into three different counties 

89.97 90.83 B: uh-huh 

95.52 96.44 B: oh 

96.56 101.47 A: so depending on what county you're in i i think they have different smoking laws for each 

101.18 102.15 B: oh uh-huh 

101.52 103.35 A: (( um so )) 

104.15 110.59 A: yeah i know in some places you can't smoke and in other places you can i just don't know what county i'm in at the time 

109.83 113.42 B: because the whole state of california you can't smoke in a building 

113.39 114.60 A: oh really 

114.06 115.84 B: yeah i mean it's 

114.99 117.51 A: even at a even at a bar or something 

117.12 119.74 B: no huh uh they've banned it 

118.38 119.25 A: oh that 

119.55 120.71 A: oh wow 

120.18 122.15 B: yeah you have to go outside 

122.70 124.25 A: [laughter] 

123.35 128.96 B: that was a really big deal when they did it because like i mean you know a lot of people when they drink they smoke 

128.85 129.99 A: exactly 

129.53 136.42 B: and and i used to so when they banned it you know even in a bar you have to go outside there's bar owners that 

136.46 141.53 B: that kind of weasel around it and they'll let you but they can get fined pretty heavily 

141.33 142.62 A: mhm 

142.20 143.25 B: so 

143.33 147.37 A: oh that's pretty bad so uh within the whole state of of california 

146.81 148.27 B: yeah 

147.96 150.33 A: well i mean i can imagine what it's like in the cities 

150.94 152.13 B: oh yeah 

151.08 160.63 A: you know that's got to be really bad i know there's complaint 'cause uh i think uh a no smoking law got passed for for bars and restaurants as well and uh 

160.66 175.66 A: in one one particular county they're just like you know well this isn't fair because you know the people that do come to come to drink do smoke at the same time but then i don't know i guess it's all part of the ambiance as well you know you kind of expect it so but 

168.41 169.43 B: right 

171.77 172.73 B: yeah 

174.74 175.68 B: yeah 

176.13 178.24 A: i don't know it's a it's it's 

178.77 185.39 A: for me it's like i prefer to be around a non smoker but if my friend smokes that's fine i just i just don't wanna be down wind of it 

181.51 182.45 B: right 

185.05 186.25 B: yeah 

186.14 196.49 A: yeah um i'm really i have nothing against smokers i mean i i [laughter] i remember in uh in high school and it was like oh well he doesn't smoke or he's uncool and all that like 

195.09 198.12 B: yeah [laughter] i know now it's the office at [laughter] 

197.43 203.11 A: yeah yeah exactly it's like well it's it's kind of the health kick now you know it's like what are you doing smoking 

201.23 202.73 B: oh yeah 

203.15 207.77 A: so and for me it's more like a it's [noise] it's real it's a serious health issue so 

207.42 208.38 B: yeah 

207.95 211.52 A: (( you know i just prefer not to be around it but if it have to that's all right but )) 

211.01 218.21 B: yeah well that's it surprise it shocked me to hear somebody say you know i asked for non smoking 'cause i'm like it's not even an option here 

217.38 224.70 A: um that's that's kinda cool i should maybe i should move out to california if i can uh if i can afford it you know [laughter] 

220.60 222.35 B: i know [laughter] 

222.92 226.06 B: yeah i know it's expensive as hell here [laughter] 

225.84 227.81 A: [cough] so what part of california are you from 

227.26 230.82 B: i'm in roseville i'm about ten minutes outside of sacramento 

230.80 232.53 A: oh okay okay 

231.62 232.64 B: yeah 

232.65 234.49 A: oh wow how long you been out there 

234.14 240.92 B: um just about three years we moved here from southern california actually my husband was in the military um and so we got transferred up here 

238.88 239.77 A: mhm 

240.95 242.52 A: oh cool cool 

241.81 245.78 B: so yeah so that was kinda nice but it's a 

243.58 244.48 A: oh 

244.69 245.91 A: (( well how long have you )) 

245.94 247.59 A: oh it's oh go go ahead 

247.05 252.11 B: oh it's a nice area it's the heat up here is bad but i'm sure atlanta's about the same 

252.61 255.01 A: yeah we got a cold front right now so it's okay 

252.82 253.49 B: so 

254.63 257.04 B: oh do you [laughter] we're in the nineties today [laughter] 

256.84 258.72 A: (( oh oh it sucks )) 

257.31 263.51 B: so and that's that's another thing that made me quit smoking [laughter] i couldn't understand how people could smoke up here in the heat 

263.97 264.90 A: oh yeah [noise] 

264.49 269.70 B: i mean it's like 'cause you have to go outside so you know who wants to go stand outside in the heat and smoke cigarettes 

269.98 271.41 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

270.42 272.80 B: [laughter] it's ridiculous [laughter] 

272.35 275.64 A: oh yeah yeah so how'd how'd you get off the the smoking gig 

275.22 277.63 B: you know what i just quit cold turkey 

277.80 278.97 A: wow 

278.50 286.99 B: yeah i just decided one day okay i'm a non smoker and just that was what it was in my head and that's the way it was gonna be and so i just quit i think i 

287.00 291.33 B: i fell off a couple of times like i'd stop and buy a pack and i'd just have one 

291.71 295.57 B: but um for the most part i just said this is it i'm done 

295.55 297.10 A: [noise] wow that's pretty impressive 

296.46 300.47 B: so it was w- wh- you know what it was easy for m- my husband never smoked 

300.16 301.26 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

300.54 310.03 B: and he didn't really care for it i never smoked in the house um and he just didn't care for it and so that kinda made it easy 'cause i wasn't around a lotta people that smoked 

309.69 310.87 A: mhm 

310.42 312.54 B: so that kinda made it easy but 

312.29 318.74 A: yeah i can imagine 'cause it's you know when you're i'm sure as soon as you smell it you probably get a a little urge to do it 

313.32 314.35 B: yeah 

318.27 324.37 B: you know sometimes i do but it's funny because i never really cared for i hated the taste 

324.07 325.67 A: (( don't you [noise] oh yeah )) 

325.06 335.14 B: so and for a smoker to hate the taste i mean how stupid are you [laughter] you know [laughter] but it's one of those things it just became habit so [laughter] 

328.38 330.15 A: [laughter] 

334.92 336.01 A: (( oh wow )) 

336.18 337.18 B: but
