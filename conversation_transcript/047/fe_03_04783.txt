1.17 2.50 A: hi 

2.14 4.00 B: hi my name is debby 

3.67 4.91 A: my name is seth 

5.03 6.45 B: hi seth 

6.28 7.72 A: where are you from 

7.31 8.95 B: san antonio 

8.38 10.08 A: san antonio i'm in 

9.29 10.87 B: and where are you from 

10.30 12.37 A: i'm up in provo utah 

12.16 14.97 B: oh what kind of weather have y'all been having 

14.41 20.16 A: oh goodness it's been gorgeous it's it's been in the seventies for the past week seventies and eighties 

18.76 21.25 B: yeah well we're getting ready to go into 

21.51 22.50 B: (( summer )) 

22.42 23.90 A: yeah 

22.75 25.88 B: summer in texas is fun [laughter] 

24.34 25.65 A: (( yeah i bet )) 

25.67 27.78 A: go spurs [laughter] 

27.08 30.26 B: yes go spurs [laughter] 

28.65 31.53 A: yeah i i always root for the spurs 

31.16 32.82 B: i think they're great 

32.75 36.13 A: so uh so smoking [laughter] 

33.06 33.78 B: um 

35.42 42.27 B: yeah i think that they should kind of let people smoke wherever they feel like they should do it 

42.78 46.84 B: i mean you know restaurants have smoking sections non smoking sections 

46.10 48.04 A: yeah yeah 

47.56 54.25 B: and they you know fine put people in you know double paned glass and let 'em 

52.63 54.20 A: (( mm )) 

54.29 57.55 B: wade through smoke on themselves [laughter] 

56.23 68.64 A: yeah yeah that's that's kind of what i think is that like there i guess there's two ways to look at it one is that the the people who smoke should have the freedom to smoke you know where they want to 

68.78 76.90 A: but then on the other hand the people who don't smoke they should have the freedom to not be in their environment where there is smoking if they want to so it's 

75.89 79.05 B: and and i totally agree i'm an ex smoker 

78.67 79.91 A: yeah 

79.31 86.08 B: and i know that from past experience going into a restaurant and saying oh no smoking allowed it's like excuse me 

85.78 87.28 A: yeah [laughter] 

86.09 89.22 B: how much time do you want me to spend in your restaurant 

88.56 101.90 A: yeah well that's yeah that's the thing is that they should have they should have their free agency and and be able to do it if they wanna do it but at the same time not taking away the free agency of of the people who don't wanna be around it so 

102.11 112.95 A: i think i think that if they separate it into a i mean kinda like they already do where they have smoking sections and stuff like that um i guess like the question 

110.98 112.15 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

112.82 117.59 A: if if they should ha- if it should be banned public places is 

115.57 116.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

117.42 121.15 B: well i'm thinking that's that's kind of unrealistic 

120.51 121.83 A: yeah 

121.74 125.31 B: the i mean there's so many people especially here in texas 

124.82 126.00 A: mhm 

125.32 128.83 B: a lot of people have like your smoking is outside 

128.56 129.62 A: yeah 

129.07 137.38 B: and your non smoking is inside well you know that's fine and then that way if someone wants to sit with their friend who is a smoker then they can go sit outside and 

131.67 132.55 A: yeah 

137.46 140.59 B: down wind from them or whatever the case may be 

139.81 141.11 A: yeah 

140.69 146.77 B: and in the winter time i'm thinking it's not that a big a big deal to enclose the place 

146.38 147.57 A: yeah 

147.07 150.65 B: that they could even open the windows and air it out you 

150.78 153.05 B: know like in the morning or something 

152.59 153.74 A: yeah 

153.14 159.68 B: so that there's some warmth or fresh air but it's like california is getting read to pass a law where there is no smoking 

159.51 160.71 A: at all 

160.16 163.97 B: yeah they're trying to pass a law where you can't even smoke in your car 

160.73 161.69 A: wow 

163.67 165.27 A: oh man [laughter] 

164.53 169.96 B: yeah now can you imagine hello how many people are they going to be having to be pulling over for tickets 

169.49 170.86 A: no kidding 

170.15 173.56 B: hi we're stopping you because you smoked in your car okay bite me 

173.54 178.00 A: yeah well that's that's that i haven't heard anything like that that's retarded 

173.57 175.73 B: you know [laughter] 

176.80 183.18 B: i mean i'm thinking that totally that goes against everything you know the constitutional right of hi 

182.25 183.77 A: yeah no kidding 

183.17 194.04 B: you know i'm not doing anything to like put a gun to your head and shoot you if i wanna kill myself it should be my choice [laughter] you don't stop people from jumping off cliffs in little kites do you 

186.84 187.84 A: yeah 

189.82 191.33 A: well it's like 

193.17 203.85 A: yeah that's the same as as like uh i race cars kind of f- not for a living but just for fun and uh the one of the rules that they came up with recently um 

199.37 200.28 B: yeah 

203.84 212.54 A: i don't know if it's if it's nationwide or just here in utah is that you you're not allowed to remove the airbag from your steering wheel and uh 

211.80 218.02 B: and airbags kill people [laughter] [noise] you know hello 

213.33 222.94 A: yeah tha- well that's the thing is i hate airbags like i've i've had too many friends that have gotten you know burned all over their face broken noses all kinds of things 

222.95 232.83 A: and uh i've never had had any a friend that was killed by one even though it does happen but but just that and plus you know it's my car it it should be my choice whether or not 

231.67 236.64 B: right well see and that's kinda what uh my feelings are is it it ought to be your choice 

236.07 237.25 A: yeah 

236.65 239.18 B: i mean this is why we live here 

238.82 239.91 A: yeah 

239.29 249.73 B: this is why we live in america it's we get our choices we get a choice if we wanna vote if we wanna drive if we wanna you know eat red meat [laughter] 

240.80 241.71 A: (( yes )) 

249.01 250.43 A: yeah exactly 

249.78 258.68 B: i think that smoking has to do with that it's all freedom of choice and for someone to pass a law saying no you know it's against the law for you to smoke here 

258.48 259.64 A: yeah 

258.98 260.28 B: baloney 

260.36 265.98 B: i mean they've gotten to the point now and i remember when i was smoking it's like we went to the um theater 

265.65 266.98 A: mhm 

266.31 269.47 B: and they have like a thirty minute break between you know 

270.02 283.58 B: acts in the in the theater and you have to run down the stairs outside down the block to the designated smoking area it's like okay now i'm in the uh you know no person zone 

270.87 271.88 A: yeah 

272.14 273.03 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

277.96 279.01 A: yeah 

283.82 284.89 A: yeah i 

284.01 289.96 B: then you smoke your cigarette real quick and then you go run back up the stairs [laughter] it's like okay guys 

287.36 288.75 A: yeah no kidding 

290.05 296.47 A: and from what i understand running isn't the best thing or the easiest thing to do especially right after you smoke [laughter] 

295.56 306.04 B: right but i'm thinking you know airports have these little rooms that they have cordoned off that they have air filtering in and people go in these rooms and the doors close and they're locked in this little room that 

298.92 299.95 A: yeah 

305.85 312.96 B: has the haze or smoke over it and fine you know so you're sitting next to a person on the airplane that smells like an ashtray 

306.89 308.89 A: yeah yeah 

312.44 313.97 A: [laughter] 

313.31 320.07 B: you know you could also be sitting on the plane next to somebody and they could you know they hadn't bathed in three days you know 

317.99 319.74 A: yeah same difference 

320.24 321.27 B: [laughter] 

320.86 323.97 A: well and then yeah like like i 

322.73 328.42 B: poor body odor is now against the law [laughter] [laughter] but it's just 

324.92 330.21 A: oh that'd be nice [laughter] i think they should look at that before they look at smoking [laughter] 

329.23 333.87 B: but i mean it's the same kind of to me it's the same kind of uh 

334.36 335.45 B: thing 

335.14 347.68 A: yeah well what i think is that that it shouldn't be a law that's passed that says it's gonna be banned in all public places i j- i think it should be up to the individual owners of the businesses or the public place 

346.30 347.30 B: yeah 

347.48 348.51 B: really 

348.04 355.15 A: and where it's like a park or something like that involved then you know the the city can deal with it on an individual 

355.33 357.01 A: basis you know 

356.04 368.02 B: but they could also make it an area like a designated area in a park like one end of a park and the other end of the park you make like a place where there is an ashtray and you know say if we catch you putting your butt on the 

359.04 359.90 A: yeah 

359.97 361.02 A: yeah well that's 

364.67 366.05 A: yeah exactly 

367.78 373.57 B: you know ground we'll fine you you know a hundred dollars you know use the ashtray idiot person [laughter] 

370.51 371.61 A: yeah 

373.08 374.67 A: yeah [laughter] 

373.67 376.65 B: you know it's there it's there for a reason 

376.32 377.56 A: yeah 

377.30 380.00 B: and that would make much more sense to me 

379.52 384.13 A: yeah i agree i don't i don't think it should be a law necessarily as 

384.16 391.52 A: as much as it should just be the the individual choice of of whoever's in charge of the facility or the environment 

389.26 390.25 B: yeah 

390.92 396.90 B: really and it's like if you go to a restaurant and they have a no smoking policy you have a choice of eating at the restaurant 

396.53 397.51 A: yeah 

396.92 398.25 B: and suffering 

397.79 400.97 A: and that's and because it's the choice of the restaurant 

400.36 404.08 B: yeah or not eating at the restaurant and going someplace else 

401.02 401.88 A: then it 

401.97 403.16 A: (( you know and )) 

403.40 415.80 A: yeah instead of you know they make a law and a- that all public places have to follow and then some public places that wouldn't mind allowing people to smoke in their restaurants they lose business possibly 

414.86 427.28 B: i mean please could you imagine them passing a law and having some guy at a bus de- uh bus stop i'm sorry you can't smoke here it's against the law i know you're outside but still we need fresh air okay hello [laughter] 

421.53 422.45 A: [laughter] 

422.86 424.04 A: [laughter] 

426.08 427.02 A: yeah 

427.16 429.03 A: i think i think over 

427.32 430.91 B: then put filters on cars [laughter] 

429.52 436.37 A: yeah no kidding i think over time too a lot of this will take care of itself kind of it it seems like the number of people 

436.42 440.10 A: that are are starting to smoke is going down quite a bit 

440.16 441.29 A: and uh 

440.40 455.35 B: well yeah i'm sure realizing that it's more healthy not to smoke and the ones that have been smoking for forty years you know and they don't wanna quit they have a choice of not quitting i mean they're the ones that are actually pissing their money down the drain 

444.24 445.15 A: yeah 

447.07 448.19 A: yeah 

449.79 450.86 A: yeah 

454.73 456.17 A: yeah 

455.73 458.41 B: so i mean that was basically why we stopped 

458.05 458.99 A: yeah 

458.42 463.57 B: it's 'cause you start figuring in how much you know how much money have i am i spending on cigarettes 

460.83 462.04 A: it costs 

463.19 464.29 A: yeah 

463.69 468.94 B: you know that i could go out to a movie or have a really nice dinner or go on vacation 

468.59 469.84 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

469.94 474.03 B: to so to me yeah telling somebody they can't smoke outside is kind of 

474.24 475.29 B: why 

475.38 477.04 A: yeah [laughter] 

475.92 479.65 B: [laughter] it just doesn't make any sense it's outside [noise] 

479.85 481.37 A: yep i agree 

480.78 484.85 B: what harm is it gonna cause that's too weird 

482.45 483.88 A: yep i agree 

484.60 486.44 A: (( i agree hundred percent )) 

485.35 488.55 B: well and i'm sure you probably i mean how old are you 

488.28 489.92 A: i'm twenty two right now 

489.32 491.24 B: well see i'm forty four 

491.75 495.37 B: and so i'm but i'm sure you've got friends that smoke 

494.96 496.29 A: oh yeah 

496.04 503.73 B: and i mean i've got friends at forty four that doesn't exactly smoke legal stuff [laughter] you know hi [laughter] 

500.17 502.27 A: (( yep [laughter] )) 

502.50 506.09 A: that's mostly that's mostly with the friends that i have [laughter] 

505.31 512.48 B: right but you have to stop and think i mean if they're gonna they roll their own tobacco you gonna what you gonna put a law against chewing 

512.01 513.10 A: yeah 

512.50 514.55 B: i mean they could use snuff 

514.14 515.37 A: yeah 

514.77 520.39 B: snuff is more di- it's more disgusting for me to have somebody spit something evil 

520.44 522.35 B: on the sidewalk in front of me 

522.00 523.09 A: yeah 

522.45 524.09 B: than to drop a cigarette butt 

524.06 525.41 A: yeah no kidding 

525.14 530.77 B: it's like [laughter] i would much prefer to stop and pick up their cigarette butt and throw it away [noise] 

525.81 527.00 A: disgusting 

530.86 535.67 B: than have to walk around some g- goop that's on the sidewalk 

535.25 536.38 A: yeah 

535.76 540.86 B: [laughter] you know that you step in and you're tracking across your floor in your car 

540.80 547.97 A: that stuff is gross so do you know is this is this really something that they're looking at doing is making this law about 

542.11 543.28 B: yeah 

547.41 548.90 B: in california 

548.44 552.59 A: or or just like anywhere else i mean in the in just public places 

551.04 557.68 B: california's the only place i've really heard about it 'cause i have a friend that lives in anaheim and she was telling me about it and she's a smoker 

557.27 558.33 A: yeah 

557.76 565.34 B: and she was like oh my god they're gonna like start pulling people over and giving them tickets if they smoke in their car and i said can you do that i mean is that legal 

565.56 567.45 A: huh uh well i wonder 

566.22 569.59 B: i mean how could you how could you pass a law like that 

568.90 578.86 A: i wonder if it's kind of along the same lines as the no talking on cellphones in the car just b- because it can become a distraction or something like the 

574.12 575.61 B: oh yeah please 

577.72 581.93 B: how many people do you know that talk on their phone while they drive their car 

581.57 583.13 A: a lot [laughter] 

582.34 590.78 B: yeah [laughter] so [laughter] oh yeah we're gonna pass we're gonna pass this law and you're not allowed to talk on your phone [noise] 

583.65 585.16 A: (( everybody )) 

585.70 587.08 A: everybody 

589.72 599.61 A: well and then well and then the other thing too is like a lot of the laws like and they they can't pull you over specifically for that but if they pull you over for something else and they you know
