294.89 295.70 B: i 

295.97 298.98 B: [laughter] i had no idea you could buy coupons on ebay 

298.62 310.97 A: yeah well it's it's weird because it's illegal to sell coupons so you have to put in your ebay thing you have to say i am not selling coupons you are bidding on my time to cut these coupons 

302.29 303.64 B: [noise] really 

310.82 323.14 A: because there's like this disclaimer on all coupons that says illegal to sell so that's how they get around it [mn] but yeah you can get i mean just type in anything that you regularly buy and i sw- [mn] coupons will probably come up for it [mn] [noise] 

322.44 328.70 B: [noise] yeah or probably something that you wouldn't usually buy i've seen some pretty nutty stuff on ebay 

328.32 330.64 A: mhm [laughter] totally 

329.68 334.49 B: but yeah that sounds like sounds like a fun hobby 

333.89 336.12 A: is that how you found out about this study 

336.16 337.75 B: (( [mn] uh no )) 

337.46 338.96 A: no oh okay 

338.63 350.21 B: actually uh my my sister told me about it but somebody that used to live at this number like signed up for it too so we did a couple of calls without getting paid for 'em just for fun 

350.00 351.12 A: (( oh oh )) 

350.47 352.99 B: so i kinda knew what was up anyways [noise] [noise] 

352.41 361.74 A: okay 'cause i i just was wondering because i heard about this study from um a board that trades coupons so i thought maybe [mn] maybe you were on there too yeah 

359.15 360.26 B: oh really 

361.06 365.06 B: i might i might start doing some secret shopping as a hobby too 

364.56 365.95 A: oh i do that too 

365.62 366.51 B: (( really ho- )) 

366.07 368.08 A: mhm i've found a lot of that 

367.45 368.75 B: how do you like it [noise] 

368.28 376.32 A: oh god i it's so easy it's so fun you kinda you'll you'll like start to figure out which ones you wanna do like certain companies make it too hard 

374.15 374.95 B: [noise] 

376.04 377.15 B: yeah 

376.49 381.34 A: where like they want so many details it's just ridiculous no one can remember all of that stuff 

380.93 382.04 B: yeah 

381.38 395.28 A: but then other companies are totally great to work for and you know totally worth the money [mn] just i mean it's just you know you you can't think of it as really making money it is really is like a side hobby for just a extra few dollars in your pocket 

386.79 387.74 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

392.39 393.60 B: yeah 

394.17 398.47 B: yeah well i mean sister said she made like five hundred bucks last month

398.82 399.74 B: yeah 

400.47 409.58 B: yeah so yeah she she always like you know goes looking at apartments and stuff like that but i mean [mn] five hundred dollars yeah 

407.03 407.89 A: (( wow )) 

408.06 412.98 A: wow i guess that's because yeah seattle probably has a lot of opportunity 

412.54 414.69 B: well she lives in philadelphia 

414.43 428.81 A: oh wow oh yeah that's a big city the bigger city you live in i know you have more opportunities since i live in a smaller town there isn't that much but you ah you should look into it 'cause it it can be lucrative especially if you're a student 'cause you can kinda bend your schedule a little bit 

419.83 420.83 B: yeah 

428.12 430.42 B: yeah well i i work at
