64.22 79.22 B: when i normally sew i i mostly sew women clothes like i might sew cl- ah suits and ah dresses pyjamas you know pants tops you know stuff like that right now i'm in the middle of um 

67.52 68.37 A: (( mhm )) 

79.61 94.26 B: a sewing project i'm getting ready to sew some curtains for my living room my bathroom and my kitchen so i'm out looking here and looking everywhere trying to find me the right curtains i haven't found the right material yet but i'm gonna keep looking and looking and looking so when people come to my house they're like 

94.18 98.31 B: oh you even haven't gotten your curtains yet i say i haven't found them yet [laughter] so 

97.52 108.85 A: [laughter] do so you basically i mean you don't go you don't rely on patterns you design your own stuff and this is what i want my curtains to like and you kind of [mn] you have the ability to visualize that and and just kind 

102.62 104.04 B: (( well i do rel- )) 

107.58 111.33 B: yeah i got the ability to do that but i do sew with a pattern also 

111.00 112.23 A: mhm 

111.60 118.08 B: and i do know a little bit about making my own patterns you know and i'm studying that a little bit more on my own 

115.24 116.04 A: okay 

118.35 130.95 B: you know you could do it on the computer or you could it yourself by hand but i wanna i'm gonna do both of 'em because i need to learn how to do that because i'm gonna be one day when you're expired fashion designers and you're probably hear my name 

130.65 131.79 A: (( ahah )) 

131.01 132.83 B: [laughter]

149.11 150.02 A: (( mhm )) 

149.38 156.43 B: and you know you have to take home economics so once you take that you know you you see that you like it and i liked it it was just a natural with me you know 

156.49 162.33 B: and i never thought about sewing for other people but every time i would sew something people would always try to get me sew 'em 

162.24 176.12 B: sew 'em what i made you know and usually i used to sew for myself i didn't want ah the reason why i sew for myself was because i didn't want nobody else having on the same outfit i had on [laughter] but now i don't care [laughter] 

164.31 164.87 A: (( [mn] ))

366.06 366.88 B: huh 

366.79 371.79 A: i said the first thing you mentioned was basketball there can i can can i assume you're a pistons fan 

372.21 374.08 B: (( i'm a what kind of fan )) 

373.82 375.10 A: a pistons 

375.40 382.15 B: pistons oh no no you know what the pistons are okay just like the detroit lions are okay you know they 

375.82 377.07 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

379.53 380.39 A: (( okay [mn] )) 

382.59 390.13 B: [laughter] you know have you have you not heard their history the pistons are better than the lions the lions are just you know we [mn] they're just hopeless 

389.79 396.08 A: it's been tough i know but i figured i i was gonna ask about the pistons because they've beaten my seventy sixers last week [mn] 

395.89 400.21 B: well somebody yesterday just beat them who who who is jason kidd 

399.96 401.52 A: that's new jersey 

400.96 408.64 B: okay he he oh see was it yesterday or the day before yesterday he he sunk a winning shot to beat the pistons 

408.24 410.10 A: yes yes he did 

409.51 411.16 B: yes he did [laughter] 

410.79 415.77 A: [mn] they get seven games though they could they could still i like the pistons' chances this year 

415.48 417.05 B: oh you like their chances this year 

416.45 425.69 A: i like their chances they're they're from the last week when they're when they were playing philadelphia and i'm about a hundred miles from philadelphia so that's kind of my home n._b._a. team 

421.02 422.04 B: mhm 

425.11 426.08 B: mhm 

425.90 430.53 A: so but that was um yeah they i think they they think they got a pretty good team there 

430.68 435.93 B: so is the reason why you like the pistons is because you were originally from ah michigan is the rea- 

435.05 438.09 A: oh no no like i said i i i like the seventy sixers 

437.66 439.27 B: oh you like the seventy sixers 

438.52 444.59 A: yeah it was um it just ah it was just i asked about the pistons because they just beat the seventy sixers 

444.42 445.65 B: oh okay 

445.19 449.52 A: so we are no longer in the playoffs because of your guys [laughter] 

447.81 451.88 B: 'cause ah the pistons knocked them out you know what i i guess i 

449.85 450.68 A: yeah 

451.96 461.89 B: i like basketball but i just haven't decided about um even a favorite team even the pistons 'cause the pistons you know i live in michigan they're not me favorite team i guess i have to look at a team 

461.98 467.16 B: and look at the players and then i'll decide if i like that team or not and i don't care where they live at huh 

465.33 466.44 A: (( i tell you there's )) 

466.56 473.74 A: i just had another thought about another hobby that's something that's not too not too far from you probably a couple of hours drive i love roller coasters

474.89 477.91 A: and one of my favorite places to go is cedar point 

477.43 479.31 B: oh yeah

489.99 491.45 A: oh is it that far 

492.50 493.58 A: (( okay okay ))
