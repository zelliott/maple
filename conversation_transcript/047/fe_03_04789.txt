0.30 2.48 B: (( hi this is haviere )) 

2.29 3.96 A: hi this is joseph 

3.94 5.08 B: hi joseph 

5.28 6.11 A: hey 

6.12 6.73 B: (( [noise] )) 

7.29 10.54 B: so this is actually my first time so i guess we just dive in 

10.59 12.30 A: yeah it's mine as well 

12.16 25.17 B: okay um well to start off i guess [noise] um i'm a former smoker um and was just in new york recently um after they've passed the no smoking in public s- 

25.31 28.97 B: places um [sigh] legislation there 

26.51 27.89 A: right [noise] 

29.02 31.49 B: um so what's your feeling on 

31.87 35.60 A: well i have i'm an ex smoker as well and um 

35.81 39.01 A: i actually lived in california prior to 

39.16 40.00 A: um 

41.34 43.68 B: (( that )) 

41.60 42.71 A: (( [noise] )) 

42.88 57.67 A: i lived in california when uh they banned smoking in public places there and i i prefer not being inundated with cigarette smoke even as a smoker i didn't feel like uh it was that big of a deal to go outside or to smoke 

47.21 49.00 B: mhm 

57.16 58.66 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

57.61 60.20 A: w- in an area where there is uh 

61.26 63.14 A: you know smoking's allowed 

63.03 64.84 B: yeah i agree um 

65.04 68.63 B: ev- [mn] there is there's one thing and i had to 

68.92 77.31 B: there's one memory in particular that was well actually i was in california for a while too and i found it upsetting then i think i was i was younger and i was beginning to smoke 

77.13 85.74 B: so i was generally not happy with the idea that i'd have to ask permission if i were in an outdoor cafe to light a cigarette 

85.60 99.81 B: um and that i found somewhat irritating 'cause i figured if i was outside i should be able to smoke whenever i wanted to even though i was in the confines of some establishment um but in new york maybe because i'm older maybe because i'm at the point where i've quit 

99.61 103.79 B: um i'm actually kind of happy to be at a bar 

103.60 110.21 B: where there's no smoking but a little upset that people can't smoke in restaurants believe it or not 

109.99 113.06 B: um 'cause i feel i'm not so 

112.85 125.07 B: militant about banning smoking in restaurants even though i generally don't like when people smoke at my table but i can appreciate why someone would want to casually have a cigarette after a nice meal um 

125.01 138.85 B: and and that i think it's probably a little bit more offensive to ask a patron to step outside from a dinner table to light a cigarette then than to have someone do so in a bar but i think that's just my own particular quirk 

138.24 144.89 A: yeah i i i mean can just totally appreciate why someone would wanna smoke after after dinner but you know 

144.99 152.74 A: if there are kids in that restaurant then i don't want a child being you know inflicted with cigarette smoke and you know if it's outside it's outside 

152.20 154.78 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right no i understand )) 

153.55 156.87 A: um i think if smokers were a little bit more um 

155.15 157.47 B: (( that )) 

156.99 165.06 A: [lipsmack] tolerant of non smokers the world be a much better place it's it's not their god given right to be able to light up and smoke 

164.85 166.09 B: (( [noise] [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

165.49 168.41 A: you know and and it is it is a privilege so 

168.85 171.00 B: how do you see it as a privilege 

170.98 173.31 A: well i mean you you um 

173.67 177.27 A: i guess privilege is probably the ba- a bad word for it it's you know 

177.42 180.84 A: you don't ha- it's you know you don't have to smoke to stay alive 

180.77 182.40 B: no right 

181.10 188.69 A: so you you um it is it is a luxury i should say not really a privilege to smoke and you know 

189.70 193.79 A: i- if you wanna smoke then then you should have to pay for 

193.87 198.50 A: you know your health costs i shouldn't have to take care of you when you're older you know it's like 

195.05 196.00 B: [noise] 

198.31 212.24 A: you know if you wanna drink i should i shouldn't have to pay for you know the public shouldn't have to pay for treatment for you over and over and over again i mean there has to be some personal accountability and it and i think most smokers um who 

212.18 217.01 A: you know that i'm friends with are really respectful of their space around them 

216.64 218.97 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

217.50 219.80 A: and not so self indulgent 

220.32 223.66 B: as self indulgent as 

223.70 233.18 A: well well you know that it's you know just i smoke therefore you know i can smoke wherever i want to or it doesn't really matter who's around me just more self centered 

223.96 224.57 B: (( [noise] )) 

233.19 236.86 B: right right it's interesting that you oh go i'm sorry go ahead 

234.26 235.02 A: and 

237.12 239.14 A: so i i just don't um 

240.22 251.72 A: you know i and and even as a smoker that's the way i was i i was very conscious of people around me and being you know not wanting to affect my my ha- bad habits 

251.86 258.86 A: to affect people around me a- or impact them in a way that was negative for them because it is a bad habit 

255.94 256.51 B: (( [noise] )) 

257.42 260.10 B: (( right )) 

259.01 260.75 A: you know it's not healthy 

260.86 264.91 A: it's it's you know p- secondhand smoke isn't good for other people 

265.07 268.71 A: you know the smoke going into my own lungs wasn't good for me and 

267.91 269.21 B: (( [noise] right [mn] )) 

269.04 272.90 A: so i i didn't feel i- it was right for me to inflict that upon anyone [mn] 

271.91 276.51 B: i suppose i mean i'm i'm less willing to um 

277.87 283.56 B: [sigh] as far as an idea that's going to tell people what to do mostly because i mean 

283.66 290.56 B: [noise] whether one person thinks it's a bad habit somebody else thinks it's relaxing and i it's far be it for me to determine whether 

290.40 294.23 B: someone smoking is a bad habit or just a form of relief and i 

294.04 307.56 B: and i'm hesitant to indulge any kind of conversation not not necessarily with you but any discourse would empower an institution i.e. the government to tell people not to do something like that i mean i don't 

307.35 313.29 B: i've quit smoking because i think it's unhealthy um and i don't wanna be a smoker and i don't wanna have certain 

313.33 322.06 B: things related with people who smoke when i'm older but that doesn't mean that i should i don't feel comfortable let's say um 

322.07 327.27 B: preventing other people from doing what they want to do with their body [noise] [noise] 

324.99 333.03 A: i don't b- i don't i don't believe the government has any in telling anyone i mean i think it public places is is one thing passing laws 

332.27 332.87 B: (( [noise] )) 

333.47 342.16 A: i- is one thing but as far as smoking i think everyone has that right to has the right to smoke but i i guess i'm talking more personally you know 

342.82 344.31 B: mhm 

342.89 348.11 A: people being responsible for their own actions so that the government doesn't feel the need to step in 

348.28 355.88 A: you know if smokers were more tolerant of non smokers and respectful then you know the g- this wouldn't be an issue 

350.32 350.94 B: (( [noise] )) 

355.85 358.32 B: yeah you're right [sigh] you're right 

357.33 361.21 A: so i and and the and and i'm not you know i don't want the government 

361.31 362.19 A: you know 

362.32 365.39 A: doing things that they really don't need to be doing 

365.21 368.45 B: [noise] no it's just it seems like it's a fine line where 

368.40 372.83 B: where one determines [mn] you know what is polite or what is 

372.68 382.27 B: common courtesy and you know what should we leave up to the individual to determine for himself at his own discretion well this seems to be like uh i'm crossing a line 

382.05 394.34 B: or this is something that the state needs to legislate over because people seem to be abusing as you put it a a privilege or a luxury um and i guess where it becomes [noise] that that's where it becomes 

394.72 398.73 B: touchy conversation because it really brings up issues of you know [mn] 

398.84 402.56 B: at a very extreme level i think fascism where you do have you know 

402.89 414.99 B: on a on a very black and white way you do have uh you know in new york for example they're telling you you can't smoke in certain places even though the or you're telling owners of establishments that they can't allow their patrons to smoke 

414.83 421.10 B: even though they may very well want them to be smokers and they may want everybody in the establishment to be a smoker 

421.00 431.30 B: um but the state is preventing them from running their business as they want to so it's you know it brings up an interesting issue that way i think [sigh] um 

431.87 434.41 B: (( i don't know [sigh] it's [noise] )) 

433.48 441.19 A: well i mean i mean i think uh you know as far as smoking in in bars and restaurants i don't really i mean bars i think 

441.10 448.49 A: uh [mn] for me it all comes down to ventilation if something's really well ventilated then the fact that people are smoking is not a huge issue 

448.23 449.19 B: mhm 

448.62 457.24 A: but for the most you know the the because i live in oregon and it's not it's illegal to smoke in a restaurant but you can smoke in bars 

456.71 460.60 B: mhm 

458.12 458.98 A: um 

459.96 461.41 A: you know i i also 

461.55 467.90 A: uh and i'm not a ba- you know i don't think i don't think uh i think a lot has been done in this area without legislation 

468.50 471.22 B: yeah and i'm i i 

468.74 469.59 A: um 

469.90 472.33 A: you know i think socially it's it's 

472.75 480.15 A: you know what's crazy is that slowly little by little people who smoke are killing themselves and the people around them 

480.64 483.00 A: you know that's that is so 

480.77 482.94 B: (( right [noise] )) 

483.26 495.68 A: you know if someone wants to continue their habit and i'm i'm you know if someone wants to do drugs that's fine do them i have no i i have no problem with that i think it should be completely legal but 

496.15 500.65 A: when it when it starts to infringe upon my health or [mn] 

500.89 506.88 A: [mn] a child's health or you know someone who's someone who chooses not to do that then uh you know 

507.71 511.24 A: who who is supposed to step in and say that's not okay [mn] 

511.18 516.67 B: right i mean that's the you're you're absolutely right it it reminds me of an issue with um marijuana 

516.68 521.83 B: legislation in the country which is you know illegal um but a lot of people have made arguments 

521.80 524.85 A: i live in a state where medical marijuana is legal 

521.96 522.68 B: (( yeah )) 

524.53 535.26 B: okay well that's right w- well working from the general purposes like recreational use of marijuana is illegal a lot of people have thought that perhaps it wouldn't it shouldn't be illegal if 

535.18 539.88 B: you because the effects of marijuana in comparison to other drugs 

539.75 543.86 B: uh some of the heavier drugs like cocaine for example are 

543.71 549.04 B: not as intense that if you grow the marijuana and you don't 

548.83 556.49 B: um and you don't fund from sort of illegal drug trafficking system that it should be okay 

556.29 569.92 B: um which seems you know an issue relevant to what you're saying where y- you know if there's certain boundaries that we hold as far as cigarette smoke is concerned where they don't it doesn't harm other people then whatever you do to yourself is okay in u- [mn] 

569.81 575.01 B: working off the analogy w- from the analogy of the marijuana which is if i'm not funding 

575.03 584.54 B: you know the drug dealer on the corner who is selling to five year olds and is supporting some criminal regime in some other country so that i can have my pot 

584.33 591.71 B: but i grow it in my backyard then i should be able to h- to grow it and it's an interesting thing it's just again it it seems like such a slippery um 

592.00 599.95 B: a slippery line to draw between w- you know because most well some people will probably not have a hard time knowing when
