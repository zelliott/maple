7.61 9.96 A: i'm from chicago where are you from 

9.54 11.02 B: oh central p._a. 

10.84 12.80 A: oh okay have you done this before 

12.76 15.15 B: uh first time yesterday actually [lipsmack] 

14.67 17.23 A: all right well this is my first time today [laughter] 

16.69 20.58 B: okay yeah i guess so i'm just hopeful that they pay you know [laughter] 

17.27 18.67 A: (( so i'm )) 

19.92 23.36 A: yeah exactly so i don't i 

22.28 24.70 B: anyway uh smokey you know 

23.52 25.78 A: i haven't what's that 

25.22 26.65 B: do you smoke 

26.35 27.71 A: oh yes i do do you 

27.84 29.58 B: no i don't i don't 

28.64 29.48 A: oh 

29.66 32.96 A: no i'm a smoker from way back and um 

33.47 38.58 A: there's i'm not really too happy about uh them trying to ban it in public places 

37.99 40.43 B: yeah i can imagine it's gonna make it difficult for ya 

40.08 42.09 A: oh yeah big time 

42.06 47.24 B: now does uh chicago have anything similar to new york i know new york was you know full out uh 

47.56 49.53 B: you know banning it what not 

48.97 54.63 A: right well they're thinking about it they're [noise] they're trying to pass some legislation but it keeps getting voted down [noise] 

54.34 55.17 B: okay 

55.10 56.69 A: (( so [noise] it )) 

55.79 58.53 B: but you can still smoke in restaurants there or 

58.54 63.96 A: yes oh yeah th- they're like they're just where they have their uh regulated designated smoking areas 

59.92 60.73 B: okay 

63.84 64.56 B: (( okay )) 

64.78 71.86 A: but um [lipsmack] i think for me w- my uh wife doesn't smoke so when we go out i go in the non smoking section anyway 

71.72 73.39 B: yeah yeah 

72.15 81.91 A: [cough] so it doesn't bother me either or it's just the uh the principle that matters i think you should be able to have a choice if you're a smoker if you wanna smoke go for it 

81.67 86.88 B: okay okay yeah here uh in central p._a. it's like uh the chain the chain uh restaurants 

86.67 97.26 B: um you know the fast food and what not they don't have any smoking sections but like the lower uh you know the mom and pop restaurants they uh they still have sections but most the places are you know generally non smoking just 

92.99 93.59 A: (( mm )) 

97.39 104.06 A: right well i think now they're trying to ban it in all public places so i guess that means that even if you're walking down the street you're not allowed to smoke 

103.42 105.50 B: [mn] yeah yeah 

104.91 112.96 A: well i guess the next place is gonna they're gonna try to get into your car and then get into your home and [laughter] when's it gonna stop 

108.95 110.27 B: [laughter] 

112.47 116.75 B: yeah so uh [lipsmack] how do you deal with that at work do you have smoke breaks or 

116.47 126.30 A: yeah i get smoke breaks at work yeah i'm i'm a [noise] manager so you know i get a [laughter] i pretty much can smoke wherever or whenever i want 

118.29 119.17 B: okay 

121.29 122.33 B: (( oh okay )) 

125.75 127.61 B: that works or 

126.48 128.56 A: (( yeah yeah i suppose not too bad )) 

128.15 130.99 B: (( so you well you have to go outside the uh business to do it oh )) 

129.41 132.93 A: yeah we do have to go outside it's a non smoking building [noise] 

134.07 136.27 A: how do they do it at uh your company 

134.26 135.27 B: (( maybe if i [mn] )) 

136.55 138.81 B: (( oh i'm still in college so i'm )) 

137.77 138.75 A: oh okay 

139.12 140.80 B: not too worried about it 

140.22 142.80 A: (( no [laughter] not yet )) 

141.87 144.09 B: yeah yeah 

142.81 145.86 A: yeah well since you're a non smoker anyway so it really wouldn't matter 

145.72 150.43 B: yeah yeah it's just uh i don't see i don't mind it i mean the other people smoking is uh 

150.45 152.69 B: (( you know i've grown up with it and so )) 

152.90 154.06 B: (( i don't know )) 

153.97 155.29 A: mhm 

154.70 157.44 B: uh what they did at my school was now they used to have uh 

157.77 171.56 B: at outside of um outside of buildings like immediately outside the buildings so the problem is uh pretty much all the exits i mean these buildings hold you know a couple of thousand people and all these exits have become pretty uh popular so there's a lot of smokers outside of 'em and now uh 

166.67 167.55 A: (( [noise] right )) 

171.53 178.28 B: the complain 'cause they have to walk through it so now they have a law out there uh i i- it's just campus policy i guess that you uh 

177.29 178.62 A: right 

178.32 181.38 B: to have you have to be twenty five feet away from any building now 

181.32 188.08 A: yeah well that makes sense because if you're not if i was a non smoker i wouldn't wanna walk through a uh a cloud of smoke to get to any of my uh buildings either 

186.42 187.55 B: yeah 

188.18 192.72 B: so what's they that's twenty five feet which uh is real loosely enforced [noise] 

192.45 201.62 A: mhm [lipsmack] yeah well i figure as long as they have the uh fight for the rights of the non smokers they might as well fight as hard for the rights of smokers 

201.19 202.47 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

202.41 208.53 A: so the old joke is uh we pay more taxes and have shorter lives so our voices should be heard [laughter] 

206.75 207.99 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

209.90 214.58 B: yeah well if uh i don't know it's uh it's interesting between uh you know 

214.75 218.19 B: the rights of the smoker versus the rights of the non smokers [lipsmack] 

218.34 220.04 A: right well even if 

219.31 220.13 B: because 

220.08 227.28 A: uh i figure just a basic human rights i mean if you're if you're gonna ban it from uh for one group 

227.31 230.63 A: then uh you know what's what's the check and balance there 

230.43 239.08 B: yeah yeah it's tough though it's one of the things you know it is your own body and what not but uh like still with the issue of second hand smoke which is uh 

239.21 241.71 B: which kind of negates that 

241.07 242.09 A: that's true 

243.23 249.24 A: so yeah i guess there is all you could do is just do you uh are you an activist or anything do you go out and 

248.65 252.78 B: uh not not no i really don't i couldn't care less about smoking to be honest with you 

252.67 254.45 A: what about uh other things 

254.03 266.05 B: other things yeah i mean not not so much uh you know i'm big individual rights and uh you know uh on the same lines i could see i can sympathize with smokers you know stay out of my business and uh just let me do what i do in private whatever 

262.13 263.38 A: mhm 

265.86 267.69 A: right see but it's 

266.69 281.04 B: but even in public uh they i mean i don't know i i i don't get mad with the smoking section i don't i don't see like any bans on it like honestly bars i understand that you know i come to accept that when i go to a bar it's gonna be smokey and uh it's just the way it is but uh 

280.20 281.86 A: right 

281.46 288.02 B: i don't see how that should be different with any bus- other business like uh you should know if it's gonna be smokey or not in there and you have the choice to go in and 

287.60 295.23 A: [noise] exactly i don't see them banning people who uh don't drink from going into the bars you know they're not complaining that there's alcohol there 

288.26 289.00 B: (( yeah )) 

292.51 293.97 B: yeah yeah 

295.29 298.76 A: so i don't see why uh non smokers should be complaining [noise] [noise] 

295.48 296.34 B: yeah 

299.73 300.86 B: exactly 

302.34 306.21 A: so how long does this thing go for do we just keep talking for ten minutes or [laughter] 

304.08 310.14 B: uh a few more minutes yeah yesterday just cut off real abruptly it said ten minutes and then uh 

310.16 313.17 B: you have thirty seconds to say goodbye and that's about it 

312.68 316.51 A: okay and then that's it it's just [noise] they they hang up on you or 

315.92 322.91 B: yeah yeah that's it it's like say thirty seconds to say goodbye you can place comments afterwards if you want but like i never did that 

320.44 321.14 A: mhm 

322.00 324.52 A: okay oh yeah i ho- i hope they pay 

324.78 327.78 A: this as i said this is my first call so [laughter] 

324.97 326.33 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

327.76 337.29 B: uh th- in fact it's pretty painless you know they just call it's it's real random though 'cause uh i i gave 'em a time and you know what not and i'm like when i can do it and stuff but it's just out of the blue when they call 

336.99 340.93 A: mm yeah yeah i just signed up the day uh the day before yesterday so 

338.31 339.10 B: so 

341.66 345.63 A: i found the ad in a news group and i figured oh what the hell i'd give it a try 

345.47 352.67 B: yeah yeah yeah i mean it doesn't look that publicized but it's obviously pretty big if they do all these random callings you know and so and match people up 

352.82 356.95 A: yeah well if it's legitimate in the university i'm sure they've got the funding for it 

356.39 358.40 B: yeah yeah 

358.72 364.27 B: it's about the university of penn too you know so pretty well known school it's university of penn too pretty well known school 

360.94 362.05 A: what's that 

363.78 365.50 A: oh yeah 

364.67 365.99 B: and everything 

366.65 371.48 B: [lipsmack] but uh yeah i mean i think we've covered smoking as much as we can [laughter] 

370.10 371.92 A: i think so too [laughter] 

372.60 378.43 A: i think we did pretty well with the allotted time so now we've just gotta finish cooking here [noise] 

375.04 376.12 B: good 

378.10 379.13 B: (( [laughter] )) 

380.35 382.10 B: so what kind of manager are ya 

381.99 385.35 A: i manage a cargo warehouse for an airline [noise] 

385.49 386.16 B: (( okay )) 

386.07 387.55 A: i work over at o'hara 

387.73 388.60 B: okay 

388.10 396.49 A: and i'm also going to school as a student studying computers web design graphic design things of that nature [noise] 

395.02 395.94 B: okay 

397.17 398.24 B: keep you busy 

397.95 400.42 A: oh yeah like you wouldn't believe 

400.13 401.34 B: [laughter] 

402.04 402.84 B: (( um )) 

402.22 409.18 A: especially uh when was it the other day last week chicago was doing that uh security testing 

408.95 409.83 B: okay 

409.87 417.31 A: so since we're right at the airport they decided to send the uh drugs that they were waiting for 

417.09 418.19 B: yeah 

417.63 419.21 A: through our warehouse 

419.24 420.46 B: oh 

419.59 421.97 A: uh so yeah so that was fun having 

422.14 426.58 A: you know interrupt our flights and everything we were on a tight schedule as it is 

426.36 427.48 B: yeah oh man 

427.32 430.68 A: yeah but uh it was pretty interesting 

430.22 431.01 B: huh 

432.50 443.20 B: that is uh do you notice the difference when they uh you know i to me uh it doesn't make a bit of difference for me increase the terror alerts and uh the different levels or what not but do you do you have different protocols when things change or 

443.36 448.55 A: [noise] y- well for us not really because our security is high all the time anyway it doesn't really matter 

446.48 447.28 B: yeah 

448.71 458.35 A: but uh in general yeah i guess people get a little bit more tense for like the first few days of when it gets goes a bit higher but then everything goes back to normal 

448.77 449.46 B: (( okay )) 

456.38 457.36 B: yeah 

458.15 459.08 B: okay 

459.07 462.64 A: so i mean it's that's either good or bad depends on how you look at it 

461.87 464.64 B: yeah yeah 

464.28 468.07 A: you know hopefully the people that are supposed to be watching out are watching out [noise] 

467.75 470.10 B: yeah it's all up at the high now again 

472.28 474.25 A: r- i'm sorry what was that 

473.77 478.80 B: i saw the level's up to high again uh the last couple of days they put it up yeah yeah 

475.72 476.59 A: oh yeah 

478.30 480.83 A: yeah with those uh bombings in afghanistan 

480.91 481.94 B: (( oh i )) 

482.68 487.99 B: (( guess we were at like within the last couple of hours uh i heard there was some kind of explosion at yale law school )) 

487.51 489.21 A: mhm 

488.69 494.57 B: but i don't know the way they described it it looked like it had barely cleared out a classroom or maybe two it seems severe 

495.19 497.90 A: yeah what was it uh like a pipe bomb or 

497.45 511.25 B: yeah they they they don't i don't think they're trying to say pipe bomb you know but [noise] that's what they uh they didn't really say that but i don't know it got people scared um but yeah it really seemed like it but it did knock out the windows no structural damage you know something small 

504.51 505.45 A: yeah 

510.80 511.55 A: (( mm )) 

512.04 513.02 B: but uh 

512.41 516.05 A: [noise] well i guess if you're gonna have to get bombed uh that's the best way to have it 

515.35 520.30 B: [laughter] yeah don't make a big deal over you know not much of uh anything 

516.53 518.66 A: um [laughter] yeah 

519.75 521.70 A: something nice and small 

522.01 526.86 B: yeah and then no one's in the you know it's just a you know a deserted classroom essentially 

526.26 526.98 A: (( hm )) 

527.11 527.97 B: so 

528.65 531.18 B: (( we'll see how that pans out )) 

531.67 534.97 A: yep i think they're letting us go over our time here 

535.36 538.72 B: yeah is it i i'm not keeping track what uh 

537.72 541.61 A: i wasn't either but i know it's gotta be at least past ten minutes by now 

541.59 545.70 B: yeah the the honestly it's like it's real abrupt they just someone just comes on the line and says 

546.42 548.01 B: pretty much any second now 

547.86 549.00 A: probably 

550.29 552.35 A: good i can finish up here 

554.32 555.85 A: (( [noise] )) 

555.95 558.11 A: yeah actually they called a little bit early today
