46.14 48.83 B: that i understand but 

49.79 50.82 B: you know 

51.05 57.61 B: i think they should get on other people for drinking [laughter] versus smoking [laughter] 

54.35 69.35 A: mhm well i guess the thing is when somebody's drinking a bottle of beer or whatever it ah the next person next to them doesn't necessarily have to drink it as well but when you're smoking everybody else has gotta smoke it too 

68.88 78.99 B: it does irritate people and i always did respect people that did not smoke and matter of fact i don't even smoke in my home i smoke in my garage [laughter] 

76.37 78.01 A: (( mhm )) 

78.61 81.02 A: you smoke in your garage instead of your home

91.86 93.90 B: oh yes i would smell it 

93.71 94.62 A: uh-huh 

94.11 104.03 B: yes yes i'd definitely that nope no we've always been very honest with them and always told them it wrong and it's not nice and 

95.17 97.51 A: but they wouldn't try and keep it from you though 

100.10 103.23 A: mhm 

103.39 117.93 A: right [noise] ha well i mean it's funny 'cause i grew up ah both my parents did smoke and um my um and only one of my brothers i have three brothers actually um only one of my brothers um 

118.24 125.54 A: took it up at some point but then later on in life i just as a casual thing you know i'd hang out with some friends of mine and i started smoking a little 

125.51 131.53 A: and i'd say at this point i'm not a regular smoker by any means i haven't smoked a cigarette in a few months or so 

131.10 132.05 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

131.44 141.99 A: but you know when i'm hanging out with the right people i'll definitely smoke a cigarette and enjoy that and so it's just kind of interesting that [mn] having grown up with it and i was so anti smoking 

136.25 137.42 B: yeah 

141.67 143.34 B: yeah 

142.22 151.09 A: um because of my parents smoking that that now i'll like i guess maybe it's kind of a bit i still feel slightly rebellious or something 'cause i was so straight laced 

150.77 152.94 B: [laughter] yeah 

151.32 156.01 A: [laughter] that that it does have that symbol of being the rebellious thing 

155.68 165.48 B: yeah well what irritates me most actually is they want you to quit smoking but they make it impossible for you to afford to quit smoking 

165.29 166.04 A: (( how's )) 

166.49 172.26 B: well in order like to get the patches or the nicorette stuff i mean it's around fifty bucks 

170.94 174.38 A: that yeah but i guess 

174.49 183.03 A: i mean i'm not saying that that believe me i i i think many things are too expensive but i guess at least in new york a pack of cigarettes costs seven dollars 

176.78 177.79 B: [laughter] 

182.57 183.68 B: well 

183.89 191.11 B: we can still get a carton well we get ours from delaware but we only pay twenty dollars a carton still and that's name brand 

187.07 187.96 A: uh-huh 

189.11 190.25 A: i see 

191.00 195.12 A: right but you know i guess in the end if you if you spend the 

195.28 204.01 A: i don't know what the hundred dollars or whatever it would take to um to do the patch thing or something like that over a few months that would pay for itself 

200.22 201.79 B: uh-huh right 

203.71 208.06 B: oh well it does but it doesn't [laughter] [laughter] 

205.40 219.20 A: [laughter] not counting the food you have to eat because you're you're doing something else and the other things you have to do because you're trying not to not to smoke yeah [lipsmack] no it is it is a tough thing to do in fact at some point 

211.03 215.28 B: absolutely i don't want the weight gain either [laughter] 

219.19 228.50 A: i i felt like i was smoking too much and i definitely felt like i had to cut back or stop for a little while because it was just like oh i don't wanna become a smoker and then 

228.15 229.06 B: yeah 

229.20 230.09 A: um 

229.21 232.18 B: now can you smoke in new york freely or no 

231.66 233.97 A: no no you um 

233.91 241.20 A: you pretty much have to just step outside anywhere i mean you can smoke in your in the privacy of your home but they they 

239.03 240.19 B: mhm 

241.05 255.75 A: a law recently i think it was the beginning of this year that was banned smoking in any workplace so that means any restaurant any even there's no more like smoking in specific sections in restaurants or 

253.98 254.73 B: yes 

255.66 262.38 A: anywhere that you think you generally think well it's reasonable to smoke there you can't because somebody's working there

278.88 281.25 B: basketball games nothing [laughter] 

281.40 284.31 A: well i think that's pretty reasonable 

282.15 283.77 B: they banned it they were 

284.24 290.34 B: well i do but when you're out in the open you know you should be allowed to do what you wanna do 

285.17 286.27 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

290.10 295.49 A: [noise] i guess but i guess it's i mean it goes into the do you wanna be doing it around the children 

295.15 300.85 B: yeah yeah well of the things that children do nowadays [laughter] 

296.29 297.19 A: (( um ))

317.85 319.74 B: right yes yes 

320.00 325.63 B: you know and i think they should get on the drugs more than the cigarettes for as far as the young kids are concerned 

325.64 336.07 A: well you want my opinion i think the best way to do anything about drugs and all all of that is exactly what they're doing with cigarettes is first of all make it legal so that you can regulate it and make it hard 

335.66 337.97 B: right right right 

337.08 338.83 A: def- so 

338.64 342.99 B: you know and i have i have no problems i mean if you wanna smoke that's your own 

343.04 348.26 B: thing but everybody's passing the laws are probably non smokers or smokers that quit 

347.98 349.75 A: mhm 

348.49 351.69 B: you know and that that irritates me like crazy 

352.04 353.52 B: it does i mean

376.25 378.77 A: i guess they're making it harder now for 

378.78 381.11 A: people to start that young at least 

380.45 383.97 B: well i know a lot of parents that will buy it for their children 

383.55 384.78 A: (( [lipsmack] is that true ))

409.10 421.88 A: [laughter] well good for you [laughter] does any of this um imposition on you these laws and these regulating you to certain areas 

412.90 414.26 B: no i don't 

414.88 415.58 B: i 

421.81 424.94 A: make you think oh it would be easier if i didn't smoke 

424.37 427.05 B: no actually i adapted very well 

426.77 427.69 A: uh-huh 

427.14 430.82 B: i mean i would be the one that'd be smoking in a restaurant or 

430.91 433.58 B: out anywhere else but i adapted 

432.57 433.90 A: and if they 

433.95 436.77 A: if they cost you seven dollars a pack

445.59 447.28 A: right 

446.89 454.14 B: you know and it's i guess that's my desire to wanna do that you know just like a drinker or a drug addict or whatever 

451.05 452.40 A: right 

453.67 462.61 A: [noise] [noise] do you th- do you think it would um i'm just curious you know if [noise] 'cause i think that's one of the points of all of these laws is to make it 

463.34 471.27 A: somewhat harder for people to do it and ultimately i mean i'm trying to give everybody the benefit of the doubt that one of the reasons that they're 

465.24 466.10 B: uh-huh 

471.62 477.56 A: they wanna do all this is for public safety public health purposes and you know to to get rid of smoking all together 

474.91 475.85 B: (( right [noise] )) 

477.81 488.90 A: um wh- you know what what do you think would what kind of law could be passed that would make you say all right enough already i'm just gonna give this up 

488.19 489.90 B: absolutely nothing 

490.20 492.43 A: if it cost you fifteen dollars a pack 

492.47 493.10 B: (( uh-uh )) 

493.89 497.19 B: [laughter] i probably would still do it [laughter] 

496.46 498.17 A: yeah 

497.21 502.60 B: i mean since they did raise the price of cigarettes i did cut down substantially 

502.19 503.08 A: did you 

502.66 512.37 B: yes i have you know i used to be like a pack pack and a half a day now i'm down to about ten cigarettes a day you know due to the money aspect of it 

503.73 505.05 A: mhm 

509.49 510.50 A: mhm 

512.45 519.40 B: but i still have no desire whatsoever to quit and i don't think anything they put in effect will make me want to quit 

519.00 519.80 A: (( mm )) 

520.90 521.87 B: (( or it )) 

521.18 524.26 A: did your family did your parents smoke

531.20 533.65 A: [laughter] 

531.97 535.17 B: [laughter] you know but it 

535.22 539.13 A: well what would you say to your kids if they if you found them smoking 

538.97 542.08 B: i would advise them fully against it 

542.67 544.29 B: and i 

544.82 548.67 B: you know i would not disallow it i would 

547.50 549.26 A: mhm 

549.54 552.29 B: kindly tell them i'd prefer them not do it 

552.07 554.17 A: you think you'd be angry 

553.33 554.37 B: (( no mm )) 

554.38 556.12 A: yeah

569.39 571.16 A: right

573.21 576.69 A: right well obviously i mean you're a good parent and you know 

577.00 581.21 A: [noise] people make their own choices when they're become adults so
