0.35 2.22 A: hi i'm howard 

1.67 3.26 B: hi i'm laura 

2.94 4.33 A: hi laura 

3.81 4.67 B: hi 

4.55 7.72 A: well what interests you about smoking 

7.19 9.43 B: okay well first of all i'm a smoker 

9.02 10.24 A: okay 

10.62 14.89 A: so so tell so tell me about how that effects the way you think about it 

11.21 12.18 B: [laughter] 

14.96 19.65 B: as far as public places like restaurants malls grocery stores 

17.79 18.66 A: yeah 

19.29 20.36 A: yeah 

19.78 23.15 B: i don't think you know that smoking should be allowed 

22.80 23.69 A: uh-huh 

23.54 28.25 B: even coming from a smoker because it's kind of rude to non smokers 

25.03 25.92 A: yeah 

27.72 40.91 A: right well what about what about the idea let's say there was like you know i don't know a bar right and the bar's like you know they say out front hey smokers welcome okay so it's perfectly clear to everybody walking in the bar 

28.75 29.63 B: um 

37.79 38.71 B: [laughter] 

40.72 44.13 A: hey this is a place friendly to smokers and smoking 

44.20 55.83 A: should should do you think there should we should be able to make laws that say you know you c- ah the in fact le- even further i'll go and say that i heard a guy who owns a tobacco shop said [mn] a 

54.61 55.33 B: (( [cough] )) 

56.10 60.56 A: a person can come in here and buy tobacco but they can't smoke it in the store 

60.94 61.94 B: right 

61.57 76.17 A: yeah so so do you think we should be able to like you know make laws that say you know you can't you just you know doesn't matter what even if you want designate this is a place by and for smokers you just can't have smoking there 

76.49 79.43 A: because the public is some sense welcome 

79.91 84.14 B: right so what are you saying like smokers welcome but like non smokers aren't 

83.54 95.49 A: no no i'm saying non smokers are welcome but anybody who walks in you know knows that okay i'm gonna go in and i'm going to experience a somewhat smokey environment 'cause this is a place that's friendly to smokers 

84.26 85.10 B: or 

85.28 87.35 B: it's up to the non smokers 

92.10 93.09 B: right 

95.11 95.98 B: right 

95.32 106.47 A: so i gu- you know the reason i think they've been able to like you know create these laws that say you know you can't smoke you can't you can't even have a restaurant where smoking is allowed at all 

106.14 107.45 B: right 

106.28 111.90 A: whether ah is that people who work in the restaurant the innocent people who work in the restaurant 

111.24 111.96 B: [laughter] 

111.96 115.48 A: you know suffer from the effects of the smoking okay 

114.55 115.57 B: right 

115.63 123.25 A: (( ah and yet when i think to when i think about it i go well wait a minute you know if every um you know there's there's this )) 

123.63 131.92 A: in this society now most people don't smoke and most establishments therefore you know cater to the people who don't smoke and so 

132.00 141.73 A: if somebody wants to take a job at a place where there is smoking you know they're assuming some health risk associated maybe with you know hanging around where there's cigarette smoke 

141.33 142.49 B: right 

141.76 151.98 A: but it's not i don't think it's like you can or you can't get a job as a as a waiter or a bar tender you know because well you know because you have to work in a smokey environment 

151.42 152.36 B: right 

152.08 165.31 A: you know and i think well and and then i think well all right well if you're gonna have a place like that and there is some consequence maybe you know the health insurance rate for employees there you know would be higher and you know that would come out of the employer's pocket or the employee's pocket or 

164.70 165.27 B: (( [cough] )) 

165.09 177.14 A: it just it it seems a bit a bit strong to say that you know you just can't have any kind of business establishment open to the public that includes smoking and i'm by the way i'm not a smoker 

174.75 175.92 B: right 

176.81 179.01 B: okay [laughter] 

177.71 185.52 A: [laughter] well and i shouldn't quite say that i smoke a little ah but just you know kind of here here and there on and off 

181.58 182.51 B: okay 

184.35 185.22 B: right 

185.92 186.73 A: (( um )) 

186.81 192.49 B: yeah if i go out to eat i don't mind not smoking that's fine you know 

186.94 187.84 A: so what 

189.93 191.28 A: yeah right 

192.73 197.41 B: it other people oh first it being a smoker i don't like people smoking while i'm eating 

197.09 198.27 A: yeah right 

197.58 203.54 B: it's just i'm trying to eat my dinner or lun- you know i don't like the smoke in my face or you know 

199.87 200.81 A: right 

202.58 203.57 A: right 

203.59 207.92 B: so i mean i understand like public place i i think that's 

208.14 209.01 B: fine 

208.79 223.35 A: yeah but but i guess i'm asking the question you know what about a public place where and i i suppose the most common situation it that of a bar where people often like to drink and even people who don't smoke regularly sometimes like to smoke when they drink 

216.46 217.96 B: (( where people )) 

218.56 219.76 B: right 

223.55 224.87 A: (( and um )) 

224.22 225.03 B: well 

225.09 225.92 A: (( you know )) 

226.30 232.26 B: if they were to ban smoking in a bar i think all bars would probably go out of business 

228.57 229.66 A: yeah 

231.46 244.94 A: well no because they've done this i think in new york and in ah california i think there's like they they do that in fact they're trying to do that here um and ah in this in my state which is washington 

232.42 233.02 B: (( [laughter] )) 

239.28 240.41 B: (( [mn] )) 

244.63 246.34 B: yeah i'm in pennsylvania 

245.63 254.38 A: pennsylvania yeah i was just there recently but anyway we're talk we're supposed to talk about smoking [laughter] although i know i think it just matters that we talk i don't think they what we talk about 

249.19 250.05 B: right 

250.33 251.18 B: um 

253.80 255.12 B: [laughter] 

254.78 256.10 A: (( um )) 

256.08 269.66 A: although at first you know when they first started this study you know they don't tell you what it's about and ah they i don't know it was some question about terrorism and i thought oh they're trying to figure out like how to listen for words you know it was like it was like some c._i._a. related thing 

268.84 270.20 B: [laughter] right 

269.45 276.80 A: but but then as i've heard the other topics i realised oh they're just looking for things people you know any two people could probably have a conversation about 

275.82 277.02 B: mhm 

277.37 279.44 A: (( [lipsmack] so ah )) 

279.55 282.27 A: so so what so so how long have you smoked 

284.46 287.49 B: oh phew ah almost twenty years 

286.90 290.48 A: twenty years yeah you do you think about do you think about stopping smoking 

288.12 289.35 B: (( just about )) 

289.87 291.16 B: yes i do 

290.83 292.22 A: uh-huh and 

291.31 293.95 B: and it would be nice 

293.97 298.29 B: to you know i don't know well they said something about like the help programs 

297.62 298.91 A: yeah 

298.41 299.93 B: um it said something 

299.62 300.74 A: yeah 

300.15 311.35 B: that would be nice because like you know a._a. you have like a a person that you could go to you you know you call your support person you know maybe like whenever i wanted to light up a cigarette to have that person to call you know 

306.10 307.47 A: yeah yeah 

310.63 313.78 A: well you know i think there are programs like that 

312.10 312.77 B: (( or )) 

313.25 314.55 B: quit 

313.92 316.31 A: yeah i think there are programs like that i think 

315.40 318.09 B: and i tried the patch it 

316.83 317.73 A: yeah 

317.74 326.12 A: have you contacted like you know like the local ah the lung association or the cancer society 'cause i know they have like all kinds of programs 

325.62 327.48 B: they should 

326.33 333.86 A: and i would be it would be really i would be really surprised if there wasn't something that was kind of modeled around that twelve step kind of model yeah 

332.32 336.69 B: right you know and you have your support person for i wanted a cigarette 

334.73 335.72 A: right 

336.29 337.36 A: right 

336.79 338.31 B: (( help [laughter] )) 

337.67 348.61 A: right yeah i mean even i as a someone who has you know smokes like you know maybe when i'm smoking a couple a day i really want that one or two 

344.62 345.68 B: mhm 

346.91 347.99 B: right 

348.10 353.17 B: well that's the thing too like do you want it do you need it like how you know what 

350.98 351.86 A: yeah 

353.78 356.65 B: what's the situation why are you having that cigarette 

356.06 357.55 A: right right 

357.57 366.18 A: you know and it it's a combination of things of course you know it's the setting and and just that you're kind of you're kind of used to it and it's kind of physically consoling i think to smoke 

361.46 362.57 B: mhm 

365.99 366.99 B: yeah 

367.27 368.36 A: (( yeah )) 

367.64 371.18 B: but it yes it is bad for you and the people around you 

371.13 372.41 A: yeah it sure its 

371.59 374.07 B: they say you know it's not 

374.26 376.19 B: a good habit 

375.47 381.43 A: no no although at at the level at which i smoke it's kind of hard to like beat up on myself too much you know 

380.78 384.01 B: well yeah that would be great a couple of cigarettes a day 

383.65 395.47 A: yeah and i don't know what it is i mean for me if i smoke like you know mo- much more than that i start to experience unpleasant side effects you know like you know sub- sore throat and you know 

394.64 395.76 B: mhm 

395.61 403.88 A: and and when i c- of course at whatever level i have the the wife who says you stink [laughter] 

401.20 402.38 B: [laughter] 

403.06 404.56 B: yeah 

403.83 414.65 A: so um so so those are enough to kind of make me stop sometimes although other times so for me the big thing is as long as i don't buy any i don't smoke [laughter] and so 

413.94 415.33 B: that's good 

414.80 418.74 A: so every time i go by the store i go oh i figure i could kind of 

418.17 420.95 B: and the way they keep upping the price of cigarettes 

420.35 422.19 A: yeah that helps too 

421.66 424.45 B: you know it's hard [laughter] 

423.32 432.48 A: yep yep i just had a i i learned by i came back from a trip in to australia a few moths ago and i could get like cigarettes duty free 

432.46 440.46 A: and so i i bought some for friends when we stopped in on our way back ah in hawaii for a few days and i 

434.86 435.80 B: mhm 

440.54 443.06 A: ah started smoking them 

442.50 443.43 B: [laughter] 

443.28 446.11 A: and i ended up not giving away too very many 

446.07 460.90 A: um so they i just went to a very short trip nearby to canada the other day with my in laws and ah and it was the same kind of thing i could you know o- off the boat off the ferry boat i could i could get some cigarettes and i thought for my i thought for my friends and i thought 

460.86 465.08 A: (( no don't do it you'll just smoke them [laughter] )) 

461.13 464.80 B: yeah yeah [laughter] yeah 

466.56 471.23 B: you know i've heard though that they wanted to try to ban smoking like outside 

471.43 473.40 B: of some public places 

472.85 487.56 A: yes it's true there are some outdoor loc- like locations that are prohi- like at at my airport you can smoke you can't smoke on the at the level where people are are are you know departing only downstairs on the arriving level 

473.82 474.63 B: so 

486.76 487.69 B: right 

487.41 495.10 A: um and i yeah and i can understand where you know where people mass together even outside it it can be ah irritating 

494.73 499.62 B: yeah if there's a lot of people like there's the smoking area and you have to walk by it you're a non smoker 

499.21 500.21 A: yeah
