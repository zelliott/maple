124.55 128.97 A: what do you think about um the well i mean like you don't smoke so 

129.05 133.23 A: the quit smoking ads and stuff they got on t._v. 

133.38 136.15 B: (( yeah yeah i most of a lot of )) 

136.19 140.00 A: they ah i don't know i think the ones with all the young kids 

140.49 141.38 A: (( ah )) 

141.63 143.50 A: some of 'em are kind of stupid 

143.57 145.28 B: (( that yeah )) 

145.48 147.20 A: but 

145.56 147.11 B: yeah they 

148.79 153.47 B: ah when they start making t._v. ads they get kind of crazy sometimes ah no 

153.94 155.79 B: matter what it's about 

155.14 157.09 A: oh yeah 

157.18 157.74 B: (( [cough] )) 

158.65 160.27 B: and 

162.19 166.56 B: i guess that's their job they gotta fill in the time 

165.46 167.36 A: yeah 

168.07 176.96 B: and i try not to worry about 'em even though i get a little disgusted with 'em from time to time but anyhow i don't as far as ah 

177.01 183.70 B: smoking in public places i think probably it's a good idea to to discontinue it if we can 

179.63 180.70 A: (( [noise] )) 

183.99 185.01 B: course 

185.04 191.90 A: well i know some states arizona you can't smoke in public places at all anymore and i've even heard ah 

190.16 191.96 B: yeah 

192.27 195.79 A: some of the states went to no smoking even in bars 

195.81 197.59 B: yeah 

196.96 202.83 A: which i don't know that'd probably bother me if it ever got to that where here where i'm at but 

201.43 204.05 B: so so you think maybe that's stretching it a little 

204.07 205.87 A: yeah 

205.32 207.17 B: (( yeah )) 

206.98 214.70 A: i don't know if they're so far if they're so against smoking and if it's that dangerous to people why don't they just make the tobacco companies quit selling tobacco all together 

214.10 214.79 B: (( [laughter] )) 

214.86 223.17 A: why don't they make it illegal like they do with ah drugs and marijuana but if they do that then they're gonna do it with alcohol and beer and 

215.13 219.46 B: (( yeah )) 

223.97 225.75 B: yeah that ah 

226.91 231.61 B: ah the approach to all this stuff is a little bit silly sometimes and i 

231.91 237.88 B: i mean i've noticed here recently the ah price of a pack of cigarettes 

238.16 250.99 B: is several times what i paid for a carton when i was overseas i i bought 'em you know we had a an allotment a ration i guess they call it and ah 

251.17 254.55 B: we could buy one carton of cigarettes a week 

254.47 266.36 B: and i'd buy mine and sell 'em on the black market [laughter] but ah i was in japan at the time and and i would ah i'd pay fifty cents a carton 

257.30 258.75 A: [laughter] 

266.63 268.05 B: for cigarettes 

267.74 268.70 A: wow 

268.33 273.29 B: and and then i'd go sell 'em for three hundred yen which ah 

273.62 274.79 B: actually is ah 

276.11 280.34 B: [mn] i think the exchange rate round then was fifteen to one 

280.61 281.68 B: (( ah )) 

282.57 287.33 B: but yeah it'd raise a lot i used the three hundred yen to 

288.33 289.46 B: cover my 

290.52 294.01 B: everyday pocket money expenses and and ah 

294.55 297.44 B: and sent my paycheck home 

296.46 298.17 A: yeah 

297.80 298.68 B: (( but )) 

299.43 301.66 B: anyhow that was a long time ago 

301.07 306.95 A: [noise] yeah ah they're twenty eight twenty six twenty five bucks a [noise] carton now 

306.77 311.40 B: [laughter] ain't that something yeah and and a big part of that's tax 

307.68 309.22 A: (( [noise] yep )) 

310.67 312.29 A: [noise] oh yeah 

311.62 319.31 B: and that's the way and that's the way they're planing on getting some more revenue i think is raising the tax on cigarettes 

319.78 321.02 B: (( but ah )) 

321.90 322.91 B: (( that's ah )) 

324.20 327.79 B: i don't know whether that's really fair or not 

326.49 328.93 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

327.93 331.24 B: i guess it's another way of getting people to quit 

330.70 331.70 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

334.05 335.78 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

335.22 339.22 A: they ah i don't know taxes they tax everything so ridiculous 

339.43 340.65 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

339.59 342.75 A: automobile taxes and then you gotta turn around and pay for 

342.92 345.85 A: taxes when you get plates and 

347.71 349.13 B: sales tax 

349.42 355.86 B: here i'm in arkansas and ah we pay pay sales tax on m- when we buy a car 

355.54 357.30 A: yeah 

356.20 358.65 B: and that can almost strangle you 

358.48 359.82 A: oh yeah it's ah 

360.07 362.42 A: (( when i get a i'm in nebraska so )) 

363.21 364.80 A: taxes up here 

365.04 367.41 A: our cigarette taxes i think are ah 

368.80 371.54 A: our sales tax is seven percent now 

371.63 374.84 B: yeah yeah our's is seven point something yeah 

375.06 378.39 A: yeah but [mn] 

377.24 381.37 B: i believe it's seven seven point two five if i remember rightly 

380.05 382.33 A: yeah they got a bunch a 

382.63 390.75 A: big billboards about quit smoking all over the state up here and all kinds of commercials all the time a lot of 'em are 

385.97 386.72 B: (( yeah mm ))

405.06 409.31 B: (( yeah no [laughter] well really [cough] ))

412.05 413.73 B: yeah 

413.38 414.24 A: (( but )) 

414.50 416.11 B: yeah 

416.35 426.16 B: when people started wanting to make a commercial for something they do a lot of stretching of the mind trying to trying to think of something to say and do and that 

424.94 427.11 A: yeah 

426.19 427.56 B: it gets pretty 

428.27 430.12 B: crazy sometimes
