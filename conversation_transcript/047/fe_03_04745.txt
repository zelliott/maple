67.98 69.61 A: oh you do okay 

70.75 71.93 A: [laughter] 

72.46 73.74 A: mhm 

74.89 75.84 A: oh 

76.68 85.77 B: [lipsmack] singing now do [mn] do you sing in a bar do you sing i mean hey [mn] are you good enough to go on uh that talent show 

81.09 82.05 A: (( um )) 

85.98 88.58 A: you mean american idol [laughter] 

87.37 89.86 B: no no i don't like that i mean the other one they 

89.03 89.86 A: (( oh )) 

90.09 93.05 B: what's the other one yeah 

90.52 91.92 A: (( star search )) 

92.50 102.28 A: yeah definitely it's just i don't want to do that because i don't know it's just it's kind of hokey you go through all that and then like some two year olds would beat you out 'cause they sing 

102.50 103.62 A: (( i don't know )) 

102.56 103.45 B: mhm 

104.48 107.09 B: well it sounds like you have a lack of confidence 

107.17 117.49 A: oh no it's just that i'm a little bit more serious than that and even though a lot of people have been found on star search it's like been years before they actually got a serious contract 

117.62 119.68 A: so like that like um 

119.61 133.12 A: [lipsmack] what's his name like usher and oh that girl leanne rimes they were on star search but then they didn't even get a con- like a contact until like years later like it wasn't like 'til like ten twelve years after that that they actually got something 

122.92 123.77 B: yeah 

132.78 141.67 B: but you you you want to turn [mn] it it said in the question you want to turn your hobby into some sort of profit is that correct 

133.30 134.16 A: (( so )) 

141.29 142.82 A: right exactly 

142.74 145.94 B: and wh- where do you sing with a band now 

147.45 156.10 A: no actually i'm a solo artist so like i sing at clubs and i've sung at some showcases and stuff i definitely keep myself busy 

156.53 157.67 B: (( [mn] um [mn] )) 

157.77 162.08 B: let's see what what state are you f- state of confusion right what state are you from 

161.73 163.11 A: i'm in new york 

162.80 166.99 B: new york and you don't have an accent that's interesting 

163.77 164.99 A: mhm 

166.74 168.19 A: [laughter] 

167.06 170.32 B: i'm in california you know 

168.49 172.92 A: oh okay yeah people tell me that all the time like i can't believe you're from new york you don't have an accent 

172.31 175.06 B: you must be from upstate 

174.46 176.51 A: no actually i'm in the city 

176.84 180.96 B: and what what opportunities are there in in in singing for you 

181.42 184.72 B: i'm sure you sound you must be pretty 

181.66 182.93 A: oh there's a 

184.22 185.79 A: [laughter] 

184.84 189.26 B: so you sound pretty so you don't have to worry about people looking at you 

189.24 193.56 A: true well as far as opportunities like um 

190.21 191.14 B: and 

193.90 198.58 A: there's always people looking for somebody to um fill in 

199.18 213.97 A: as far as like like right now there's like a bunch of shows that go on and they're always looking for the next act or something of singing or whatever so it works and plus like i mean there's a bunch of different ways you can get started um you don't have to necessarily go to 

213.90 223.35 A: you know star search or american idol to get it and most people probably don't because th- those those are like just ratings really that's just for ratings it's not like anyone takes it seriously 

221.34 227.83 B: well i you know i would i would suspect i mean i'm i i don't know obviously from my voice i can't sing at all 

227.63 237.36 B: but i can sing it just doesn't sound good anyway i would suspect that that competition like in an athletic uh uh event 

227.71 228.55 A: (( [laughter] )) 

237.19 251.75 B: that if you think you're the fastest runner you'll go out there and and run faster than anybody in in any event but it seems that that your concept of this uh uh program is just a waste of time 

237.39 238.90 A: mhm 

243.84 244.83 A: mhm 

251.21 262.85 A: well because i think with the in sporting events it's different because kobe bryant really is one of the fastest people out there you know like or the shaq really is very good at his thing 

262.61 263.77 B: but wouldn't you 

262.94 264.86 A: whereas um 

264.09 276.34 B: [mn] yeah but wouldn't you think that okay kobe bryant all right now wouldn't you think that an upstarting young athlete in college uh twenty twenty two years old says you know i want to beat him up 'cause i'm better than him 

275.72 277.66 A: (( mhm but the difference )) 

276.41 277.70 B: wouldn't you think 

277.61 291.16 A: yeah i agree but the differences with that one is like when there's scouts out there looking at artists i mean looking at sports players you really do want to get the best person because if you don't then you're going to like you're gong to get fired plus if 

289.91 294.51 B: well i just think a correlation between that and and your ambition 

294.51 302.42 B: uh with with your concept of of that show i'm just trying to won- i'm i'm wondering why that concept of that show isn't like 

294.53 295.75 A: mhm 

302.19 314.02 B: an athlete i'm not just i'm not i'm i'm only using the athlete as an example i'm a better singer than all those uh people and i can show them [mn] is that is that the wrong attitude to have 

313.94 328.62 A: no i mean that's a great attitude it's just the difference is like i just feel like with sports it's a little bit more honest because the people who are out there in the high school and the college whatever people who are obviously really good because they got past the basic level where everybody's just a wannabe 

328.45 329.56 A: to 

329.73 340.44 A: the next level whereas in music it's not necessarily who's out there is the most talented it's just that they came across the right person at the right time and not necessarily 

339.63 341.30 B: (( yeah )) 

340.57 343.97 A: always at star search or american idol 

341.89 350.14 B: i unde- exactly yeah all right that makes sense it's there's a lot more political scenarios with that 

345.77 347.32 A: mhm 

348.40 352.69 A: right it's really it's you know it's about oh well we need a girl 

350.63 355.17 B: but i've heard a lot of singers that don't sound worth a damn really [laughter] 

354.24 363.66 A: exactly that's what i'm saying whereas you're never going to see somebody in the n._b._a. who's purposely terrible you know like they'll have some kind of talent maybe 

361.00 372.53 B: yeah [laughter] that's good analogy no it's very true yeah you you know oh god he's getting a hundred million dollars a year and he can't even make a basket isn't going to yeah that's not going to happen 

364.07 365.27 A: [laughter] 

370.72 373.27 A: exactly that's not going to happen 

372.75 374.42 B: [laughter] 

373.47 375.63 A: (( so it's it's a definite difference )) 

375.75 379.51 B: well anyway my my hobbies are computers that's what i'm doing right now 

378.88 380.59 A: oh really [laughter] 

380.04 392.65 B: what what do you do what do you what do you do for for work i mean [mn] i know that the the singing business is uh is difficult to get started in so you must have something to supplement your income 

388.67 389.76 A: right 

392.03 396.24 A: right i'm a freelance writer and i work on computers too actually 

395.89 397.30 B: do you really 

396.68 398.43 A: (( uh-huh do other things )) 

397.31 400.06 B: do you pr- do you program or 

399.48 401.49 A: no no just web design 

401.61 413.94 A: not really i mean it's technically programming but when i think of programming i think of my friends who are c._p._s. majors who like make like microsoft word type programs i don't do that i just i make your website look pretty 

414.16 416.72 B: so so you design programs 

417.07 418.32 B: is that what you said 

417.25 423.87 A: no no that's not designing programs i mean it's a form of programming like when you create a website 

423.59 424.52 B: yeah 

424.03 429.25 A: but it's not like it's not the same as like bill gates you know that kind of programming 

428.27 430.90 B: ca- can you can create websites 

430.60 432.01 A: yeah that's what i do 

432.59 440.48 B: well you know that's exactly what i need [laughter] yeah because i'm i'm too busy programming other things 

435.98 437.17 A: oh really 

440.41 452.17 B: you know i i i even learned h._t._m._l. and all that sort of stuff but it it just i it just i'm too focussed on what i'm doing in order to get out there and do that i have a patented anti theft device that uh 

447.28 448.38 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

452.34 453.57 A: oh wow 

452.38 457.79 B: for diesel trucks that uh you know they're stealing like sixty billion dollars a year
