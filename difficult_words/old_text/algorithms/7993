Enhancement characteristics after administration of a contrast agent are regarded as a major criterion for differential diagnosis in magnetic resonance mammography (MRM). However, no consensus exists about the best measurement method to assess contrast enhancement kinetics. This systematic investigation was performed to compare visual estimation with manual region of interest (ROI) and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) analysis for time curve measurements in MRM.

A total of 329 patients undergoing surgery after MRM (1.5 T) were analyzed prospectively. Dynamic data were measured using visual estimation, including ROI as well as CAD methods, and classified depending on initial signal increase and delayed enhancement.

Pathology revealed 469 lesions (279 malignant, 190 benign). Kappa agreement between the methods ranged from 0.78 to 0.81. Diagnostic accuracies of 74.4% (visual), 75.7% (ROI), and 76.6% (CAD) were found without statistical significant differences.

According to our results, curve type measurements are useful as a diagnostic criterion in breast lesions irrespective of the method used.
