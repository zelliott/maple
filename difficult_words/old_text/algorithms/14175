The manner in which anatomical rotation from an individual segment contributes to the position and velocity of the endpoint can be informative in the arena of many athletic events whose goals are to attain the maximal velocity of the most distal segment. This study presents a new method of velocity analysis using dual Euler angles and its application in studying rotational contribution from upper extremity segments to club head speed during a golf swing. Dual Euler angle describes 3D movement as a series of ordered screw motions about each orthogonal axis in a streamlined matrix form-the dual transformation matrix- and allows the translation and rotation component to be described in the same moving frame. Applying this method in biomechanics is a novel idea and the authors have previously applied the methodology to clinical studies on its use in displacement analysis. The focus of this paper is velocity analysis and applications in sports biomechanics. In this study, electrogoniometers (Biometrics, UK) with a frequency of 1000 Hz were attached to a subject during the execution of the swing to obtain the joint angles throughout the motion. The velocity of the club head was then analyzed using the dual velocity which specifies the velocity distribution of a rigid body in screw motion at any point in time as the dual vector. The contributions of each segment to the club-head velocity were also compared. In order to evaluate this method, the calculated position and velocity of the club head were compared to the values obtained from video image analysis. The results indicated that there is good agreement between calculated values and video data, suggesting the suitability of using the Dual Euler method in analyzing a kinematic chain motion.
