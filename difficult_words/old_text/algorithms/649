We report a single center experience with emergency urological consultations and interventions during cesarean sections, and provide several guidelines for the intraoperative diagnosis and management of urological trauma in this specific clinical setting.

From 1996 to 2003 urological consultations were required in 29 of 10,439 abdominal deliveries (0.3%). Patient files were reviewed for obstetric, surgical and followup data.

In 20 patients (69%) cesarean section was done on an emergency basis for fetal distress or placental abruption. Of the 29 urological consults 12 (42%) were for inadvertent cystotomy and 17 (58%) were for suspected injuries to the ureter. Patients with inadvertent cystotomy underwent concomitant assessment of ureteral patency by direct insertion of ureteral catheters through the ureteral orifice. Ureteral obstruction was identified in 1 case and promptly repaired by dissecting the ureter and releasing offending sutures that were angulating the ureter and occluding the lumen. Patients with suspected ureteral damage and an intact bladder were studied by endoscopic means (14) or direct surgical dissection and exposure of the ureter (3). Endoscopic assessment was performed by cystoscopic inspection of stained urine flow from the orifices following the administration of intravenous dye (indigo carmine) or by retrograde ureteral catheterization. One patient was found to have incomplete ureteral transection, which was repaired primarily over a self-retaining ureteral stent.

Key factors to obtain optimal results in the management of urological injuries during cesarean sections are the early recognition and immediate repair of damage. Ureteral catheterization via a cystoscope or directly through the orifices should be considered the modality of choice to assess ureteral intactness. Algorithms for urological assessment in this clinical setting are provided.
