Methods for optimizing coded data entry in clinical systems are a frequent topic of system design. We have developed a new mechanism for this type of data entry that we call "Pick From Thousands" (PFT). It combines several known methods, including menu selection, keyword entry, and initial character matching, but adds a new string matching algorithm. The PFT method is more selective than initial character matching for a given number of keystrokes if entries in the coded list have more than one word. Collaborative processing between a PC workstation and the central HELP system computer is used to optimize ease of maintenance and increase the flexibility and performance of the system.
