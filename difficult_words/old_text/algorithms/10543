The incidence of premature births is not decreasing in developed countries, but rather shows a tendency to increase. This rise is primarily due to an increase in the number iatrogenic late preterm births at a gestational age between 34 + 0 and 36 + 6 weeks. Late preterm births account for up to 80% of all preterm births and these newborns have higher morbidity and mortality rates and a higher rate in neurodevelopmental long-term impairment in comparison to term infants. In order to reduce iatrogenic preterm birth, it is necessary to apply standardised treatment algorithms especially in cases of mild preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction.
