The prevalence of actinic keratosis (AK) continues to rise among white people throughout the world and it is necessary to increase the level of attention paid to it from a diagnostic and a preventive point of view. Today, AK must be considered an in situ squamous cell carcinoma and as such, must be managed using one of the available approved therapeutic alternatives. However, when multiple AKs develop on severely photodamaged skin, the treatment of the lesion together with that of the field of cancerization is part of an optimal strategy that aims not only to solve alterations clinically evident but also those in the surrounding skin field cancerization, that most likely hosts genetic alterations and is the site of initial gradual replacement of normal cells with tumoral cells. This paper reports the most recent evidences from a careful review of the literature's key articles of the treatment of AKs and suggests guidelines for the clinicians. The guidelines indicated by the authors have also been based on practical evaluations and their own clinical experience. The present conclusions may be modified by new findings in the field of oncologic research.
