To investigate the possible use of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in monitoring focal cerebral infarction in a rabbit model.

A model of focal cerebral infarction was established in eight New Zealand rabbits using a photochemical method without craniectomy. Focal cerebral infarction was confirmed by histopathological examination. Intracranial impedance variation was measured using 16 electrodes placed in a circle on the scalp. EIT images were obtained using a damped least-squares reconstruction algorithm. The average resistivity value (ARV) of the infarct region on EIT images was calculated to quantify relative resistivity changes. A symmetry index was calculated to evaluate the relative difference in resistivity between the two sides of the cerebrum.

EIT images and ARV curves showed that impedance changes caused by cerebral infarction increased linearly with irradiation time. A difference in ARV was found between measurements taken before and after infarct induction.

Focal cerebral infarction can be monitored by EIT in the proposed animal model. The results are sufficiently encouraging that the authors plan to extend this study to humans, after further technical improvements.
