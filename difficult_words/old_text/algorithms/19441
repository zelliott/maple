Ovaries consist of numerous follicles, oocytes, and granulosa cells in different stages of development. Many of these follicles will undergo an apoptotic process during the lifetime of the animal. By using proper tissue preparation methods, the events within the whole ovary can be observed by using 3D confocal microscopy.

Whole ovaries were stained with LysoTracker Red (LT), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PF) and 1% glutaraldehyde (Glut), dehydrated with methanol (MEOH), and cleared with benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate (BABB). Using this tissue preparation technique, the ovary becomes relatively transparent, allowing its morphology to be observed with confocal microscopes. A spectral imaging system (PARISS) located on a conventional microscope was used to interpret the LT dye spectra and fixation products in the tissues with different excitation wavelengths.

Apoptosis in the follicle was detected as clusters of intensely stained granulosa cells located in close proximity to the oocytes. The fixation with Glut and PF preserved morphological details, increased tissue fluorescence, thus increased the signal to noise of the background image.

Thick tissues can be imaged after they are properly stained, aldehyde fixed, and BABB cleared. LT intensely stained single cells or clusters of apoptotic cells in the follicles and the nucleolus. Spectral differences between LT as an indicator of apoptosis and Glut-PF fixation was used to visualize ovarian morphology and apoptosis. The PARISS spectrophotometer revealed spectral peaks for LT at 609.6 nm and for Glut-PF at 471.3 nm. The proper use of the spectra from these fluorescence molecules is the foundation for high quality morphological images of apoptosis. By sequentially imaging the two probes with a 488 nm laser and a 543/568 nm laser, there was a reduction in fluorescent cross talk and an increase in image quality.
