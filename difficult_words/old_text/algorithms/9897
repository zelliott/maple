Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy (PVR) refers to the migration and proliferation of cells into the subretinal space, vitreous cavity, and onto the retinal surface and undersurface. Subsequent collagen production and cell-mediated contraction of the collagenous scar leads to retinal detachment and loss of vision. Although refinements in surgical techniques and equipment have improved the success rate of surgery to repair retinal detachment in recent years, recurrence due to reproliferation is not uncommon and remains the leading cause of failure o retinal reattachment surgery.
