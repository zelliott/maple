Amaurosis fugax is the subjective phenomenon caused by a transient and temporary ceasing of the retinal blood flow. Wray classified amaurosis fugax in four types, according to the mechanisms involved: embolic, hypoperfusion, angiospasm and idiopathic. Amaurosis fugax is an important symptom because it can announce the definite visual loss, an cerebral infaction or even death caused by vascular causes.
