Nucleosome positioning dictates eukaryotic DNA compaction and access. To predict nucleosome positions in a statistical mechanics model, we exploited the knowledge that nucleosomes favor DNA sequences with specific periodically occurring dinucleotides. Our model is the first to capture both dyad position within a few base pairs, and free binding energy within 2 k(B)T, for all the known nucleosome positioning sequences. By applying Percus's equation to the derived energy landscape, we isolate sequence effects on genome-wide nucleosome occupancy from other factors that may influence nucleosome positioning. For both in vitro and in vivo systems, three parameters suffice to predict nucleosome occupancy with correlation coefficients of respectively 0.74 and 0.66. As predicted, we find the largest deviations in vivo around transcription start sites. This relatively simple algorithm can be used to guide future studies on the influence of DNA sequence on chromatin organization.
