Ultrasonic non-destructive testing of polycrystalline structures can be disturbed by scattering at grain boundaries. Understanding and modeling this so-called "structural noise" is crucial for characterization as well as detection purposes. Structural noise can be considered as a fingerprint of the material under investigation, since it contains information about its microstructure. The interpretation of experimental data necessitates an accurate comprehension of complex phenomena that occur in multiple scattering media and thus robust scattering models. In particular, numerical models can offer the opportunity to realize parametrical studies on controlled microstructures. However, the ability of the model to simulate wave propagation in complex media must be validated. In that perspective, the main objective of the present work is to evaluate the ability of the finite-element code ATHENA 2D to reproduce typical features of multiple wave scattering in the context of ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation, with an array of sources and receivers. Experiments were carried out with a 64-element array, around 2 MHz. The sample was a mock-up of Inconel600 exhibiting a coarse grain structure with a known grain size distribution. The numerical model of this microstructure is based on Voronoi diagrams. Two physical parameters were used to compare numerical and experimental data: the coherent backscattering peak, and the singular value distribution of the array response matrix. Though the simulations are 2-D, a good agreement was found between simulated and experimental data.
