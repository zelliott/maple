The properties of a system reaction-electrodiffusion were studied using two-component model of interaction and diffusion of charged particles near membrane in solutions of low ionic strength to which traditional assumptions about local electroneutrality of medium are not applicable. It is shown that the effect of self-consistent electric field leads to bistability, the appearance of localized structures with contrast charge distribution and regimes aperiodical in time and in space.
