To solve the problem of the basal descent movement in quantification of the regional left ventricular (LV) myocardial wall thickness (WTh) and wall thickening (%WT) in short-axis (SA) cine MRI for effectively assessing the regional wall motion of LV myocardium.

LV long-axis tagged MRI and SA cine MRI were performed to calculate the longitudinal translation and circumferential WTh of LV myocardium in eight normal volunteers. The new SA end-systolic thickness (EST) data were reconstructed from the original EST data, based on the quantified longitudinal translation of LV myocardium.

The mean %WT of six segments in the basal section after correction was significantly different from that before correction in both intra- and inter-operator experiments. The polar map also showed the significant improvement of the variability of regional %WT and lack of quantification of %WT in the most basal SA slices after correction.

The proposed technique demonstrated an important advantage to calculate the %WT in the most basal SA myocardial tissue, which was considered difficult to be achieved using cine MRI.
