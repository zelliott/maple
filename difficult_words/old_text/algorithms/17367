A programmed complex has been developed to determine the optimum radiation protocols which include the optimum positions of intersection centers of central axes of radiation beams, the optimum directions of radiation, the optimum time of exposure. Analyzing the optimum radiation protocols has shown that variations in the positions of intersection centers of radiation beams play a crucial role in the targeted formation of the optimum dose fields. To choose the optimum radiation protocols for central lung cancer is a challenge whose solution depends on the initial position of intersection centers of radiation beams, which give rise to iterative solution of emergency problems. An effective radiation protocol has been chosen among its varieties by making a multicriteria assessment of gross characteristics of dose fields in the lung tissue.
