Phencyclidine has frequently been used to model schizophrenia in animals. In the present study, the ability of the neuronal selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, Nomega-propyl-L-arginine, to block the behavioural effects of phencyclidine in mice was investigated. N(omega)-propyl-L-arginine (20 mg/kg) was found to block both phencyclidine (4 mg/kg)-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition and phencyclidine-induced stimulation of locomotor activity in the mice tested. It is concluded that the NOS-sensitive behavioural effects of phencyclidine in rodents is dependent on neuronal NOS and that NO may play a role in the psychotomimetic effects of phencyclidine.
