Modeling of CD4 cells counts response was performed through a Non-Hierarchical-descendant process with profoundly immunocompromised symptomatic patients under nevirapine or efavirenz-based antiretroviral regimen in Abidjan. Similar CD4 cells count trajectories have been modelled in meta-trajectories linked to patients' classes. Global immunological response is similar between "nevirapine group" and "efavirenz group" but the model showed an internal variation of this response in each group. In the both groups, some variables presented a significant variation between classes: average CD4, CD4 Nadir, CD4 peak and average gain of CD4. In "nevirapine group", these following parameters vary significantly between classes: mean weight, mean haemoglobin count and mean increase in haemoglobin count and sex. It's also important to note that, all meta-trajectories began with distinctive categories of baseline CD4 cells counts. Other explanatory factors must be sought because the characteristics we have chosen to describe patients'classes, are not exhaustive.
