Cyclic water clusters are important molecular species to understand the nature of hydrogen bonded networks. Theoretical studies for the dynamics of triple proton transfer in the cyclic water trimer were performed. The potential energy surface (PES) of triple proton transfer is generated by the multiconfiguration molecular mechanics (MCMM) algorithm. We have used the MP2/6-31G(d,p) level for high-level ab initio data (energies, gradients, and Hessians), which are used in the Shepard interpolation. Eight high-level reference points were added step by step, including two points for the critical configurations of the large curvature tunneling paths. The more high-level points are used, the better the potential energy surfaces become. The rate constant and kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the triple proton transfer at 300 K, which have been calculated by the canonical variational transition-state theory with microcanonical optimized multidimensional semiclassical tunneling approximation, are 1.6 x 10(-3) s(-1) and 230, respectively. Tunneling is very important not only for the triple proton transfer but also for the triple deuterium transfer. The MCMM results show good agreement with those from the direct ab initio dynamics calculations.
