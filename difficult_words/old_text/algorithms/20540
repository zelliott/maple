The first resonance Raman scattering observation of the low-frequency (LF) region (below 40 up to 12 cm-1) of DNA motions is presented. Since the concentration of the studied DNA solution was very low (1 mg/ml), the spectra features reflect internal vibrations of the macromolecule. The decomposition of the spectra into Lorentzians clearly indicate three intrahelical DNA modes: the corresponding peaks are located at the frequencies 16, 19, and 23 (+/- 1) cm-1. This result is in agreement with our quasi-continuity model of the LF B-form DNA dynamics (V. Lisy, P. Miskovsky and P. Schreiber, J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 13, 707 (1996)). The fit of the experimental frequencies to the theory, using the Genetic Algorithms approach, allowed us to make some conclusions about the model force constants which could be found by independent conformational energy calculations. Possible positions of five lowest-frequency DNA peaks, predicted by the model, are discussed.
