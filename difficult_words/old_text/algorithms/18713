A complex of cerium(III) with 4-methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin was synthesized by mixing water solutions of cerium(III) nitrate and 4-methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin sodium salt in a metal-to-ligand molar ratio of 1:2. The complex was characterized and identified by elemental analysis, conductometry, IR, 1H and 13C NMR-spectroscopy, mass spectral data, DTA and TGA. Thermal analysis of the complex indicated the formation of a compound of the composition CeR2(OH).5H2O, R standing for the ligand. The reaction of cerium(III) with 4-methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin was studied in detail by the spectrophotometric method. The stepwise formation of two complexes, vis., CeR2+ and CeR2+, was established in the pH region studied. The equilibrium constants for 1:1 and 1:2 complexes were determined to be 10.72 and 9.22, respectively.
