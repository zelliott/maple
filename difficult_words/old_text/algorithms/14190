This article describes a surgical technique for achieving implant placement parallelism and presents an equation concept to predict the bone depth available for implant placement by measuring the discrepancy of the panoramic radiograph compared with a clinical situation in cases in which a wide edentulous area is present.

A surgical template with tube technique in combination with measurement of the vertical dimension of the mandible bone available for implant placement was used to treat 2 patients in whom 7 and 3 implants, respectively, were inserted in the lower and upper jaws.

All implants were successfully implanted into their reliable positions. In regard to the position of an important area such as the inferior alveolar nerve and maxillary sinus, this predictive equation can provide an extra margin of security.

A partial denture surgical template technique with tube technique using a Coen's drill guide in combination with a mathematical equation to find the clinical-radiographic discrepancy can be used as an alternative method in placement guidance of dental implant insertions and its fixed prosthetic treatment planning in a wide edentulous area.
