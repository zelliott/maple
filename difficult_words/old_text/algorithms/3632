A web-based software suite, SABIA (System for Automated Bacterial Integrated Annotation), is described that provides a comprehensive computational support for the assembly and annotation of whole bacterial genomes from the data derived from sequencing projects.

Both SABIA and supplementary materials are available at http://www.sabia.lncc.br
