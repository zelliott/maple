In this study to identify the origin of PM10 in the atmosphere of Kerman and investigate the dispersion conditions for these particles, the variations of the mass concentration and size distribution of PM10 have been measured. This study is focused on the local environmental impact of Kerman Cement Plant. All samples have been taken in the area between the plant and the city entrance at the wind direction. The result of this research shows that the PM10 concentration in the ambient air in distances about 590-1370 m from the stacks is higher than the WHO guidelines of annual average (260 microg/m(3)). Also, concentration of PM10 is computed by using Gaussian plume model that incorporates source related factors and meteorological factors to estimate pollutant concentration from continuous sources. The performance of this model has been compared with the measured data.
