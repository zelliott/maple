Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has been proposed for the comprehensive assessment of coronary artery stenosis and myocardial perfusion yet traditionally required reducing the temporal resolution of cardiac studies. We evaluated a reconstruction algorithm that preserves high temporal resolution at cardiac DECT.

Twelve consecutive patients (3 women; mean [SD] age, 64 [10] years) with an abnormal single photon emission CT result underwent invasive coronary angiography and cardiac DECT. Dual-energy CT studies were reconstructed using the standard algorithm with 165-millisecond temporal resolution and a hybrid algorithm providing 83-millisecond temporal resolution. These studies were rated for coronary image quality and motion artifacts and compared with invasive coronary angiographic studies.

One hundred sixty-eight coronary artery segments (82%) were evaluated. The standard 165-millisecond reconstruction provided 95% diagnostic segments compared with 100% using the 83-millisecond hybrid reconstruction. Image quality was rated significantly (P < 0.05) better with hybrid reconstruction and had 91.4% sensitivity, 94.7% specificity, 82.1% positive predictive value, and 97.7% negative predictive value for detecting significant stenosis versus 85.7%, 93.2%, 76.9%, and 96.1% with standard reconstruction, respectively.

Hybrid image reconstruction mitigates the former limitations in temporal resolution of cardiac DECT.
