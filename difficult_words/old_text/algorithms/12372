We have investigated the feasibility to use posturography as a method to estimate sleep deprivation. This manuscript presents a proof-of-concept of this idea. Twenty-one healthy subjects aged 20-37 years participated in the study. The subjects were deprived of sleep for up to 36 h. Their postural stability was measured as a function of sleep deprivation time. As a reference the critical fusion frequency method for measuring sleepiness was used. The 163 posturographic parameters used for analyzing the posturographic data were found from the literature. Of these parameters, the fractal dimension of the sway path, the most common frequency of the sway, the time-interval for open-loop control of stance, and the most common amplitude of the sway showed the highest linear correlations with sleep deprivation time. Using these four parameters we were able to estimate the sleep deprivation time with an accuracy better than 5 h for 80% of the subjects.
