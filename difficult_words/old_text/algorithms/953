Multiple sequence alignment can be a useful technique for studying molecular evolution and analyzing sequence-structure relationships. Until recently, it has been impractical to apply dynamic programming, the most widely accepted method for producing pairwise alignments, to comparisons of more than three sequences. We describe the design and application of a tool for multiple alignment of amino acid sequences that implements a new algorithm that greatly reduces the computational demands of dynamic programming. This tool is able to align in reasonable time as many as eight sequences the length of an average protein.
