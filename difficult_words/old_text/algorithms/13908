To design a decision tree according to time from irradiation and site, morphology, and number of microcalcifications for the rational treatment of patients with microcalcifications at the lumpectomy site after breast-conserving therapy (BCT), to minimize performance of biopsy.

From a database of 504 women selected to receive BCT, those developing probably benign microcalcifications within 3 years of BCT received close follow-up with mammography. Patients developing fewer than four probably benign microcalcifications more than 3 years after treatment were offered mammography or biopsy. If microcalcifications appeared malignant or patients developed four or more microcalcifications after 3 years, biopsy was performed.

Twenty-eight patients (29 breasts [5.7%]) developed microcalcifications confined to the lumpectomy site. Fifteen patients (15 breasts) developed microcalcifications within 3 years of BCT and were followed up with mammography. Thirteen patients (14 breasts) developed microcalcifications confined to the lumpectomy site after more than 3 years. Among the latter group, microcalcifications appeared malignant in four breasts, and biopsy specimens revealed three recurrences. The remaining 10 breasts were followed up with mammography. No patient undergoing mammographic follow-up without biopsy has had clinical evidence of local failure throughout the follow-up period.

Follow-up mammography is an option when benign-appearing microcalcifications develop at the lumpectomy site depending on time of appearance and number; it is the primary recommendation when these microcalcifications develop within 3 years after treatment.
