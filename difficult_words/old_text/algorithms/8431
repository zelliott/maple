In this paper we consider the spatial orientation of vertebrae. We take the view that, in determining their rotation angles from X-rays, the procedure applied by Drerup yields the most reliable empirical results, viz. the three angles through which a vertebra rotates about its own symmetry axes in a specific sequence. With a view to the further use of this information to analyze deformations or the motion of a spine we recommend that the Drerup angles be converted into the well-known Eulerian angles. How this can be done is the subject of this report.
