The separation of dansyl (DNS-AAs) and carbobenzoxy (CBZ-AAs) amino acids using micellar electrokinetic chromatography employing polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexes (PSC) formed in the reaction between polyacrylic acid (PAA) and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) as pseudo-stationary phases was described. The PSCs were stabilized by hydrophobic interactions of alkyl chains of the surfactant ions and converted to an intramolecular micellar-like phase. The running buffer was a 50mM solution of sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) containing 4.6-20.2mM PSC, in which a part of carboxyl groups of PAA was blocked by aliphatic amines. For the systems with 7.9mM of PAA/DTAB complex (phi=0.30, phi-composition of water-soluble polyelectrolyte complex) as a pseudo-stationary phase, the peaks of six dansyl amino acids (DNS-AAs) were baseline resolved. The separation in this case is based on a complex distribution mechanism of the dansyl derivatives between the free buffer and the intramolecular micellar-like phase of the water-soluble PSC. On the other hand, the additives of PAA/DTAB complex (phi=0.30) to the running buffer does not essentially affect on the electrophoretic behaviour of the CBZ-AAs, the variant MEKC is not realized. The influence of the concentration of the complex of PAA/DTAB on the electrophoretic behaviour of analytes was investigated. Relative retentions and relative selectivities were used for describing electrophoretic behaviour of the amino acid derivatives.
