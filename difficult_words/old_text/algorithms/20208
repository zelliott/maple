Small concentrations of albumin detected in the urine predict renal dysfunction and reflect vascular abnormalities such as atherosclerosis, retinopathy and, probably, neuropathy. Although microalbuminuria is not specific for diabetic complications, it has been most extensively studied in diabetics. The rate of urinary albumin excretion can also be used to determine therapeutic response to pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions such as diet, smoking cessation and physical activity. The pathophysiology of microalbuminuria and its clinical significance in diabetes is presented, along with a discussion of measurement issues and implications for clinical management. An algorithm for the evaluation of diabetic patients is included.
