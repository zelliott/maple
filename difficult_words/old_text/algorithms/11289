Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a method for measuring fluorophore lifetimes with microscopic spatial resolution, providing a useful tool for cell biologists to detect, visualize, and investigate structure and function of biological systems. In this chapter, we begin by introducing the basic theory of fluorescence lifetime, including the characteristics of fluorophore decay, followed by a discussion of factors affecting fluorescence lifetimes and the potential advantages of fluorescence lifetime as a source of image contrast. Experimental methods for creating lifetime maps, including both time- and frequency-domain experimental approaches, are then introduced. Then, FLIM data analysis methods are discussed, including rapid lifetime determination, multiexponential fitting, Laguerre polynomial fitting, and phasor plot analysis. After, data analysis methods are introduced that improve lifetime precision of FLIM maps based upon optimal virtual gating and total variation denoising. The chapter concludes by highlighting several recent FLIM applications for quantitative biological imaging, including FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer-FLIM, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy-FLIM, multispectral-FLIM, and multiphoton-FLIM.
