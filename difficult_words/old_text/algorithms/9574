This article describes a modification of the conventional membrane crystallization technique in which a membrane is used to dose the solvent/antisolvent composition to generate supersaturation and induce crystallization in a drug solution. Two operative configurations are proposed: (a) solvent/antisolvent demixing crystallization, where the solvent is removed in at higher flow rate than the antisolvent so that phase inversion promotes supersaturation and (b) antisolvent addition, in which the antisolvent is dosed into the crystallizing drug solution. In both cases, solvent/antisolvent migration occurs in vapor phase and it is controlled by the porous membrane structure, acting on the operative process parameters. This mechanism is different than that observed when forcing the liquid phases through the pores and the more finely controllable supersaturated environment would generate crystals with the desired characteristics. Two organic molecules of relevant industrial implication, like paracetamol and glycine, were used to test the new systems. Experiments demonstrated that, by using antisolvent membrane crystallization in both configurations, accurate control of solution composition at the crystallization point has been achieved with effects on crystals morphology.
