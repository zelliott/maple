Like others in the health care industry, Physician's Association for AIDS Care (PAAC) and Midway Hospital in Los Angeles are turning to managed care to help corral costs. Their plan is to use a managed care payment model, known as capitation, to pay for AIDS care. Under capitation, insurers and providers negotiate annual contracts for payment. Providers are paid a monthly lump sum for the care they provide--but they are paid before care is provided. Although the cost of AIDS care seems to be declining, health insurers still are clamoring for cost-containment measures. Many project 1995 will be a pivotal year, doubling the expected life span of HIV-infected people, not because of a cure, but because of drugs to combat opportunistic disease and improve quality of life. PAAC, along with its sister organization, the California AIDS Physicians Association, is spearheading the development of a capitation model in Los Angeles with $250,000 in start-up money. It is assembling a 120-physician independent practice association (IPA) made up of AIDS specialists and Midway Hospital. The physicians are developing treatment algorithms for six to seven categories of illness. A price tag would be put on each procedure included in the algorithm and the attending physician would then be required to follow the algorithm.
