Network models that represent the void space of a rock by a lattice of pores connected by throats can predict relative permeability once the pore geometry and wettability are known. Micro-computerized-tomography scanning provides a three-dimensional image of the pore space. However, these images cannot be directly input into network models. In this paper a modified maximal ball algorithm, extending the work of Silin and Patzek [D. Silin and T. Patzek, Physica A 371, 336 (2006)], is developed to extract simplified networks of pores and throats with parametrized geometry and interconnectivity from images of the pore space. The parameters of the pore networks, such as coordination number, and pore and throat size distributions are computed and compared to benchmark data from networks extracted by other methods, experimental data, and direct computation of permeability and formation factor on the underlying images. Good agreement is reached in most cases allowing networks derived from a wide variety of rock types to be used for predictive modeling.
