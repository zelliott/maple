We have identified new lead candidates that possess inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv chorismate mutase by a ligand-based virtual screening optimized for lead evaluation in combination with in vitro enzymatic assay. The initial virtual screening using a ligand-based pharmacophore model identified 95 compounds from an in-house small molecule database of 15,452 compounds. The obtained hits were further evaluated by molecular docking and 15 compounds were short listed based on docking scores and the other scoring functions and subjected to biological assay. Chorismate mutase activity assays identified four compounds as inhibitors of M. tuberculosis chorismate mutase (MtCM) with low K(i) values. The structural models for these ligands in the chorismate mutase binding site will facilitate medicinal chemistry efforts for lead optimization against this protein.
