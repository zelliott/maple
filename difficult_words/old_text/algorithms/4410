An algorithm for localizing a sound source with two microphones is introduced and used in real-time situations. This algorithm is inspired by biological computation of interaural time difference as occurring in the barn owl and is a modification of the algorithm proposed by Liu et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 110, 3218-3231 (2001)] in that it creates a three-dimensional map of coincidence location. This eliminates localization artifacts found during tests with the original algorithm. The source direction is found by determining the azimuth at which the minimum of the response in an azimuth-frequency matrix occurs. The system was tested with a pan-tilt unit in real-time in an office environment with signal types ranging from broadband noise to pure tones. Both open loop (pan-tilt unit stationary) and closed loop experiments (pan-tilt unit moving) were conducted. In real world situations, the algorithm performed well for all signal types except pure tones. Subsequent room simulations showed that localization accuracy decreases with decreasing direct-to-reverberant ratio.
