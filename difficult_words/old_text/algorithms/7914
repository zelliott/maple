A technique is presented to allow a breathing pattern to be obtained from any multi-slice CT, cone-beam or other series of sequential chest x-ray image sets. The technique requires no extra signals to be recorded and does not need specific external or internal oscillating structures to be visible in the field of view. The breathing pattern is instead acquired from analysing the variation in pixel values between projection images. For cone-beam image sets, slowly varying changes, due to an angular attenuation dependence, must be corrected before the breathing trace analysis can begin. All the results of the new technique were checked visually and were in good agreement. If the studied image set could be analysed using the existing 'Amsterdam shroud' technique, then the results it provided were also used for comparison. In cases that allowed comparison by both techniques, the results were in agreement. The new technique was also shown to provide a usable signal when applied to cardiac motion.
