The nature and validity of the mathematical formulation of Michaelis-Menten type kinetics for enzyme-catalysed biochemical reactions is studied. Almost all previous work has concentrated on isolated reactions, i.e. those without input or other environmental influences. In this paper, we investigate the effects of substrate input on this formulation, in particular, on the nature and validity of the quasi-steady state assumptions.
