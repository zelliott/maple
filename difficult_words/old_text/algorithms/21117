Deformation and compaction properties of native amino poly-saccharides chitin and chitosan were studied and compared with those obtained with established pharmaceutical direct compression excipients. An instrumented single-punch tablet machine was used for tablet compaction. The following compression parameters were evaluated: a ratio of crushing strength and compression pressure, plasticity and elasticity factor (PF and EF), tensile strength and R-value. Chitin and chitosan were found to have a marked tendency to plastic deformation, and both showed a good compression behaviour compared with the other direct compression excipients including microcrystalline cellulose. It is concluded that chitin and chitosan are potential co-excipients for direct compression applications.
