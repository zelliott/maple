The paper is concerned with a detailed description of an algorithm for picturing functional imaging of the kidneys based on the calculation of parenchymal transport time (PTT). The authors discuss the results obtained in a group of patients aged 4 to 14 with conditional normal indices. The method permits quantitative and qualitative assessment of the function of the minimum amount of nephrons of each kidney and facilitates an analysis of gamma scintigraphy results. Clinical importance of the method is discussed.
