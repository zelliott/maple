The authors propose the "height multiplier method," a new, simple, universal method to predict adult height. The authors calculated age- and gender-specific height multiplier values and validated their use for height prediction. Average height multiplier values (M) for boys and girls were calculated by dividing height at skeletal maturity (Htm) by present height (Ht) for each age, gender, and height percentile (M=Htm/Ht) using data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The accuracy of the multiplier method was compared with the CDC growth charts using longitudinal growth data from 52 normal children. No significant differences were noted between predictions made using the CDC growth charts versus the multiplier method. The authors also compared the CDC-derived multiplier values with other growth databases from around the world and from different eras. Height multipliers were independent of height percentile, race, and generation, indicating that the multiplier method is universal.
