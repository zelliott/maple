The paper deals with detection of the QRS complex of a cardiac signal at the level of interferences by the rank method. An algorithm is proposed to detect informational cardiac pulses of an electrocardiographic signal and its temporary ranges. The use of such algorithms provides portable devices to examine an electrocardiographic signal when the patient freely moves under high interference.
