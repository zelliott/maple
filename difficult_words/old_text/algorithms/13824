Immunohistochemical studies of formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections today constitute an essential component of the diagnostic process for malignant lymphoma. Lineage related markers are of value in distinguishing various lymphomas from anaplastic large and small cell carcinomas, and from sarcomas. Other more recently available markers are of value in establishing prognosis and, on occasion, in differentiating between neoplastic and reactive proliferations. Meticulous attention to reagent control and technical procedures is essential to all such studies.
