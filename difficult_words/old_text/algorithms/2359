We investigated two calibration techniques commonly used with eye movement signals pertaining to the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Eye movement signals were recorded electro-oculographically as usual and calibrated using both static and dynamic calibration techniques. The calibration values of normals and patients were computed and compared to each other. Also gain parameters of vestibulo-ocular reflex which depend on the calibration were computed. We found that both techniques are chiefly equally valid, and there are no considerable differences in results computed with either one.
