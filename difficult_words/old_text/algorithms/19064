The corpus callosum (CC) is of great interest for pathophysiological models of schizophrenia. Volume and structural integrity of the CC have been examined by volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies, but results were not consistent across methods or studies. A possible explanation may be varying methodologies and accuracy of measurements based on a single slice or small regions of interest. In addition, none of the studies examined volume and diffusion values in the same group of patients, and thus the relationship between these anatomical measures is not clear. We used an automatic algorithm to segment seven midline slices of the CC from DTI images. We compared volume and the DTI measures fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in the CC and its subdivisions in the schizophrenia patients and matched controls. Patients had decreased volume, decreased FA and increased MD of the whole CC. The important novel finding is, however, that not all regions were equally affected by anatomical changes. The results emphasize the importance of using different methods in evaluation of white matter (WM) in schizophrenia to avoid false negative findings. In addition, the measures were highly correlated with each other, implying a common pathological process influencing FA, MD and volume of the CC. Although we cannot rule out other mechanisms affecting volume, FA and MD, converging evidence from cytoarchitectonic and genetic studies suggests that WM changes observed in schizophrenia may involve disintegration of healthy, functional axons and strengthening of aberrant connections resulting in increased severity of clinical symptoms.
