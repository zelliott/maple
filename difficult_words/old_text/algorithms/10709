Rabies post exposure treatment and rapid diagnosis in an endemic area requires skillful and an experienced medical staff and veterinary specialists. A software program was introduced in 2000 as a tool to diagnose rabies based on clinical symptoms and signs of suspicious dogs where veterinarian service and other laboratory diagnostic options are not immediately available. It is easily accessed from the website: www.soonak.com/rabies.
