This paper examines the initial actions that should take place following the sudden collapse of a patient in a hospital. The current Basic Life Support guidelines are not designed for this situation, yet are commonly taught to hospital staff. An alternative algorithm for Hospital Resuscitation has been developed. Additional factors, such as the recognition of the sick patient and the importance of audit should be included in hospital resuscitation training. A tiered approach to resuscitation training within a hospital should be adopted and national standards developed.
