We evaluate the capability of reconstructing Fokker-Planck equations for an improved characterization of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from epilepsy patients. We derive stochastic qualifiers of brain dynamics that are based on specific characteristics of the Kramers-Moyal coefficients estimated from the EEG. Analyzing long-lasting multichannel EEG recordings from eight patients suffering from focal epilepsies we show that particularly the stochastic part of the dynamics can yield valuable information for diagnostic purposes.
