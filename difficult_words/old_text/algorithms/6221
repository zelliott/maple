Different surgical techniques have been proposed to treat traumatic scapholunate instability. Deciding which treatment is best for each individual case is not easy. In this article we report an algorithm of treatment based on a number of prognostic factors that may help in this matter. We also report on the promising results obtained using a new technique, the 3-ligament tenodesis, for the treatment of nonrepairable complete scapholunate ligament rupture, causing a reducible carpal malalignment without secondary osteoarthritis. This technique incorporates features from 3 previously described techniques.
