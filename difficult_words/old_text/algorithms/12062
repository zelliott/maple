To achieve higher volume coverage at improved z-resolution in computed tomography (CT), systems with a large number of detector rows are demanded. However, handling an increased number of detector rows, as compared to today's four-slice scanners, requires to accounting for the cone geometry of the beams. Many so-called cone-beam reconstruction algorithms have been proposed during the last decade. None met all the requirements of the medical spiral cone-beam CT in regard to the need for high image quality, low patient dose and low reconstruction times. We therefore propose an approximate cone-beam algorithm which uses virtual reconstruction planes tilted to optimally fit 180 degrees spiral segments, i.e., the advanced single-slice rebinning (ASSR) algorithm. Our algorithm is a modification of the single-slice rebinning algorithm proposed by Noo et al. [Phys. Med. Biol. 44, 561-570 (1999)] since we use tilted reconstruction slices instead of transaxial slices to approximate the spiral path. Theoretical considerations as well as the reconstruction of simulated phantom data in comparison to the gold standard 180 degrees LI (single-slice spiral CT) were carried out. Image artifacts, z-resolution as well as noise levels were evaluated for all simulated scanners. Even for a high number of detector rows the artifact level in the reconstructed images remains comparable to that of 180 degrees LI. Multiplanar reformations of the Defrise phantom show none of the typical cone-beam artifacts usually appearing when going to larger cone angles. Image noise as well as the shape of the respective slice sensitivity profiles are equivalent to the single-slice spiral reconstruction, z-resolution is slightly decreased. The ASSR has the potential to become a practical tool for medical spiral cone-beam CT. Its computational complexity lies in the order of standard single-slice CT and it allows to use available 2D backprojection hardware.
