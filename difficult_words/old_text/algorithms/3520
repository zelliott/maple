In this paper, for joint torque optimization of redundant manipulators subject to physical constraints, we show that velocity-level and acceleration-level redundancy-resolution schemes both can be formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem subject to equality and inequality/bound constraints. To solve this QP problem online, a primal-dual dynamical system solver is further presented based on linear variational inequalities. Compared to previous researches, the presented QP-solver has simple piecewise-linear dynamics, does not entail real-time matrix inversion, and could also provide joint-acceleration information for manipulator torque control in the velocity-level redundancy-resolution schemes. The proposed QP-based dynamical system approach is simulated based on the PUMA560 robot arm with efficiency and effectiveness demonstrated.
