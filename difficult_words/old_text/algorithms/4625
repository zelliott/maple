A new fuzzy filter is presented for the reduction of additive noise for digital color images. The filter consists of two subfilters. The first subfilter computes fuzzy distances between the color components of the central pixel and its neighborhood. These distances determine in what degree each component should be corrected. All performed corrections preserve the color component distances. The goal of the second subfilter is to correct the pixels where the color components differences are corrupted so much that they appear as outliers in comparison to their environment. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach. We compare with other noise reduction methods by numerical measures and visual observations. We also illustrate the performance of the proposed method as preprocessing step for edge detection.
