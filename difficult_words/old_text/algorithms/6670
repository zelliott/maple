The pulse height weighting integration method for measuring H'(0.07) using a plastic scintillator has been developed through Monte Carlo simulations and laboratory tests. In order to design an optimal detector configuration, the parameters of input-window thickness and plastic scintillator thickness were investigated by EGS4 for their influences on the energy response for electrons. Based on the calculated deposited spectra in the plastic scintillator for electrons with various incident energies, a weighting function W(E), folded with the deposited energy spectra, was introduced in order to obtain a flat energy response in the low energy range. A constant response within +/-3% was confirmed, by calculation, for electrons with energy >0.15 MeV. In addition, a preliminary experiment was performed using three beta sources (90Sr-90Y, 147Pm, 204Tl) and the energy response within +/-6% for beta rays with the maximum energy >0.22 MeV was obtained. Some factors causing uncertainties in the measurements are also discussed in this article.
