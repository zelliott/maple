The construction of a consensus tree to summarize the information of a given set of phylogenetic trees is now routinely a part of many studies in systematic biology. One popular method is the majority-rule consensus tree. In this paper we introduce and characterize a new consensus method that refines the majority-rule tree by adding certain compatible clusters satisfying a simple criterion.
