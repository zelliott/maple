Alcoholic liver disease is a spectrum of lesions, of which the most severe is alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). Recent European guidelines define alcoholic hepatitis as a clinical syndrome: the recent onset of jaundice and/or ascites in a patient with ongoing alcohol misuse. Next to infection, the most frequent aetiology is ASH, a histological diagnosis. In case of severe ASH, as defined by prognostic scores, a biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Non-severe forms of ASH may improve with interruption of alcohol abuse only; however survival of severe forms of ASH is improved by the association of corticosteroids and N-acetylcysteine. In case of uncontrolled infection, pentoxifylline may be administered. The Lille score, measured at the 7th day of corticosteroid therapy, measures response to therapy and guides the total duration of treatment.
