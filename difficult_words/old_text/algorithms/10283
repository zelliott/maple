When analyzing computer simulations of mixtures of lipids and water, the questions to be answered are often of a morphological nature. They can deal with global properties, like the kind of phase that is adopted or the presence or absence of certain key features like a pore or stalk, or with local properties, like the local curvature present at a particular part of the lipid/water interface. While in principle all of the information relating to the global and local morphological properties of a system can be obtained from the set of atomic coordinates generated by a computer simulation, the extraction of this information is a tedious task that usually involves using a visualization program and performing the analysis by eye. Here we present a tool that employs the technique of morphological image analysis (MIA) to automatically extract the global morphology--as given by Minkowski functionals--from a set of atomic coordinates, and creates an image of the system onto which the local curvatures are mapped as a color code.
