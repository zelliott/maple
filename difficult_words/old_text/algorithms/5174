Focused ultrasound thermal therapy relies on temperature monitoring for treatment guidance and assurance of targeting and dose control. One potential approach is to monitor temperature change through ultrasonic-backscattered signal processing. The current approach involves the detection of echo time-shifts based on cross-correlation processing from segmented radiofrequency (RF) data. In this study, we propose a novel ultrasonic temperature-measurement approach that detects changes in instantaneous frequency along the imaging beam direction. Focused ultrasound was used as the heating source, and the 1-D beamformed RF signals provided from an ultrasound imager were used to verify the proposed algorithm for temperature change estimation. For comparison, a conventional cross-correlation technique was also evaluated. Heating experiments testing tissue-mimicking phantoms and ex vivo porcine muscles were conducted. The results showed that temperature can be well estimated by the proposed algorithm in the temperature range, where the relationship of sound speed versus temperature is linear. Compared with the cross-correlation-based algorithm, the proposed new algorithm yields a six-fold increase in computational efficiency, along with comparable contrast-detection ability and precision. This new algorithm may serve as an alternative method for implementing temperature estimation into a clinical ultrasound imager for thermal therapy guidance.
