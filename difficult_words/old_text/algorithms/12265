Evolutionary algorithms are frequently applied to dynamic optimization problems in which the objective varies with time. It is desirable to gain an improved understanding of the influence of different genetic operators and of the parameters of a strategy on its tracking performance. An approach that has proven useful in the past is to mathematically analyze the strategy's behavior in simple, idealized environments. The present paper investigates the performance of a multiparent evolution strategy that employs cumulative step length adaptation for an optimization task in which the target moves linearly with uniform speed. Scaling laws that quite accurately describe the behavior of the strategy and that greatly contribute to its understanding are derived. It is shown that in contrast to previously obtained results for a randomly moving target, cumulative step length adaptation fails to achieve optimal step lengths if the target moves in a linear fashion. Implications for the choice of population size parameters are discussed.
