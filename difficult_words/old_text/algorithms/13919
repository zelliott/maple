The double "J" ureter stent has become one of the most basic and valuable tools in urology, but it can cause complications. Stent encrustation is one of its most difficult complications to manage. An evaluation and treatment algorithm that stratifies the treatment based upon the function of the stented kidney and the presence or absence of concomitant ureteral obstruction is presented. Minimally invasive surgery using ESWL and cystolitholapaxy is recommended as the first line of treatment of the extensively encrusted ureteral stent when the kidney has greater than 10% function.
