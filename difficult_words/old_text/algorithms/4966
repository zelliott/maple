The aim of this report was to present an integrated 3-dimensional (3D) virtual approach toward cone-beam computed tomography-based treatment planning of orthognathic surgery in the clinical routine.

We have described the different stages of the workflow process for routine 3D virtual treatment planning of orthognathic surgery: 1) image acquisition for 3D virtual orthognathic surgery; 2) processing of acquired image data toward a 3D virtual augmented model of the patient's head; 3) 3D virtual diagnosis of the patient; 4) 3D virtual treatment planning of orthognathic surgery; 5) 3D virtual treatment planning communication; 6) 3D splint manufacturing; 7) 3D virtual treatment planning transfer to the operating room; and 8) 3D virtual treatment outcome evaluation.

The potential benefits and actual limits of an integrated 3D virtual approach for the treatment of the patient with a maxillofacial deformity are discussed comprehensively from our experience using 3D virtual treatment planning clinically.
