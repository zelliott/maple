It is a well-known fact that (compact-support) dyadic wavelets [based on the two channel filter banks (FBs)] cannot be simultaneously orthogonal and symmetric. Although orthogonal wavelets have the energy preservation property, biorthogonal wavelets are preferred in image processing applications because of their symmetric property. In this paper, a novel method is presented for the design of almost symmetric orthogonal wavelet FB. Orthogonality is structurally imposed by using the unnormalized lattice structure, and this leads to an objective function, which is relatively simple to optimize. The designed filters have good frequency response, flat group delay, almost symmetric filter coefficients, and symmetric wavelet function.
