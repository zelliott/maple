Interventricular septum thickness in end-diastole (IVSd) is one of the key parameters in cardiology. This paper presents a fast algorithm, suitable for pocket-sized ultrasound devices, for measurement of IVSd using 2D B-mode parasternal long axis images. The algorithm is based on a deformable model of the septum and the mitral valve. The model shape is estimated using an extended Kalman filter. A feasibility study using 32 unselected recordings is presented. The recordings originate from a database consisting of subjects from a normal healthy population. Five patients with suspected hypertrophy were included in the study. Reference B-mode measurements were made by two cardiologists. A paired t-test revealed a non-significant mean difference, compared to the B-mode reference, of (mean±SD) 0.14±1.36 mm (p=0.532). Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.79 (p<0.001). The results are comparable to the variability between the two cardiologists, which was found to be 1.29±1.23 mm (p<0.001). The results indicate that the method has potential as a tool for rapid assessment of IVSd.
