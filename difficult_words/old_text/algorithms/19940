Evaluate the efficacy of a topical treatment protocol with DMSO 50% to alleviate inflammatory processes in type 1 complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) with a course of less than 1 year.

Retrospective study performed in a traumatology hospital on patients with type 1 CRPS for whom a standard treatment algorithm was prescribed with stepwise administration of oral drugs and interventional techniques. Patients also received topical DMSO 50% cream as a magistral formula. The follow-up period, lasting until patient discharge, or during 1 year for persistent cases, included 6 visits: baseline, 15 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The evaluation was performed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) as the main efficacy variable. Secondary variables were the Likert scale for quality of life and the limb capacity variable (range of motion, strength, overall limb function). A questionnaire designed for the study was also given.

Overall decrease in VAS score in the 29 patients was 3.09 points. The Likert scale score increased by 1.36 points. The scores measuring limb capacity increased to 12.03 for range of motion and to 3 in strength with overall function rated «moderate».

Topical application of DMSO 50% associated with a treatment algorithm decreased pain intensity according to the VAS score with results approaching absence of pain, and led to higher scores on the quality of life questionnaire. Topical DMSO 50% is an additional tool for use in treating CRPS I. Its side effects are scarce and it provides an overall sense of relief and lessens rigidity.
