The electrocardiographic (ECG) inverse problem is ill-posed and usually solved by regularization schemes. These regularization methods, such as the Tikhonov method, are often based on the L2-norm data and constraint terms. However, L2-norm-based methods inherently provide smoothed inverse solutions that are sensitive to measurement errors, and also lack the capability of localizing and distinguishing multiple proximal cardiac electrical sources. This paper presents alternative regularization schemes employing the L1-norm data term for the reconstruction of epicardial potentials (EPs) from measured body surface potentials (BSPs). During numerical implementation, the iteratively reweighted norm algorithm was applied to solve the L1-norm-related schemes, and measurement noises were considered in the BSP data. The proposed L1-norm data term-based regularization schemes (with L1 and L2 penalty terms of the normal derivative constraint (labelled as L1TV and L1L2)) were compared with the L2-norm data terms (Tikhonov with zero-order and normal derivative constraints, labelled as ZOT and FOT, and the total variation method labelled as L2TV). The studies demonstrated that, with averaged measurement noise, the inverse solutions provided by the L1L2 and FOT algorithms have less relative error values. However, when larger noise occurred in some electrodes (for example, signal lost during measurement), the L1TV and L1L2 methods can obtain more accurate EPs in a robust manner. Therefore the L1-norm data term-based solutions are generally less perturbed by measurement noises, suggesting that the new regularization scheme is promising for providing practical ECG inverse solutions.
