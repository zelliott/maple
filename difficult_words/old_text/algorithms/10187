We examined the effects of a manualized care management protocol specifically designed for care managers working with caregivers, the Tailored Caregiver Assessment and Referral® (TCARE®) protocol, on caregiver identity discrepancy, burden, and depressive symptoms.

Preliminary data from a longitudinal, randomized, controlled intervention study with 266 family caregivers served by 52 care managers in 4 states were analyzed using repeated measures random effects regression procedures. Caregivers in the intervention and control groups were repeatedly assessed for up to 9 months on caregiver identity discrepancy, 3 areas of caregiving burden-objective, relationship, and stress burdens; depression; and intention for nursing home placement.

We found significant group by time interaction effects for caregiver identity discrepancy, relationship burden, stress burden, depression, and intention for nursing home placement. Caregivers in the intervention group experienced significant improvement on these measures, whereas caregivers in the control group worsened on these measures over time.

The preliminary findings provide strong support for effectiveness of the TCARE® protocol on improving caregiver well-being and mental health outcomes.
