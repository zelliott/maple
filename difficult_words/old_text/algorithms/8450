A new, simple, sensitive, low cost and rapid potentiometric method for direct determination of ultra trace amounts of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with a new DS(-)-selective electrode is reported. The electrode was prepared by electropolymerization of aniline in acidified DS- ion on the surface of a Pt electrode. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used for electropolymerization of polyaniline (PA) in the potential range of -200 to +1000 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. This sensor showed a Nernstian behavior (59.0 +/- 2.3 mV/decade) over a very wide linear range (1.0 x 10(-9)-3.0 x 10(-6) M) with a detection limit of 1.0 x 10(-9) M. The response time of the electrode was 15 s for 1.0 x 10(-7) M of analyte; the electrode can be used for 4 weeks without any major deviation. This electrode can be used in the pH range of 3.5-9.8. The selectivity of electrode to DS- over some organic, inorganic and anionic surfactants was investigated with the fixed primary ion method. The results show that the electrode is highly selective to DS- ion over other ions. The proposed electrode was applied to the determination of DS- in real samples.
