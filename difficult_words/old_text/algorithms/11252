Spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is an extremely rare condition that occurs in the absence of ovarian hyperstimulation treatment. It can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, and therefore early diagnosis and supportive treatment are essential. We report an affected mother and her daughter with a previously reported heterozygous activating mutation in the FSHR gene. We performed a literature review with particular regard to pathogenesis, with a view to suggesting a pathophysiological classification system and a diagnostic algorithm to assist in the management of this rare condition.
