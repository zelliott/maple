A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and Windows-based program (called PostNatal) was developed that focuses on postnatal growth, from birth through adulthood, using appropriate growth curves for each species and gender. Postnatal growth algorithms relating organs/tissues weights with total body weight for male and female humans, dogs, rats, and mice are an integral part of the software and are utilized to assign the appropriate weight and blood flow for each of 22 organs/tissues for each simulation. Upper limits of body weight were chosen that reflect the available data used to define the algorithms; above these limits a set percent body weight was assigned to all organs/tissues.
