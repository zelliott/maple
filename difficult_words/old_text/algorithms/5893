Nonlinear properties exist within the brain across a hierarchy of scales and within a variety of critical neural processes. Only a few studies of brain activity in schizophrenia, however, have used nonlinear methods. This review paper evaluates the contribution of the nonlinear sciences towards understanding schizophrenia.

Applications of nonlinear methods to the study of schizophrenia symptoms and to healthy and schizophrenia functional neuroscience data are reviewed. The main flaws of nonlinear algorithms and recent methods to correct these are also appraised.

Initial research methods utilized in the study of nonlinearity in schizophrenia have fundamental methodological limitations. In the last decade, many of these problems have been addressed, facilitating future progress. Research incorporating these improvements has been applied to normal electroencephalogram (EEG) data and to the symptoms of schizophrenia, but not systematically to brain imaging data collected from patients with schizophrenia.

There is strong statistical evidence for weak nonlinearity in normal EEG and in the fluctuations of the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the contribution of nonlinear processes to brain dysfunction in schizophrenia is yet to be properly established or accurately quantified. Despite this, recent methodological advances suggest that a 'nonlinear theory' of schizophrenia may be helpful in understanding this disorder.
