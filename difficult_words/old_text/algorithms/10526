We discuss recent highlights from research at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, regarding the use of spin-transfer torques to control magnetic moments in nanoscale ferromagnetic devices. We highlight progress on reducing the critical currents necessary to produce spin-torque-driven magnetic switching, quantitative measurements of the magnitude and direction of the spin torque in magnetic tunnel junctions, and single-shot measurements of the magnetic dynamics generated during thermally assisted spin-torque switching.
