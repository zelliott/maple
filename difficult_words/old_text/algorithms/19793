Fingolimod is the first oral treatment of multiple sclerosis. It is the first-in-class sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that binds to sphingosine 1-phophate receptors on lymphocytes and via downregulation of the receptor prevents lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues into the circulation. This mechanism reduces the infiltration of potentially auto-aggressive lymphocytes into the central nervous system. Two large phase III studies with fingolimod have shown superior efficacy of the drug in two dosages compared to placebo and to weekly intramuscular injections of Interferon beta-1a. Among possible side effects of the drug is a transient bradycardia after the first dose of fingolimod including possible AV blockade and therefore monitoring of pulse rate and blood pressure for 6 h following the first application is needed. During treatment, attention has to be given to specific infections, elevated liver enzymes, and ophthalmologic changes. Recommendations on the use of fingolimod including safety aspects are given in this article.
