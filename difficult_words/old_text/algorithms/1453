The method, developed on the basis of disperse analysis, includes anonymous questioning by multicomponent questionnaires containing several blocks of questions which cover the social composition, level of knowledge, behavioral and sexual orientation, control of the reliability of answers, etc. The correlative dependence of individual blocks permits the evaluation of the level and dynamics of the formation of microsocial environment at an institution. The use of this method makes it possible to differentiate youth subpopulations by the epidemiological importance of their risk of infection and its elements in the structure of an individual institution, to find out behavioral "groups of risk" and, in accordance with the data thus obtained, to build the system of propaganda adapted to these individual subpopulations and to the whole institution.
