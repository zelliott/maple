Body surface mapping is introduced in this paper. The research of body surface mapping involves two main aspects: data acquiring system and data processing methods. The recommended design utilizes the virtual instruments concept and high-speed open bus standard. The data processing methods involve qualitative and quantitative methods. Dynamic and static mapping techniques are introduced here as the qualitative methods while statistical methods, inverse calculation and principle component analysis are introduced as the quantitative methods.
