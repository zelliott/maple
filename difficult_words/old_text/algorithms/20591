Elevated left ventricular mass and increased wall thickness have important prognostic implications in clinical medicine. However, these parameters have been incompletely characterized by one- and two-dimensional echocardiography. Therefore this study was performed to validate in vitro measurement of left ventricular mass and circumferential wall thickness with a multiplane transesophageal transducer and three-dimensional reconstruction. Results for mass measurements were also compared with a standard method for the determination of left ventricular mass, the Penn convention. Fourteen necropsied left ventricles were scanned in a water bath by a volume-rendering, three-dimensional reconstruction system. There was an excellent correlation and high agreement for determination of three-dimensional left ventricular mass (r = 0.98; standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 9.6 gm; y = 1.02x + 0.46) and wall thickness (r = 0.93; SEE = 1.4 mm; y = 0.95x + 1.64) compared with anatomic measurements. Left ventricular mass by a simulated Penn convention revealed a lower correlation and larger error compared with three-dimensional measurements (r = 0.72; SEE = 42.8 gm; y = 1.01x + 9.61). Therefore determination of left ventricular mass by three-dimensional reconstruction was validated in vitro and was superior to one-dimensional echocardiographic methods.
