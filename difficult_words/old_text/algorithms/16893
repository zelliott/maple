A pioneering experiment of archival tagging of European hake Merluccius merluccius provided evidence of a diel vertical migration pattern which was analysed using an automatic method, developed and validated through time-frequency analyses. Frequent vertical movements across the thermocline were observed and fish experienced rapid temperature changes >7Â° C. These tagging-recapture data also suggested a homing behaviour to feeding grounds.
