A method is presented that uses a vectorial multiscale feature image for wave front propagation between two or more user defined points to retrieve the central axis of tubular objects in digital images. Its implicit scale selection mechanism makes the method more robust to overlap and to the presence of adjacent structures than conventional techniques that propagate a wave front over a scalar image representing the maximum of a range of filters. The method is shown to retain its potential to cope with severe stenoses or imaging artifacts and objects with varying widths in simulated and actual two-dimensional angiographic images.
