Interactions between cortical areas are crucial for cognitive functioning. Methods currently in use to assess such interactions are not well suited for this task because they lack timing precision, localization precision, or both. We present a method for simultaneous estimation of source location and orientation parameters and cross-spectral parameters to overcome these problems. Different estimators are evaluated for their performance. From a simulation study, we conclude that the estimators derived from the maximum-likelihood procedure have good statistical properties with moderate sample sizes, whereas those obtained from the generalized least squares procedure are biased and give poor-quality standard errors. The method is illustrated with visually evoked field data, with inconclusive results.
