Combining the concept of lateral shear interferometry (LSI) within a digital holography microscope, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain quantitative optical phase measurement in microscopy by a new single-image-processing procedure. Numerical lateral shear of the reconstructed wavefront in the image plane makes it possible to retrieve the derivative of the wavefront and remove the defocus aberration term introduced by the microscope objective. The method is tested to investigate a silicon structure and a mouse cell line.
