Images/videos captured from optical devices are usually degraded by turbid media such as haze, smoke, fog, rain and snow. Haze is the most common problem in outdoor scenes because of the atmosphere conditions. This paper proposes a novel single image-based dehazing framework to remove haze artifacts from images, where we propose two novel image priors, called the pixel-based dark channel prior and the pixel-based bright channel prior. Based on the two priors with the haze optical model, we propose to estimate atmospheric light via haze density analysis. We can then estimate transmission map, followed by refining it via the bilateral filter. As a result, high-quality haze-free images can be recovered with lower computational complexity compared with the state-of-the-art approach based on patch-based dark channel prior.
