Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is an unsupervised classification algorithm which has been widely used in many areas with its simplicity and its ability to deal with hidden clusters of different sizes and shapes and with noise. However, the computational issue of the distance table and the non-stability in detecting the boundaries of adjacent clusters limit the application of the original algorithm to large datasets such as images. In this paper, the DBSCAN algorithm was revised and improved for image clustering and segmentation. The proposed clustering algorithm presents two major advantages over the original one. Firstly, the revised DBSCAN algorithm made it applicable for large 3D image dataset (often with millions of pixels) by using the coordinate system of the image data. Secondly, the revised algorithm solved the non-stability issue of boundary detection in the original DBSCAN. For broader applications, the image dataset can be ordinary 3D images or in general, it can also be a classification result of other type of image data e.g. a multivariate image.
