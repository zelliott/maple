Acoustic wave fields in a thin-film bulk acoustic wave resonator are studied using a heterodyne laser interferometer. The measurement area is extended outside the active electrode region of the resonator, so that wave fields in both the active and surrounding regions can be characterized. At frequencies at which the region surrounding the resonator does not support laterally propagating acoustic waves, the analysis of the measurement data shows exponentially decaying amplitude fields outside the active resonator area, as suggested by theory. The magnitude of the imaginary wave vectors is determined by fitting an exponential function to the measured amplitude data, and thereby the experimentally determined dispersion diagram is extended into the region of imaginary wave numbers.
