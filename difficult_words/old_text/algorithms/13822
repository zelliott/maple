Noninvasive images of the myocardial activation sequence are acquired, based on a new formulation of the inverse problem of electrocardiography in terms of the critical points of the ventricular surface activation map. It is shown that the method is stable with respect to substantial amounts of correlated noise common in the measurements and modeling of electrocardiography and that problems associated with conventional regularization techniques can be circumvented. Examples of application of the method to measured human data are presented. This first invasive validation of results compares well to previously published results obtained by using a standard approach. The method can provide additional constraints on, and thus improve, traditional methods aimed at solving the inverse problem of electrocardiography.
