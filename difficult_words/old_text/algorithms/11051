We present several procedures to represent molecular electrostatic potential as a graph, based on the pattern of critical points and their neighborhood relations. This representation is used for the molecular electrostatic comparison, which is reduced to a comparison of tree-type graphs. Several methods to compare trees are also presented. The applications of this algorithm to compare and classify molecules through their electrostatic potential are illustrated.
