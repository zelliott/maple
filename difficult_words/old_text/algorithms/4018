Seizure freedom after resective epilepsy surgery is not obtained in a substantial number of patients with medically intractable epilepsy. Functional neural network analysis is a promising technique for more accurate identification of the target areas for epilepsy surgery, but a better understanding of the correlations between changes in functional network organization due to surgery and postoperative seizure status is required. We explored these correlations in longitudinal magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of 20 lesional epilepsy patients. Resting-state MEG recordings were obtained at baseline (preoperatively; T0) and at 3-7 (T1) and 9-15months after resection (T2). We assessed frequency-specific functional connectivity and performed a minimum spanning tree (MST) network analysis. The MST captures the most important connections in the network. We found a significant positive correlation between functional connectivity in the lower alpha band and seizure frequency at T0, especially in regions where lesions were located. MST leaf fraction, a measure of integration of information in the network, was significantly increased between T0 and T2, only for the seizure-free patients. This is in line with previous work, which showed that lower functional network integration in lesional epilepsy patients is related to higher epilepsy burden. Finally, eccentricity and betweenness centrality, which are measures of hub-status, decreased between T0 and T2 in seizure free patients, also in regions that were anatomically close to resection cavities. Our results increase insight into functional network changes in successful epilepsy surgery and might eventually be utilized for optimization of neurosurgical approaches.
