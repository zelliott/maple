We present an improved analysis of reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM) images, recorded to investigate model membrane systems that mimic cell adhesion. The model systems were giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV) adhering via specific ligand-receptor interactions to supported lipid bilayers (SLB) or to patterns of receptors. Conventional RICM and dual-wavelength RICM (DW-RICM) were applied to measure absolute optical distances between the biomembranes and planar substrates. We developed algorithms for a straightforward implementation of an automated, time-resolved reconstruction of the membrane conformations from RICM/DW-RICM images, taking into account all the interfaces in the system and blurring of the data due to camera noise. Finally, we demonstrate the validity and usefulness of this new approach by analyzing the topography and fluctuations of a bound membrane in the steady state and its dynamic adaptation to osmotic pressure changes. These measurements clearly show that macroscopic membrane flow through tightly adhered area is possible in our system.
