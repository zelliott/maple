B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac neurohormone released as preproBNP and then enzymatically cleaved to N-terminal-proBNP and BNP upon ventricular myocyte stretch. Blood measurements of BNP have been used to identify patients with heart failure. Currently, BNP assay is used as a diagnostic and prognostic aid in congestive heart failure. In general, a BNP level <100 pg/mL excludes acutely decompensated heart failure. This article sorts out the literature concerning the practical use of BNP in a variety of clinical scenarios.
