Patients with acute brain injury from various etiologies commonly develop increased intracranial pressure. Acute intracranial hypertension resulting from elevation of intracranial pressure is a medical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and management. Appropriate and timely management strategies result in better patient outcome in an otherwise severely debilitating or fatal disease process.

The clinical manifestation and principles of management of acute intracranial hypertension are discussed and reviewed. Acute treatment protocols are presented in an algorithm-based format aimed at utilizing the current available management strategies and suggested therapeutic goals. Individualization of specific therapeutic modalities is emphasized to optimize the clinical outcome.

Clinicians treating patients with acute brain injury should be familiar with the principles of management of increased intracranial pressure. Since acute intracranial hypertension is a potentially reversible condition, high index of suspicion, and low threshold for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies will improve patient care.
