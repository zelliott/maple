The most important element in the treatment of acute hospitalized asthmatics is salbutamol administered via wet nebulization prescribed usually on a subjective evaluation of the patient's status. This study outlines a novel protocol that incorporates the FEV1 variable as the major objective parameter in a feedback loop. Data from patients admitted in the year prior to the initiation of the protocol (N = 348) were compared with similar data from patients hospitalized the year following institution of the protocol (N = 238). There were no withdrawals from the protocol due to adverse effects nor were there any deteriorations requiring ICU admission. A significant decrease in the length of hospitalization and the number of salbutamol prescriptions per hospitalization was observed after, relative to before, institution of the protocol (2.2 vs. 2.6 days; 2.3 vs. 3.8; p < .05, respectively). It is concluded that this protocol is safe and efficient, and may also be more efficacious than a nonstandardized approach for treating the hospitalized asthmatic child.
