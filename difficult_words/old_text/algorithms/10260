The purpose of this study was to determine the dosimetric impact of density variations observed in water-equivalent solid slabs. Measurements were performed using two 30 cm Ã— 30 cm water-equivalent slabs, one being 4 cm think and the other 5 cm thick. The location and extent of density variations were determined by computed tomography (CT) scans. Additional imaging measurements were made with an amorphous silicon megavoltage portal imaging device and an ultrasound unit. Dosimetric measurements were conducted with a 2D ion chamber array, and a scanned diode in water. Additional measurements and calculations were made of small rectilinear void inhomogeneities formed with water-equivalent slabs, using a 2D ion chamber array and the convolution superposition algorithm. Two general types of density variation features were observed on CT images: 1) regions of many centimeters across, but typically only a few millimeters thick, with electron densities a few percent lower than the bulk material, and 2) cylindrical regions roughly 0.2 cm in diameter and up to 20 cm long with electron densities up to 5% lower than the surrounding material. The density variations were not visible on kilovoltage, megavoltage or ultrasound images. The dosimetric impact of the density variations were not detectable to within 0.1% using the 2D ion chamber array or the scanning photon diode at distances 0.4 cm to 2 cm beyond the features. High-resolution dosimetric calculations using the convolution-superposition algorithm with density corrections enabled on CT-based datasets showed no discernable dosimetric impact. Calculations and measurements on simulated voids place the upper limit on possible dosimetric variations from observed density variations at much less than 0.6%. CT imaging of water-equivalent slabs may reveal density variations which are otherwise unobserved with kV, MV, or ultrasound imaging. No dosimetric impact from these features was measureable with an ion chamber array or scanned photon diode. Consequently, they were determined to be acceptable for all clinical use.
