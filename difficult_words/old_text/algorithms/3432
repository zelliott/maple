AVN of the talus is a challenging disease process with respect to patho-physiology and treatment. We believe that our algorithm is a legitimate approach to aid the orthopedic surgeon in initiating a promising treatment. It is divided into different levels and allows to change between some. This is not the only way to proceed but it seems promising, especially if the long-term results with the vascularized bone grafts show revascularization of the talus. As always in medicine, the treatment needs to be individualized. Arthrodesis always should be the last option and is a challenging procedure.
