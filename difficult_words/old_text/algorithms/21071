Manganas et al. (Reports, 9 November 2007, p. 980) used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify a biomarker of neural progenitor cells. However, their analysis relies on spectral processing methods that are known to be problematic. Absent detection using alternate methods of spectrum analysis or controls to quantify the false discovery rate, their conclusions may be premature.
