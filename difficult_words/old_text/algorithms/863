We developed a network model in an attempt to characterize heterogeneity of tissue elasticity of the lung. The model includes a parallel set of pathways, each consisting of an airway resistance, an airway inertance, and a tissue element connected in series. The airway resistance, airway inertance, and the hysteresivity of the tissue elements were the same in each pathway, whereas the tissue elastance (H) followed a hyperbolic distribution between a minimum and maximum. To test the model, we measured the input impedance of the respiratory system of ventilated normal and emphysematous C57BL/6 mice in closed chest condition at four levels of positive end-expiratory pressures. Mild emphysema was developed by nebulized porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) (30 IU/day x 6 days). Respiratory mechanics were studied 3 wk following the initial treatment. The model significantly improved the fitting error compared with a single-compartment model. The PPE treatment was associated with an increase in mean alveolar diameter and a decrease in minimum, maximum, and mean H. The coefficient of variation of H was significantly larger in emphysema (40%) than that in control (32%). These results indicate that PPE treatment resulted in increased time-constant inequalities associated with a wider distribution of H. The heterogeneity of alveolar size (diameters and area) was also larger in emphysema, suggesting that the model-based tissue elastance heterogeneity may reflect the underlying heterogeneity of the alveolar structure.
