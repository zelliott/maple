To adapt a magnetization-prepared spiral imaging technique, termed T1prep, for time-efficient radiofrequency (RF)-insensitive prostate T(1) quantification at 1.5 T and evaluate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limits to voxel-based versus subregion analysis.

A magnetization-prepared spiral imaging technique was adapted for robust T(1) contrast development, multislice imaging within 5 minutes, and data regression to a monoexponential decay. In vitro testing evaluated RF insensitivity of the multislice acquisition plus method accuracy. A pilot study was performed in 15 patients with low or intermediate risk localized prostate cancer.

The multislice design displayed excellent RF insensitivity (<1% error for RF mistunings to ± 20%) and accuracy (within 3% of gold standard for T(1) values between 140 and 2100 msec). A clinical pilot study reported significantly reduced T(1) from PZ to CG to tumor subregions (PZ: 1421 ± 168 msec, n = 11; CG: 1314 ± 49 msec, n = 13; 1246 ± 68 msec, n = 8). SNR measurements identified an inappropriateness of voxel-based analysis.

T1prep can quantify prostate T(1) as an adjunct measure for quantitative perfusion measurements and longitudinal treatment response monitoring. Intrapatient heterogeneities support T(1) assessment within individual patients. SNR calculations will support a transition to voxel-based analysis in future trials.
