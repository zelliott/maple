Determination of lactate concentrations in vivo is required in the noninvasive diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic monitoring of diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and stroke. An iterative filtering process based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) method in the time domain is proposed to isolate the lactate doublet signal from overlapping lipid resonances and estimate the magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) parameters of the lactate methyl signal (signal amplitude, chemical shift, J-coupling and apparent transverse relaxation time (T*(2))). This method offers a number of advantages over the multiple quantum (MQ) and difference spectroscopy approaches, including: 1) full recovery of the lactate methyl signal, whereas the MQ methods usually detect 50% of the signal intensity; 2) in contrast to MQ methods, the lipid signal is retained together with J-coupling data on the lactate peak; 3) the CWT method is much less sensitive to motion artifacts than difference spectroscopy. Application of the method to simulated and real (1)H MRS data collected from human blood plasma and brain tumors demonstrated that this filter provides accurate estimates of the MRS parameters of the lactate doublet and efficiently removes lipid contributions.
