The article considers 3 different points of view on systemic mathematical analysis of human fatigue process. In this case, the same physiologic information is processed according to various algorithms for integral and digital estimates of lowered performance and energy expenditure, as well as indirect characteristics of inhibition and excitation processes in the brain cortex. The mathematical results are applied in computer forecasting of individual occupational risk at the specific workplace.
