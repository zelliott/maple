In this study, we aimed to improve the performance of a locomotion-mode-recognition system based on neuromuscular-mechanical fusion by introducing additional information about the walking environment. Linear-discriminant-analysis-based classifiers were first designed to identify a lower limb prosthesis user's locomotion mode based on electromyographic signals recorded from residual leg muscles and ground reaction forces measured from the prosthetic pylon. Nine transfemoral amputees who wore a passive hydraulic knee or powered prosthetic knee participated in this study. Information about the walking terrain was simulated and modeled as prior probability based on the principle of maximum entropy and integrated into the discriminant functions of the classifier. When the correct prior knowledge of walking terrain was simulated, the classification accuracy for each locomotion mode significantly increased and no task transitions were missed. In addition, simulated incorrect prior knowledge did not significantly reduce system performance, indicating that our design is robust against noisy and imperfect prior information. Furthermore, these observations were independent of the type of prosthesis applied. The promising results in this study may assist the further development of an environment-aware adaptive system for locomotion-mode recognition for powered lower limb prostheses or orthoses.
