The transient response of a resonant structure can be altered by the attachment of one or more substantially smaller resonators. Considered here is a coupled array of damped harmonic oscillators whose resonant frequencies are distributed across a frequency band that encompasses the natural frequency of the primary structure. Vibration energy introduced to the primary structure, which has little to no intrinsic damping, is transferred into and trapped by the attached array. It is shown that, when the properties of the array are optimized to reduce the settling time of the primary structure's transient response, the apparent damping is approximately proportional to the bandwidth of the array (the span of resonant frequencies of the attached oscillators). Numerical simulations were conducted using an unconstrained nonlinear minimization algorithm to find system parameters that result in the fastest settling time. This minimization was conducted for a range of system characteristics including the overall bandwidth of the array, the ratio of the total array mass to that of the primary structure, and the distributions of mass, stiffness, and damping among the array elements. This paper reports optimal values of these parameters and demonstrates that the resulting minimum settling time decreases with increasing bandwidth.
