An analytic element approach is presented for the modeling of multiaquifer domains embedded in a single-aquifer model. The inside of each domain may consist of an arbitrary number of aquifers separated by leaky layers. The analytic element solution is obtained through a combination of existing single-aquifer and multiaquifer analytic elements and allows for the analytic computation of head and leakage at any point in the aquifer. Along the boundary of an embedded multiaquifer domain, the normal flux is continuous everywhere; continuity of head across the boundary is met exactly at collocations points and approximately, but very accurately, in between. The analytic element solution compares well with an existing exact solution. A hypothetical example with a river intersecting two embedded domains illustrates the practical application of the proposed approach.
