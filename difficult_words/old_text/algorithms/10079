In various kinds of cultured cells, it has been reported that the membrane potential exhibits fluctuations with long-term correlations, although the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. A cardiac muscle cell culture serves as an excellent experimental system to investigate this phenomenon because timings of excitations can be determined over an extended time period in a noninvasive manner through visualization of contractions, although the properties of beat-timing fluctuations of cardiac muscle cells at the single-cell level remains to be fully clarified. In this article, we report on our investigation of spontaneous contractions of cultured rat cardiac muscle cells at the single-cell level. It was found that single cells exhibit several typical temporal patterns of contractions and spontaneous transitions among them. Detrended fluctuation analysis on the time series of interbeat intervals revealed the presence of 1/f(beta) noise at sufficiently large timescales. Furthermore, multifractality was also found in the time series of interbeat intervals. These experimental trends were successfully explained using a simple mathematical model, incorporating correlated noise into ionic currents. From these findings, it was established that singular fluctuations accompanying 1/f(beta) noise and multifractality are intrinsic properties of single cardiac muscle cells.
