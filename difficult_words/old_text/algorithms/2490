We examined the elution behavior of isoluminol isothiocyanate (ILITC)-labeled biomolecules (α-amino acids, peptides, and proteins) in an open-tubular capillary chromatography system using an untreated fused-silica capillary tube and a water-acetonitrile-ethyl acetate mixture carrier solution.  Such an open-tubular capillary chromatography is called "tube radial distribution chromatography (TRDC)" for convenience.  A mixture of ILITC and ILITC-labeled biomolecules was analyzed using TRDC with chemiluminescence detection that provided simple instrument without a light source and complex optical devises.  The ILITC and the labeled twenty α-amino acids were separated, in this order or the reverse order, or not separated with an organic solvent-rich and water-rich carrier solution.  Their elution behavior was considered to be of hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature of ILITC and the labeled α-amino acids.  The ILITC and the labeled protein, alcohol dehydrogenase and bovine serum albumin, were separated in this order with an organic solvent-rich carrier solution, while they were eluted in the reverse order with a water-rich carrier solution, based on the TRDC separation performance.  The TRDC system worked with the untreated open-tubular capillary tube not using any specific capillary tubes, such as coated, packed, or monolithic.
