Undertaking a HIV seroepidemiological survey in Sahel is logistically problematic, since countries like Niger or Mali are very large with scattered populations and harsh climatic conditions. Therefore, the replacement of serum samples by whole blood dried on filter papers has been studied for HIV-antibody testing with commercial kits that are commonly used. In Niger, two tests ELISA (Genscreen HIV1/2 version 2, Vironostika HIV Uni-Form II Ag/Ab) and two rapid tests (Determine HIV1/2 et Immunocomb II HIV1&2 Bispot) were used to compare the dried blood spots and serum samples from 43 control individuals. Both ELISAs gave an excellent correlation (r = 0.99 et r = 0.98) between the dried blood spots and serum absorbance values. Using the rapid tests, the HIV status was found 100% concordant with dried blood spots and serum samples. An algorithm using three out of the four mentioned tests was defined then validated on the dried blood spots of 163 control individuals (100% concordant). In conclusion, dried blood spots may accurately and profitably replace serum samples for the serodiagnosis of HIV infection and for mass serosurveys in Sahel.
