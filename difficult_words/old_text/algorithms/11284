"Camera Technologies for Low Light Imaging" is designed to offer the reader a summary of the current camera choices for low light imaging with special emphasis on the practical aspects related to each. Four major camera technologies, cooled charge-coupled device, cooled sCMOS, intensified cameras, and electron multiplier cameras, are discussed and compared. Supporting information about noise characteristics of photoelectrons and camera noise are provided and used for illuminating the practical aspects of using these cameras.
