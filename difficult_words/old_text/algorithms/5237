The filtration of SiO(2), Al(2)O(3) and Fe(2)O(3) particles with average sizes of 4 and 40 microm using a fluidized bed filter at 40 and 300 degrees C was studied. The collection mechanisms, interparticle forces and bounce-off effect between filtered particles and collectors were analyzed to determine their effect on particle filtration. Experimental results showed that the collection efficiency of 4 microm SiO(2) and Al(2)O(3) particles exceeded that of 40 microm particles. Contrarily, the 40 microm Fe(2)O(3) particles were collected more efficiently than the 4 microm particles, because of the differences between the microstructures of SiO(2), Al(2)O(3,) and Fe(2)O(3) particles. The interaction between the particles affected the removal of mixed SiO(2), Al(2)O(3) and Fe(2)O(3). The particle size distribution (PSD) of the particles in the exit was governed by the operating temperature, the original size of the filtered particles, the interparticle force and the hardness of the particles and the collectors. The smallest particles were not those most easily elutriated from the fluidized bed filter because they agglomerated with each other or with large particles. The van der Waal's force dominated the forces between 4 and 40 microm particles. The main collection mechanism for 4 and 40 microm particles was direct interception. The effect of impaction increased with particle size above 40 microm. The strong impaction and bounce-off effect reduced the collection efficiency of 40 microm SiO(2) and Al(2)O(3) particles. However, the strong interparticle force between Fe(2)O(3) particles and collectors contributed to the high collection efficiency of the Fe(2)O(3) particles.
