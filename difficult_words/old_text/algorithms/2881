Level of artifacts in spectra obtained by Multidimensional Fourier Transform has been studied, considering randomly sampled signals of high dimensionality and long evolution times. It has been shown theoretically and experimentally, that this level is dependent on the number of time domain samples, but not on its relation to the number of points required in appropriate conventional experiment. Independence of the evolution time domain size (in the terms of both: dimensionality and evolution time reached), suggests that random sampling should be used rather to design new techniques with large time domain than to accelerate standard experiments. 5D HC(CC-TOCSY)CONH has been presented as the example of such approach. The feature of Multidimensional Fourier Transform, namely the possibility of calculating spectral values at arbitrary chosen frequency points, allowed easy examination of resulting spectrum. We present the example of such approach, referred to as Sparse Multidimensional Fourier Transform.
