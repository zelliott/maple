Computer assisted bone age assessment (BAA) integrated with a clinical PACS is described. The image analysis is performed on a DICOM compliant workstation able to accept images from a PACS server or directly from an image modality (digital radiography or film scanner). Images can be processed in two modes. If the image is acquired from a normally developed subject, it can be added to the digital hand atlas. An image may also be subjected only to a diagnostic analysis for the BAA without archiving the features in the database. The image analysis is performed in three steps. A location of six region of interest is followed by their segmentation and feature extraction. The features analysis results in retrieving the closest image match from the standard database. Based on currently analyzed image data in the hand atlas, the standard deviation of the assessment bone age does not exceed 1 yr of age.
