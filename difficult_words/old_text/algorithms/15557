The aim of this work is to characterise the skin permeation properties of a male rat by means of a purely diffusive mathematical model based on Fick's second law. Additionally, in the attempt of proposing a reliable tool allowing the skin permeability (or resistance) determination on the basis of experimental data, the model automatically accounts also for two typical experimental conditions. In particular, drug dissolution in the donor environment and receiver sampling technique (part of the receiver volume is withdrawn and immediately replaced by fresh solvent) are considered. The results of this characterisation are then compared with those coming from a common simplified approach. Acyclovir is chosen as model drug and a thermostatic (37 degrees C) Franz cell apparatus is used to perform permeation experiments. This study suggests that Acyclovir permeation through the rat skin can be well described by the proposed model and that some differences arise in the evaluation of the full-skin resistance performed by means of our model or the usual simpler approach.
