Immunological indices and hemograms were studied in 80 children early in the course of primary tuberculous infection to ascertain prognostic criteria of chemoprophylaxis efficacy. Of prognostic importance appeared: to be the Mantoux test with 2 TU PPD-L; T-lymphocyte, T-helpers, active T-lymphocytes, leukocyte, eosinophil count; leukocyte migration inhibition test with pulmonary antigen and BCG; hemogram assessment according to Garkavi and its dynamic changes 1 month after chemoprophylaxis. Basing on these prognostic criteria relevant algorithms have been derived.
