The goal of this preliminary study was to investigate the feasibility of using singular value decomposition (SVD) to eliminate the M-wave from the surface electromyogram (EMG) of an electrically stimulated paretic muscle in order to extract the volitional response. An SVD-based algorithm combining the subspaces method and a subsequent filtering is presented. It was evaluated with EMG signals registered from surface of electrically stimulated muscles with simulated paresis and its performance was compared with a conventional fixed filter. The filtering strategy proposed showed a good performance in static conditions where there were no traces of the M-wave. In dynamic conditions, the SVD-based algorithm was robust but with some remaining M-wave traces. It would be as a consequence of modifications in the data matrix and, therefore, in the subspaces generator columns and the singular values. In general, the fixed filter was very sensitive to input signal disturbances. In all of these conditions there was a greater power reduction for the SVD-based filter than for the fixed filter.
