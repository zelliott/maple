Microbes are known to regulate both gene expression and protein activity through the use of post-translational modifications (PTMs). Common PTMs involved in cellular signaling and gene control include methylations, acetylations, and phosphorylations, whereas oxidations have been implicated as an indicator of stress. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a Gram-negative bacterium that demonstrates both respiratory versatility and the ability to sense and adapt to diverse environmental conditions. The data set used in this study consisted of tandem mass spectra derived from midlog phase aerobic cultures of S. oneidensis either native or shocked with 1 mM chromate [Cr(VI)]. In this study, three algorithms (DBDigger, Sequest, and InsPecT) were evaluated for their ability to scrutinize shotgun proteomic data for evidence of PTMs. The use of conservative scoring filters for peptides or proteins versus creating a subdatabase first from a nonmodification search was evaluated with DBDigger. The use of higher-scoring filters for peptide identifications was found to result in optimal identifications of PTM peptides with a 2% false discovery rate (FDR) for the total data set using the DBDigger algorithm. However, the FDR climbs to unacceptably high levels when only PTM peptides are considered. Sequest was evaluated as a method for confirming PTM peptides putatively identified using DBDigger; however, there was a low identification rate ( approximately 25%) for the searched spectra. InsPecT was found to have a much lower, and thus more acceptable, FDR than DBDigger for PTM peptides. Comparisons between InsPecT and DBDigger were made with respect to both the FDR and PTM peptide identifications. As a demonstration of this approach, a number of S. oneidensis chemotaxis proteins as well as low-abundance signal transduction proteins were identified as being post-translationally modified in response to chromate challenge.
