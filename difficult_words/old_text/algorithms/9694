Sugammadex, a cyclodextrin, is a novel agent designed to encapsulate selectively steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents such as rocuronium and vecuronium as well. One molecule of sugammadex is able to encapsulate only one molecule of muscle relaxant. This original pharmacological property allows a very rapid reversal of muscle paralysis. After sugammadex injection, a train of four ratio higher than 0.9 is obtained in less than 5 minutes in all the patients whatever the degree of muscle paralysis at the time of reversal and even when anesthesia is maintained with halogenated agents. However, in order to preserve this efficacy, the dose of sugammadex needs to be adjusted to the degree of muscle paralysis at the time of reversal : 2 mg/kg after obtaining 2 responses at the adductor pollicis muscle after a train of four stimulation, 4 mg/kg with a post-tetanic count between 1 and 3 responses, and 12 to 16 mg/kg in case of rescue reversal (3 to 15 minutes after 0.6 to 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium). Even if the original property of sugammadex lets us think that per-operative neuromuscular transmission monitoring would not be furthermore useful, the assessment of the exact degree of muscle paralysis before reversal is mandatory for choosing the right dose of sugammadex.
