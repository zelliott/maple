This paper is concerned with the problem of adaptive fuzzy tracking control for a class of pure-feedback stochastic nonlinear systems with input saturation. To overcome the design difficulty from nondifferential saturation nonlinearity, a smooth nonlinear function of the control input signal is first introduced to approximate the saturation function; then, an adaptive fuzzy tracking controller based on the mean-value theorem is constructed by using backstepping technique. The proposed adaptive fuzzy controller guarantees that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded in probability and the system output eventually converges to a small neighborhood of the desired reference signal in the sense of mean quartic value. Simulation results further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
