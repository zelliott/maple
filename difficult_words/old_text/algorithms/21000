Sedation and analgesia are a constant challenging issue in paediatric intensive care units, for ethical reasons among others. Basically, goals and available treatments in that context do not differ from those in adults. For instance, while we propose midazolam as the first choice benzodiazepine, there is no evidence for encouraging the use of one morphinomimetic rather than others in children. On the other hand, numerous paediatric specificities do exist: understanding and expression of pain both different and difficult, presence and involvement of the parents, pain assessment methods, pharmacology, pathologies. It is therefore mandatory to know these specificities to ensure a proper use of evaluation tools and therapeutics. The paucity of strong evidence from the literature does not allow producing definitive consensus guidelines. However, some practices can be highlighted such as the use of written protocol on pain/sedation evaluation and therapeutics adapted to children, literature data and local habits, the training of medical/nursing staff and the constitution of local referring team. A particular attention should be paid to propofol: its use longer than several hours should be strongly discouraged in infants and children due to the risk of Propofol Infusion Syndrome. Further clinical studies should be conducted in an attempt to provide answers to routine, daily issues and questions, for example, how to tailor the level of sedation to the needs of the patient, how to stop it, which drug must be preferred or what place for non-pharmacological approaches.
