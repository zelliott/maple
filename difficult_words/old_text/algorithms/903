After a detailed behavioral and developmental history has been supplemented by the use of formal questionnaires, the diagnosis of an attentional disorder can be further clarified by the judicious selection of psychoeducational and pediatric physical and neurodevelopmental examinations. The most common difficulty in the interpretation of psychoeducational test subscores and profiles is the significant overlap between the patterns generated by attentional deficits and those associated with memory-based learning disabilities. Certain other medical and behavioral conditions need to receive careful consideration prior to finalizing the diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). A thorough but focused general examination coupled with the pediatric neurodevelopmental examination can contribute to this differentiation.
