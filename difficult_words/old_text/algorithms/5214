Although real imaging problems involve objects that have variations in three dimensions, a majority of work examining inverse scattering methods for ultrasonic tomography considers 2-D imaging problems. Therefore, the study of 3-D inverse scattering methods is necessary for future applications of ultrasonic tomography. In this work, 3-D reconstructions using different arrays of rectangular elements focused on elevation were studied when reconstructing spherical imaging targets by producing a series of 2-D image slices using the 2-D distorted Born iterative method (DBIM). The effects of focal number f/#, speed of sound contrast c, and scatterer size were considered. For comparison, the 3-D wave equation was also inverted using point-like transducers to produce fully 3-D DBIM image reconstructions. In 2-D slicing, blurring in the vertical direction was highly correlated with the transmit/receive elevation point-spread function of the transducers for low c. The eventual appearance of overshoot artifacts in the vertical direction were observed with increasing c. These diffraction-related artifacts were less severe for smaller focal number values and larger spherical target sizes. When using 3-D DBIM, the overshoot artifacts were not observed and spatial resolution was improved. However, results indicate that array configuration in 3-D reconstructions is important for good image reconstruction. Practical arrays were designed and assessed for image reconstruction using 3-D DBIM.
