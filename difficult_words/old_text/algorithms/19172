In this study, a resting-state fMRI based classifier, for the first time, was proposed and applied to discriminate children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from normal controls. On the basis of regional homogeneity (ReHo), a mapping of brain function at resting state, PCA-based Fisher discriminative analysis (PC-FDA) was trained to build a linear classifier. Permutation test was then conducted to identify the brain areas with the most significant contribution to the final discrimination. Experimental results showed a correct classification rate of 85% using a leave-one-out cross-validation. Moreover, some highly discriminative brain regions, like the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, well confirmed the previous findings on ADHD. Interestingly, some important but less reported regions such as the thalamus were also identified. We conclude that the classifier, using resting-state brain function as classification feature, has potential ability to improve current diagnosis and treatment evaluation of ADHD.
