A new compound, 5-O-(4'-[beta-d-glucopyranosyl]-trans-feruloyl)quinic acid (GPFQ, 10), is reported from the medicinal plant goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis). A new HPLC method is described and used to show that GPFQ is a potential marker for goldenseal roots (1.0% w/w) and rhizomes (2.3%). GPFQ was found at much lower levels in stems (<0.1%) and could not be detected in leaves. Neochlorogenic acid (9), which has not previously been reported from goldenseal, and chlorogenic acid (6) reached their highest levels in leaves (0.9% 9 and 0.5% 6). The main alkaloids, hydrastine (1) and berberine (2), were highest in rhizomes (2.8% 1 and 4.6% 2), but palmatine (5) was not found in genuine goldenseal.
