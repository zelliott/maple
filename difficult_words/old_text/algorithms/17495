This paper describes a hierarchical architecture and a high-performance and interoperability protocol for centralized monitoring and controlling systems (CMCS). The protocol we proposed can interoperate different monitoring and controlling systems constructed by different companies, each with different functions and communication protocols. The protocol reduces the amount of traffic and has real-time and high-performance advantages. The protocol was implemented in CMCS for telecommunication power supply and air-conditioner used by the Telecommunication Bureau of Zhejiang Province. This paper deals with the hierarchical architecture and function of CMCS and packet format, command ID, and SDL description of its protocol. We also discuss the properties of the interoperability and performance of the protocol in this paper.
