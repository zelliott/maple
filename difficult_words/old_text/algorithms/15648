Mesenteric venous thrombosis is an uncommon but often fatal form of intestinal ischaemia. The authors present two cases of severe small intestinal ischaemia due to superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, the first associated with oral contraceptive use and a congenital methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase defect and the second associated with atypical intestinal mycobacterial disease and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The authors review the relevant literature using the Medline search facility and comment on the changing aspects of MVT syndrome with regard to aetiological factors, diagnostic approach and surgical or pharmacological therapy.
