A method for generating various forms of junctions involving armchair and zig-zag nanotubes, firstly introduced by Zsoldos et al., is developed to cover all types of armchair and zig-zag nanotubes in a systematical way. This method can also be used to produce nanogears and toothed canals. The method is explained and flowcharts are included to aid in programming into a code.
