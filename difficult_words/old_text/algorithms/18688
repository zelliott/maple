Integrated multimodal care is needed for patients with Ewing sarcoma, which is the second most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescence. Chemotherapy increases survival from less than 5% to 65-70% for patients with localized tumors and to 25-30% for those with metastases at diagnosis. Surgery is a major tool, whereas advances in imaging techniques have improved the indications for and the optimization of treatment. Radiotherapy remains useful, either alone or in addition to surgery, and new techniques (conformational RT and IMRT) will reduce short-term toxic effects. Pediatric oncologists do not outweigh surgeons or radiation therapists, but they are the ones who coordinate the medical team, which also includes pathologists and imaging specialists.

The point of view of the pediatric oncologist was assessed as follows: the place of chemotherapy in Ewing tumor treatment, the place of radiotherapy in Ewing tumor treatment (including why avoid radiotherapy when technically possible in children), and how to proceed into the future? The place of surgery as local treatment for Ewing tumors was also evaluated.

These reviews show a dynamic and kaleidoscopic panorama of intense activity at the laboratory and clinical levels.

Though good survival rates have been achieved, improvements using entirely new approaches are needed.
