We propose a method based on the maximum-likelihood technique for removing speckle patterns that plague coherent images. The proposed method is designed for images whose gray levels vary continuously in space. The image model is based on a lattice of nodes corresponding to vertices of triangles in which the gray level of each pixel is produced by linear interpolation. A constraint on isoline gray levels is introduced to regularize the solution.
