Gepard provides a user-friendly, interactive application for the quick creation of dotplots. It utilizes suffix arrays to reduce the time complexity of dotplot calculation to Theta(m*log n). A client-server mode, which is a novel feature for dotplot creation software, allows the user to calculate dotplots and color them by functional annotation without any prior downloading of sequence or annotation data.

Both source codes and executable binaries are available at http://mips.gsf.de/services/analysis/gepard
