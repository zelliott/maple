In this paper, the automated diagnostic systems trained on diverse and composite features were presented for detection of electrocardiographic changes in partial epileptic patients. In practical applications of pattern recognition, there are often diverse features extracted from raw data that require recognizing. Methods of combining multiple classifiers with diverse features are viewed as a general problem in various application areas of pattern recognition. Two types (normal and partial epilepsy) of ECG beats (180 records from each class) were obtained from the Physiobank database. The multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), combined neural network (CNN), mixture of experts (ME), and modified mixture of experts (MME) were tested and benchmarked for their performance on the classification of the studied ECG signals, which were trained on diverse or composite features. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by eigenvector methods and classification using the classifiers trained on the extracted features. The present research demonstrated that the MME trained on the diverse features achieved accuracy rates (total classification accuracy is 99.44%) that were higher than that of the other automated diagnostic systems.
