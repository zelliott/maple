To combat the millions of days of restricted activity and the billions of dollars spent in respiratory clinical practice, national health objectives are targeting people with asthma. Research data depict nurses and other health care providers as encountering patients with asthma and allergies who do not adhere to their medical and nursing care management plans. The skills and success with which these professional caregivers are able to assist these patients depends on an understanding of how to measure and evaluate compliance and adherence issues. In turn, this implementation of effective strategies for optimal patient outcomes can be actualized. Patient-related, practice-related, and health care provider-related factors must be considered to ensure that patients get the best chance to succeed and to be compliant. Achieving adherence with regimens not only reduces health care expenditures but ultimately results in patients' reaching their highest level of wellness.
