Alcoholic fermentation under Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts is governed largely by glucose uptake, biomass formation, ethanol and glycerin production, and acidification. In this work, PLS calibration models were developed with a view to determining these analytical parameters from near infrared spectra and analytical data provided by the corresponding reference methods. The models were applied to a set of samples obtained from various fermentation processes. The glucose, ethanol, and biomass values predicted by the models exhibited a high correlation with those provided by the reference method.
