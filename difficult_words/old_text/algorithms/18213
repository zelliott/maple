To integrate imaging performance characteristics, specifically sensitivity and specificity, of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) into arteriovenous malformation (AVM) radiosurgery planning and evaluation.

Images of 10 patients with AVMs located in critical brain areas were analyzed in this retrospective planning study. The image findings were first used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of MRA and DSA. Instead of accepting the imaging observation as a binary (yes or no) mapping of AVM location, our alternative is to translate the image into an AVM probability distribution map by incorporating imagers' sensitivity and specificity, and to use this map as a basis for planning and evaluation. Three sets of radiosurgery plans, targeting the MRA and DSA positive overlap, MRA positive, and DSA positive were optimized for best conformality. The AVM obliteration rate (ORAVM) and brain complication rate served as endpoints for plan comparison.

In our 10-patient study, the specificities and sensitivities of MRA and DSA were estimated to be (0.95, 0.74) and (0.71, 0.95), respectively. The positive overlap of MRA and DSA accounted for 67.8% +/- 4.9% of the estimated true AVM volume. Compared with plans targeting MRA and DSA-positive overlap, plans targeting MRA-positive or DSA-positive improved ORAVM by 4.1% +/- 1.9% and 15.7% +/- 8.3%, while also increasing the complication rate by 1.0% +/- 0.8% and 4.4% +/- 2.3%, respectively.

The impact of imagers' quality should be quantified and incorporated in AVM radiosurgery planning and evaluation to facilitate clinical decision making.
