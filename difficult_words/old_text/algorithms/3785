We study methods for reducing chemical master equations using the Michaelis-Menten mechanism as an example. The master equation consists of a set of linear ordinary differential equations whose variables are probabilities that the realizable states exist. For a master equation with s(0) initial substrate molecules and e(0) initial enzyme molecules, the manifold can be parametrized by s(0) of the probability variables. Fraser's functional iteration method is found to be difficult to use for master equations of high dimension. Building on the insights gained from Fraser's method, techniques are developed to produce s(0)-dimensional manifolds of larger systems directly from the eigenvectors. We also develop a simple, but surprisingly effective way to generate initial conditions for the reduced models.
