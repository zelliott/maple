We show that a granular mixture subject to horizontal oscillations can be reduced to a monodisperse system of particles interacting via an effective interaction. This interaction is attractive at short distances and strongly anisotropic, and its features explain the system rich phenomenology, including segregation and stripe pattern formation. Finally, we show that a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation, which takes into account the characteristics of the effective interaction, is capable of describing the dynamics of the mixture.
