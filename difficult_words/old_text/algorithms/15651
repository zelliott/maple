Atrial septal pacing has been shown to prevent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) refractory to drugs in patients without inappropriate bradycardia. This study assesses the effects of atrial septal pacing using new pacing algorithms designed to prevent the initiation or maintenance of PAF.

Eleven Medtronic AT500 and 6 Guidant Pulsar Max pacemakers were implanted. The incremental benefit of prevention pacing therapies was compared with DDDR pacing by analysis of pacemaker-stored electrograms, ambulatory electrocardiography, symptoms and quality of life questionnaires.

Atrial septal pacing reduced AF burden by >50% in 13/17 patients (76.5%). Activation of a combined pacing algorithm (atrial pacing preference; atrial rate stabilization; and post mode-switch overdrive pacing) in patients with AT500 pacemakers produced a marginal reduction in AF burden (mean %AF 0.61 ON, 0.73 OFF, P=0.53 ns). Conversely in the Pulsar Max group when atrial pacing preference was activated, AF burden was slightly increased (mean %AF 5.84 ON, 3.73 OFF,P =0.13). Symptoms improved with atrial septal pacing but did not change when prevention algorithms were activated.

Atrial septal pacing resulted in a marked improvement in AF burden and symptoms. Activation of specific prevention pacing algorithms provided more continuous atrial pacing but had limited and heterogeneous effects on AF burden.
