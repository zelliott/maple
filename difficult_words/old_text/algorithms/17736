The influence of external interference on neuromagnetic source reconstruction by adaptive beamformer techniques was investigated. In our analysis, we assume that the interference has the following two properties: First, it is additive and uncorrelated with brain activity. Second, its temporal behavior can be characterized by a few distinct activities, and as a result, the spatio-temporal matrix of the interference has a few distinctly large singular values. Namely, the interference can be modeled as a low-rank signal. Under these assumptions, our analysis shows that the adaptive beamformer techniques are insensitive to interference when its spatial singular vectors are so different from a lead field vector of a brain source that the generalized cosine between these two vectors is much smaller than unity. Four types of numerical examples verifying this conclusion are presented.
