Many real-life networks exhibit a spatial dependence; i.e., the probability to form an edge between two nodes in the network depends on the distance between them. We investigate the influence of spatial dependence on the spectral density of the network. When increasing spatial dependence in Erdös-Rényi, scale-free, and small-world networks, it is found that the spectrum changes. Due to the spatial dependence the degree of clustering and the number of triangles increase. This results in a higher asymmetry (skewness). Our results show that the spectrum can be used to detect and quantify clustering and spatial dependence in a network.
