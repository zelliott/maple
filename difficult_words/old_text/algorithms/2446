Electronic health records are gradually replacing conventional paper-based health records. For a doctor, it is a working instrument, which can significantly reduce the time spent on paper work. At the same time, patients can benefit from accessing the electronic health records even though they usually do not have a medical background. Therefore, when specifying a graphical user interface (GUI) it is necessary to take into account the requirements of the different users: e.g. the functionality for the doctors and the presentation of data in an understandable manner for the patients. The study aims to review and analyze metrics used to evaluate the usability of user interfaces in health information systems. A literature review was performed to identify existing metrics. The scope of the search included the analysis of existing usability evaluation metrics that are applied both in healthcare and other domains, where standards for storage and presentation of information are applied. The analysis focused on metrics that are applicable for evaluating GUIs of health information systems. Several approaches and standards have been studied. Finally, a set of metrics and evaluation methods that provide holistic evaluation facilities for graphical user interfaces has been identified.
