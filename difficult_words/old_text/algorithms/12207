The surface characteristics of zero-valent iron (ZVI) and the efficiency of reductive dechlorination of trichloroethylene (TCE) in the presence of ferrous ions were studied. The experimental results indicated that the acid-washing of a metallic iron sample enhanced the efficiency of TCE degradation by ZVI. This occurred because acid-washing changed the conformation of oxides on the surface of iron from maghemite (gamma-Fe(2)O(3)) to the more hydrated goethite (alpha-FeOOH), as was confirmed by XPS analysis. However, when ferrous ions were simultaneous with TCE in water, the TCE degradation rate decreased as the concentration of ferrous ion increased. This was due to the formation of passive precipitates of ferrous hydroxide, including maghemite and magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)), that coated on the surface of acid-washed ZVI, which as a result inhibited the electron transfer and catalytic hydrogenation mechanisms. On the other hand, in an Fe(0)-TCE system without the acid-washing pretreatment of ZVI, ferrous ions were adsorbed into the maghemite lattice which was then converted to semiconductive magnetite. Thus, the electrons were transferred from the iron surface and passed through the precipitates, allowing for the reductive dechlorination of TCE.
