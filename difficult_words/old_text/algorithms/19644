The Structural Proteomics In Europe (SPINE) consortium contained a workpackage to address the automated X-ray analysis of macromolecules. The aim of this workpackage was to increase the throughput of three-dimensional structures while maintaining the high quality of conventional analyses. SPINE was able to bring together developers of software with users from the partner laboratories. Here, the results of a workshop organized by the consortium to evaluate software developed in the member laboratories against a set of bacterial targets are described. The major emphasis was on molecular-replacement suites, where automation was most advanced. Data processing and analysis, use of experimental phases and model construction were also addressed, albeit at a lower level.
