Peritonitis continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality and often an etiologic diagnosis is unclear. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of laparoscopy the authors analyzed their 5-year experience with this modality of treatment.

A review was made of 107 consecutive nonselected laparoscopic procedures performed between October 1990 and November 1995. The diagnosis was established by clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings and confirmed by laparoscopy and/or laparotomy.

An etiologic diagnosis was unclear in 35% of the cases and was established in all by laparoscopy; 94 patients (87.9%) were successfully treated by laparoscopy while 13 (12.1%) required conversion. Mortality was 4.6%; 14% had postoperative complications and 7.4% had reoperations.

Laparoscopic surgery is safe and very efficient in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with peritonitis. In most instances a definitive treatment can be carried out without conversion and has the additional and well-known advantages of minimally invasive surgery.
