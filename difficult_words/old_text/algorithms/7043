A technique for studying the distribution and size of different fibre types in muscles is proposed for automated analysis of individual fibres in optical density images from ATPase-stained muscle sections. After delineation, fibres may be classified into different histological types (1, 2A, 2B and 2C) using the measurement of their mean optical density (mOD). The densitometric measurements were obtained from three serial histological slides stained under different conditions. The delineation procedure is performed on one of the images: the resulting mask is fitted to the other images using a linear coordinate transform. Along with densitometric measurements, the lesser diameter of the fibres is computed. Both in processing and in analysis, extensive use was made of mathematical morphology tools. All software was implemented on a VICOM digital image processor, extended with a VISIOMORPH morphoprocessor board.
