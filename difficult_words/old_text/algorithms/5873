This paper considers the multiscale entropy (MSE) approach for estimating the regularity of time series at different scales. Sample entropy (SampEn) and approximate entropy (ApEn) are evaluated in MSE analysis on simulated data to enhance the main features of both estimators. We applied the approximate entropy and the sample entropy estimators to fetal heart rate signals on both single and multiple scales for an early identification of fetal sufferance antepartum. Our results show that the ApEn index significantly distinguishes suffering from normal fetuses between the 30th and the 35th week of gestation. Furthermore, our data shows that the MSE entropy values are reliable indicators of the fetal distress associated with the presence of a pathological condition at birth.
