Although age, genetics, and sex steroid hormones play prominent roles in the cause of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), recent epidemiological studies suggest that modifiable lifestyle factors also contribute substantially to the pathogenesis of these conditions.

Lifestyle and metabolic factors associated with significantly increased risks of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms include obesity, diabetes, and meat and fat consumption. Factors associated with decreased risks include physical activity, moderate alcohol intake, and vegetable consumption. Factors for which no clear risk patterns have emerged include lipids and smoking. Randomized clinical trials of lifestyle alterations - such as weight loss, exercise, and diet - for the prevention or treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms have yet to be performed.

Lifestyle factors present a novel opportunity for the prevention and treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms. Although clinical trials of lifestyle modifications have not yet been undertaken, promotion of healthy lifestyle alternatives within the context of standard benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms treatment algorithms is potentially beneficial.
