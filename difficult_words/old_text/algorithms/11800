This paper introduces an automatic microscopic urinary sediment analyzer. A set of basic algorithms, including pretreatment and picking up characteristics is brought forward to realize the automatic segmentation of urinary sediment. This paper also characterizes the visible components in urinary sediment in morphology and has sum up 7 morphology parameters and a simple method of classification.
