In order to account for the phenomenon of virtual pitch, various theories assume implicitly or explicitly that each spectral component introduces a series of subharmonics. The spectral-compression method for pitch determination can be viewed as a direct implementation of this principle. The widespread application of this principle in pitch determination is, however, impeded by numerical problems with respect to accuracy and computational efficiency. A modified algorithm is described that solves these problems. Its performance is tested for normal speech and "telephone" speech, i.e., speech high-pass filtered at 300 Hz. The algorithm out-performs the harmonic-sieve method for pitch determination, while its computational requirements are about the same. The algorithm is described in terms of nonlinear system theory, i.c., subharmonic summation. It is argued that the favorable performance of the subharmonic-summation algorithm stems from its corresponding more closely with current pitch-perception theories than does the harmonic sieve.
