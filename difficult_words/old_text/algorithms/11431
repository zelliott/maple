Since Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) show degraded performance in dense urban and indoor areas, a positioning sensor based on Digital Video Broadcast-Terrestrial (DVB-T) systems is presented in this paper. DVB-T signals can be considered as signals-of-opportunity for positioning, due to their good properties. One of the challenges to overcome is to distinguish the signals from different emitters. Here, we suppose that the user can first compute his position by GNSS during an initialization phase, which is used for solving all the ambiguities concerning DVB-T emitters. Starting from there, DVB-T signals can be used for aiding positioning when the user enters a GNSS-blocked area, up to a limit case, where all the GNSS satellites are not in view and only DVB-T signals are used for positioning. We tested this method by simulation, by adopting the Hata model for the emitter attenuations and the Rayleigh model for multipath. The obtained results show good performance if the receiver correctly associates the signal to the user's motion.
