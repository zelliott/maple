Nanoscale silver hollow spheres are first prepared via a microemulsion approach with 15-20 nm as the outer diameter, 3-5 nm as the wall thickness, and 10-15 nm as the diameter of the inner cavity. The presence of hollow spheres is confirmed by electron microscopy (SEM, BF-/HAADF-STEM, HRTEM) as well as by X-ray diffraction with a line-shape analysis to characterize the microcrystalline properties. In addition to the hollow spheres, massive silver nanoparticles of similar size (outer diameter of 15-20 nm) are gained via microemulsions. Based on the similarity of experimental conditions and the resulting particle size, as-prepared silver hollow spheres and massive nanoparticles are used to compare their optical properties and surface-plasmon resonance. In contrast to reducing the diameter of massive particles, "hollowing" of silver nanoparticles leads to a red-shift of the plasmon resonance. With a red shift of about 33 nm in the case of the hollow spheres, a quantum-size effect is indeed observed and in accordance with the thin sphere wall.
