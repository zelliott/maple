Membrane fouling is the major problem in the treatment by ultrafiltration (UF) of the cork processing wastewaters. This problem leads to drastic reduction on the permeate fluxes and has been associated with wastewaters phenolic/tannic colloidal matter. The present work proposes a flocculation/flotation/ultrafiltration integrated process for the treatment of these wastewaters. A flocculation study was carried out in jar-test equipment with chitosan. The zeta-potential and the particle size were monitored at different pH values and for different chitosan concentrations. The results showed an increase of the zeta-potential when chitosan is added and a significant increase of the effluent particle size with the decrease of the pH. A dissolved-air flotation study was performed with the flocculated wastewater. The parameters varied were the operating pressure and the recycle ratio. It was observed that for higher pressures and at a recycle ratio of 0.19 the polyphenols removal was higher. The UF experiments were carried out in flat-sheet cells of 13.2 cm2 of membrane surface area at transmembrane pressures of 1-3 bar. A commercial membrane (Ropur-TS60) and four cellulose acetate membranes with molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) ranging from 4.5 to 86 kDa were used. The flocculation/flotation pretreatment led to the enhancement of the UF permeate fluxes. For the membrane with higher MWCO, the permeate flux enhancement reached 130%.
