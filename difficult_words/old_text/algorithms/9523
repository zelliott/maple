We use displacement encoding pulsed field gradient (PFG) nuclear magnetic resonance to measure Fourier components S(q) of flow displacement distributions P(zeta) with mean displacement (zeta) for Newtonian and non-Newtonian flows through rocks and bead packs. Displacement distributions are non-Gaussian; hence, there are finite terms above second order in the cumulant expansion of ln(S(q)). We describe an algorithm for an optimal self-consistent cumulant analysis of data, which can be used to obtain the first three (central) moments of a non-Gaussian P(zeta), with error bars. The analysis is applied to Newtonian and non-Newtonian flows in rocks and beads. Flow with shear-thinning xanthan solution produces a 15.6+/-2.3% enhancement of the variance sigma(2) of displacement distributions when compared to flow experiments with water.
