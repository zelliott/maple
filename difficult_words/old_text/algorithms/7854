Corticomuscular synchronization has been shown to occur in beta (15-30 Hz) and gamma range (30-45 Hz) during isometric compensation of static and dynamic (periodically modulated) low-level forces, respectively. However, it is still unknown to what extent these synchronization processes in beta and gamma range are modified with increasing modulated force. We addressed this question by investigating the corticomuscular coherence (CMC) between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) from the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI) as well as the cortical and muscular spectral power during a visuomotor task where different levels of a dynamic (modulated) force were used. Seven healthy right-handed female subjects compensated dynamic forces at 8, 16, and 24% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) isometrically with their right index finger. Under the three conditions investigated, we found a broad-band CMC comprising both beta and gamma range and peaking at approximately 22 Hz within the beta band. This broad-band coherence increased linearly with higher force level. A separate analysis of the gamma range CMC did not show significant modulation of the CMC by the force levels. EEG and EMG spectral power did not show any significant difference among the three force conditions. Our results favor the view that the function of beta range CMC is not specific for low-level static forces only. The sensorimotor system may resort to stronger and also broader beta-range CMC to generate stable corticospinal interaction during increased force level, as well as when compensating for dynamic modulated forces. This finding re-enforces the importance of the beta-range EEG-EMG coherence in sensorimotor integration.
