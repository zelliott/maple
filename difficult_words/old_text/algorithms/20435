The value of neurophysiological tests of the autonomic nerve system is limited. One of the clinically most commonly applied test is the skin sudomotor response, frequently referred to as 'sympathetic skin response' (SSR). However, the SSR is a more qualitative than quantitative evaluation technique. Continuous wave (cw) Doppler sonography of the radial artery may be an alternative quantitative approach. We studied 41 age matched volunteers (23 female, 18 male; 16-82 years (mean age 53 years)). The stimulus was a loud and unexpected acoustic signal, alternatively a cough. SSR evaluation included the latency of onset, the duration and the amplitude of the response. Doppler evaluation also included flow velocity and resistance index (RI) changes with adequate stimulation. SSRs were observed in 36 volunteers (88%), Doppler responses in 35 (85%). The latency between stimulus and response onset was 1.35 s with SSR and 1.52 s with ultrasound (n.s.). The mean SSR amplitude was 1.3 mV, systolic velocities decreased by 20% and diastolic velocities by 124% (flow reversal). RI increased from 0.85 to 1.25 with no correlation between SSR amplitude and flow velocity changes. SSR and cw Doppler are complementary methods. Doppler sonography offers an additional approach of autonomic nerve evaluation.
