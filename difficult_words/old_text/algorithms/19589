We sought to assess the influence of emergency department (ED) structure and care processes on adherence to practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes.

We surveyed emergency physicians and nurses from 316 hospitals participating in the CRUSADE Quality Improvement Initiative and used multivariable modeling to correlate ED-specific characteristics with guidelines adherence.

Factors that were significantly associated with improved guidelines adherence included collaboration between emergency physicians and hospital administration, northeast region, adequate nursing support, use of locum tenens physicians, an independent ED (not a division of another clinical department), and use of a care algorithm for acute coronary syndromes.

Quality improvement strategies that have the full support of hospital administration, focus on increasing collaboration between emergency physicians and other health care providers, and specified protocol-driven management algorithm may be the most successful methods for improving the care and outcomes of patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes.
