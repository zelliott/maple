The dynamics of a classical system driven by a rapidly oscillating field (with frequency ω) in the presence of friction has been investigated using the multiple scale perturbation theory (MSPT). By exploiting the idea of separation of time scales, the slow motion has been computed in a systematic expansion in the inverse of ω to the order ω(-3). This perturbation series can be viewed as a generalization of the calculation presented by Landau and Lifshitz for Kapitza's pendulum (where the point of suspension is moved periodically) in the presence of friction. The radiation induced dynamics of the system is found to be described by an effective time-independent potential with friction that controls the slow motion. The explicit appearance of friction in our computed effective potential is a manifestation of the dynamical effect due to the fast motion. The present study demonstrates that MSPT can be used to understand and predict the classical dynamics of a driven system in the presence of friction.
