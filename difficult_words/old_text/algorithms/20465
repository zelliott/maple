Although analyses of in-plane aliasing have been done for conventional computed tomography (CT) images, longitudinal aliasing in spiral CT has not been properly investigated. We propose a mathematical model of the three-dimensional (3-D) sampling scheme in spiral CT and analyze its effects on longitudinal aliasing. We investigated longitudinal aliasing as a function of the helical-interpolation algorithm, pitch, and reconstruction interval using CT simulations and actual phantom scans. Our model predicts, and we verified, that for a radially uniform object at the isocenter, the spiral sampling scheme results in spatially varying cancellation of the aliased spectral islands which, in turn, results in spatially varying longitudinal aliasing. The aliasing is minimal at the scanner isocenter, but worsens with distance from it and rapidly becomes significant. Our results agree with published results observed at the isocenter of the scanner and further provide new insight into the aliasing conditions at off-isocenter locations with respect to the pitch, interpolation algorithm, and reconstruction interval. We conclude that longitudinal aliasing at off-isocenter locations can be significant, and that its magnitude and effects cannot be predicted by measurements made only at the scanner isocenter.
