A dynamic model for plant cell metabolism was used as a basis for a rational analysis of plant production potential in in vitro cultures. The model was calibrated with data from 3-L bioreactor cultures. A dynamic sensitivity analysis framework was developed to analyse the response curves of secondary metabolite production to metabolic and medium perturbations. Simulation results suggest that a straightforward engineering of cell metabolism or medium composition might only have a limited effect on productivity. To circumvent the problem of the dynamic allocation of resources between growth and production pathways, the sensitivity analysis framework was used to assess the effect of stabilizing intracellular nutrient concentrations. Simulations showed that a stabilization of intracellular glucose and nitrogen reserves could lead to a 116% increase in the specific production of secondary metabolites compared with standard culture protocol. This culture strategy was implemented experimentally using a perfusion bioreactor. To stabilize intracellular concentrations, adaptive medium feeding was performed using model mass balances and estimations. This allowed for a completely automated culture, with controlled conditions and pre-defined decision making algorithm. The proposed culture strategy leads to a 73% increase in specific production and a 129% increase in total production, as compared with a standard batch culture protocol. The sensitivity analysis on a mathematical model of plant metabolism thus allowed producing new insights on the links between intracellular nutritional management and cell productivity. The experimental implementation was also a significant improvement on current plant bioprocess strategies.
