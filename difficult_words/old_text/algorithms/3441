Adsorption isotherm data of phenol from an aqueous solution of methanol onto a C18-bonded silica (Symmetry-C18) were acquired by frontal analysis (FA) at six different temperatures, in a wide concentration range. The non-linear fitting of these data provided the bi-Langmuir model as best isotherm model, a conclusion further supported by the results of the calculation of the affinity energy distribution (AED). The isotherm parameters were obtained using several methods, the fitting of FA isotherm data, the calculation of the AED, and the inverse method, that uses overloaded elution band profiles. The different values obtained are in close agreement. They allow a quantitative investigation of the separate properties of the low- and the high-energy sites on the adsorbent surface. Increasing the temperature decreases the saturation capacity of the low-energy adsorption sites and the adsorption constant of the high-energy sites. In contrast, increasing the temperature does not cause any significant changes in either the saturation capacity of the high-energy sites or the adsorption constant of the low-energy sites.
