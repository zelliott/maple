A method is presented to improve computer aided detection (CAD) results for masses in mammograms by fusing information obtained from two views of the same breast. It is based on a previously developed approach to link potentially suspicious regions in mediolateral oblique (MLO) and craniocaudal (CC) views. Using correspondence between regions, we extended our CAD scheme by building a cascaded multiple-classifier system, in which the last stage computes suspiciousness of an initially detected region conditional on the existence and similarity of a linked candidate region in the other view. We compared the two-view detection system with the single-view detection method using free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis and cross validation. The dataset used in the evaluation consisted of 948 four-view mammograms, including 412 cancer cases with a mass, architectural distortion, or asymmetry. A statistically significant improvement was found in the lesion based detection performance. At a false positive (FP) rate of 0.1 FP/image, the lesion sensitivity improved from 56% to 61%. Case based sensitivity did not improve.
