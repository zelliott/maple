The focus of this study is to validate whether the sensitivity of dose distribution following the interface of different media can be used to distinguish between small variations of photon energy spectra in the context of the convolution/superposition algorithm in the polyenergetic implementation (Philips Pinnacle3, ADAC Laboratories, Milpitas, CA). Calculations were performed in homogeneous water and heterogeneous lung/water phantoms. Spectra were generated, in which the weights of the low-, medium- and high-energy components were adjusted sequentially. The heterogeneity correction factor CFlung, the D20/D10 ratio for homogeneous water and logarithmic derivative in buildup region LDbuildup were assessed for their relative ability to discriminate between different spectra for various field sizes. In accordance with another study (Charland et al 2004), the superior discrimination ability of the CFlung and LDbuildup tests over the D20/D10 test was observed for changes in an energy component as small as 0.3% of the total weight in the energy spectrum. Furthermore, new tests utilizing transverse dose profile data for discriminating between spectra, Fringe Index (FI) and Penumbra Index (PI), were introduced. The discrimination ability of the PI and FI tests was superior when a medium containing interface effects was exploited to obtain the transverse profile data (water/lung phantom for PIhung and FIlung tests) as opposed to when a homogeneous water medium was used (PIwater and FIwater tests).
