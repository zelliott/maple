Complex diseases, by definition, involve multiple factors, including gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions. Researchers commonly rely on simulated data to evaluate their approaches for detecting high-order interactions in disease gene mapping. A publicly available simulation program to generate samples involving complex genetic and environmental interactions is of great interest to the community. We have developed a software package named gs1.0, which has been widely used since its publication. In this article, we present an upgraded version gs2.0, which not only inherits its capacity to generate realistic genotype data but also provides great functionality and flexibility to simulate various interaction models. In addition to a standalone version, a user-friendly web server (http://cbc.case.edu/gs) has been set up to help users to build complex interaction models. Furthermore, by utilizing three three-locus models as an example, we have shown how realistic model parameters can be chosen in generating simulated data.
