Smoking has been involved in the failure of antimalarial therapy in patient with chronic or subacute erythematosus lupus.

We report a prospective study of 26 patients with chronic, subacute or systemic erythematosus lupus who were treated with antimalarials. Several variables including smoking are compared in responders and non-responders.

Despite the reduced number of patients study that does not permit to allow significative results, it seems that among responders and non-responders, in other respects comparables, there is no difference in the presence of smoking, its quantity or its duration.

The significance of molecular interactions between some components of tobacco and antimalarials have still to be established.
