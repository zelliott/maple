Fuzzy logic has been used as a tool in structure-camphoraceous odor relationships. The data base studied included 99 molecules. The rules used to discriminate between camphor and non camphor molecules lead to 77% correct discrimination. Such rules account for the shape and the size of the molecule. Their adjustment by means of genetic algorithms led to 84% correct discrimination between camphor and non-camphor molecules. [figure: see text]. Membership function for the chosen variables.
