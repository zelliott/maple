Certain skin cancers occur with increased frequency or altered course in patients infected with HIV. Malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma are examples of cutaneous malignancies that have a more aggressive course in patients with HIV. Others, such as basal cell carcinoma, appear more frequently in this population but do not appear to be more aggressive. The incidence of HIV-associated Kapsosi's sarcoma has markedly decreased since the advent of HIV antiretroviral therapy. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of this malignancy and its unique management issues are fully reviewed. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is rare in this population. Other types of cutaneous lymphoma and HIV-associated pseudo-CTCL are discussed. This article addresses prevention, treatment, and follow-up strategies for this at-risk population.

At the completion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the unique epidemiology, clinical course, and management of cutaneous malignancy in patients infected with HIV.
