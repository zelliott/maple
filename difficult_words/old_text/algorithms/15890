Cystic adrenal lesions can be either cortical or medullary, and distinguishing between these 2 types of lesions may be important in patient management. Pheochromocytomas, which are adrenal medullary neoplasms, typically manifest with hypertension, headaches, palpitations, tachycardia, sweating, and anxiety symptoms; however, 10% to 17% of patients with pheochromocytomas are asymptomatic. We describe a 67-year-old woman with lifelong headaches and recent persistent cough in whom a left cystic adrenal mass was incidentally discovered by computed tomography of the chest. A moderate increase in normetanephrine and total metanephrine values in two 24-hour urine samples suggested a pheochromocytoma. Computed tomography with use of contrast medium revealed ring enhancement of the cyst wall, a finding consistent with an adrenal medullary tumor. This report demonstrates the importance of repeated 24-hour urine samples to determine the metanephrine values together with contrast-enhanced computed tomography in a patient with nonspecific symptoms.
