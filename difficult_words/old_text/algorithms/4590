Acute heart failure (HF) is characterized by the rapid onset or progression of symptoms and signs secondary to abnormal cardiac function, and remains a common disease associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are an effective pharmacological option in the treatment of chronic HF, but their effect in acute HF is less well known. This review attempts to summarize the current understanding of acute HF and the pharmacological effects of ACEi in the treatment of acute HF.
