We present a web-based pediatric CT dose tool that estimates effective dose based on dose length product, patient age and region of body scanned. The tool also provides an estimate of additional lifetime risk of cancer from CT exams. These estimations are based on the interpolation of factors from published methods. The calculator serves as an educational tool that can be used by radiologists and clinicians to better understand CT dose and its associated risks.
