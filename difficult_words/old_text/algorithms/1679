In this paper, sliding mode control is utilized for stabilization of a particular class of nonlinear polytopic differential inclusion systems with fractional-order-0 < q < 1. This class of fractional order differential inclusion systems is used to model physical chaotic fractional order Chen and Lu systems. By defining a sliding surface with fractional integral formula, exploiting the concept of the state space norm, and obtaining sufficient conditions for stability of the sliding surface, a special feedback law is presented which enables the system states to reach the sliding surface and consequently creates a sliding mode control. Finally, simulation results are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
