More than one child in five is allergic. This pathology therefore makes an everyday problem of consultations. Allergy should always be considered, after many symptoms, but allergy is often only one of the etiological factors. An illness with an allergy component may also be triggered by other etiological factors. Many diagnoses may certainly be responsible for the same symptoms as those met in the symptoms with an allergy component. In practice, when the symptoms recur, an assessment is always necessary. The allergy investigation is primarily clinical and complementary examinations only have a confirmatory role; in effect to the sensitising allergen. The sensitisation corresponds to the manufacture by an individual of allergen-specific IgE; this sensitisation finds expression by the presence of IgE. After a new contact with an allergen, an individual may not present clinical symptoms, a simple sensitisation exists; if there are clinical symptoms an allergy is indicated. In order to succeed as quickly as possible and at least cost to a diagnosis of the symptoms of the allergy component, it is essential to adopt a strategy. The strategy that we suggest is in accord with the decree of 19th October 1994.
