Eight hyperthyroid and eight normal subjects underwent 2-h oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and euglycemic clamp studies to assess the presence of peripheral and hepatic insulin antagonism in hyperthyroidism. Although the mean total glucose area during the OGTT was similar in the hyperthyroid patients and normal subjects [16.4 +/- 0.8 (+/- SE) vs. 15.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/L.h], the mean insulin area was significantly elevated in the hyperthyroid group (1413 +/- 136 vs. 1004 +/- 122 pmol/L.h; P less than 0.05). Basal hepatic glucose production was measured during the second hour of a primed [3-3H]glucose infusion. A two-insulin dose euglycemic clamp study with [3-3H]glucose and somatostatin (500 micrograms/h) was carried out during the next 6 h. The insulin infusion rate was 0.05 mU/kg.min during the third, fourth, and fifth hours and 0.60 mU/kg.min during the sixth, seventh, and eighth hours. Hepatic glucose production and glucose utilization were measured during the final 0.5 h of each clamp period. Serum C-peptide concentrations were measured in the initial sample and in the last sample of each clamp period. The mean equilibrium serum insulin concentrations were similar in both groups during the final 0.5 h of the low (90 +/- 8 vs. 79 +/- 6 pmol/L) and high (367 +/- 11 vs. 367 +/- 15 pmol/L) insulin infusion rates. Basal serum C-peptide levels were significantly increased in the hyperthyroid patients (596 +/- 17 vs. 487 +/- 43 pmol/L; P less than 0.05) but were suppressed equally in both groups at the end of both clamp periods. The MCRs of insulin were similar in the hyperthyroid and normal subjects during the low (6.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.5 mL/kg.min) and high (11.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 12.1 +/- 0.5 mL/kg.mm) insulin infusion rates. Glucose production was significantly increased in the hyperthyroid patients during the basal state (17.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 11.5 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.001) and remained elevated during the final 0.5 h of the low (12.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.9 +/- 1.7; P less than 0.01) and high (3.2 +/- 1.2 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.3; P less than 0.05) insulin infusion rates. Peripheral insulin action, assessed by Bergman's sensitivity index, was significantly decreased in the hyperthyroid patients (7.4 +/- 2.2 vs. 15.6 +/- 2.1 L/kg min-1/pmol/L; P less than 0.02). In conclusion, hyperthyroidism is characterized by 1) hyperinsulinemia after oral glucose loading, 2) increased basal hepatic glucose production, 3) impairment of insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production, and 4) antagonism to insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose utilization.
