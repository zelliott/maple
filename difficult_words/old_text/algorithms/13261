An optimization-based correction method is developed to control simultaneously two deformable mirrors in a wavefront-sensor-less adaptive beam cleanup system, where the wave-front aberrations could not be compensated by a single deformable mirror. Stochastic parallel gradient decent algorithm is chosen as the optimization algorithm. In this control method, different aberrations are assigned to each deformable mirror according to their different correction quality. The method is proved to be effective by numerical simulations as well as experiments. Experimental results showed that the area containing 84% energy of the laser beam in the far-field can reach 3.0 times diffraction limited.
