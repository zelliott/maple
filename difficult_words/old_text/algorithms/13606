To evaluate the impact of early vs. late amniotomy on delivery mode in women undergoing induction of labor.

143 women admitted for induction were randomized to early amniotomy (EA, concomitant with the beginning of oxytocin infusion; n = 71) or to late amniotomy (LA, four hours after the beginning of oxytocin; n = 72). Randomization was stratified by parity. The primary outcome was the rate of cesarean. Secondary outcomes were duration of labor and intrapartum fever.

The cesarean rate was similar between groups (18% vs. 17% among nulliparous; and 3% vs. 0% among parous women, in EA and LA group, respectively). However, EA was associated with shorter oxytocin-to-delivery interval (12 vs. 15 h) and a non-significant decrease in intrapartum fever (3% vs. 25%) than LA in nulliparous women (p = 0.05).

For women undergoing oxytocin induction, early amniotomy is associated with shorter labor in nulliparous women with no effect on the risk of cesarean section in both nulliparous and multiparous women.
