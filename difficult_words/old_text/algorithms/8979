The diagnosis and treatment of osteosarcoma should be performed by an experienced multidisciplinary team. Considering it is a systemic disease, chemotherapy is essential for long-term success. The drugs most commonly used are: cisplatin, adriamycin, high-dose methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, and, more recently, mifamurtide. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy allows to know tumour chemosensitivity and getting the main prognostic factor: the percentage of tumour necrosis. In addition to chemotherapy, it is important to conduct surgical resection of primary tumour with wide margins, and in disseminated disease also to attempt resection of pulmonary metastasis.
