Carcinoma of the gallbladder is the most common malignant tumour of the biliary tract and a particularly high incidence is observed in Chile, Japan, and northern India. The aetiology of this tumour is complex, but there is a strong association with gallstones. Owing to its non-specific symptoms, gallbladder carcinoma is generally diagnosed late in the disease course, but if a patient with gallstones experiences a sudden change of symptoms, then a cancer diagnosis should be considered. Treatment with radical or extended cholecystectomy is potentially curative, although these procedures are only possible in 10-30% of patients. There is no role for cytoreductive surgery in this disease. If a gallbladder carcinoma is discovered via pathological examination of tissue samples, then the patient should be examined further and should have radical surgery if the tumour is found to be T1b or beyond. Additional port-site excision is necessary if the patient has already had their gallbladder removed during laparoscopy; however, patients with an intact gallbladder who are suspected to have gallbladder carcinoma should not undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients with advanced inoperable disease should receive palliative treatment; however, the role of chemotherapy and radiation in these patients needs further evaluation.
