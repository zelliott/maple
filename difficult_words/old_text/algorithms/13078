Radiological investigation plays an important role in the management of conditions affecting the hepatobiliary system. However, multiple imaging modalities exist and inappropriate requesting can lead to delays in diagnosis and subsequent treatment.

To assess the approach to biliary imaging amongst Irish gastroenterologists across a number of scenarios, and examine and seek to explain any variations.

A survey to determine "best practice" radiological investigation of real-life clinical scenarios was designed and distributed to fully trained and trainee gastroenterologists nationally.

The responses to scenarios ranged from near unanimity, with up to 97% agreement, to notable lack of consensus amongst both registrars and consultants.

An algorithm for the management of hepatobiliary disease was formulated.
