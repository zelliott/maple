Diagnostic interpretation at auscultation of heart murmurs is accompanied by frequent errors. It creates serious clinical, pedagogical, organizational and social problems. The standard nosological principle of a clinical information description from the diagnosis (a disease name) to the description of symptoms/signs contradicts to real clinical practice from revealing of symptoms through differential diagnostics to a diagnosis establishment. The differential diagnostic algorithm or diagnostic algorithm developed by the author, is based on the opposite syndromic principle of thinking - from the signs to the diagnosis. It completely corresponds to the practical purposes of reliable diagnostics of 35 illnesses, manifested by heart murmurs at a heart auscultation.
