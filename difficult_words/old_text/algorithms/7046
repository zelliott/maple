Previous studies done by our group suggest that partially occluded coronary arteries may generate sounds due to turbulent blood flow. To support these previous findings the frequency spectra of diastolic heart sounds are compared before and after angioplastic surgery. Since the low-level sounds associated with partially occluded coronary arteries are contaminated with considerable background noise, traditional FFT analysis may not produce accurate frequency spectra. Indeed, in a previous study using the same data, no significant differences were found in the diastolic heart sounds before and after angioplastic surgery. In this study, three eigenvector methods (Pisarenko, MUSIC, and Minimum-Norm) have been selected to generate the frequency spectra because of their higher resolution, particularly in the presence of noise. Although the Pisarenko method produced spurious zeros and could not be used, the other two methods produced spectra showing, in most cases, a marked decrease in high-frequency spectral components following angioplasty.
