Excess body weight is a cardiovascular risk factor. The relationship between anthropometric indices and cardiovascular health is not completely understood. Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT) is a subclinical marker of atherosclerosis. This study aimed to investigate the best anthropometric obesity indicator for diagnosis of initial stage of atherosclerosis by CIMT. This cross-sectional study included 100 adult women, aged 18-50 years. Anthropometric indices were measured with standard protocol and CIMT was measured by non-invasive ultrasound. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was carried out to determine the optimal cut-off values of anthropometric indices, and the best indices for atherosclerosis diagnosis. On ROC curve analysis the suggested appropriate cut-offs of waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR), waist to height ratio (WHtR), body mass index (BMI) and percentage body fat (%BF) were 96 cm, 0.86, 0.64, 31.29 kg/mÂ² and 30.42%, respectively. The area under the ROC curve of BMI (AUC=0.74, 95%CI=0.62-0.86) and WHtR (AUC=0.74, 95%CI=0.63-0.85) were greater than other anthropometric indices. The AUC for WHR was the lowest among the studied obesity indices AUC=0.68 (95% CI=0.54-0.81). In our study, WHtR and BMI were the best diagnostic parameters of initial stage of atherosclerosis while WHR was the worst based on AUC.
