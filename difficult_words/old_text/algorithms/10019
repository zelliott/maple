Approximate analytical chirped solitary pulse (chirped dissipative soliton) solutions of the one-dimensional complex cubic-quintic nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau equation are obtained. These solutions are stable and highly accurate under condition of domination of a normal dispersion over a spectral dissipation. The parametric space of the solitons is three-dimensional, that makes theirs to be easily traceable within a whole range of the equation parameters. Scaling properties of the chirped dissipative solitons are highly interesting for applications in the field of high-energy ultrafast laser physics.
