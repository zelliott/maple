The Lanczos algorithm (LA) is a useful iterative method for the reduction of a large matrix to tridiagonal form. It is a storage efficient procedure requiring only the preceding two Lanczos vectors to compute the next. The quasi-minimal residual (QMR) method is a powerful method for the solution of linear equation systems, Ax = b. In this report we provide another application of the QMR method: we incorporate QMR into the LA to monitor the convergence of the Lanczos projections in the reduction of large sparse matrices. We demonstrate that the combined approach of the LA and QMR can be utilized efficiently for the orthogonal transformation of large, but sparse, complex, symmetric matrices, such as are encountered in the simulation of slow-motional 1D- and 2D-electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra. Especially in the 2D-ESR simulations, it is essential that we store all of the Lanczos vectors obtained in the course of the LA recursions and maintain their orthogonality. In the LA-QMR application, the QMR weight matrix mitigates the problem that the Lanczos vectors lose orthogonality after many LA projections. This enables substantially more Lanczos projections, as required to achieve convergence for the more challenging ESR simulations. It, therefore, provides better accuracy for the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the large sparse matrices originating in 2D-ESR simulations than does the previously employed method, which is a combined approach of the LA and the conjugate-gradient (CG) methods, as evidenced by the quality and convergence of the 2D-ESR simulations. Our results show that very slow-motional 2D-ESR spectra at W-band (95 GHz) can be reliably simulated using the LA-QMR method, whereas the LA-CG consistently fails. The improvements due to the LA-QMR are of critical importance in enabling the simulation of high-frequency 2D-ESR spectra, which are characterized by their very high resolution to molecular orientation.
