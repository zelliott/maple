The author discusses in four points (indications in etalons, reduction of invasiveness, extension of indications, new technologies) the tremendous scientific progress that has been achieved nowadays in the field of cardiovascular surgery. A special emphasis is given to the role of interventional cardio-angiology that can be practiced only in surgical departments with suitable profile. Illustrative cases are presented along with a list of the most pertinent references. It is finally suggested that the mastering of the invasive and tissue sparing techniques is also a task of cardiovascular surgeons. A co-operation is indispensable. In the field of this new branch of science further developments are necessary in Hungary. The employment of the most up to date technology can be recommended and accepted only after the collection of one's own initial experiences. The introduction of the new technologies requires a substantial financial expenditure that will be hopefully recovered in terms of the expected considerable reduction of cardiovascular mortality which is at present 55% in Hungary.
