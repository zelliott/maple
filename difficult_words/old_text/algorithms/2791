Current 64-multidetector Computed Tomographic scanners (MDCT) utilize retrospective overlapping helical acquisition (RS-OHA) which imparts a higher than desired radiation dose. Although the radiation burden of computed tomographic angiography (CTA) can be efficiently reduced by dose modulation and limiting field of view, a further decrease in radiation without compromising diagnostic image quality would be indeed very desirable. An alternative imaging mode is the axial prospective ECG-triggering acquisition (prospective gating). This study was done to compare the effective radiation dose and the image quality with two techniques to reduce radiation doses with CTA studies utilizing 64-MDCT scanners. The study included 149 consecutive patients (48 females and 101 males) 64-MDCT (mean age = 67 +/- 11 years, 72.2% male). Patients underwent CT coronary angiography using one of three algorithms: retrospective triggering with dose modulation; prospective triggering with padding (step and shoot acquisition with additional adjacent phases); and prospective triggering without padding (single phase acquisition only). Based on body habitus, two different voltages were utilized: 100 kVp (<85 kg) or 120 kVp (>85 kg). Radiation doses and image quality (signal to noise ratio) was measured for each patient, and compared between different acquisition protocols. The signal to-noise ratio of the ascending aorta (SNR-AA) was calculated from the mean pixel values of the contrast-filled left ventricular chamber divided by the standard deviation of these pixel values. Use of 100 kVp reduced radiation dose 41.5% using prospective triggering and 39.6% using retrospective imaging as compared to 120 kVp (P < 0.001). Use of prospective imaging reduced radiation exposure by 82.6% as compared to retrospective imaging (P < 0.001). Using both prospective imaging and 100 kVp without padding (single phase data, no other phases obtained), radiation dose was reduced by 90% (P < 0.001). In terms of image quality, the coefficient of variation of ascending aortic contrast enhancement between kVp of 120 and kVp of 100 was 6% (1.05, 95 CI 0.93-1.17), and 7.8% (0.9, 95% CI 0.7-1.2) at the pulmonary artery. The prospective ECG-Triggered acquisition and 100 kVp images were of diagnostic quality, allowing adequate assessment in all patients. CTA using PA and 100 kVp reduced the radiation dose by up to 90% without compromising the image quality.
