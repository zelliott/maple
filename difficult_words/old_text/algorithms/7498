We propose a new method to recover 3D time-resolved velocity vectors within the left ventricle (LV) using a combination of multiple registered 3D colour Doppler images and LV wall motion. Incorporation of wall motion, calculated from 3D B-Mode images, and the use of a multi-scale reconstruction framework allow recovery of 3D velocity over the entire ventricle, even in regions where there is little or no Doppler data. Our method is tested on the LV of a paediatric patient and is compared to 2D and 3D flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Use of wall motion information increased stroke volume accuracy by 14%, and enabled full 3D velocity mapping within the ventricle. Velocity distribution showed good agreement with respect to MRI, and vortex formation during diastole was successfully reconstructed.
