The Patient- and Family-Centered Care (PFCC) method and practice has been developed over the past 4 years as a means of improving care experiences by viewing all aspects of a patient's care experience through the eyes of the patient and family. One of the most powerful components of the method, evaluating care through patient and family shadowing and the accompanying care experience flow mapping, is described. An overview of the PFCC method can be found in the authors' article in the December 2010 issue.
