These include, delayed gastric emptying, pancreatic fistula, post-operative bleeding, and the complications after vascular reconstruction in the cases of locally extended pancreatic cancer. For this, randomised prospective studies, systematic meta-analyses and clinical guidelines on the definition, clinical severity grade and treatment of these complications have been evaluated.
