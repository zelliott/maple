Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with indocyanine green (ICG) dilution is applied externally on the head to determine the cerebral hemodynamics of neurointensive care patients. We applied Monte Carlo simulation for the analysis of a number of problems associated with this method. First, the contamination of the optical density (OD) signal due to the extracerebral tissue was assessed. Second, the measured OD signal depends essentially on the relative blood content (with respect to its absorption) in the various transilluminated tissues. To take this into account, we weighted the calculated densities of the photon distribution under baseline conditions within the different tissues with the changes and aberration of the relative blood volumes that are typically observed under healthy and pathologic conditions. Third, in case of NIRS ICG dye dilution, an ICG bolus replaces part of the blood such that a transient change of absorption in the brain tissues occurs that can be recorded in the OD signal. Our results indicate that for an exchange fraction of Delta=30% of the relative blood volume within the intracerebral tissue, the OD signal is determined from 64 to 74% by the gray matter and between 8 to 16% by the white matter maximally for a distance of d=4.5 cm.
