The literature concerning measurement of spatial resolution in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is vague. Different groups often use their own method or a modified version of a better known method, thus hindering a generalized resolution measurement which could be useful for gauging the performance of one system against another. Measurement of spatial resolution in EIT is further complicated by its spatial variant nature and hence cannot be expressed simply with a single parameter as it can be in other imaging modalities (such as nuclear medicine or MRI for example). If the performance of each acquisition and image reconstruction system in EIT is to be compared objectively then there needs to be a common standard. In this paper the results of different methods for calculating spatial resolution are compared and an improved method is proposed which aims to fulfil this role.
