The widespread application of abdominal imaging procedures has resulted in an increased frequency of clinically silent adrenal masses. Adrenal incidentaloma (AI) is a term applied to an accidentally discovered adrenal mass on imaging performed for the investigation of an unrelated complaint. Adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) are a cluster of different pathologies, the majority of which are benign and non-functioning adrenal adenomas. However, mild hormonal alterations as well as metabolic abnormalities may be present in patients with AIs. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach with biochemical and radiologic evaluation is needed to characterize these lesions and identify patients who are at high risk for hormonal or malignant evolution. Significant new information has helped resolve controversies regarding the most reliable approach to this clinical problem. The present review considers the prevalence, pathology and natural history of AIs. We also discuss the reliability of available screening methods and localization techniques and consider optimal management and follow-up strategies.
