Equalizing image noise is shown to be an important step in the automatic detection of microcalcifications in digital mammography. This study extends a well established film-screen noise equalization scheme developed by Veldkamp et al. for application to full-field digital mammogram (FFDM) images. A simple noise model is determined based on the assumption that quantum noise is dominant in direct digital X-ray imaging. Estimation of the noise as a function of the gray level is improved by calculating the noise statistics using a truncated distribution method. Experimental support for the quantum noise assumption is presented for a set of step wedge phantom images. Performance of the noise equalization technique is also tested as a preprocessing stage to a microcalcification detection scheme. It is shown that the square root model based approach which FFDM allows leads to a robust estimation of the high frequency image noise. This provides better microcalcification detection performance when compared to the film-screen noise equalization method developed by Veldkamp. Substantially better results are obtained than when noise equalization is omitted. A database of 124 direct digital mammogram images containing 28 microcalcification clusters was used for evaluation of the method.
