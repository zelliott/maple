The phytochemical investigation of the root bark of Cassia artemisioides (Gaudich. Ex. DC) Randell resulted in the isolation of one new anthraquinone 1,1'-dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethyl-8,8'-dimethoxy-6,6'-O-bianthraquinone (1) along with four known anthraquinones 1,6-dihydroxy-8-methoxy-3-methylanthraquinone (2), 1-hydroxy-8-methoxy-3-methylanthraquinone (3), 1,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methylanthraquinone (4), and 1,6,8-trihydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone (5). The structures of the compounds were elucidated using spectroscopic techniques including 1D and 2D NMR. The compounds were evaluated for antioxidant activity. 1,6,8-Trihydroxy-3-methyl anthraquinone (5) showed good activity among the tested compounds.
