An inverse planning algorithm for determining the intensity of modulated beams that generates conformal radiotherapy dose distributions is presented. This algorithm is based on the mathematical analysis of the singular values decomposition. It is integrated in the DOSIGRAY 3D treatment planning software. The dose is calculated by the separation of the primary and scattered radiation. We presented, for a prostate cancer, the modulated intensity profiles and the optimal dose distribution obtained by the inverse optimization software developed and integrated in the treatment planning system. We obtained a region with high doses which geometrically conforms the target volume and spares the neighboring critical structures. This preliminary study showed the feasibility and the managing of the singular value decomposition to generate conformal dose distribution in a clinical environment.
