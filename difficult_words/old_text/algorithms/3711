Preterm premature rupture of the membranes (preterm PROM) is a common and significant cause of preterm birth and perinatal morbidity and mortality. The obstetric caregiver has the opportunity significantly to alter pregnancy and perinatal outcome for women suffering from this complication. Although management is often predetermined by the presence of clinical infection, vaginal bleeding, labor, or nonreassuring fetal heart-rate pattern on admission, a gestational age-based approach to the management of the stable patient with preterm PROM offers the potential to reduce perinatal infectious and gestational age-dependent morbidity for patients who are amenable to conservative management.
