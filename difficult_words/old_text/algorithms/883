We present a stochastic cellular automaton model for the behavior of limb bud precartilage mesenchymal cells undergoing chondrogenic patterning. This "agent-oriented" model represents cells by points on a lattice that obey rules motivated by experimental findings. The "cells" follow these rules as autonomous agents, interacting with other cells and with the microenvironments cell activities produce. The rules include random cell motion, production and lateral deposition of a substrate adhesion molecule (SAM, corresponding to fibronectin), production and release of a diffusible growth factor ("activator," corresponding to TGF-beta) that stimulates production of the SAM, and another diffusible factor ("inhibitor") that suppresses the activity of the activator. We implemented the cellular automaton on a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice to emulate the quasi-2D micromass culture extensively used to study patterning in avian limb bud precartilage cells. We identified parameters that produce nodular patterns that resemble, in size and distribution, cell condensations in leg-cell cultures, thus establishing a correspondence between in vitro and in silico results. We then studied the in vitro and in silico micromass cultures experimentally. We altered the standard in vitro micromass culture by diluting the initial cell density, transiently exposing it to exogenous activator, suppressing the inhibitor, and constitutively activating fibronectin production. We altered the standard in silico micromass culture in each case by changing the corresponding parameter. In vitro and in silico experiments agreed well. We also used the model to test hypotheses for differences in the in vitro patterns of cells derived from chick embryo forelimb and hindlimb. We discuss the applicability of this model to limb development in vivo and to other organ development.
