Klippel-Feil syndrome is a visually arresting deformity wherein severe restriction of cervical motion predicts a difficult airway. Even minor distraction of the neck risks cervical spine or neurologic injury, so regional techniques, awake fiberoptic intubation, or awake tracheostomy are recommended anesthetic approaches. We present a case of aortic dissection in a Klippel-Feil syndrome patient for whom congenital bilateral deafness, coupled with the urgency of the surgery, mitigated against the recommended first-choice techniques. Using anesthesia crisis resource management methods, a multi-member team rehearsed predefined roles and then managed the airway via inhaled induction of anesthesia, followed by flexible fiberoptic intubation.
