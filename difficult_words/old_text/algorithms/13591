Hospital readmission is an important contributor to total medical expenditures and is an emerging indicator of quality of care. Diabetes, similar to other chronic medical conditions, is associated with increased risk of hospital readmission. Risk factors include previous hospitalization, extremes in age, and socioeconomic barriers. Preliminary studies suggest that acute and/or chronic glycemic control may be of importance when diabetes is the primary diagnosis or when it is a comorbidity. Very limited evidence from prospective randomized controlled trials aimed at improving glycemic control is available. However, whether one concludes that inpatient or outpatient glycemic control is partly responsible for reduced hospitalizations, attention to glycemic control in the hospital may facilitate sustained glycemic control post-discharge. Limited prospective and retrospective evidence suggest that the involvement of a diabetes specialist team may improve readmission rates, but attention to more generalized comprehensive approaches may also be worthwhile. Prospective interventional studies targeting interventions for improving glycemic control are needed to determine whether glycemic control impacts readmission rates.
