A method for estimating T1 using a single breath-hold, segmented, inversion recovery prepared, true fast imaging with steady-state precession (sIR-TrueFISP) acquisition at low flip angle (FA) was implemented in this study. T1 values measured by sIR-TrueFISP technique in a Gd-DTPA-doped water phantom and the human brain and abdomen of healthy volunteers were compared with the results of the standard IR fast spin echo (FSE) technique. A good correlation between the two methods was observed (R2=0.999 in the phantom, and R2=0.943 in the brain and abdominal tissues). The T1 values of the tissues agreed well with published results. sIR-TrueFISP enables fast measurements of T1 to be obtained within a single breath-hold with good accuracy, which is particularly important for chest and abdominal imaging.
