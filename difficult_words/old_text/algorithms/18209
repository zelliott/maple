This paper presents the way of application of structural methods of Artificial Intelligence-in particular, linguistic mechanisms of semantic meaning reasoning-for development of intelligent medical information systems. They also facilitate an in-depth analysis of the meaning presented in Diagnosis Support Information Systems used in analysis of selected medical examinations. This paper will present the mechanisms of pattern meaning description on selected examples of spinal cord image analysis. Presented approach for semantic reasoning will be based on the model of cognitive resonance, which will be applied to the task of interpreting the meaning of selected diagnostic images from the central nervous system. Such algorithms are aimed to construct an intelligent analysis module in medical IS. The application presented in this paper is of a research character and it serves the preparation of efficient lesion detection methods applied to a data set originating from magnetic and resonance examinations of the spine and spinal cord structures.
