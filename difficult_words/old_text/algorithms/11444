A method, is presented for blind unmixing spectrally resolved fluorescence lifetime images. The method is based on the combined analysis of spectral and lifetime phasors and allows unmixing of up to three components without any prior knowledge. Fractional intensities, spectra and decay curves of the individual components can be extracted with this new technique. The reliability and sensitivity are investigated and the possibility of extending the method to unmix more components is discussed. The method is evaluated on mixtures of fluorescent dyes and labeled cells.
