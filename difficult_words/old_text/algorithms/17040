Unified autocorrelation method of EEG analysis (UNIFAC-EEG) represents some optimized algorithms of EEG-signals processing according to the sign of maximum stability to the broadband noise. These algorithms are united by the common aim to identify generation models of these signals narrowband components on the basis of concrete empirical data and estimation of their source dynamic parameters according to the identification results. On the basis of this method it was proved that alpha-rhythm sources belonged to the type of structural stable dynamic systems, and its decrement value could serve as one of the parameters of the functional state of the central nervous system. The effect was found of the interaction between the heart electric fields and human brain in EEG frequent alpha-range.
