"Metabonomics" method requires the development of rapid, advanced analytical tools and GC will play an important role for its special advantage. In this study we show the application of GC-based metabonomics to investigate the control and type 2 diabetes (DM2) patients by urinary organic acids metabolic profile. After peak matching, multivariate statistical analysis methods: principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used. The results showed that there was a relationship between organic acids metabolic profiles and DM2, and PLS-DA can distinguish the DM2 patients from the control. Five organic acids as potential biomarkers were identified.
