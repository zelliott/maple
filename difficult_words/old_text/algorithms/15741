A critical review is given of the present state of group additivity schemes for the calculation of partial molar volumes and heat capacities of unfolded proteins. The comparison between the experimental values and the predictions based on the different models shows clearly that only the peptide-based additivity scheme represents properly both the absolute values and the temperature dependence of these thermodynamic quantities.
