An episode of device-related proarrhythmia is reported. Ventricular tachycardia was induced by ventricular pacing in a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator due to an inappropriate interaction of programmed device settings with the atrial preference pacing, an automatic algorithm designed to prevent atrial tachyarrhythmias.
