We present a novel method for dynamical measurement of the ternary diffusion by using digital holographic interferometry based on wavelength and angular multiplexing techniques. Two laser beams with different wavelengths (λ1=532 nm and λ2=473 nm) are used for the ternary diffusion measurement, and they are adjusted to make corresponding interference fringes in orthogonal directions on the CCD target. The orthogonal splitting of the fringes enables the spatial frequencies of each wavelength to be filtered separately in the Fourier spectrum of the hologram. Finally, they are reconstructed to obtain the molar concentration. This method is also suitable for two-phase diffusion measurement.
