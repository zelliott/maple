In this article, the effect of interparticle interactions of 4.63 nm sized monolayer protected gold clusters (Au MPCs) during quantized double layer (QDL) charging has been investigated using electrochemical techniques. Voltammetry and scanning tunneling microscopy have been used to compare their electron transfer behavior. Furthermore, since the QDL process is diffusion controlled, the diffusion coefficient values have been estimated at various charge steps using two independent electroanalytical techniques, viz. chronoamperometry and impedance. These results show that higher core charge facilitates higher diffusion coefficient values, and indicate that repulsive interactions dominate for charged MPCs compared to those of its neutral analogue, which are mainly attractive in nature. Additionally, the electron transfer rate constants at various charge steps have been estimated from the impedance results, showing comparatively faster electron transfer rate at higher charge states.
