The acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is one of the most frequent differential diagnoses in emergency medicine. The causal mechanism of the ACS most often is an atherosclerotic plaque rupture. The differential diagnosis of ACS is guided by the clinical symptom of chest discomfort. The diagnosis is based on the electrocardiographic, biomarker and imaging findings before targeted therapy can be initiated. Over the last years we have witnessed breakthroughs in imaging techniques and the application of biomarkers such as highly sensitive or ultrasensitive cardiac troponin assays. They permit an early and sensitive diagnosis of ACS. Furthermore, they exhibit a high negative predictive value for a safe rule-out. Trained personnel and optimized structures in chest pain units constitute optimal conditions for a guideline conform therapy of patients with ACS.â€ŠThe number of certified chest pain units in Germany has constantly been increasing.
