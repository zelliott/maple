Dual phospho/dephosphorylation cycles, as well as covalent enzymatic-catalyzed modifications of substrates are widely diffused within cellular systems and are crucial for the control of complex responses such as learning, memory, and cellular fate determination. Despite the large body of deterministic studies and the increasing work aimed at elucidating the effect of noise in such systems, some aspects remain unclear. Here we study the stationary distribution provided by the two-dimensional chemical master equation for a well-known model of a two step phospho/dephosphorylation cycle using the quasi-steady state approximation of enzymatic kinetics. Our aim is to analyze the role of fluctuations and the molecules distribution properties in the transition to a bistable regime. When detailed balance conditions are satisfied it is possible to compute equilibrium distributions in a closed and explicit form. When detailed balance is not satisfied, the stationary non-equilibrium state is strongly influenced by the chemical fluxes. In the last case, we show how the external field derived from the generation and recombination transition rates, can be decomposed by the Helmholtz theorem, into a conservative and a rotational (irreversible) part. Moreover, this decomposition allows to compute the stationary distribution via a perturbative approach. For a finite number of molecules there exists diffusion dynamics in a macroscopic region of the state space where a relevant transition rate between the two critical points is observed. Further, the stationary distribution function can be approximated by the solution of a Fokker-Planck equation. We illustrate the theoretical results using several numerical simulations.
