This study assessed the predictive accuracy of previously published bioelectrical impedance analysis equations for estimating fat-free mass of young (20-39 yr) Hispanic women (N = 29). The reference method was hydrostatic weighing at residual lung volume. Body density was converted to percent body fat using the Siri equation. Resistance and reactance were measured with a Valhalla bioimpedance analyzer. The bioelectrical impedance analysis equations of Lohman, Rising, Stolarczyk, Segal, Gray, and Van Loan were cross-validated. There were significant correlations between criterion and predicted fat-free mass (r = 0.86-0.95) for all equations. The standard error of estimate for each equation was acceptable; however, the total error for the Stolarczyk (3.2 kg) and the Van Loan (4.6 kg) equations exceeded the recommended value (2.8 kg). For all equations, the difference between average criterion and predicted fat-free mass was significant (P < 0.05). However, the mean differences for the Lohman (0.8 kg), Segal (0.8 kg), and Gray (0.9 kg) equations were small. In conclusion, the Segal, Lohman, and Gray equations may have potential for assessing the body composition of healthy, acculturated, Hispanic women.
