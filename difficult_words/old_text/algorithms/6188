An application tool for alignment, template matching and visualization of gene expression time series is presented. The core algorithm is based on dynamic time warping techniques used in the speech recognition field. These techniques allow for non-linear (elastic) alignment of temporal sequences of feature vectors and consequently enable detection of similar shapes with different phases.

The Java program, examples and a tutorial are available at http://www.psb.ugent.be/cbd/papers/gentxwarper/
