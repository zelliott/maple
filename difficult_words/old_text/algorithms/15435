The P and R-branch spectral lines of high-lying rotational quantum states of (0,0), (1,1) bands in d(1)Σ(+)-A(3)Σ0(-) electronic transition of NbN are obtained in this work by using the analytical formula proposed recently by Sun et al. The formula have generated unknown P and R-branch emission spectral lines up to J=80 those may not be available experimentally for these bands of NbN molecule.
