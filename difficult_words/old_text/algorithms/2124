The aim of the study was to determine and compare bending and torsion moments across mandibular fractures, for different positions of the bite point and different sites of the fracture. Three identical resin mandibles, each with a single fracture, were used. The fracture sites were in the angle, body and symphyseal regions. A polyethylene bone plate was used for fixation. Simulated bite forces were applied at 13 bite points. For each bite point, the displacements of the fragments were registered and converted into bending and torsion moments across the fracture. Positive bending moments were defined as those moments that caused compression at the lower border and tension at the alveolar side of the mandible; negative bending moments did the opposite. Angle fractures had relatively high positive bending moments. Body fractures had positive as well as negative bending moments and the highest torsion moments. Symphyseal fractures had negative bending moments only and relatively high torsion moments. It was found that angle, body and symphyseal fractures each have a characteristic load pattern. These load patterns should play a decisive role in the treatment of mandibular fractures with regard to number and positioning of plates.
