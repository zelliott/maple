Previous studies have shown that extracellular pH (pHo) alters gating and permeation properties of cardiac L- and T-type channels. However, a comprehensive study investigating the effects of pHo on all other voltage-gated calcium channels is lacking. Here, we report the effects of pHo on activation parameters slope factor (S), half-activation potential (Va), reversal potential (Erev), and maximum slope conductance (Gmax) of the nine known neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels transiently expressed in tsA-201 cells. In all cases, acidification of the extracellular bathing solution results in a depolarizing shift in the activation curve and reduction in peak current amplitudes. Relative to a physiological pHo of 7.25, statistically significant depolarizing shifts in Va were observed for all channels at pHo 7.00 except Cav1.3 and 3.2, which showed significant shifts at pHo 6.75 and below. All channels displayed significant reductions in Gmax relative to pHo 7.25 at pHo 7.00 except Cav1.2, 2.1, and 3.1 which required acidification to pHo 6.75. Upon acidification Cav3 channels displayed the largest changes in Vas and exhibited the largest reduction in Gmax compared with other channel subtypes. Taken together, these results suggest that significant modulation of calcium channel currents can occur with changes in pHo. Acidification of the external solution did not produce significant shifts in observed Erevs or blockade of outward currents for any of the nine channel subtypes. Finally, we tested a simple Woodhull-type model of current block by assuming blockade of the pore by a single proton. In all cases, the amount of blockade observed could not be explained in these simple terms, suggesting that proton modulation is more complicated, involving more than one site or gating modification as has been previously described for cardiac L- and T-type channels.
