This novel method of Pedestrian Tracking using Support Vector (PTSV) proposed for a video surveillance instrument combines the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier into an optic-flow based tracker. The traditional method using optical flow tracks objects by minimizing an intensity difference function between successive frames, while PTSV tracks objects by maximizing the SVM classification score. As the SVM classifier for object and non-object is pre-trained, there is need only to classify an image block as object or non-object without having to compare the pixel region of the tracked object in the previous frame. To account for large motions between successive frames we build pyramids from the support vectors and use a coarse-to-fine scan in the classification stage. To accelerate the training of SVM, a Sequential Minimal Optimization Method (SMO) is adopted. The results of using a kernel-PTSV for pedestrian tracking from real time video are shown at the end. Comparative experimental results showed that PTSV improves the reliability of tracking compared to that of traditional tracking method using optical flow.
