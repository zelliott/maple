Field measurements of chlorophyll-a (Chl), phycoerythrin (PE), chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and variable fluorescence (F(v)/F(m)) in diverse waters of the California Current, Mediterranean Sea and Gulf of Mexico using 375, 405, 510 and 532 nm laser excitation wavelengths (EW) are analyzed. EW = 375 and 405 nm were found more suitable for Chl assessment in high-Chl (> 10 Î¼g/l) waters. Both EW = 532 and 510 nm can be used to efficiently stimulate PE fluorescence for structural characterization of phytoplankton communities. EW = 375 nm and 405 nm can provide best results for CDOM assessments in offshore oceanic waters; the green EWs can be also used for CDOM measurements in fresh and estuarine water types in conjunction with spectral discrimination between CDOM and PE fluorescence. Both EW = 405 and 510 are suitable for photo-physiological F(v)/F(m) assessments, though using EW = 405 nm may result in underestimation of PE-containing phytoplankton groups present in mixed phytoplankton assemblages.
