We describe Rosetta predictions in the Sixth Community-Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP), focusing on the free modeling category. Methods developed since CASP5 are described, and their application to selected targets is discussed. Highlights include improved performance on larger proteins (100-200 residues) and the prediction of a 70-residue alpha-beta protein to near-atomic resolution.
