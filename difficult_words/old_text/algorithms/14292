The long-term effects of initial treatment for infantile septic arthritis of the hip differ and depend on patient age, infecting organism, and timing and adequacy of surgical and pharmacologic treatment. Appropriate and timely reconstructive operations benefit hip growth and development by providing the best possible hip joint mechanics at skeletal maturity. Any surgical treatment for severe sequelae, however, must be regarded as a measure that temporarily improves clinical function and delays the more definitive procedures that are reserved for adult patients. This article summarizes the surgical modalities currently available to reduce and stabilize a damaged femoral head and neck and to reconstruct femoral-acetabular articulation.
