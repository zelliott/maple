We assessed the accuracy of a wrist-worn device WatchPAT 200 for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sleep and wakefulness indicators compared to standard polysomnography (PSG) using American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria. Twenty-eight adults with suspected OSA underwent a standard in-hospital PSG while wearing a WatchPAT 200. PSG events were manually scored using AASM criteria; WatchPAT 200 data were collected and analyzed by an automatic algorithm. The accuracy of WatchPAT 200 algorithm in apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and sleep-wake detection was compared to standard PSG methodology. The study population consisted of 21 males and 7 females, mean age of 47.45 ± 13.46 years, and mean body mass index of 29.99 ± 5.74 kg/m(2). For AHI, the mean PSG score for events per hour was 23.00 ± 21.55 compared to a mean score of 25.99 ± 19.09 for WatchPAT (r = 0.92, P < 0.001). The agreement of the sleep-wake assessment based on 30-s bins between the PSG and the WatchPAT was 89 ± 6 %. WatchPAT 200 detected OSA based on AHI with comparable accuracy, and provided a reasonably accurate estimation of sleep and wakefulness in patients with OSA on an epoch-by-epoch basis.
