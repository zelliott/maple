A complete set of software tools to aid the physical mapping of a genome has been developed and successfully applied to the genomic mapping of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Two approaches were used for ordering single-copy hybridisation probes: one was based on the simulated annealing algorithm to order all probes, and another on inferring the minimum-spanning subset of the probes using a heuristic filtering procedure. Both algorithms produced almost identical maps, with minor differences in the order of repetitive probes and those having identical hybridisation patterns. A separate algorithm fitted the clones to the established probe order. Approaches for handling experimental noise and repetitive elements are discussed. In addition to these programs and the database management software, tools for visualizing and editing the data are described. The issues of combining the information from different libraries are addressed. Also, ways of handling multiple-copy probes and non-hybridisation data are discussed.
