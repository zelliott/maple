Three-dimensional high-spatial-resolution angiograms of the coronary arteries were acquired with an electrocardiogram-gated three-dimensional rotational angiography technique on an interventional X-ray system.

During selective injection of contrast material in the left and right coronary artery, projection images were obtained in eight pigs during a continuous rotation of the X-ray gantry over an angular range of 180 degrees within 8 seconds.

Three-dimensional tomographic reconstruction depicted the proximal, medial, and distal sections of the main arteries as well as the main bifurcations in multiple cardiac phases in all animals.

For the first time, this feasibility study shows that a three-dimensional angiogram of the coronary arteries can be obtained intraprocedurally in a conventional interventional suite by means of tomographic reconstruction from projection images.
