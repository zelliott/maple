Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a subset of stroke resulting from bleeding within the brain parenchyma of the brain. It is potentially lethal, and survival depends on ensuring an adequate airway, reversal of coagulopathy, and proper diagnosis. ICH was chosen as an emergency neurological life support (ENLS) protocol because intervention within the first critical hour may improve outcome, and it is helpful to have a protocol to drive care quickly and efficiently.
