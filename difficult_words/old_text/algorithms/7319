We show that the space mapping algorithm, originally developed for microwave circuit optimization, can enable the efficient design of nanoplasmonic waveguide devices which satisfy a set of desired specifications. Space mapping utilizes a physics-based coarse model to approximate a fine model accurately describing a device. Here the fine model is a full-wave finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) simulation of the device, while the coarse model is based on transmission line theory. We demonstrate that simply optimizing the transmission line model of the device is not enough to obtain a device which satisfies all the required design specifications. On the other hand, when the iterative space mapping algorithm is used, it converges fast to a design which meets all the specifications. In addition, full-wave FDFD simulations of only a few candidate structures are required before the iterative process is terminated. Use of the space mapping algorithm therefore results in large reductions in the required computation time when compared to any direct optimization method of the fine FDFD model.
