Basic calculational methods and models used in dose assessment for internal emitters in nuclear medicine are discussed in this overview. Methods for quantification of activity in clinical and preclinical studies also are discussed, and we show how to implement them in currently available dose calculational models. Current practice of the use of internal emitters in therapy also is briefly presented here. Some of the future challenges for dose assessment in nuclear medicine are discussed, including application of patient-specific dose calculational methods and the need for significant advances in radiation biology.
