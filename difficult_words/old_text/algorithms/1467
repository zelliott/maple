The primary sequence of esterases from Acinetobacter lwoffii RAG-1 and A. calcoaceticus BD413 were compared with linearized structural sequences of two hundred proteins selected from Brookhaven Protein DataBank using a modified version of the Bowie et al. algorithm [3]. Significant structural homology was found to alpha/beta proteins and specifically to those with the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold for which the crystal structure was reported. No such homology was detected using common primary sequence alignment programs such as FASTA or BLAST.
