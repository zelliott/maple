This paper studies the problem of state feedback controller design for a class of nonlinear systems, which are described by continuous-time affine fuzzy models. A convex piecewise affine controller design method is proposed based on a new dilated linear matrix inequality (LMI) characterization, where the system matrix is separated from Lyapunov matrix such that the controller parametrization is independent of the Lyapunov matrix. In contrast to the existing work, the derived stabilizability condition leads to less conservative LMI characterizations and much wider scope of the applicability. Furthermore, the results are extended to H(âˆž) state feedback synthesis. Finally, two numerical examples illustrate the superiority and effectiveness of the new results.
