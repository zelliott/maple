Mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) occur when a dynamical system switches between fast and slow motion and small and large amplitude. MMOs appear in a variety of systems in nature, and may be simple or complex. This focus issue presents a series of articles on theoretical, numerical, and experimental aspects of MMOs. The applications cover physical, chemical, and biological systems.
