A dynamic mathematical model is formulated and used to describe the distribution and transport of fluid and plasma proteins between the circulation, interstitial space of skin and muscle, and the lymphatics in the rat. Two descriptions of transcapillary exchange are investigated: a homoporous "Starling model" and a heteroporous "plasma leak model." Parameters used in the two hypothetical transport mechanisms are determined based on statistical fitting procedures between simulation predictions and selected experimental data. These data consist of interstitial fluid volume and colloid osmotic pressure measurements as a function of venous pressure for muscle and interstitial colloid osmotic pressure vs. venous pressure for skin. The values determined for the transport parameters compare well with data in the literature. The fully determined model is used to simulate steady-state conditions of hypoproteinemia, overhydration, and dehydration, as well as the dynamic response to changes in venous pressure and intravascularly administered protein tracers. Comparisons between the simulation predictions and experimental data for these various perturbations are made. The plasma leak model appears to provide a better description of microvascular exchange.
