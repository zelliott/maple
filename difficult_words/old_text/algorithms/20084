The algorithm of analysis of blood of oncologic patients with anemic syndrome was elaborated using large clinical sampling (n = 284). It is established that 72% of oncologic patients developed anemia by kind of chronic diseases anemia. However in some patients the anemic syndrome was caused by the iron deficiency The cases of B12 deficient, autoimmune hemolytic anemia were registered and inefficient erythropoiesis under metastatic lesion of bone marrow and myelodysplasia syndromes as well. The high importance of methods of objective evaluation of iron resources (level of ferritin and soluble receptors of transferrin), erythropoietic activity of bone marrow (reticulocytes and reticulocyte indices) and adequate response to anemia degree (level of endogenic erythropoietin). The possibility to detect the concentration of hemoglobin in reticulocytes makes it possible to monitor the restoration of hemoglobin content on early stages of treatment of patient with iron deficiency anemia.
