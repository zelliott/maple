The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of attenuation correction of technetium 99m tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging for the detection of myocardial viability.

A head-to-head comparison between resting Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) SPECT was performed. Both the noncorrected and attenuation-corrected Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT images were compared with the FDG images that served as the reference for viability. Consecutive patients (n = 33) with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction were included. Segmental Tc-99m tetrofosmin and FDG data were displayed in polar maps (17-segment model), and the segments were normalized to peak activity by use of the 4D-MSPECT software program. Segments with normalized FDG activity greater than 50% were considered viable. A similar cutoff value to assess viability was used for the noncorrected and attenuation-corrected Tc-99m tetrofosmin images. Regional contractile function was determined from the gated Tc-99m tetrofosmin images and scored as normokinesia, hypokinesia, or akinesia/dyskinesia. Of all segments, 482 (85%) were viable on FDG SPECT. Of these, 427 (89%) were classified as viable with noncorrected Tc-99m tetrofosmin. Thus 55 (11%) were underestimated with noncorrected Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT; these segments were mainly located in the inferior and inferoseptal regions. Attenuation correction changed the classification of 39 (70%) of the underestimated segments to viable. By use of attenuation correction, the agreement between Tc-99m tetrofosmin and FDG imaging improved from 84% to 90%. Similar observations were made when the analysis was restricted to the dysfunctional segments.

The addition of attenuation correction to Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT significantly improved detection of myocardial viability in patients with chronic coronary artery disease, although minimal underestimation of viability remained as compared with FDG SPECT imaging.
