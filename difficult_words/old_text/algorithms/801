In a bioprocess, for example a fermentation process, many biological reactions are always working in intracellular space and the control of such a process is very complicated. Bioprocesses have therefore been controlled by the judgment of the experts who are the skilled operators and have much experience in the control of such processes. Such experience is normally described in terms of linguistic IF-THEN rules. Fuzzy inference is a powerful tool for incorporating linguistic rules into computer control of such processes. Fuzzy control is divided into two types--direct fuzzy control of process variables, for example sugar feed rate and fermentation temperature, and indirect control via phase recognition. In bioprocess control the experts decide the value of controllable process variables such as sugar feed rate or temperature as output data from several state variables as input data. Fuzzy control is regarded as a computational algorithm in which the causal relationship between input and output data are incorporated. In Japan fuzzy control has already been applied to practical industrial processes such as production of pravastatin precursor and vitamin B2 and to the Japanese sake mashing process; these examples are reviewed. In addition, an advanced control tool developed from a study on fuzzy control, fuzzy neural networks (FNN), are introduced. FNN can involve complicated causality between input and output data in a network model. FNN have been proven to be applicable to a research in biomedicine, for example modeling of the complicated causality between electroencephalogram or gene expression profiling data and prognostic prediction. Successful results on this research will be also explained.
