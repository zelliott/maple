Long-lived spin states have been observed in a variety of systems. Although the dynamics underlying the long lifetimes of these states are well understood in the case of two-spin systems, the corresponding dynamics in systems containing more spins appear to be more complex. Recently it has been shown that a selection rule for transitions mediated by intramolecular dipolar relaxation may play a role in determining the lifetimes of long-lived states in systems containing arbitrary numbers of spins. Here we present a theory of long-lived states in systems containing three and four spins and demonstrate how it can be used to identify states that have little or no intramolecular dipolar relaxation.
