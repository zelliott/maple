This paper proposes a novel method to detect transparent living cells in a transparent microfluidic chamber by optical diffraction of an aperture or an aperture array. Through the analysis of the far-field diffraction pattern, one of the parameters of the cells, including the size, refractive index, or position, can be extracted by the analysis software developed in this paper. Calculations are carried out to discuss the key issues of this MEMS device, and our simulation is verified by diffraction patterns of transparent microparticles on fabricated apertures, recorded via a digital camera.
