Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the behavior of the EMIM-BF(4) ionic liquid for conditions similar to those of electrospray thrusters. To study the physics of ion extrusion a large system composed of approximately 2160 ion pairs was placed inside a platinum capillary and equilibrated. Diffusion coefficients and electrical conductivity were calculated and compared with literature values, showing good agreement and validating the use of a constrained dynamics model with a coarse-grained potential. An electric field was applied to the system in the longitudinal direction and the fraction of solvated and non-solvated emitted ions was analyzed. The threshold electric field for particle emission was found to be 1.2 V/nm, consistent with other reported work.
