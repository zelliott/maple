Single-shot detection of ultrabroadband mid-infrared spectra was demonstrated by using chirped-pulse upconversion technique with four-wave difference frequency generation in gases. Thanks to the low dispersion of the gas media, the bandwidth of the phase matching condition of the upconversion process becomes very broad and the entire mid-infrared spectrum spanning from 200 to 5500 cm(-1) was upconverted by using a 10 ps chirped pulse to visible wavelength radiation, which was detected with a conventional visible dispersive spectrometer. This method was demonstrated by the successful measurement of infrared absorption spectra of organic polymer films.
