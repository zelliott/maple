The estimation of intralesional haemodynamics is crucial in determining appropriate treatment for soft-tissue vascular malformations. The aim of this study was to develop a method to evaluate the flow characteristics of soft-tissue vascular malformations using technetium-99m labelled red blood cells (99mTc-RBCs). Seventy-nine soft-tissue vascular malformations, including 20 arteriovenous malformations and 59 venous malformations, in 57 patients were examined. Following the intravenous injection of 99mTc-RBCs, dynamic imaging was performed for 30 min with the lesion in the field of view (99mTc-RBC flow study). A time-activity curve was generated for the lesion, and the lesion was categorized as a high-flow or low-flow lesion by visual inspection of the curve. In low-flow lesions, mean vascular transit time (MTT) was calculated by curve fitting based on a two-compartment model. Twenty-nine lesions in 19 patients were examined twice, and reproducibility was assessed. In 23 venous malformations in 16 patients, 99mTc-Sn colloid was percutaneously injected into the intravascular space of the lesion, and dynamic data of 5-min duration were acquired (direct puncture scintigraphy). MTT was estimated from the washout curve and compared with MTT estimated by 99mTc-RBC flow study. 99mTc-RBC flow study classified all 20 arteriovenous malformations as high-flow lesions and all 59 venous malformations as low-flow lesions. In the low-flow lesions, MTT estimated by 99mTc-RBC flow study ranged from 61.2 to 2174.9 s. In the reproducibility study, complete concordance in classification and high correlation in MTT were shown between the first and second examinations. MTT estimated by 99mTc-RBC flow study was significantly correlated with that estimated by direct puncture scintigraphy. In summary, 99mTc-RBC flow study provides a quantitative indicator of intralesional haemodynamics in low-flow lesions in addition to accurate distinction between high-flow and low-flow lesions. The results of this study suggest the feasibility of detailed evaluation of flow characteristics in soft-tissue vascular malformations using 99mTc-RBCs.
