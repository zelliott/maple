To develop an objective and uniform means for classifying patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) according to SCI syndromes.

Criteria for assigning the syndromes (defined by the International Standards for Neurological and Functional Classification of SCI Patients) were operationalized by means of sensory and motor scores and were incorporated into a set of six independent algorithms and two composite algorithms.

A regional SCI rehabilitation center in Canada.

SCI patients (n = 56) with incomplete injuries (American Spinal Injury Association classes B, C, D) and stable neurologic deficits.

Individual algorithms allowed the highest classification rate but with some patients meeting the criteria for more than one syndrome. A composite, differential allocation algorithm, with selected thresholds at decision nodes, yielded a classification rate approximating that of the individual algorithms but without double classifications.

The composite algorithm provided an objective and standardized means of assigning patients to syndromes based on clinically measurable sensory and motor scores. The thresholds used to implement criteria and the order of decision nodes greatly influenced the outcomes and may be adjusted to suit the needs of the classification, that is, embracing liberal or stringent criteria. Controversy remains about the interpretation of some syndromes, and many patients remain unclassifiable because of mixed clinical presentation.
