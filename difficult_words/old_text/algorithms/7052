Computer scientists creating computer systems supporting partial diagnostics based on numerical results of medical examinations always follow a similar method. Why not algorithmize this procedure? This was the main reason for preparation of the specialized PC software presented in the paper. The software is addressed to clinicians-scientists and enables such users to create by themselves (with no need of programming) practically useful computer systems for differential diagnosis of chosen diseases. These generated systems are assigned to an end-user, i.e. any physician interested in a partial diagnosis of the considered type. They perform classification of patients on the basis of numerical results of the examinations selected for the training databases. The software is based on a statistical approach; multi-dimensional variance analysis and discriminant analysis methods have been used. The pilot version of the software (experimentally implemented in a Warsaw clinic) and an outline of planned work are presented.
