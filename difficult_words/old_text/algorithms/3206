Phase sensing implementations of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) have demonstrated the ability to measure nanometer-scale temporal and spatial profiles of samples. However, the phase information suffers from a 2pi ambiguity that limits observations of larger sample displacements to lengths less than half the source center wavelength. We introduce a synthetic wavelength phase unwrapping technique in SDOCT that uses spectral windowing and corrects the 2pi ambiguity, providing accurate measurements of sample motion with information gained from standard SDOCT processing. We demonstrate this technique by using a common path implementation of SDOCT and correctly measure phase profiles from a phantom phase object and human epithelial cheek cells which produce multiple wrapping artifacts. Using a synthetic wavelength for phase unwrapping could prove useful in Doppler or other phase based implementations of OCT.
