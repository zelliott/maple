The purpose of this study was to compare the Precision Imaging sonographic technique (Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with conventional sonography of liver lesions in terms of lesion conspicuity, margin sharpness, overall image quality, and posterior enhancement.

Sixty-nine focal liver lesions in 60 patients (age range, 14-76 years; mean age, 43 years) were prospectively evaluated. Each lesion was examined with Precision Imaging and conventional sonography. All images were reviewed and graded on a 3-point scale by 2 readers for lesion conspicuity, margin sharpness, and overall image quality. Posterior acoustic enhancement was also analyzed in cystic lesions. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical comparisons of the techniques for all parameters.

Statistical analysis showed that for margin sharpness, lesion conspicuity, and overall image quality, Precision Imaging was superior to conventional sonography (P< .05). In addition, according to lesion types and dimensions, Precision Imaging was significantly superior to conventional sonography for all parameters. For posterior enhancement, there was no significant difference between Precision Imaging and conventional sonography (P â‰¥ .05).

In sonography of focal liver lesions, Precision Imaging provides better lesion conspicuity, better margin sharpness, and better overall image quality than conventional sonography. With respect to posterior enhancement of cystic lesions, Precision Imaging is not significantly different from conventional sonography. Precision Imaging may be used as a complementary method in the sonographic evaluation of focal liver lesions.
