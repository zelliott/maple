Erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE) are the two most prevalent male sexual dysfunctions.

To present the updated version of 2009 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on ED and PE.

A systematic review of the recent literature on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ED and PE was performed. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation were assigned.

ED is highly prevalent, and 5-20% of men have moderate to severe ED. ED shares common risk factors with cardiovascular disease. Diagnosis is based on medical and sexual history, including validated questionnaires. Physical examination and laboratory testing must be tailored to the patient's complaints and risk factors. Treatment is based on phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is), including sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil. PDE5-Is have high efficacy and safety rates, even in difficult-to-treat populations such as patients with diabetes mellitus. Treatment options for patients who do not respond to PDE5-Is or for whom PDE5-Is are contraindicated include intracavernous injections, intraurethral alprostadil, vacuum constriction devices, or implantation of a penile prosthesis. PE has prevalence rates of 20-30%. PE may be classified as lifelong (primary) or acquired (secondary). Diagnosis is based on medical and sexual history assessing intravaginal ejaculatory latency time, perceived control, distress, and interpersonal difficulty related to the ejaculatory dysfunction. Physical examination and laboratory testing may be needed in selected patients only. Pharmacotherapy is the basis of treatment in lifelong PE, including daily dosing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and topical anaesthetics. Dapoxetine is the only drug approved for the on-demand treatment of PE in Europe. Behavioural techniques may be efficacious as a monotherapy or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Recurrence is likely to occur after treatment withdrawal.

These EAU guidelines summarise the present information on ED and PE. The extended version of the guidelines is available at the EAU Web site (http://www.uroweb.org/nc/professional-resources/guidelines/online/).
