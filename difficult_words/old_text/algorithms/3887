Test validity is determined by the proportion of results that are diagnostically confirmed and predicted on the measures used to identify the disease process. This article summarizes the results of a series of 224 stable high-risk infants who were screened by automated (ALGO-1) and conventional (Bio-logics LT) ABR instrumentation. Failure criteria was defined as the absence or prolongation of a replicable wave V response (conventional) or Refer by the automated system. The overall failure rates at a 35 dB screening level were comparable between devices. Sensitivity and specificity measures for the ALGO-1 unit were 100 and 96 percent, respectively. Permanent hearing loss was demonstrated in 5 percent of the newborns screened in this study. Advantages of the automated system include a dual artifact rejection system, attenuating ear couplers, and a battery operated design. These findings suggest that the automated ABR screener is a viable alternative to conventional ABR instrumentation for the limited purpose of neonatal auditory screening.
