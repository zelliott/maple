An attempt was made to determine whether an algorithm for lithium dose prediction allows earlier or more economical attainment of a therapeutic steady state than does the usual "clinical titration." Twelve patients were treated using an algorithm developed by Zetin and associates and compared with 21 patients treated by clinical titration. Ten of the 12 algorithm-treated patients (83%) had reached the desired lithium blood level by the seventh day, whereas only 8 of the 21 clinical titration patients (38%) had done so. This difference is significant. In addition, the Zetin algorithm performed safely: the 2 dose prediction errors led to underdosing. Some of the relevant literature is reviewed.
