In this paper we describe attempts at building a robust model for predicting the length of survival of patients with colorectal cancer. The aim of the research, reported in this paper, is to study the effective utilisation of artificial intelligence techniques in the medical domain. We suggest that an important research objective of proponents of intelligent prognostic systems must be to evaluate the additionality that AI techniques can bring to an already well-established field of medical prognosis. Towards this end, we compare a number of different AI techniques that lend themselves to the task of predicting survival in colorectal cancer patients. We describe the pros and cons of each of these methods using the usual metrics of accuracy and perspicuity. We then present the notion of intelligent hybrid systems and evaluate the role that they may potentially play in developing robust prognostic models. In particular we evaluate a hybrid system that utilises the k Nearest Neighbour technique in conjunction with Genetic Algorithms. We describe a number of innovations used within this hybrid paradigm used to build the prognostic model. We discuss the issue of censored patients and how this issue can be tackled within the various models used. In keeping with our objective of studying the additionality that AI techniques bring to building prognostic models, we use Cox's regression as a standard and compare each AI technique with it, attempting to discover their capabilities in enhancing prognostic methods in medicine. In doing so we address two main questions--which model fits the data best?, and are the results obtained by the various AI techniques significantly different from those of Cox's regression? We conclude this paper by discussing future enhancements to the work presented and lessons learned from the study to date.
