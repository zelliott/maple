The fabrication and electrochemical characteristics of penicillamine (PCA) self-assembled monolayer modified gold electrode were investigated. The self-assembled electrode shows an obvious electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of dopamine (DA). In phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), the peak current is proportional to the concentration of DA in the range of 8.0 x 10(-6) approximately 1.0 x 10(-3) M by the cyclic voltammetry methods with the detection limits of 4.5 x 10(-7) M. The PCA self-assembled monolayer modified gold electrode can be applied to the determination of DA in practical injection samples with simplicity, rapidness, and accurate results.
