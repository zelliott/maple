The purpose of the present study was to investigate oxygen mass transfer in the human carotid bifurcation, focusing on the effects of the wall compliance and flow field on the temporal variation and spatial distribution of the oxygen wall flux. Details of unsteady convective-diffusive oxygen transport were examined numerically using a compliant model of the human carotid bifurcation and realistic blood flow waveforms. Results reveal that axial flow separation at the outer common-internal carotid wall can significantly alter the flow field, oxygen tension field, and oxygen wall flux distribution. At the outer wall of the sinus, the Sherwood number, Sh (non-dimensional oxygen wall flux), takes on significantly lower values than at other sites due to the attenuation of transport rates by convective flow away from wall. More specifically, the lowest value of Sh was Sh approximately 6 (in the sinus), which is much lower than the value of the non-dimensional oxygen consumption rate (Damkohler number, Da) in the reactive wall tissue (Da=29-39). At the inner wall of the sinus, Sh approximately 170 is far above the expected value of Da. This implies that flow separation on the outer wall of the sinus provides a very strong fluid mechanical barrier to oxygen transport; whereas at the inner wall of the sinus, the mechanism of transport is controlled by the wall consumption rate.
