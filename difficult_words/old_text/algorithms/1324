A multiresolution statistical method for identifying clinically normal tissue in digitized mammograms is used to construct an algorithm for separating normal regions from potentially abnormal regions; that is, small regions that may contain isolated calcifications. This is the initial phase of the development of a general method for the automatic recognition of normal mammograms. The first step is to decompose the image with a wavelet expansion that yields a sum of independent images, each containing different levels of image detail. When calcifications are present, there is strong empirical evidence that only some of the image components are necessary for the purpose of detecting a deviation from normal. The underlying statistic for each of the selected expansion components can be modeled with a simple parametric probability distribution function. This function serves as an instrument for the development of a statistical test that allows for the recognition of normal tissue regions. The distribution function depends on only one parameter, and this parameter itself has an underlying statistical distribution. The values of this parameter define a summary statistic that can be used to set detection error rates. Once the summary statistic is determined, spatial filters that are matched to resolution are applied independently to each selected expansion image. Regions of the image that correlate with the normal statistical model are discarded and regions in disagreement (suspicious areas) are flagged. These results are combined to produce a detection output image consisting only of suspicious areas. This type of detection output is amenable to further processing that may ultimately lead to a fully automated algorithm for the identification of normal mammograms.
