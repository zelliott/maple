The effects of ion channel fluctuations on the transmembrane voltage activity are potentially profound in small-size excitable membrane patches. Different groups have extended Hodgkin-Huxley equations into stochastic differential equations to capture the effects of ion channel noise analytically (Fox & Lu, 1994; Linaro, Storace, & Giugliano, 2011; Güler, 2013). Studies have shown that the accuracy of spiking statistics by Fox and Lu's model does not match well with the corresponding statistics from the exact microscopic simulations. The models of both Linaro et al. and Güler, however, were found to produce highly accurate statistics. Here we extend the examination of these models to the case in which the rate functions for the opening and closing of gates are under the influence of noise. For that purpose, the usual rate functions are accompanied additively by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type stochastic angular variables. Moreover, we argue that the existence of such noise in the rate functions is a plausible physiological phenomenon for finite-size membranes. It is observed that the presence of noise in the rates is not effective on the degree of inaccuracies within the Fox and Lu model. Güler model's accuracy is found to remain high as in the case of noise free rates. But the performance of Linaro et al.'s model is seen to degrade seriously with the increasing strength of the introduced rate function noise. We attribute this failure of Linaro et al.'s model to the use of the covariance function of open channels at the steady state, in its derivation.
