The informative value of each of 15 laboratory indices (the amount of platelets, their factor 4 (PF-4), antithrombin III (AT III), fibrinogen and its degradation products (FDP), ethanol and protamine sulfate tests (ET, PST), plasminogen, the eucaryne test, etc.), most commonly used now in laboratory practice for the diagnosis of the DIC syndrome was assessed using mathematical methods relating mainly to the theory of pattern recognition. Basic and alternative algorithms of the recognition of the DIC syndrome which could be used with a minor error (less than or equal to 2.5% and less than or equal to 7-10% respectively) irrespective of the type, form and stage of this syndrome both in the automated system and in a common variant, were developed. Their testing was successfully implemented in a large group of patients with symptoms of the DIC syndrome (770 persons). Indices of the platelet amount, FDP, PF-4,ET and PST possessed the utmost informative value, and close functional ties were particularly noticeable between elevated FDP and lowered platelets. Optimum combinations of the diagnostic indices were presented and substantiated with relation to the potentialities of different types of laboratories.
