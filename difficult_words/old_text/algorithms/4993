To study and compare postoperative complications of total thyroidectomy for Graves disease and multinodular benign goiters.

A retrospective study on 176 patients (37 with Graves disease and 139 with multinodular benign goiters) over a period of 41 months was conducted. Postoperative calcemia and laryngeal palsy as well as hemorrhagic and infectious complications were studied and statistically compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test.

There was no statistical difference concerning the occurrence of postoperative laryngeal palsy, hypoparathyroidism or hemorrhagic complications between these two groups of patients. Only a more frequent immediate postoperative hypocalcemia (day 1) in the Graves disease group was found.

Total thyroidectomy in the surgical management of Graves disease, after a cautious medical preoperative preparation, appears to be a safe technique. Total thyroidectomy must be performed instead of subtotal thyroidectomy in order to avoid recurrences.
