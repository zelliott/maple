Aortic surgical procedures requiring hypothermic circulatory arrest are associated with altered hemostasis and increased bleeding. In a randomized clinical trial, we evaluated effects of thromboelastometrically guided algorithm on transfusion requirements.

Fifty-six consecutive patients (25 with acute type A dissection) undergoing aortic surgery with hypothermic circulatory arrest were enrolled in a randomized trial during a 6-month period. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment group (n = 27) with thromboelastometrically guided transfusion algorithm or control group (n = 29) with routine transfusion practices (clinical judgment-guided transfusion followed by transfusion according to coagulation test results). Primary end point was cumulative allogeneic blood units (red blood cells, fresh-frozen plasma, and platelets) transfused.

Transfusion of allogeneic blood was significantly reduced in the thromboelastometry group: median 9.0 units (interquartile range, 2.0-30.0 units) versus. 16.0 units (9.0-23.0 units, P = .02). Most significant decrease was in the use of fresh-frozen plasma (3.0 units, 0-12.0 units, vs 8.0 units, 4.0-18.0 units, P = .005). Postoperative blood loss (890 mL/d, 600-1250 mL/d vs 950 mL/d, 650-1400 mL/d, p = 0.5) and rate of surgical re-exploration (19% vs 24%, P = .7) were similar between groups. Thromboelastometrically guided algorithm significantly decreased need for massive perioperative transfusion (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.9; P = .03) in multivariable logistic regression analysis.

Thromboelastometrically guided transfusion is associated with a decreased use of allogeneic blood units and reduced incidence of massive transfusion in patients undergoing aortic surgery with circulatory arrest.
