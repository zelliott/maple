pancreatic focal neoplastic lesions (PFNL) should be characterized through image methods to differentiate from no neoplastic lesions, suggesting one or more probable diagnosis, and staging of malignant lesions, in order to help define the estrategy of medial or surgical management. The multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) offers multiple properties and advantages that enable adequate characterization of the PFNL. The objective of this study is to evaluate de usefulness of MDCT in characterizing PFNL.

a descriptive, retrospective caseseries study has been conducted. It consisted of reviewing MDCT studies in which PFNL were found, over a period of 4 years 11 months from January 2006 to November 2010.

we obtained 54 cases of PFNL which were characterized by MDCT; 75.9% for a specific diagnosis, and were categorized as indeterminate 24.1%, considering more than one possible diagnosis. The most frequent PFNL type was pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in 51.9%. Pancreatic cystic neoplasms accounted for 16.7%.

MDCT is useful for identifying and characterizing LFNP, this means the possibility of establishing one or more diagnostic possibilities and guide medical management.
