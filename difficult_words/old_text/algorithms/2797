A new water potential, DMIP (distributed multipoles, implicit polarization), is constructed using distributed multipoles to describe the electrostatic interactions, while accounting for polarization implicitly. In this procedure, small clusters are randomly sampled from atomistic simulations of bulk water using the AMOEBA (Ren and Ponder, J Comput Chem 2002, 23, 1497) potential. The multipole moments of the central water in each cluster are obtained from ab initio densities for each cluster, and the moments are then averaged over all clusters. Properties of bulk water calculated using DMIP compare favorably with existing data from AMOEBA simulations and experiment, with a conservative estimate of reduction in compute time of roughly 40%. The implicit force-field is also shown to work compatibly with existing polarizable multipole-based force-fields for biomolecules.
