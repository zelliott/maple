The development of mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) does not necessarily require surgical intervention. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of avoiding early operative intervention, which can lead to significant sacrifice of the small bowel.

Patients with MVT were identified using the inpatient registry for the years between 2003 and 2007. Each patient's past medical history, history of prior deep venous thrombosis or hypercoagulable state, clinical and biologic presentation, and computed tomography (CT) results were analyzed. The proportion of ischemic bowel observed on the CT scans was compared with the length of the bowel resected.

Nine patients were admitted for extensive MVT during the time period evaluated (six men, three women). All CT scans demonstrated signs of severe bowel ischemia, with a mean ischemic bowel proportion of 21% (range 5-45%). Four patients received medical management alone. Five patients underwent surgery. The mean admission time for these patients prior to the operation was 14.8 days (6-36 days). Surgery was required only in cases of intestinal perforation. The mean length of the bowel resections was 33 cm (20-45 cm). At 6 months after admission, none of the patients required parenteral nutrition. The mean follow-up evaluation period was 27 months (15-38 months). One patient died secondary to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis during the follow-up.

Initial nonsurgical management comprised of inpatient observation on a surgical ward along with systemic anticoagulation must be considered an alternative treatment strategy for MVT. This strategy delays surgery and therefore avoids short bowel syndrome.
