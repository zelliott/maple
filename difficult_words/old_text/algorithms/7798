The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of arytenoid resection on voice and swallowing function in patients who undergo supracricoid laryngectomy with cricohyoidopexy.

A case series with chart review. According to the arytenoid number, patients were divided into two groups: 11 patients with two arytenoids and 9 patients with one arytenoid. The decannulation, nasogastric tube removal, and hospitalization times were noted. Maximum phonation time, average fundamental frequency, percent jitter, percent shimmer, and noise-to-harmonic ratio were measured. Grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenicity and strain scale (for the perceptual evaluation of vocal quality), Voice Handicap Index (for self-assessment of the voice), and dysphagia score were used.

The mean decannulation, nasogastric tube removal, and hospitalization time was 18.4, 40.2, and 32.7 days in patients with one arytenoid, whereas 8.8, 20.8, and 25.3 days in patients with two arytenoids, respectively. The differences were statistically significant. For all of the parameters that are associated with voice function and dysphagia, there was no statistically significant difference between one arytenoid and two arytenoids.

Arytenoid resection may affect the swallowing function in the early postoperative period, but for voice and deglutition functions there was no difference between cricohyoidopexy with one arytenoid and two over the course of time.
