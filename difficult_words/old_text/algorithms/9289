Formation of correct TA and GC and "false" thymine-1H-enol guanine (TGenol) base pairs is here considered to control nucleotide insertion into DNA via low substrate concentration Michaelis-Menten controlled kinetics. Contributions of base pairing to formation of Gibbs free energies in water solution, DeltaDeltaG, are calculated for the correct and false base pairs with the semi-empiric MNDO/PM3 method for base pairing energies in vacuum and the BEM method for hydration effects. The results for DeltaDeltaG indicate equal insertion rates for correct base pairing and a 10(-3)-10(-4) error probability for false insertion controlled by the TGenol false pair.
