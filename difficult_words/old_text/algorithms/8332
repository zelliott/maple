Ependymins beta and gamma constitute a novel family of secretory proteins in the extracellular fluid of goldfish brain. Here we demonstrate that at least two different transcripts exist in goldfish brain differing mainly in the length of their 3' noncoding regions but encoding very similar precursors for ependymins. Both precursors consist of 216 amino acid residues including two potential N-glycosylation sites. Prepro-ependymin-I is the main but not the only precursor of ependymin beta, whereas prepro-ependymin-II is preferentially processed to ependymin gamma. This is in line with our results showing that both ependymins beta and gamma represent different glycoforms with very similar protein backbones. Additionally, we show that both ependymins share the same C-terminal ends indicating that ependymin gamma is not a proteolysis product of ependymin beta. We also demonstrate that processing at three internal pairs of basic residues does not occur in either ependymin.
