The aim of this study was to determine the effects of breastfeeding education/support offered at home on day 3 postpartum on breastfeeding duration and knowledge.

The study included a total of 60 women who gave birth at Zübeyde Hanım Maternity Hospital located in Aydın, Turkey. In addition to a standard breastfeeding education in the first few hours after delivery, which was provided to all women in this "baby-friendly initiative" (BFI) hospital, the mothers in the intervention group received breastfeeding education at home on day 3 postpartum from supporters.

Both groups were comparable in terms of maternal and neonatal characteristics. The breastfeeding education/support offered during a home visit on day 3 postpartum was associated with a significant increase in the percentage of exclusively breastfed infants both at 2 weeks and 6 weeks, and at 6 months, and was also associated with a significant increase in exclusive breastfeeding and in total breastfeeding duration. In addition, increased breastfeeding knowledge scores were observed in the intervention group at 2 weeks and at 6 weeks after delivery, when compared with the respective scores in the control group.

Breastfeeding education offered at home on day 3 postpartum was effective in increasing the breastfeeding duration and breastfeeding knowledge.
