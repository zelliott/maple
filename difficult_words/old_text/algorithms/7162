Correlation-based feature selection (CFS) using neighborhood mutual information (NMI) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are combined into an ensemble technique in this paper. Based on this observation, an efficient gene selection algorithm, denoted by NMICFS-PSO, is proposed. Several cancer recognition tasks are gathered for testing the proposed technique. Moreover, support vector machine (SVM), integrated with leave-one-out cross-validation and served as a classifier, is employed for six classification profiles to calculate the classification accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the redundant features effectively and achieve superior performance. The classification accuracy obtained by our method is higher in five out of the six gene expression problems as compared with that of other classifi cation methods.
