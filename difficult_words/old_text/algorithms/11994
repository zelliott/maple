Nodular thyroid disease is common. Most nodules are asymptomatic and benign, but some are malignant. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy should be the cornerstone of the evaluation of thyroid nodules. Radionuclide scans and other imaging procedures should be considered adjunctive tests and should not be performed until after determination of thyroid function and results of cytology are available.
