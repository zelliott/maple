Period-3 oscillations in genome composition can be detected through correlation functions. Since these oscillations are closely related to the genetic code structure, we developed methods for quantitative comparison of genomic and exonic oscillation amplitudes and decay. In contrast to genomic correlations, exonic period-3 oscillation amplitudes are persistent. A model postulating an uncorrelated distribution of exons in the genome has been applied to the analysis of Escherichia coli K12, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens genomic decay, allowing for a quantitative discussion of genome organization.
