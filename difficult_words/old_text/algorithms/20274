In the present experiments it was tested whether the organic calcium antagonist verapamil has an influence on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) induced cortical field potentials (CFP) in neocortical slices of guinea pigs. NMDA (1 mumol/l) was applied via a micropipette by pressure pulses. Verapamil (60 mumol/l) was administered by bath application or ejected locally (100 mumol/l) and simultaneously with NMDA. Neither the systemic administration nor the local application of verapamil had an influence on NMDA induced CFP. It is concluded that the antiepileptic effect of verapamil is not mediated via the NMDA receptor.
