The role of processes in organic and inorganic nature that determine the formation of the atmosphere chemical composition and Earth temperature balance was analyzed. It was concluded that the biological mechanisms of CO2 removal from the atmosphere are insufficient, and there exist potentially hazardous CO2 sources in inorganic nature that can be activated upon elevation of the mean Earth temperature. It was shown that the stability of natural systems of maintaining the constant chemical composition of the atmosphere is destroyed due to the disturbance by man of climate-forming biocenoses, which may lead to irreversible changes in Earth's climate with the result that the mean planetary temperature would be elevated to 100-150 degrees C and above. This would make impossible the existence of life on our planet, at least in its present form. A radiation-adiabatic model of the greenhouse effect was constructed in the framework of which asymptotic estimates of the increase in mean planet temperatures for a wide range of changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases were obtained. On the basis of the model, an integral model of changes in Earth's climate was constructed, which takes into account the heat inertia of the ocean and aerosol contaminations of the upper layers of the atmosphere. It was shown that irreversible (catastrophic) changes in Earth's climate (greenhouse catastrophe) may occur in a relatively near future (200-300 years).
