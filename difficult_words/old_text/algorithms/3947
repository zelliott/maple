To assess correlation between multi-planar, dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) blood flow measurements and radiolabeled microsphere blood flow measurements, five groups of six rabbits underwent unilateral testicular torsion of 0°, 180°, 360°, 540° or 720°. Five US measurements per testis (three transverse/two longitudinal) were obtained pre-operatively and immediately and 4 and 8 h post-operatively using linear transducers (7-4 MHz/center frequency 4.5 MHz/10 rabbits; 9-3 MHz/center frequency 5.5 MHz/20 rabbits). Björck's linear least-squares method fit the rise phase of mean pixel intensity over a 7-s period for each time curve. Slope of fit and intervention/control US pixel intensity ratios were calculated. Means of transverse, longitudinal and combined transverse/longitudinal US ratios as a function of torsion degree were compared with radiolabeled microsphere ratios using Pearson's correlation coefficient, ρ. There was high correlation between the two sets of ratios (ρ ≥ 0.88, p ≤ 0.05), except for the transverse US ratio in the immediate post-operative period (ρ = 0.79, p = 0.11). These results hold promise for future clinical applications.
