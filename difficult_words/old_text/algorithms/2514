The spectrum dose index (SDI) method was tested for use with data from plastic scintillator detectors by irradiating a typical portal detector system using different gamma sources and natural background. Measurements were compared with exposure rates simultaneously measured using a calibrated pressurised ion chamber. It was found that a modified SDI algorithm could be used to calculate exposure rates for these detectors despite the lack of photopeaks in plastic scintillator spectra.
