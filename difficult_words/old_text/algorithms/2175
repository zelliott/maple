Several mathematical models to predict tissue adaptation have been derived since Julius Wolff proposed a function-form relationship for bone. These can be formulated as computational procedures (algorithms) to predict bone adaptation around implants. The objective of this paper was to further develop the damage-adaptive algorithm, to test its validity, and to determine the relationship between it and algorithms based on strain energy. This was achieved using finite element models of the proximal femur, one for the intact case and another for the case where a noncemented hip prosthesis is implanted. The finite models were generated using CT scan data. Initial bone resorption patterns around a femoral prosthesis following total hip arthroplasty were computed for both damage-adaptive and strain-adaptive adaptation rules. It is found that the damage-adaptive algorithm can successfully predict the bone's adaptive behaviour in response to altered mechanical loading provided that account is taken of the nonlinear nature of damage accumulation. Predictions are made using a strain energy stimulus for comparison with the damage stimulus, and a theoretical relationship between the two is proposed. It is shown that an advantage of the damage approach over the strain-based approach is that the nonlinearity required to replicate clinically observed resorption patterns can be derived theoretically, whereas for strain-adaptive remodelling, empirical relationships are assumed.
