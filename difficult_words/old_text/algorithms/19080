Abstract Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive optical technique that can be used to assess functional activity in the human brain. This work describes the set-up of a one-channel NIRS system designed for use as an optical brain-computer interface (BCI) and reports on first measurements of deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) and oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)) changes during mental arithmetic tasks. We found relatively stable and reproducible hemodynamic responses in a group of 13 healthy subjects. Unexpected observations of a decrease in HbO(2) and increase in Hb concentrations measured over the prefrontal cortex were in contrast to the typical hemodynamic responses (increase in HbO(2), decrease in Hb) during cortical activation previously reported.
