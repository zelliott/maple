The aim of the Multiple Sclerosis Think Tank (Groupe de Réflexion sur la Sclérose en Plaques: GRESEP), composed of hospital neurologists involved in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis, is to provide recommendations in response to clinical questions that are raised when managing these patients. After work done on the themes on useful serum testing with suspected multiple sclerosis, as well as the detection and management of cognitive disorders early in the course of the disease, the subject of the present work is the early definition and early treatment of the disease. Following a systematic literature review, a RAND/UCLA appropriateness-derived method enabled consensual recommendations among a working group, a rating group and a reading group to be developed and formulated. Each recommendation is presented with the degree of consensus that it was accorded.
