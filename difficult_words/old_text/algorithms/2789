In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is considered as the master circadian pacemaker. Each cell in the SCN contains an autonomous molecular clock, and the SCN is composed of multiple single-cell circadian oscillators. The fundamental question is how the individual cellular oscillators, expressing a wide range of periods, interact and assemble to create an integrated pacemaker that can govern behavioural and physiological rhythmicity and be reset by environmental light. The key is that the heterogeneous network formed by the cellular clocks within the SCN must synchronise to maintain timekeeping activity. To study the synchronisation mechanisms and the circadian rhythm generation, we propose a model based on the structural and functional heterogeneity of the SCN. The model is a heterogeneous network of circadian oscillators in which individual oscillators are self-sustained. The authors show that the dorsomedial region can smooth the periodic light-dark (LD) signal curve and affect its wave form. The authors also study the rhythmic process of the circadian oscillators under the effect of the daily LD cycle, including three courses: information afferent inputs, oscillation and information efferent outputs. The numerical simulations are also given to demonstrate the theoretical results.
