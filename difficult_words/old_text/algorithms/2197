Epilepsy is an important public health problem because of its prevalence in the community and the economic disadvantage associated with its chronic morbidity. Uncontrolled seizures are potentially life-threatening and have adverse psychosocial consequences. Surgery is an effective but underutilized therapy for some patients with medically refractory seizures. However, this form of treatment demands precise localization of the epileptogenic zone. In recent years there have been major advances in the development of various imaging techniques for seizure localization. The best combination of diagnostic testing with regard to cost-benefit has been debated. A rational strategy for the deployment of these techniques is discussed.
