Annotations delineating regions of interest can provide valuable information for training medical image classification and segmentation methods. However the process of obtaining annotations is tedious and time-consuming, especially for high-resolution volumetric images. In this paper we present a novel learning framework to reduce the requirement of manual annotations while achieving competitive classification performance. The approach is evaluated on a dataset with 59 3D optical projection tomography images of colorectal polyps. The results show that the proposed method can robustly infer patterns from partially annotated images with low computational cost.
