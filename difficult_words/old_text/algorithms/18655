The aim of this study was to evaluate the perioperative and long-term results of hepatectomy for hepatolithiasis.

Immediate and long-term outcomes of 103 consecutive patients with hepatolithiasis who underwent hepatectomy from 1989 to 2001 were analyzed. Immediate outcomes included stone clearance rate, operative morbidity, and mortality. Long-term results included stone recurrence rate and survival.

The immediate stone clearance rate was 90%, and the final stone clearance rate was 98% after subsequent choledochoscopic lithotripsy by cutaneous stoma or T-tube route. The operative morbidity and hospital mortality rates were 28% and 2%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that right hepatectomy (P=.006) and preoperative hyperbilirubinemia (P=.038) were predictive of postoperative complications. Ten patients (10%) had associated cholangiocarcinoma (four known preoperatively) at the time of hepatectomy. With a median follow-up of 56 months (range 6-158), recurrent stones developed in eight patients and cholangiocarcinoma developed in three patients (range: 7-30 months postoperatively). Sixteen patients had died during the follow-up period, none of recurrent cholangitis. Cholangiocarcinoma was the only significant prognostic factor of long-term survival by Cox regression analysis.

Hepatectomy is a safe and effective treatment for hepatolithiasis, with a high immediate stone clearance rate and a low long-term stone recurrence rate. The presence of associated cholangiocarcinoma is the main factor compromising long-term survival in patients with hepatolithiasis.
