Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a risk factor for a variety of human diseases. Homocysteine is formed from methionine and has two primary metabolic fates: remethylation to form methionine or commitment to the transsulfuration pathway by the action of cystathionine Î²-synthase (CBS). We have examined the metabolic response in mice of a shift from a methionine-replete to a methionine-free diet.

We found that shifting 3-mo-old C57BL6 mice to a methionine-free diet caused a transient increase in tHcy and an increase in the tHcy/methionine ratio. Because CBS is a key regulator of tHcy, we examined CBS protein levels and found that within 3 d on the methionine-deficient diet, animals had a 50% reduction in the levels of liver CBS protein and enzyme activity. Examination of CBS mRNA and studies of transgenic animals that express CBS from a heterologous promoter indicated that this reduction is occurring post-transcriptionally. Loss of CBS protein was unrelated to intracellular levels of S-adenosylmethionine, a known regulator of CBS activity and stability.

Our results imply that methionine deprivation induces a metabolic state in which methionine is effectively conserved in tissue by shutdown of the transsulfuration pathway by an S-adenosylmethionine-independent mechanism that signals a rapid downregulation of CBS protein.
