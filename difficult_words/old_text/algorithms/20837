This article attempts to discern the physical (or mechanistic) features of the sonochemical degradation of two major and ubiquitous nitroaromatic pollutants, viz. nitrobenzene and p-nitrophenol. The fundamental physical phenomenon behind sonochemical degradation of pollutants is radial motion of cavitation bubbles. This study implements a dual approach to the problem, i.e. results of the experiments under different conditions have been coupled to a mathematical model that addresses physics and chemistry of the cavitation bubbles. Various experimental techniques applied in this study influence important physical parameters related to cavitation phenomenon in the liquid medium such as extent of radical production from the bubble, thickness of the liquid shell surrounding the bubble that gets heated up during transient collapse, the concentration of the pollutant in the interfacial region and extent of radical scavenging in the medium. Concurrent analysis of the experimental and simulation results reveal that overall degradation of the pollutant achieved for a given combination of experimental conditions is a function of competing (and sometimes conflicting) effect of these parameters. A semi-quantitative account of the relative influence of these parameters and the interrelations between them is presented.
