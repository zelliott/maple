Various human papillomavirus of the genera α-, β-, γ-, μ- and η-papillomavirus induce type-specific extragenital warts. Plantar, common and plane warts are the most common types. The closely related Alpha-papillomaviruses HPV 2, 27 and 57 are responsible for the majority of therapy-resistant common warts. A wide armamentarium of surgical, physical, chemical or drug therapies is available but no modality cures all patients. In order to avoid overtreatment it is mandatory to differentiate between indolent warts which will spontaneously resolve, warts which cause acute discomfort and warts without any tendency to heal spontaneously. HPV type, wart type, localization, size, disease duration as well as age and immune status are parameters influencing self-healing and should be considered when choosing the appropriate wart therapy.
