Using normal rats and rats with a chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve (injured, model of Bennett-Xie) we investigated the possibility of classifying, by statistical tools, the temporal sequences of neuronal discharges during different noxious and non-noxious stimuli. An analysis was made of both the distribution of the inter-spike intervals and the temporal density of spike trains, the latter being studied within the framework of stochastic universal multifractals, to allow the identification of different random processes involved in the discharge distributions through the Lévy index alpha. The statistical analysis shows that the parametrization based on the Lévy index seems able to discriminate between different noxious stimuli (mechanical pinching and thermal), both in normal and injured animals. Furthermore, comparing normal and injured animals, although the spontaneous basal and non-noxious stimuli (brushing) evoked activities presented different frequencies, these seem to have the same multifractal structure, while the corresponding statistics of the inter-spike intervals are quite different. This information might be relevant to the understanding of a code of neuronal firing and to the modelling of temporal patterns in acute and chronic noxious signals.
