A humanoid thorax phantom containing six compartments was scanned with two different computed tomography (CT) scanners using various image acquisition and reconstruction parameters. The differences of CT numbers were statistically significant between the two CT scanners for each compartment (p<0.001) except for the "air" compartment. The variabilities of the CT numbers are described for the different parameters. The mean CT numbers of the "water" compartment, for instance, ranged from 1 to 15HU (Hounsfield Units), those of the "air" compartment varied from -962 to -990HU. Knowledge of these CT number variabilities is necessary when CT numbers are used for tissue characterization.
