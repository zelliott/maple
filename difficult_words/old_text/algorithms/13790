This technical report presents the recent progress in the design and construction of a closed loop automated seating system. Preliminary test results are reported. The system is designed to measure seating surface forces and control the seating surface geometry of a seated human. It uses force information as feedback to determine custom seating contours which produce desired seating characteristics. Ultimately, the system is intended to be used for research studies with patients. The system consists of an electronically actuated, force-sensing seating surface which is controlled by a computer. Stepper motors are used to move force sensing probes up or down until the desired seating surface characteristic is attained. Preliminary test results are presented and analyzed. A force-equalizing control algorithm has been written and found to produce relatively uniform force distributions for soft, hemispherical loads of various weights.
