Commercially available systems for computer-assisted pedicle screw placement are prohibitively expensive, even in advanced countries. The advantage of the great accuracy of computer-assisted systems for pedicle screw insertion makes them highly desirable and essential for current spinal surgeries.

We have tried to develop a new software for pedicle screw placement, based on paired point matching.

The newly developed software is much less expensive and is an excellent educational tool. Its accuracy has been established by a cadaveric study, described in this paper.

The cadaveric study supports the view that computer-assisted pedicle screw fixation using the newly developed software is superior to the conventional fluoroscopic method, especially with regard to the thoracic spine, where a higher degree of accuracy is needed. Further clinical studies are planned and the software needs further refinement for complex clinical situations.
