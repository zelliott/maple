Accurate and computationally efficient approaches in discovering relationships between biological objects from text documents are important for biologists to develop biological models. This paper presents a novel approach to extract relationships between multiple biological objects that are present in a text document. The approach involves object identification, reference resolution, ontology and synonym discovery, and extracting object-object relationships. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), dictionaries, and N-Gram models are used to set the framework to tackle the complex task of extracting object-object relationships. Experiments were carried out using a corpus of one thousand Medline abstracts. Intermediate results were obtained for the object identification process, synonym discovery, and finally the relationship extraction. For a corpus of thousand abstracts, 53 relationships were extracted of which 43 were correct, giving a specificity of 81%. The approach is both adaptable and scalable to new problems as opposed to rule-based methods.
