Recognition of shunted pouches dural arteriovenous fistula allows us to treat the disease effectively by selective embolization of the pouches at first. However, the shunted pouches in transverse-sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas have not been well-documented. Our aim was to evaluate the angioarchitecture of transverse-sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas, including the frequency and location of shunted pouches and their feeding arteries. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-five consecutive cases of TSS-DAVFs that underwent rotational angiography and transvenous embolization between 2008 and 2011 were reviewed. Multiplanar reformatted images of rotational angiography and selective angiography were reviewed with a particular focus on the shunted pouches.

All 25 cases showed SPs, with numbers ranging from 1 to 4 pouches (mean, 2.35). The SPs were located at the transverse-sigmoid junction in 16, close to the vein of Labbé in 9, at the dorsal-to-sigmoid sinus in 9, inferior to the sigmoid sinus in 6, at the sigmoid-jugular junction in 5, and inferior to the transverse sinus or the sinus confluence in 14. The SP at the sigmoid sinus was frequently fed by the jugular branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery and the stylomastoid artery. The SP at the transverse-sigmoid junction and the vein of Labbé was fed by the petrosal/petrosquamous and posterior branches of the middle meningeal artery and the transosseous branches of the occipital artery. The SP inferior to the transverse sinus and the sinus confluence was fed by the transosseous branches of the occipital artery and the posterior meningeal artery. All cases were successfully treated by transvenous embolization with sinus packing (n = 13) or selective embolization of the SP (n = 12).

The presence of SP is a common angioarchitecture of TSS-DAVFs. Identification of the SPs would be useful for their treatment.
