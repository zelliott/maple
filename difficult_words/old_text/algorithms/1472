A completely automated algorithm is presented which is capable of identifying both the right- and left-lung fields on digitized chest radiographic images. The algorithm is tested on a sample of 802 chest images against lung fields drawn by a human observer. The average accuracies are found to be 0.957 +/- 0.003 and 0.960 +/- 0.003 for right- and left-lung regions, respectively. To put them into perspective, the results are compared to several other simple segmentation techniques. These include a comparison of two sets of lung fields drawn by the human observer at different times which yielded accuracies of 0.967 +/- 0.005 and 0.967 +/- 0.004 for right- and left-lung regions, respectively.
