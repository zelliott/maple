This paper describes the development and application of a new fast MRI technique based on the DEFT principle. The sequence named MAgnetization RecoverY for Signal Enhancement (MARYSE) is composed of two completely symmetric gradient echoes separated by a 180 degrees refocusing pulse. The RF pulse scheme, 90 degrees x-180 degrees y-90 degrees -x enables restoration of the transverse magnetization along the longitudinal axis, and consequently artificially increases R1 relaxation rate. In this sequence, the period between the excitation pulse and the restoring pulse (Tem: transverse magnetization evolution time) is very short (< 10 ms). This makes possible a significant increase in signal-to-noise ratio, even with a relatively short repetition time (20 ms). Simulations were performed for different values of Tem and TR at definite T1 and T2 and for different values of T1 and T2 at constant Tem and TR. Relevant signal enhancement for species with long relaxation time constants as compared to classical gradient echo and fast spin-echo imaging was expected. In vitro studies on a fat/water phantom confirmed this simulation. Application of MARYSE to mouse brain imaging permitted to visualize almost completely cerebrospinal fluid of the ventricles, a signal usually partially saturated in fast gradient echo imaging.
