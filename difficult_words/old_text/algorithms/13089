A drastic reduction of the time required for two-dimensional NMR experiments can be achieved by reducing or skipping the recovery delay between successive experiments. Novel SMAll Recovery Times (SMART) methods use orthogonal pulsed field gradients in three spatial directions to select the desired pathways and suppress interference effects. Two-dimensional spectra of dilute amino acids with concentrations as low as 2 mM can be recorded in about 0.1 s per increment in the indirect domain.
