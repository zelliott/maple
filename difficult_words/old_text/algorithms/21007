Phase-shifting interferometry with a genetic algorithm is proposed. The correction of unknown phase-shifting error is an important task in general phase-shifting interferometry. Since phase-shifting errors generate twin image noise in a reconstructed image, we can reduce the phase-shifting errors indirectly by trying to eliminate the twin-image noise in the reconstructed image. By Zernike polynomial expansion, the reconstructed image is represented as the evenness and oddness, where the ratio of the evenness and oddness is a measure of the amount of the twin image noise. We employ the genetic algorithm for finding the fittest phase shifts of interferograms by reducing the evenness of the reconstructed image, which leads to reduction of phase-shifting errors. This phase-shifting interferometry with a genetic algorithm is confirmed experimentally.
