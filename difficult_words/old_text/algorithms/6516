Data from the WAIS-III standardization sample (The Psychological Corporation, 1997) was used to generate VIQ and PIQ estimation formulae using demographic variables and current WAIS-III subtest performances. The sample (n = 2450) was randomly divided into two groups; the first was used to develop formulas and the second to validate the regression equations. Age, education, ethnicity, gender, region of the country as well as Vocabulary, Matrix Reasoning, and Picture Completion subtests raw scores were used as predictor variables. Prediction formulas were generated using a single verbal and two performance subtest algorithms. The VIQ OPIE-3 model combined Vocabulary raw scores with demographic variables. The PIQ estimation algorithm used Matrix Reasoning and Picture Completion raw scores with demographic variables. The formulas for estimating premorbid VIQ and PIQ were highly significant and accurate in estimation. Differences in estimated VIQ and PIQ scores were evaluated and the OPIE-3 algorithms were found to accurately predict VIQ and PIQ differences within the WAIS-III standardization sample.
