Electrical impedance images were made using the ACT 3 instrument, which applies currents simultaneously to 32 electrodes and measures the resulting voltages on those same electrodes. A reconstruction algorithm was written for a three-dimensional cylinder having electrodes in two or four layers, using current patterns that pass current among different planes of electrodes, as well as within each plane. We have previously reported useful vertical resolution by the use of added layers of electrodes. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate that physiologically useful information can be obtained by examining cephalo-caudal differences in three-dimensional images. Phasic changes throughout the cardiac cycle are seen to be markedly different at the heart compared to lung region, both above and beside it. We formed hydrogel electrodes each 3 cm tall and 7 cm wide and applied them to the thorax of an upright human subject in four horizontal rows; each row contained eight electrodes. During breath-holding, cardiac activity was seen in all layers. With systole, conductivity in the anterior of the lowest layers decreased, but not in the upper layer. In the upper layers, conductivity increased with systole in many regions. These observations are consistent with the opposite changes in blood volume of the heart and lungs and the locations of these organs. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of producing and displaying physiologically interpretable three-dimensional images of the chest in real time.
