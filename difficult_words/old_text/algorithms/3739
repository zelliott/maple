Atherosclerotic disease of the peripheral vasculature is a prevalent condition for which catheter-based techniques have been considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis. However, because of their invasive nature, these techniques inherently have the potential for complications. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques have historically been limited by low accuracy and high operator dependence. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a new approach that has diagnostic accuracy comparable with invasive angiography.

The literature on MRA for evaluation of carotid, mesenteric, renal, and lower-extremity arterial disease was extensively reviewed. Helpful diagnostic algorithms on the basis of the literature are also provided.

MRA is both sensitive and specific when compared with invasive angiography for the evaluation of peripheral arterial disease and avoids the potential for complications resulting from arterial puncture and use of iodinated contrast.

Current MRA techniques are diagnostically robust and have proven to be a highly accurate, safe, and convenient means of diagnosing atherosclerotic disease of the peripheral vascular system.
