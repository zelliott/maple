An individual irradiation planning and application monitoring by ISXP is presented for a remote-controlled interstitial afterloading technique using 192Ir wires which is applied in breast-preserving radiotherapy. The errors of reconstruction of the implants are discussed. The consideration of errors for ISXP can be extended to other stereoscopic methods. In this case the quality considerations made by other authors have to be enlarged. The maximum reconstruction error was investigated for a given digitalization precision, focus size, and object blur by patient's movements in dependence on the deviation angle. The optimum deviation angle is about 45 degrees, depending on the importance given to the individual parts and almost without being influenced by the relation between the isocenter-film and the focus-isocenter distances. In case of an optimized deviation angle, a displacement of an implant point of 1 mm leads to a maximum reconstruction error of 2 mm. The dosage is made according to the Paris system. If the circumcircle radius of the application triangle is modified by 1 mm, a dosage modification of 14% will be the consequence in case of very short wires and a small side length. A verification in a phantom showed a positioning error below 0.5 mm. The dosage error is 2% due to the mutual compensation of the direction-isotropic reconstruction errors of the needles the number of which is between seven and nine.
