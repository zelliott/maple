In full-parallax three-dimensional (3-D) imaging systems, the pixel cells often have the shape of a rhombus. Proper arrangement of pixels in these rhombic-shaped cells is important to maximize the quality of displayable 3-D images with a given display panel. The possible number of pixel arrangements in a rhombic cell with a definite dimension is found by considering the number of possible crossings between parallel line families forming the pixel cells, when the slopes of the lines are approximated by the ratio between the number of pixels in the vertical and horizontal directions. To make the rhombic cell have a uniquely defined pixel arrangement, its horizontal and vertical dimensions should be equal to the even multiple of the pixel dimension in their corresponding direction.
