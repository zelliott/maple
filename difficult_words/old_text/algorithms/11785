Over the last decade non-operative management of children with blunt abdominal trauma has been established as safe and efficacious.

This paper reviews the clinical management and resource utilization patterns in a pediatric trauma center in the mid-Atlantic region. It focuses on the following issues admission to the intensive care unit, safe interval for activity restriction, pre and post imaging with CT, rate of laparotomy and transfusion requirements of children with blunt abdominal trauma. Nursing care and medical management from the initial evaluation through discharge are discussed.

Management of blunt abdominal injury in children was restructured using an algorithm suggested by the American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) trauma committee to coordinate care at a regional trauma center.

Results indicated a decrease in LOS from 6 days to 4 days, and a 20% reduction in total costs.
