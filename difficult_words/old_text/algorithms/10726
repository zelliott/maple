Evaluation of molar dental restorations on enamel is performed using optical coherence tomography (OCT) with 10 microm resolution. Images of approximately 50 microm failure gaps in the restorations are demonstrated and the OCT images are compared with x-ray and optical microscopy pictures. The results demonstrate the potential of the technique for clinical evaluation of dental restorations.
