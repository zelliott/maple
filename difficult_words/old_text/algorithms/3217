We study a selective light scattering elimination procedure in the case of highly scattering rough surfaces. Contrary to the case of low scattering levels, the elimination parameters are shown to depend on the sample microstructure and to present rapid variations with the scattering angle. On the other hand, when the slope of the surface is moderated, we show that this parameters present smoother variations and little dependence to the microstructure, even when the roughness is high. These results allow an important selective reduction of the scattered light, with a basic experimental mounting and an analytical determination of the elimination parameters. Such selective scattering reduction is demonstrated by simulations and experiments and applied to the imaging of an object situated under a highly rough surface.
