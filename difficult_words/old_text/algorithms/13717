The results of a study evaluating the appropriateness of drug and defibrillation therapy given during cardiac arrest at two hospitals are reported. A retrospective study was performed to evaluate and compare the appropriateness of therapy given during adult cardiac arrest at a large teaching hospital (hospital 1) and at a smaller nonteaching hospital (hospital 2) as measured by conformance to advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) guidelines and by less stringent alternative criteria based on published data and clinical judgment. Patients included in the study were older than 18 years and had experienced at least one of five types of cardiac arrest: ventricular fibrillation, asystole, ventricular tachycardia, electromechanical dissociation, or bradycardia. The type of drug administered, the drug dosage, and the timing of dosages were evaluated, as were the timing of defibrillation attempts and the energy used for such attempts. Treatment decisions were considered inappropriate if they did not conform to standard (ACLS) or alternative criteria. In hospital 1, there were 1137 assessable decisions recorded for 75 cardiac arrests; of these, 205 (18%) were inappropriate according to standard criteria, and 96 (8.4%) were inappropriate according to alternative criteria. In hospital 2, there were 827 assessable decisions recorded for 57 cardiac arrests; of these, 173 (21%) were inappropriate according to standard criteria, and 98 (11.2%) were inappropriate according to alternative criteria. Inappropriate therapy during cardiac arrest occurred with a similar frequency in a large teaching hospital and in a smaller, nonteaching hospital. The number of inappropriate treatments was smaller when more liberal standards of therapy were used.
