Recently, numerous concealed information test (CIT) studies have been done with event related potential (ERP) for its sufficient validity in applied use. In this study, a new approach based on wavelet coefficients (WCs) and kernel learning algorithm is proposed to identify concealed information. Totally 16 subjects went through the designed CIT paradigm and the multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded. Then, the high-dimensional WCs of ERP in delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms were extracted. For the analysis of the data, kernel principle component analysis (KPCA) and a support vector machines (SVM) classifier are implemented. The results show that WCs features are significant differences between concealed information and irrelevant information (P < 0.05). The KPCA is able to effectively reduce feature dimensionalities and increase generalization performance of SVM. A high accuracy (93.6%) in recognizing concealed information and irrelevant information is achieved, which indicates the combination KPCA and SVM may provide a useful tool for detecting the concealed information.
