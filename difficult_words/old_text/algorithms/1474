Among diseases causing pilot disqualification ahead of time the cardiovascular disorders amount to 60 percent. In this connection there has been generalized the experience of examining the Armed Forces Aviation pilots with cardiovascular disorders beginning from 1979 when by the order of the Ministry of Defence N 220 the Regulations of Aeromedical Examination of pilots have been come into force. The features of examining the pilots with cardiovascular disorders are presented. The present-day methods for the instrumental examination which have been tested in cardiology are systematized in an effort to use them during aeromedical examinations of the pilots. The algorithm of the examined pilots with cardiovascular disorders is set. For the first time the three main groups of approaches to the appraisal of partial or complete loss of the work capacity with known result of diseases. The proposed organization-and-methodologic approach to medical examination of the flying personnel with consideration for the features of stage diagnostics of cardiovascular disorders, individual assessment of their manifestations enables one to handle more qualitatively the aeromedical examination issues with the aim of maintaining the professional working capacity.
