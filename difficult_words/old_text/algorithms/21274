Transient myocardial ischemia is more frequently silent than accompanied by angina. The frequency of ischemia varies markedly from day to day, so that in order to accurately define the total ischemic burden, it may be necessary to quantitate ischemic episodes for periods longer than 24 hours. Therefore, a programmable, digital device was developed for long-term, interactive, ambulatory monitoring of the electrocardiogram, which uses variations in a time-averaged ST level as an indicator of myocardial ischemia. The electrocardiographic signal is digitized at 256 Hz and analyzed by an algorithm. If ST depression is planar or downsloping and persists for more than 40 seconds, and if the ST depression is equal to or more than a user-programmed threshold, the device marks the onset of an ischemic event and times it. The algorithm has been validated by comparison of its analysis of the ST segment to human and computerized analyses of frequency-modulated Holter recordings and stress tests. To assess the feasibility and utility of long-term monitoring, patients with documented coronary artery disease were monitored continuously for 14-day periods. Of 26 patients enrolled, 8 completed a protocol for individualization of anti-ischemic therapy using transdermal nitroglycerin. Over 90% of ischemic episodes in this group of patients, all of whom had had a previous myocardial infarction, were silent. Treatment with 10 mg of transdermal nitroglycerin reduced the number of ischemic episodes by 59% and the duration of ischemia by 60% (p less than 0.001); there was no diminution in the effectiveness of treatment from week 1 to week 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
