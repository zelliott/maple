Cardiac deformation imaging is being used more and more routinely in resting echocardiography. The technique can also be applied to stress studies, and may provide additional information to that obtained by standard analysis alone. This review explores its present role, limitations, and potential uses. Although currently not widely used in stress studies, deformation imaging has the capability to provide clinically useful information.
