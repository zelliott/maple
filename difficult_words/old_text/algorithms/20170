A pigment network is one of the most important dermoscopic structures. This paper describes an automatic system that performs its detection in dermoscopy images. The proposed system involves a set of sequential steps. First, a preprocessing algorithm is applied to the dermoscopy image. Then, a bank of directional filters and a connected component analysis are used in order to detect the "lines" of the pigment network. Finally, features are extracted from the detected network and used to train an AdaBoost algorithm to classify each lesion regarding the presence of the pigment network. The algorithm was tested on a dataset of 200 medically annotated images from the database of Hospital Pedro Hispano (Matosinhos), achieving a sensitivity = 91.1% and a specificity = 82.1%.
