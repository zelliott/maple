This paper introduces an automatic robust nonlinear identification algorithm using the leave-one-out test score also known as the PRESS (Predicted REsidual Sums of Squares) statistic and regularised orthogonal least squares. The proposed algorithm aims to achieve maximised model robustness via two effective and complementary approaches, parameter regularisation via ridge regression and model optimal generalisation structure selection. The major contributions are to derive the PRESS error in a regularised orthogonal weight model, develop an efficient recursive computation formula for PRESS errors in the regularised orthogonal least squares forward regression framework and hence construct a model with a good generalisation property. Based on the properties of the PRESS statistic the proposed algorithm can achieve a fully automated model construction procedure without resort to any other validation data set for model evaluation.
