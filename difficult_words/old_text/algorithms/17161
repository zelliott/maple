Blackman et al. [1994] describe an experiment that purports to show that weak 45 Hz magnetic fields inhibit the growth of neurites from PC-12 cells treated with a growth stimulation factor. I present a statistical analysis of the data in that paper that shows that the data were corrupted in some way; hence, the results are invalid.
