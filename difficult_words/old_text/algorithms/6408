The incidence of anastomotic leakage in colorectal surgery is 1% to 12%. Every deviation from the normal postoperative course must raise suspicion of a leak. Diagnosis is made radiologically by rectal enema or CT. Limited leakages without clinical signs can be treated conservatively by wait-and-see. Larger anastomotic failure with intra-abdominal abscesses or peritonitis requires reanastomosis in combination with a diverting loop ileostomy or colostomy. A Hartmann procedure with open abdominal management may be indicated in severely ill patients with feculent peritonitis. In the pelvis, even large leaks may heal spontaneously when stool passage is diminished by a proximal diverting enterostomy. There is no benefit of primary loop enterostomies concerning the incidence of anastomotic leaks; however, they reduce the number of operative revisions due to anastomotic failure. Therefore they are proposed in risk patients and intraoperatively difficult anastomoses.
