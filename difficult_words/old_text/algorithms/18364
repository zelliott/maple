In this paper our main purpose is to give molecular solutions for the subset-sum problem. In order to achieve this, we propose a DNA-based algorithm of an n-bit parallel adder and a DNA-based algorithm of an n-bit parallel comparator to formally verify our designed molecular solutions for the subset-sum problem.
