The population pharmacokinetics of desmopressin in children with nocturnal enuresis and in healthy adults were compared using a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination. In addition, the model consisted of a number of transit compartments before absorption to describe a lag-time. The model gave an adequate description of adult as well as children data and provided a statistically significant better fit to data than a standard lag-time model. The main difference in the pharmacokinetics between children and adults was the absorption delay. The pharmacokinetic difference was minor and presumably of no clinical relevance.
