From experimental data on the hydration energetics of nucleic acids obtained by differential scanning calorimetry under isothermal conditions, dielectric relaxation time tau d and "free volume" Vf occupied by water molecules in hydration shells of natural DNA and model polyribonucleotides were calculated. In addition, systems consisting of dinucleotides ApA, TpT, UpU, TpU, UpT and water clusters of various sizes (from 20 to 400 water molecules) were studied by Monte Carlo computer simulation. It was shown that, as water content in systems increases, the dynamic characteristics of bound water obtained with both methods approached the values for bulk water.
