Determination of the relative gene order on chromosomes is of critical importance in the construction of human gene maps. In this paper we develop a sequential algorithm for gene ordering. We start by comparing three sequential procedures to order three genes on the basis of Bayesian posterior probabilities, maximum-likelihood ratio, and minimal recombinant class. In the second part of the paper we extend sequential procedure based on the posterior probabilities to the general case of g genes. We present a theorem that states that the predicted average probability of committing a decision error, associated with a Bayesian sequential procedure that accepts the hypothesis of a gene-order configuration with posterior probability equal to or greater than pi *, is smaller than 1 - pi *. This theorem holds irrespective of the number of genes, the genetic model, and the source of genetic information. The theorem is an extension of a classical result of Wald, concerning the sum of the actual and the nominal error probabilities in the sequential probability ratio test of two hypotheses. A stepwise strategy for ordering a large number of genes, with control over the decision-error probabilities, is discussed. An asymptotic approximation is provided, which facilitates the calculations with existing computer software for gene mapping, of the posterior probabilities of an order and the error probabilities. We illustrate with some simulations that the stepwise ordering is an efficient procedure.
