Approximately 20% of pregnant women harbor group B streptococcus (GBS) in the lower genital tract at the time of delivery. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis of mothers with GBS colonization who have risk factors for neonatal GBS at delivery improves the outcome of the neonates. The recommendations for treating newborn infants of mothers who receive intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for GBS colonization and the recommendations for those who do not remain empiric, because clinical studies to support such recommendations are not available. An algorithm for treatment of neonates born to mothers with GBS colonization that is based on available data and empiric recommendations is presented. These guidelines are intended to guide medical practice and not to replace clinical judgment.
