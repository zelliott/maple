An ideal hearing aid for a peripheral hearing loss would process the incoming signal in order to give a perfect match between the cochlear outputs of the impaired ear and a reference normal ear. As a first step toward this objective, a model of the normal and impaired peripheral auditory system was used to derive the optimal hearing-aid processing filter based on a minimum mean-squared error criterion. The auditory model includes the compression and suppression effects of the cochlear mechanics and the sensitivity of the neural transduction process. Simplifying assumptions were then incorporated into the processing to yield a practical frequency-dependent adaptive gain system. Processing examples of several individual speech sounds are presented for a flat hearing loss, and the results indicate that a three-channel compression system with adjustable gains and band edges will be close to the optimal solution for this case.
