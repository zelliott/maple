A necessary initial step for the application of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) as an analytical probe for structural investigations of membrane proteins in solution is the precise knowledge of the structure of spontaneously formed detergent assemblies around the protein. Following our recent article (Berthaud et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 10080-10088) on the study of the n-dodecyl Î²-D-maltopyranoside (dDM) corona surrounding Aquaporin-0 tetramers in solution, we aimed at the development of more elaborate models, exploiting the information content of the scattering data. Two additional approaches are developed here for the fit of SAXS experimental data, one based on a generalized ab initio algorithm for the construction of a coarse-grained representation of the detergent assemblies, and a second based on atomistic molecular dynamics. Accordingly, we are able to fit the SAXS experimental data and obtain a better insight concerning the structure of the detergent corona around the hydrophobic part of the Aquaporin-0 surface. The present analysis scheme represents an additional step toward future conformational studies of transmembrane proteins in solution.
