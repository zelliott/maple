To provide a review of the latest evidence on the management of anterior urethral strictures.

A continuing role exists for urethrotomy or dilatation in the management of urethral strictures as first-line therapy in selected patients. In those patients with bulbar strictures who fail or are not suitable for these procedures, an anastomotic urethroplasty, and if not feasible a substitution urethroplasty using either a flap or oral mucosal graft either by a dorsal, lateral or ventral onlay approach should be considered. For penile strictures, a ventral onlay procedure using skin can be considered except in cases of lichen sclerosis when an onlay procedure utilizing oral mucosa provides the best results using either a one-stage or two-stage approach.

Various options exist for the management of anterior urethral stricture disease. The 'reconstructive ladder' has served to guide urologists over the years. The selection of the correct procedure should be patient-centred and based on the latest evidence.
