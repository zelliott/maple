The treatment of acquired haemophilia is characteristically exceedingly expensive and thus a cost-benefit analysis of the several available treatment strategies is urgently needed. To address this issue, decision-analysis techniques were used to construct a cost-minimization model to compare the cost of treatment with porcine factor VIII (pFVIII), human FVIII (hFVIII) or an activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC). This model was based upon the results of a comprehensive literature search of all relevant clinical studies and case series. To supplement these data, a panel of haemophilia specialists was presented with a clinical scenario describing an acquired haemophilia patient with an acute haemorrhage in whom the human and porcine inhibitor titres were initially unknown. Based on this scenario and on their own clinical experience, the expert panel assessed the applicability of the model as initially constructed, assigned probabilities of success to each treatment and recommended appropriate initial dosing and follow-up regimens. This information was incorporated into the model and a simulation was conducted from which the costs of care were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were then conducted on all parameters. The results of the model show that treatment initiated with pFVIII would be more cost effective compared with treatment sequences initiated with an APCC or hFVIII, respectively. The model indicates that initial treatment with pFVIII in this scenario may be the preferred strategy clinically, as well as on economic grounds.
