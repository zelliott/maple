Electrical Impedance Computerized Tomography (EICT) is an imaging method to reconstruct the impedance distribution inside of domain through the boundary injected current and display the impedance contrast ratio as an image. This paper concentrates on developing two algorithms to enhance the quality of the conductivity image. The two algorithms are "Fine-Mesh Conversion Method" and "Sub-Domain EICT Method". "Fine-Mesh Conversion Method" is a numerical calibration process to find a coarse mesh impedance network that behaves like a fine mesh network in terms of giving similar voltages under the same current excitations. "Sub-Domain EICT" solves a higher resolution EICT with the cost of a lower resolution EICT by combining "Fine-Mesh Conversion Method", and a Fuzzy Logic Inference Systems (FLIS) classifier.
