This work evaluates the vectorcardiographic dynamic changes in ischemic patients before and during Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA).

Four QRS-loop parameters were computed in 51 ischemic and 52 healthy subjects with the objective of assessing the vectorcardiographic differences between both groups: maximum vector magnitude (QRS(mVM)), planar area (QRS(PA)), maximum distance between centroid and loop (QRS(mDCL)) and perimeter (QRS(P)).The conventional ST-change vector magnitude (STC(VM)), QRS-vector difference (QRS(VD)) and spatial ventricular gradient (SVG) were also calculated.

Statistical minute-by-minute PTCA comparison against a healthy population showed that ischemic patients monitoring is greatly enhanced when all the QRS-loop parameters, in combination with the standard STC(VM), QRS(VD) and SVG indexes, are used in the classification. Sensitivity and Specificity, in turn, reached rather high values, 95.4% and 95.2%, respectively.

These new vectorcardiographic set of complementary QRS-loop parameters, when combined with the classics STC(VM), QRS(VD) and SVG indexes, increase sensitivity and specificity for acute ischemia monitoring.
