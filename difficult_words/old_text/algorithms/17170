Firing properties of single sudomotor axons were studied via tungsten microelectrodes inserted percutaneously into cutaneous fascicles of the peroneal nerve in awake subjects. Sweating was induced by radiant heat and measured by changes in skin electrical resistance within the innervation territory on the dorsum of the foot. Eight units were classified as sudomotor neurones because spike-triggered averaging revealed a time-locked relationship between the unitary discharge and the subsequent decrease in skin resistance (1.12 +/- 0.05 s), but no relationship to skin blood flow (measured by a laser-doppler probe). Sudomotor units usually fired only one (maximum six) spike(s) in a sympathetic burst. The mean firing rate was 0.62 Hz, but instantaneous frequencies above 50 Hz could be generated. R-wave triggered histograms and coherence analysis revealed significant coupling between the firing of three sudomotor neurones and the ECG. Moreover, the firing of four sudomotor neurones showed a weak but significant correlation with the spontaneous fluctuations in cardiac interval, diastolic pressure, or the rate of fall in arterial pressure. We conclude that the discharge of human sudomotor neurones is modulated by baroreceptor input.
