Schemes such as phase-modulated Lee-Goldburg (PMLG) for homonuclear dipolar decoupling have been shown to yield high-resolution (1)H spectra at high magic-angle spinning (MAS) frequencies of 50-70kHz. This is at variance to the commonly held notion that these methods require MAS frequencies not comparable to the cycle frequencies of the pulse schemes. Here, a theoretical argument, based on bimodal Floquet theory, is presented to explain this aspect together with conditions where PMLG type of schemes may be successful at high MAS frequencies.
