Ventricular assist devices (VAD) have benefitted patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx). We present our experience with HTx after an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) hybrid with various ventricular assist devices (VAD). From May 1996 to December 2003, mechanical circulatory support with a Biopump VAD was performed in eight patients, HeartMate left VAD in eight patients, and Thoratec VAD in eight patients. Before VAD implantation, 19 patients maintained their circulation with ECMO. Half of the 24 patients were implanted with VAD to await a suitable donor for HTx. We observed that half of the patients supported by ECMO hybrid with various VAD awaited a suitable donor for HTx. In our experience, we recommend the application of ECMO for short-term support within 1 week and the Biopump VAD, Thoractec VAD, or HeartMate VAD for medium-term or long-term support as a bridge to HTx.
