Although synchronously oscillating neuronal assemblies have been the subject of many studies, a clear identification of the spatiotemporal characteristics of a medium-range oscillatory network is still lacking. Herein, we present a method for the extraction of a new waveform, namely the mean induced potential (IP), which allows the identification of the spatiotemporal characteristics of induced EEG responses. The IP calculation was applied to the 20-Hz component of the sensorimotor rhythm in order to obtain a 20-Hz sensorimotor induced potential (20-Hz SIP). The spatiotemporal characteristics of the 20-Hz bursts seen after median nerve stimulation and self-paced finger movements were extracted by means of current source density reconstruction and synchronization analysis. A cortical network including the controlateral primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the controlateral supramarginalis gyrus was found to generate the 20-Hz bursts, and the various activated areas were found to be highly synchronized. Our results demonstrate for the first time the existence of a medium-range cortical network in the human sensorimotor region whose constituents oscillate synchronously.
