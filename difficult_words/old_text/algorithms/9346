This paper reviews the recent developments in the area of MEMS-based probe recording technology. Various state-of-the-art scanning probe microscope (SPM) based techniques are briefly introduced, followed by the description of system approaches of MEMS-based probe recording technology and the basic MEMS-based actuation mechanism. Subsequently, current research status in developing MEMS-based probe recording technology with emphasis on storage architecture, MEMS access systems, probe recording mechanisms, and media for terabit per square inch recording density, is reviewed. Lastly, potential research topics and prospects for MEMS-based probe recording technology development are discussed.
