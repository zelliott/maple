The goal of modern antirheumatic therapy is to achieve an optimized disease control. This is individually achieved by an intensified immunosuppression (IS) frequently combining different immunosuppressive agents. Intensified IS should be accompanied by a standardized protocol to monitor immunological changes in the patient. This should include checklists (see Part 1 Screening during intensified IS in children and adolescents). An individual risk stratification according to the planned IS allows a prediction of infectious disease risks for the patient and, thus, individual infection prophylaxis. In addition, standardized management of patients with fever while receiving intensified IS may prevent further complications.
