Multitoning is the representation of digital pictures using a given set of available color intensities, which are also known as tones or quantization levels. It can be viewed as the generalization of halftoning, where only two such quantization levels are available. Its main application is for printing and, similar to halftoning, can be applied to both colored and grayscale images. In this paper, we present a method to produce multitones based on the multiscale error diffusion technique. Key characteristics of this technique are: 1) the use of an image quadtree; 2) the quantization order of the pixels being determined through "maximum intensity guidance" on the image quadtree; and 3) noncausal error diffusion. Special care has been given to the problem of banding, which is one of the inherent limitations in error diffusion when applied to multitoning. Banding is evident in areas of the image with values close to one of the available quantization levels; our approach is to apply a preprocessing step to alleviate part of the problem. Our results are evaluated both in terms of visual appearance and using a set of standard metrics, with the latter demonstrating the blue-noise characteristics and very low anisotropy of the proposed method.
