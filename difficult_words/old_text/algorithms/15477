The consequences of myocardial ischemia are examined from the standpoint of the neural control system of the heart, a hierarchy of three neuronal centers residing in central command, intrathoracic ganglia, and intrinsic cardiac ganglia. The basis of the investigation is the premise that while this hierarchical control system has evolved to deal with "normal" physiological circumstances, its response in the event of myocardial ischemia is unpredictable because the singular circumstances of this event are as yet not part of its evolutionary repertoire. The results indicate that the harmonious relationship between the three levels of control breaks down, because of a conflict between the priorities that they have evolved to deal with. Essentially, while the main priority in central command is blood demand, the priority at the intrathoracic and cardiac levels is heart rate. As a result of this breakdown, heart rate becomes less predictable and therefore less reliable as a diagnostic guide as to the traumatic state of the heart, which it is commonly used as such following an ischemic event. On the basis of these results it is proposed that under the singular conditions of myocardial ischemia a determination of neural control indexes in addition to cardiovascular indexes has the potential of enhancing clinical outcome.
