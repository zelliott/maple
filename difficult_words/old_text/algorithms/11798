This paper describes the development of the combined tumor therapeutic equipment based on the theory of 1 + 1 = 3 or 1 + 1 > 3 tumor combined treatment synergism. It has become a promising and valuable method dealing with cancer tumors for its good adaptability, better effectiveness and convenience. The therapeutic equipment is combined with PC and MS windows operation system, and adopts intellectual temperature control device, which realizes homogeneous and smooth heating to intracavity tumor focus and automatic processing and statistical management of all case data. The equipment works stably and is of great value in clinical applications.
