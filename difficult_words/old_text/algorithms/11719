The experimental setup was designed to study the effect of natural charging of droplets during spraying (called spray electrification or spray charging) in a wet scrubber. The influence of nozzle material, liquid feed rate, and liquid composition on the specific charge (charge per unit volume of liquid) formed in spraying was measured. It was found that the nozzle material has no measurable effect on this specific charge. Increasing the liquid feed rate increases the specific charge significantly. Increasing solute (NaCl or NaOH) concentration increases the conductivity that decreases the formed specific charge. The same correlation between the specific charge and conductivity was also observed with real scrubbing liquids. It is proposed that the specific charge depends only on the value of liquid conductivity, not on liquid composition. The conductivity of the tested scrubbing liquids was high enough to suppress the formation of a high specific charge during spraying.
