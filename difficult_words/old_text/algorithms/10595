"Venous disease consists of a spectrum with significant medical and economic morbidities. For lack of exposure, however, it is a poorly understood subject. The evaluation and approach to diagnosing venous disease requires a firm understanding of venous anatomy and pathophysiology. With a targeted history and physical, and noninvasive testing, venous disease may be evaluated comprehensively."
