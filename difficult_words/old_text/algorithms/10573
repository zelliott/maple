Limits of applicability of classical diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) are essentially extended. DWS is adapted to the case of small number of scattering events. An explicit formula for correlation function of intensity fluctuations of scattered light is derived. Potentials of DWS for diagnostics of random microflow are demonstrated.
