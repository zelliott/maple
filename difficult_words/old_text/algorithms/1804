Surgery is part of the therapeutic strategy of aspergillosis and mucormycosis. The aspergilloma is defined as a rounded mass, developing in a cavity by the proliferation of spores of Aspergillus. The most common complication was haemoptysis reported in 50-95% of cases. The pleuropulmonary lesions predisposing are: tuberculosis, residual pleural space, emphysema and lung destroyed by fibrosis or radiotherapy or bronchiectasis. The indications for surgery depend on symptoms, respiratory function, the parenchyma and the type of aspergilloma (simple or complex). In a patient with an intrapulmonary aspergilloma, lung resection preceded by embolization is recommended based on respiratory function. For intrapleural aspergilloma, thoracoplasty is recommended according to the patient's general condition. The invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is characterized by an invasion of lung tissue and blood vessels by hyphae in immunocompromised patients. The death rate of patients who have an API after treatment for leukemia or lymphoma was 30 to 40%, after bone marrow transplantation 60%, after solid organ transplantation from 50 to 60% and after any other cause of immunocompromising from 70 to 85%. The main cause of these deaths is massive hemoptysis. Surgery (lobectomy) is indicated for the prevention of hemoptysis when the mass is in contact with the pulmonary artery or one of its branches, and if it increases in size with the disappearance of border security between the mass and the vessel wall. The patient will be operated in an emergency before the white blood cells do not exceed the threshold of 1000 cells/Î¼l. A persistent residual mass after antifungal treatment may justify a lung resection (lobectomy or wedge) before a new aggressive therapy. Mucormycosis affects patients following immunocompromising states--haematologic malignancy, diabetes mellitus, transplantation, burns and malnutrition. The treatment of pulmonary mucormycosis combines surgical and medical approach.
