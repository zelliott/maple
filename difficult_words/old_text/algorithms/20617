Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is an important tool for research in the rehabilitation of lost movements in spinal cord injured patients. However, for NMES to be used outside the laboratory setup, the stimulation controller needs to be able to cope with challenging environmental conditions. A methodology to allow conversion of any specific motor task used to cope with one of these environmental conditions toward a control algorithm for NMES is proposed. The methodology was used in the definition of a stimulation sequence that allows overcoming small obstacles by the spinal cord injured patient. Simulations have proven the method feasibility, and clinical trials have confirmed these findings. Motor task conversion using the kinematic approach has shown better results than that of muscle activity.
