Although lesions of renal osteodystrophy have traditionally been defined by bone turnover, alterations in skeletal mineralization and volume are also prevalent and may contribute to significant morbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The study presented here was undertaken to compare the traditional spectrum of renal osteodystrophy defined by bone turnover to a new classification system that includes T (turnover), M (mineralization), and V (volume) and to determine the value of biochemical parameters as predictors of specific TMV lesions.

Pediatric patients (n = 161) treated with peritoneal dialysis were enrolled into the study.

Increased bone turnover and abnormal mineralization were prevalent (57% and 48%, respectively); bone volume was normal or increased in all subjects. Predictive algorithms for different skeletal diagnoses were established by Classification and regression tree analysis. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) less than 400 pg/ml in combination with alkaline phosphatase values less than 400 IU/L provided the highest correct prediction rate for patients with both normal bone turnover and normal mineralization. Levels of PTH were higher and serum calcium levels were lower in patients with defective mineralization, irrespective of bone turnover.

Although no single biochemical marker is able to provide a complete assessment of renal osteodystrophy, a combination of serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and PTH levels may lead to a more precise noninvasive assessment of turnover and mineralization abnormalities in this population.
