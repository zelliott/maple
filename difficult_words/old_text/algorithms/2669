Mostly, shape-from-focus algorithms use local averaging using a fixed rectangle window to enhance the initial focus volume. In this linear filtering, the window size affects the accuracy of the depth map. A small window is unable to suppress the noise properly, whereas a large window oversmoothes the object shape. Moreover, the use of any window size smoothes focus values uniformly. Consequently, an erroneous depth map is obtained. In this paper, we suggest the use of iterative 3-D anisotropic nonlinear diffusion filtering (ANDF) to enhance the image focus volume. In contrast to linear filtering, ANDF utilizes the local structure of the focus values to suppress the noise while preserving edges. The proposed scheme is tested using image sequences of synthetic and real objects, and results have demonstrated its effectiveness.
