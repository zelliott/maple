Malalignment causes abnormal forces that may lead to loosening after knee replacement. Whether a computer-assisted technique can improve the precision of implant positioning guaranteeing good long-term results in total knee arthroplasty, this is a matter of discussion. The authors evaluate the alignment accuracy of 20 primary total knee arthroplasties, performed using an image-free computer navigation systems, with standardized CT protocol and three-dimensional digital model reconstruction. The results of this study demonstrate that the image-free navigation system is able to improve accuracy in axial limb alignment and positioning of the components in the majority of cases; moreover, the difference between the mean mechanical axis value of the navigation system (179.7° ± 1.7°) and the median mean value obtained during the post-operative evaluation (180.3° ± 1.9°) is not statistically significant (P = 0.28).
