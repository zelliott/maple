Identification of mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 has implications for the molecular epidemiology and for the molecular pathology of human cancer. We have developed and evaluated an arrayed primer extension assay for covering both strands of a region of the coding sequence containing more than 95% of the mutations described so far in TP53. On average, 97.5% of the arrayed TP53 gene sequence can be analyzed from either sense or antisense strands, and 81% from both strands. A patient DNA sample is amplified and annealed to arrayed primers, which then promote DNA polymerase extension reactions with four fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides. The TP53 gene chip spans exons 2-9 plus two introns from both strands. The performance of the assay was evaluated by using freshly extracted genomic DNA, as well as DNA extracted from archival (paraffin-embedded) DNA samples. The arrayed primer extension-based TP53 gene test provides an accurate and efficient tool for DNA sequence analysis of this frequently mutated gene for both research and clinical applications.
