Experimental studies of second harmonic generation (SHG) from electric-field poled PMMA - DR1 system show occurrence of a maximum in diagonal and off diagonal tensor components χ(2)(-2ω;ω,ω) at 15 mol % concentration and a rapid decrease above, with a stabilization. The origin of the observed concentration dependence is studied using the Monte Carlo (MC) modeling. We find that presence of maximum is conditioned by the pre-poling history of the sample, when entanglement of linear dipolar structures takes place. Length of the pre-poling interval is an important kinetic parameter which differentiates between various nonexponential kinetics of build-up of polar phase responsible for strong/weak SHG susceptibility.
