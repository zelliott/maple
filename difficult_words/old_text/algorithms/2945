We show that the spatial synchronization of noise-induced excitations on scale-free networks, mediated through nonlinear chemical coupling, depends vitally on the intensity of additive noise and the coupling strength. In particular, a twofold optimization is needed for achieving maximal spatial synchrony, thus indicating the existence of an optimal noise intensity as well as an optimal coupling strength. On the other hand, the traditional linear coupling via gap junctions, while still requiring a fine-tuning of the noise intensity, does not postulate the existence of an optimal coupling strength since the synchronization increases monotonously with the increasing coupling strength. Presented results reveal inherent differences in optimal spatial synchronization evoked by chemical and electrical coupling, and could hence help to pinpoint their specific roles in networked systems.
