The influence of the ageing process on the low frequency behavior of some electrical parameters of naphazoline hydrochloride solutions at 0.5% and 1% in concentration and of 2% paracetamol syrup, is studied. The impedance measurements were performed, in the range between 200 Hz and 1 MHz, using an impedance analyzer and a cell for liquids with plane parallel electrodes whose separation can be changed by using a set of spacers, provided by the manufacturer, in order to get better control of the influence of electrodes polarization effect. The ageing state was artificially generated by dilution and/or heating separated procedures. The results show that this dielectric technique can be used as a good quality complementary control technique.
