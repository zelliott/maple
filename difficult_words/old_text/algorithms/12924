In vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) has played a more and more important role in biomedical research of small animals. Bioluminescence tomography (BLT) further translates the BLI optical information into three-dimensional bioluminescent source distribution, which could greatly facilitate applications in related studies. Although the diffusion approximation (DA) is one of the most widely-used forward models, higher-order approximations are still needed for in vivo small animal imaging. In this work, as a relatively accurate and higher-order approximation theory, the performance of the simplified spherical harmonics approximation (SPN) in BLT is evaluated detailedly in heterogeneous small animals. In the numerical validations, the SPN based results demonstrate better imaging quality compared with diffusion approximation heterogeneously under various source locations over wide optical domain. Although the evaluation for the effects of the optical property mismatch indicates the sensitivity of SPN is similar with DA model in the source localization, it may offer improved performance with much less artifacts. In what follows, heterogeneous experimental BLT reconstructions using in vivo mouse further evaluate the capability of the higher-order method for practical biomedical applications.
