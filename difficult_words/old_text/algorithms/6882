Although cyclodextrins are increasingly used in soil decontamination, little is known about their effects on soil physicochemical properties. In this work, the surface and pore properties of randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin (RAMEB) and three typical clay minerals were characterized, and the effects of RAMEB concentrations on clay minerals were studied using water vapor adsorption-desorption and mercury intrusion porosimetry techniques. As compared to clay minerals, for pure RAMEB very large surface area and volume of nanometer-size pores (micropores) were determined. Energy of interaction with water vapor, volume of micrometer-size pores (mesopores), and fractal dimensions in both pore size ranges of RAMEB were lower than those of the minerals. When increasing amounts of RAMEB were added to the minerals, the surface area and micropore volume decreased and adsorption energy increased. The volume of mesopores decreased after RAMEB treatments for bentonite and kaolin and increased for illite. As deduced from the fractal dimensions increase, the pore structure of the minerals became more complex with RAMEB addition. The observed changes were in general contrary to these expected when RAMEB and minerals coexist as separate, nonreactive phases and suggested strong interaction of RAMEB with clay minerals.
