Concentrations of natural radionuclides (226)Ra, (232)Th, (40)K and man-made (137)Cs in most important tourist Gran Canaria beaches have been determined using a high-purity Germanium detector to analyse their radiological hazard. Average values of the activity concentrations of (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K were 17.6±1.4, 21.3±1.8 and 480±22 Bq kg(-1), respectively. Observed activity concentration values of (137)Cs were practically negligible from a radiological protection point of view. The results of this paper were compared with others published in the bibliography for beaches and coastal sediments of different countries. The mean external air absorbed dose rate was 43.9±2.8 nGyh(-1), which resulted in an outdoor annual effective dose below the world average. Also, the radium equivalent and the external hazard index were calculated. Results from Gran Canaria beaches showed the low levels of radioactivity, indicating no significant radiological risk related to human activities in the area.
