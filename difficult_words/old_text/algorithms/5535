Digital kymography and vocal fold curve fitting are blended with detailed symmetry analysis of kymograms to provide a comprehensive characterization of the vibratory properties of injured vocal folds.

Vocal fold vibration of 12 excised canine larynges was recorded under uninjured, unilaterally injured, and bilaterally injured conditions. Kymograms were created at 25%, 50%, and 75% of the vocal fold length, and vibratory parameters were compared quantitatively among conditions and were studied with respect to right-left and anterior-posterior symmetries.

Anterior-posterior amplitude asymmetry was found in the bilateral condition. The unilateral condition showed significant right-left amplitude asymmetry, and it showed the lowest right-left phase symmetry among the conditions. In condition comparisons, vertical phase difference did not show significant differences among conditions, whereas amplitudes were significantly different among conditions at all line scan positions and most vocal fold lips. Significant differences in frequency were found among the conditions at all 4 vocal fold lips, with the bilateral condition exhibiting the greatest frequency.

Digital kymography and curve fitting provide detailed information about the vibratory behavior of injured vocal folds. Awareness of vibratory properties associated with vocal fold injury may aid in diagnosis, and the quantitative abilities of digital kymography may allow for objective treatment selection.
