A three-dimensional technique was developed for the quantification of the number and cross-sectional geometry of individual trabeculae oriented along a given direction. As an example application, the number of vertical and horizontal trabeculae and their respective cross-sectional geometry were determined for a set of six vertebral cancellous bone specimens (L3-L4 female vertebral bodies; age range 39-63 years). Three-dimensional optical images at a spatial resolution of 20 microm were obtained using an automated serial milling technique. The thickness distributions were generally right skewed. The mean true thickness for both the vertically and horizontally oriented trabeculae showed a strong relationship with volume fraction (vertical: r2 = 0.86; p < 0.05; horizontal: r2 = 0.80; p < 0.05), and mean trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.) (vertical: r2 = 0.81; p < 0.05; horizontal: r2 = 0.72; p < 0.05). The horizontal trabeculae were greater in number and were thinner than the vertical trabeculae. The coefficient of variation of the intraspecimen vertical trabecular thicknesses ranged from 25% to 42%, and showed a weak, albeit insignificant, positive correlation with volume fraction (r2 = 0.46). The findings demonstrated substantial intraspecimen variations exist in trabecular thickness that are not related to volume fraction. Further studies are recommended to determine the potential role of such intraspecimen variations in architecture on biomechanical properties.
