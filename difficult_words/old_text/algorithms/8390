The synthesis of a novel fluoroionophore, 5-p-[[4-(10',15',20'-triphenyl-5'-porphinato) phenyloxyl]-1-butyloxyl]phenyl-10,15,20-triphenylporphine (DTPP), and its application for preparation of a Hg(II)-sensitive optical fiber chemical sensor are described. The response of the sensor is based on the fluorescence quenching of DTPP by coordination with Hg(II). The porphyrin dimer-based sensor shows a linear response toward Hg(II) in the concentration range 5.2 x 10(-7)-3.1 x 10(-4) mol x L(-1), with a working pH range from 2.4 to 8.0. The sensor shows excellent selectivity for Hg(II) over transition metal cations including Cd(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), Pb(II), Zn(II), and Fe(III). As a sensing agent, the porphyrin dimer shows obviously better fluorescence response characteristics toward Hg(II) compared to porphyrin monomer or metalloporphyrin. The effect of the composition of the sensor membrane was studied, and the experimental conditions were optimized. The sensor has been used for determination of Hg(II) in water samples.
