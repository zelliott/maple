The biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics of 5-phenyl-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione (5PDTT) were investigated in rabbits, after administration as a complex with sulfobutyl-ether-7-beta-cyclodextrin (SBE7-beta-CD) by intravenous and oral routes and as a micronized powder by oral route. 5PDTT had a rapid and large red blood cell partitioning that was not dependent on drug concentration either in vitro or ex vivo. The blood clearance was very high (354 +/- 131 mL/min) suggesting extrahepatic metabolism and/or nonrenal elimination and a significant volume of distribution (67 +/- 76 L). The renal clearance was 0.17% of total clearance. 5-phenyl-1,2-dithiol-3-one (5PDTO) was identified as a metabolite in blood and urine. The bioavailability of 5PDTT following administration of 5PDTT/SBE7-beta-CD complex was estimated to 41% while it was close to zero when 5PDTT was given as a micronized powder.
