Lateral diffusion on curved biological membranes has been studied theoretically and experimentally. However, how membrane geometries influence the diffusion process remains unclear. Here we show the significance of Gaussian curvature by numerically solving the diffusion equation in a geodesic polar coordinate system with regard to several types of surfaces including elliptic and hyperbolic paraboloids. On surfaces where Gaussian curvature has positive and negative values, diffusion is slower and faster than on the plane, respectively. The deviation from the normal diffusion on the plane tends to get larger as the absolute value of Gaussian curvature increases. Diffusion is anisotropic at a surface region where the normal curvature is anisotropic and Gaussian curvature has nonzero values. The anisotropy can be classified into several types according to whether diffusion is the fastest or the slowest in the principal directions. In the case of diffusion on spheroids, the limited area of a closed surface reduces the diffusion rate so greatly that the slowdown effects of positive values of Gaussian curvature are concealed. Analysis of the diffusion equation suggests that Gaussian curvature causes slowed or accelerated diffusion and anisotropic diffusion in any type of surface. Furthermore, it is discussed the degree to which Gaussian curvature influences diffusive phenomena taking place in real membranes through such effects. These results provide a different image of biological membranes that lateral diffusion of membrane molecules is usually anisotropic and the diffusion rate kaleidoscopically changes according to place.
