The authors assess the functional potentialities of a mathematical model of transport of labeled colloids in the body. Some additions to and modifications of the model were analyzed. They made it possible to get 4 diagnostically important indices: the rate of colloid excretion from the vascular bed, the rate phagocytosis, RES volume, and the rate of RP accumulation by the liver. Besides, the authors presented the results of a computerized experiment for the determination of maintenance characteristics of a program developed for computer. The iteration algorithm for parameter identification based on a method of linearization of minimized function, was used in the program. They also formulated recommendations for a choice of arbitrary components of a calculation procedure and the use of a method of barrier functions, developed as a result of prolonged maintenance of the program.
