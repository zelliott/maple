Tension gastrothorax is a life-threatening condition and presents dramatically. It develops when the stomach herniates through a diaphragmatic defect into the thorax and distends with gas and/or fluid causing mediastinal shift. It is commonly misdiagnosed as tension pneumothorax which results in significant morbidity and mortality. In this article we report our experience of three cases with a spectrum of aetiology and a comprehensive literature review of tension gastrothorax in children. We propose an algorithm for the management of tension gastrothorax.
