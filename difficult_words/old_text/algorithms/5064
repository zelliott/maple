Ultrasound image has a lot of speckle noise, which brings great difficulties to the feature extraction, recognition and analysis. Especially in the edge extraction, the conventional extraction algorithms are difficult to achieve the desired results because of the speckle noise. To solve this problem, an algorithm based on the anisotropic diffusion equation is presented. The new algorithm combines the robust estimation and considers the characteristic of the speckle noise, so it can suppress the speckle noise effectively and be more robust, thus the edge details of the ultrasound image can be preserved even enhanced, which can provide effective safeguard for the following edge extraction. Furthermore, the paper proposes a new method to compute speckle scale coefficients automatically, which reduces the influence of the human beings, and enhances the stability of the algorithm.
