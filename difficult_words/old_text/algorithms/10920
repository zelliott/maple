Premature ejaculation (PE) is a common male sexual disorder. Normative data suggest that men with an intravaginal ejaculatory latency time of less than 1 min have 'definite' premature ejaculation, while men with intravaginal ejaculatory latency times of between 1 and 1.5 min have 'probable' premature ejaculation. Although there is insufficient empirical evidence to identify the etiology of PE, there is correlational evidence to suggest that men with PE have high levels of sexual anxiety and altered sensitivity of central 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors. Pharmacological modulation of the ejaculatory threshold using daily or on-demand selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors offers patients a high likelihood of achieving improved ejaculatory control within a few days of initiating treatment, leads to improvements in sexual desire and other sexual domains, and is well tolerated.
