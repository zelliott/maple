EML4-ALK fusion gene is found in only a small subset (2-6%) of non-small cell lung cancer. There is an urgent need to establish a rational diagnostic algorithm to identify this rare but important fusion in lung cancer.

We performed a comprehensive analysis of EGFR/KRAS mutation and ALK rearrangement in a total of 360 surgically resected lung cancers. ALK rearrangement was examined by 3 analyses: multiplex reverse transcription-PCR, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with the intercalated antibody-enhanced polymer method. A scoring system was used for IHC (iScore). A test set (202 patients with unselected lung cancer) was used for proposing a diagnostic algorithm. This diagnostic algorithm was validated in 158 patients with EGFR and KRAS mutation-negative adenocarcinoma.

ALK rearrangement was identified in 2 patients (1.0%) from the test set and both adenocarcinomas were negative for EGFR and KRAS mutations. The results of FISH and RT-PCR were completely matched. The highest iScore 3 was found only in the 2 positive cases. A diagnostic algorithm was proposed: IHC screening for ALK rearrangement followed by confirmatory FISH. In the validation set, 8 cases (5.1%) had iScore 3 and were positive for FISH, while the other cases had iScore 0 and were negative for FISH.

Screening for ALK rearrangement by IHC followed by confirmatory FISH is a rational diagnostic algorithm. If needed, patients may be selected for screening ALK rearrangement by their EGFR and KRAS mutation status.
