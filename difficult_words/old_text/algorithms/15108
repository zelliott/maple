Solubilization of nonpolar drugs constitutes one of the most important tasks in parenteral formulations design. This study investigates and assesses the solubility enhancement of Fluasterone by various techniques including cosolvency, micellization, and complexation. Of the solubilizing agents used, the modified beta-cyclodextrins were found to be the most effective. The solubility of Fluasterone is 1.55 x 10(-4) mM, 3.13 mM, and 4.04 mM in water, 20% sulfobutyl ether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBEbetaCD), and 20% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD), respectively.
