To evaluate the screening performance of the 76-Suprathreshold (76-STHR) visual field test to detect eyes with visual field defect (VFD) as measured by Humphrey threshold testing in a population-based setting.

Cross-sectional study.

All 88 subjects who agreed to participate in the pilot phase of the Thessaloniki Eye Study were included. Participants underwent a 76-STHR visual field test followed by a 30-full threshold (30-2 FTHR) test (Humphrey field analyzer). One eye/subject was randomly selected and included in the analysis. Sensitivity and specificity rates of the 76-STHR to detect eyes with VFD by the 30 to 2 FTHR test were calculated.

When eyes with borderline results in the 30 to 2 FTHR test were classified as having a VFD, sensitivity rates of the 76-STHR to detect eyes with VFD by the 30 to 2 FTHR were 85.2%, 77.8%, and 74.1%, whereas specificity rates were 70%, 78%, and 86%, depending on the cutoff used for the 76-STHR.

The 76-STHR test showed high sensitivity and low false-negative results at the "at least one point missed" cutoff level criterion to detect eyes with visual field defect by Humphrey threshold testing in a population-based setting. This criterion should be used when screening in a population-based study setting. By contrast, the 76-STHR would not be the appropriate screening test in a primary care setting with limited resources.
