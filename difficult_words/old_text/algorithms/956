The analysis of the screening stage of follow-up medical technology practice has been carried out. The study tackles the problems of selection of medical programmes of mass periodic medical check-ups, definition of diagnostic informative indices and their biometrology, programme algorithmic control with its preliminary diagnostic decisions, wide use of an individual principle of health status assessment and further organization of check-up flows, building up of technical equipment patterns for prophylactic departments. A two-stage system of technical equipment patterns of prophylactic departments in a city polyclinic is discussed. At the first stage the department should be equipped with compact, cheap, easily transported, safe and simple in operation, high-quality autonomous specialized automated diagnostic complexes. The second stage consists in the development of the data bank formation system proceeding from the examination results within the region assigned to the polyclinic.
