We describe a tool, called aCGH-Smooth, for the automated identification of breakpoints and smoothing of microarray comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) data. aCGH-Smooth is written in visual C++, has a user-friendly interface including a visualization of the results and user-defined parameters adapting the performance of data smoothing and breakpoint recognition. aCGH-Smooth can handle array-CGH data generated by all array-CGH platforms: BAC, PAC, cosmid, cDNA and oligo CGH arrays. The tool has been successfully applied to real-life data.

aCGH-Smooth is free for researchers at academic and non-profit institutions at http://www.few.vu.nl/~vumarray/.
