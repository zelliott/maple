In the estrogen-regulated RANK ligand (RANKL)/RANK/osteoprotegerin (OPG) pathway, estrogen deficiency favors osteoclast maturation, leading to increased bone resorption compared with bone formation. Treatment of low bone mineral density (BMD) should be based on fracture risk, assessed using the WHO Fracture Risk Algorithm (FRAX(R)). Criteria for treatment are 10-year overall fracture risk ≥ 20% or 10-year hip fracture risk ≥ 3%. Vitamin D supplementation at levels higher than those traditionally recommended may be appropriate for healthy menopausal women. Multiple strategies are needed to effectively manage osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.
