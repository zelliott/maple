The decaying part of the kinetic curves of luminol chemiluminescence (0.02 mM) induced by N-chlorphenylalanine is approximated by an exponential dependence, which varies insignificantly as chloramine concentration is changed from 0.2 to 0.7 mM. On the whole, the chemiluminescence of luminol is a result of its oxidation, which occurs in three stages with the formation of two intermediate products. N-Chlorphenylalanine is involved in the process at the initial stage. The reciprocal of the time the luminescence reaches a maximum increases linearly with the growth of N-chlorphenylalanine concentration. According to the calculations using the equations that reflect three stages of luminol conversion in the presence of excess chloramine, the rate constant for the initial stage is about 10(3) l/(mol.min). The rate constant for one stage of the conversion of luminol oxidation product is approximately 0.2 min-1, and the rate constant of the other is severalfold greater. Luminol chemiluminescence induced by low concentrations of N,N-dichlortaurine is more durable. Probably, it is composed of two types of emission one of which slowly decays.
