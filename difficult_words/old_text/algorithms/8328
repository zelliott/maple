A method is presented for the quantitative analysis of delayed cytokinetic effects resulting from the treatment of L1210 cells with 6-thioguanine (TG). By using dual-parameter (DNA/protein) flow cytometry, we could observe the accumulation of late S/G2/M cells with abnormally high green fluorescence (i.e., protein content), indicative of unbalanced growth. The use of mitotic cells from a pseudotetraploid line (HT29) as external markers for both red and green fluorescence facilitated highly reproducible measurement of the mean green fluorescence (GFLmean) of the arrested late S/G2/M population. We found that the dose dependence of the observed GFLmean values followed the same unusual biphasic pattern as did cytotoxicity in this cell line, indicating that this parameter might be a suitable means of predicting TG-induced toxicity in vivo. We propose that the low background expected for this kind of measurement would make it particularly appropriate for the analysis of clinical specimens (e.g., mononuclear bone marrow cells) from leukemic patients receiving thiopurines, to monitor (and, hopefully, predict) their response to treatment.
