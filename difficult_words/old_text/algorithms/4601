The objective of this study is to discover how to maximise the use of health research data without breaching the patient's confidentiality. To achieve this, we have examined available options identified in enhancing information security of health research data. It has been noted that there are gaps in information security for health research data. Our novel approach, searching through encrypted data is discussed in this paper.
