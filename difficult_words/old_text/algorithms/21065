Cryosurgery employs freezing for targeted destruction of undesirable tissues such as cancer. Ice front imaging has made controlled treatment of deep body tumors possible. One promising method, recently explored for this task, is EIT, which recovers images of electrical impedance from measurements made at boundary electrodes. However, since frozen tissue near the ice front survives, ice front imaging is insufficient. Monitoring treatment effect would enable iterative cryosurgery, where extents of ablation and need for further treatment are assessed upon thawing. Since lipid bilayers are strong barriers to low frequency electrical current and cell destruction implies impaired membranes, EIT should be able to detect the desired effect of cryosurgery: cell death. Previous work has tested EIT for ice front imaging with tank studies while others have simulated EIT in detecting cryoablation, but in vivo tests have not been reported in either case. To address this, we report 3D images of differential conductivity throughout the freeze-thaw cycle in a rat liver model in vivo with histological validation, first testing our system for ice front imaging in a gel and for viability imaging post-thaw in a raw potato slice.
