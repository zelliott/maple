In a retrospective study, we compared the results of different surgical therapies in 30 patients who had an early-onset infection after implantation of a hip hemiarthroplasty.

Patients were divided into two groups: In group 1 (n=16, deep infection), we changed the polyethylene inlay as well as the femoral head. In group 2 (n=14, deep infection), an acetabular component was also implanted.

In group 1, successful treatment was achieved in 37.5% of patients 6 months after the last operation, compared with 71.4% in group 2 (p=0.019). All patients were supported with antibiotics. In group 1, three patients died from septic multiorgan failure. Two patients in group 1 and one patient in group 2 received a Girdlestone operation.

These results suggest that aggressive surgical treatment with soft tissue revision, lavage, and implantation of an acetabular component in combination with antibiotics is a useful technique for treating early-onset infection.
