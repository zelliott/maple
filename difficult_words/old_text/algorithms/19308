A major problem in clinical management of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the largely unpredictable response to first-line treatment and the occurrence of relapse after complete initial response, associated with broad cross-resistance to even structurally dissimilar drugs. During tumor development and progression, multiple genic alterations take place that might contribute specifically to the treatment response and eventually impact on disease outcome. One area of intense research is the identification of molecular markers to accurately assess the prognosis of EOC patients and to define innovative therapeutic strategies. A large survey of recent published data indicates the need to revisit traditional molecular markers with respect to their contribution to the assessment of overall survival in selected populations. Furthermore, recent technological developments that enable simultaneous measurement of many parameters ("omic" approaches) hold the promise of identifying new molecular prognostic and predictive markers.
