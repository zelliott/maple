Heart involvement during sarcoidosis is a medical emergency. The review focuses on published data analysis of clinical management and therapy involving a multidisciplinary monitoring of cardiac sarcoidosis.

With the emergence of new modalities, especially MRI and FDG PET scan, cardiac sarcoidosis is most often suspected and confirmed even in atypical cases. Laboratory investigations may help to diagnose and survey. Cardiac sarcoidosis drastically changes functional and vital prognosis. Recent studies define earlier detrimental predictable criteria to underline how beneficial is the combination of immunosuppressive therapy and cardiac treatment to patients. There are no large prospective studies, but case reports and small series support an appropriate therapeutic approach, which includes corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents.

Our review illustrates the importance of looking for cardiac sarcoidosis in all sarcoidosis patients and to propose more specific and sensitive investigations when suspected on clinical and/or electrical signs. It emphasizes the need for more adapted criteria and even more prognostic criteria to choose the best therapeutic option.
