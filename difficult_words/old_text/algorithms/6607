This study compared coronary flow reserve (CFR) estimated by technetium 99m sestamibi imaging with the results obtained with intracoronary Doppler in patients with coronary artery disease. Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of the radionuclide-estimated CFR was also assessed.

Fourteen consecutive patients (mean age, 54 +/- 7 years) with documented coronary artery disease in whom percutaneous coronary intervention was planned underwent dipyridamole (0.74 mg/kg) sestamibi imaging and intracoronary Doppler within 5 days. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was estimated by measurement of first transit counts in the pulmonary artery and myocardial counts from single photon emission computed tomography images. Estimated CFR was expressed as the ratio of stress MBF to rest MBF. In the study vessels, CFR was 1.36 +/- 0.43 as estimated by sestamibi and 1.39 +/- 0.42 by intracoronary Doppler ( P = .69). A significant relationship between CFR estimated by sestamibi and CFR obtained by intracoronary Doppler was observed ( r = 0.85, P < .001). On Bland-Altman analysis, the mean difference between CFR by sestamibi and by Doppler was 0.03 and the intraclass correlation coefficients for intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility were high (all P < .001) for both global and regional CFR.

This study demonstrates a good agreement between CFR estimated by sestamibi imaging and by intracoronary Doppler results and a lack of intraobserver and interobserver variability of this noninvasive approach.
