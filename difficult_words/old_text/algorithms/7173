Veterinary ultrasound has been used in a large number of animal husbandry-related circumstances while many corresponding applications also call for the use of ultrasound in human patients. However, veterinary ultrasound images are affected by speckle, an interference pattern that can reduce the quality and contrast of ultrasound images. In this paper, a filter-based receive-side spatial compounding technique for veterinary ultrasound B-Mode imaging is used to create a compounded veterinary B-Mode image based on multiple looks. In particular, filtering in the lateral direction has been proved to be able to preserve the axial information in the sub-bands and to create decorrelation between sub-bands at the expense of some lateral resolution. A new method was proposed to obtain B-Mode IQ data by special veterinary ultrasonic probe. This approach is tested on 275 in-vivo swine. The effect is accomplished in real-time veterinary ultrasonic imaging with a measurable improvement of SNRe. Meanwhile, the speckle and electronic noise in the compounded image have been greatly reduced and smoothed in the visual result.
