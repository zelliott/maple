A new calibration algorithm (GLAaS) to derive absolute dose maps from images acquired with the Varian PV-aS500 electronic portal imager (based on amorphous silicon detectors) has been developed incorporating the dependence of detector response on primary and transmitted radiation and on field size. Detector calibration and algorithm validation were performed at different depths (10.0, 3.8, 1.5, and 0.8 cm) in solid water to investigate various application possibilities. Calibration data were obtained against ion chamber measurements. Validation experiments were performed on intensity-modulated fields and comparison was carried out against calculated dose maps as well as against film measurements. Split fields were acquired independently and PV-aS500 images were summed offline with the new algorithm allowing complex fields to be verified in conditions most closely resembling clinical conditions. Excellent results were obtained for the 3.8, 1.5, and 0.8 depths on a set of 34 modulated fields including both split and nonsplit fields. Applying the gamma index analysis (with distance to agreement and dose thresholds set to 3 mm and 4%, respectively), only 2.3% of the field area showed gamma > 1 at 1.5 cm depth (8.1%, 3.1%, 2.7% at 10.0, 3.8, and 0.8 and 2.5% with films at 10 cm depth). Tests were also performed to verify GLAaS at gantry angles different from 0 degrees. No statistical differences were obtained for the comparison between split and nonsplit fields and between different gantry angles. Highly significant statistical differences were obtained when comparing independent samples of 240 fields verified either with GLAaS or with film. Fields verified with GLAaS presented a mean area with gamma > 1 of 2.1 +/-1.3% while for film this value was 3.9 +/- 3.4% (p<0.001). Absolute dosimetry proved to be reliable with the PV-aS500 detector with the GLAaS algorithm. The minimal settings at depths of 1.5 or 3.8 cm would allow the use of the detector at any gantry angle without the need for any special fixation tool.
