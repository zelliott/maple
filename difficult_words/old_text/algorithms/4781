The trimodality approach represented by concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection is a highly effective, but potentially toxic therapy for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this review, we discuss the current status of this therapy in patients with mediastinal node-positive (N2) stage III NSCLC or superior sulcus tumor, and present an overview of the principles for optimisation of the risk/benefit. Numerous clinical questions remain, and enrolment of patients into well-designed clinical trials should be encouraged.
