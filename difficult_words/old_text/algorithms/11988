A Bayesian approach to the direct mapping of a quantitative trait locus (QTL), fully utilizing information from multiple linked gene markers, is presented in this paper. The joint posterior distribution (a mixture distribution modeling the linkage between a biallelic QTL and N gene markers) is computationally challenging and invites exploration via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The parameter's complete marginal posterior densities are obtained, allowing a diverse range of inferences. Parameters estimated include the QTL genotype probabilities for the sires and the offspring, the allele frequencies for the QTL, and the position and additive and dominance effects of the QTL. The methodology is applied through simulation to a half-sib design to form an outbred pedigree structure where there is an entire class of missing information. The capacity of the technique to accurately estimate parameters is examined for a range of scenarios.
