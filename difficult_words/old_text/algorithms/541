Enhanced detection of multiple targets such as self-assembled monolayer (SAM) formation, DNA hybridization, and ethanol ambient changes was explored using localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excited by metallic surface nanogratings. The sensitivity enhancement depends on the target as well as the nanostructure with a maximum at 242% over a conventional structure when detecting an 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid SAM with an LSPR structure of 200 nm period. The measured enhancement shows smaller target-dependent variance when detecting various layered biointeractions, while structure-dependent variance was much larger. The result suggests the feasibility of the efficient detection of multiple biointeractions at enhanced sensitivity and extends the applicability of a nanostructured LSPR biosensor for diverse biomolecular events.
