The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of thick maximum intensity projections (MIP) from computed tomography (CT) data sets mimicking projection images from biplane ventriculography for evaluation of left ventricular (LV) parameters.

Fifty-eight patients underwent 64-slice CT. Multiphase images were reconstructed in 10% steps of the RR interval. MIP images (70-mm thickness) of the contrast-enhanced LV in fixed 30 degrees right anterior oblique (RAO)/60 degrees left anterior oblique (LAO) and in adapted short-/long-axis planes were reconstructed. LV parameters were calculated using the area-length method formula. Three-dimensional assessment with semiautomated software served as reference standard.

Use of thick MIP reconstructions had a high intermethod reliability (86-94%) compared with the 3-dimensional approach. Smaller measurement errors were found for thick MIP reconstructions in adapted short-/long-axis planes. A significant projection error (3.0%, P < 0.001) of thick MIP reconstructions was found using fixed 30 degrees RAO/60 degrees LAO compared with adapted short-/long-axis reconstructions.

Thick MIP reconstructions with adapted short-/long-axis planes allow an accurate assessment of LV parameters compared with the established 3-dimensional method.
