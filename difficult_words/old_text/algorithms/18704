Ultrasonic flaw detection has been studied many times in the literature. Schemes based on thresholding after a previous matched filter use to be the best solution, but results obtained with this method are only satisfactory when scattering and attenuation are not considered. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to thresholding detection method. We deal with the usage of different flaw detection methods comparing them with the proposed one. The experiment tries to determinate whether a given ultrasonic signal contains a flaw echo or not. Starting with a set of 24,000 patterns with 750 samples each one, two subsets are defined for the experiments. The first one, the training set, is used to obtain the detection parameters of the different methods, and the second one is used to test the performance of them. The proposed method is based on radial basis functions networks, one of the most powerful neural network techniques. This signal processing technique tries to find the optimal decision criterion. Comparing this method with thresholding based ones, an improvement over 25-30% is obtained, depending on the probability of false alarm. So our new method is a good alternative to flaw detection problem.
