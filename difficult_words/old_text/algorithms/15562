The application of high end ultrasound platforms increases the quality of sonographic images. New software developments like Tissue Harmonic Imaging (THI) have improved the resolution of images and help to better visualize anatomic findings. Photopic-mode uses color-coding to gain contrast.

This investigation compares the use of the Photopic-software in comparison to conventional B-mode. The ultrasound platform Sonoline Elegra was used.

The Photopic-mode revealed in 8 of 40 patients a slight improvement within image quality. However, the use of Photopic-mode did not lead to other diagnostic results.

Ultrasound investigation with Photopic-mode can be a useful supplement to the conventional B-mode-sonographic examination in selected cases by gain in contrasting. A disadvantage of the Photopic-mode is that it cannot be used simultaneously with color Doppler-mode examination.
