The stability of the interface between neural tissue and chronically implanted microelectrodes is very important for obtaining reliable control signals for neuroprosthetic devices. Stability is also crucial for chronic microstimulation of the cerebral cortex. However, changes of the electrode-tissue interface can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. In the present study, intracortical microelectrode arrays were implanted into the pericruciate gyrus of cats and neural activities were recorded on a regular basis for several months. An algorithm based on cluster analysis and interspike interval analysis was developed to sort the extracellular action potentials into single units. We tracked these units based on their waveform and their response to somatic stimulation or stereotypical movements by the cats. Our results indicate that, after implantation, the electrode-tissue interface may change from day-to-day over the first 1-2 weeks, week-to-week for 1-2 months, and become quite stable thereafter. A stability index is proposed to quantify the stability of the electrode-tissue interface. The reasons for the pattern of changes are discussed.
