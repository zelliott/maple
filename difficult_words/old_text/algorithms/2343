Twelve patients (15 hands) with documented scleroderma and chronic nonhealing digital ulcers were followed for their response to nonoperative and operative treatment. The patients were initially managed with nifedipine, biofeedback, digital xylocaine blockade, and silver sulfadiazine topical ointment and cessation of all vasoconstrictive agents. Ulcerations healed in 6 of 15 hands and remained healed at a 2-year follow-up examination. The remaining nine hands in seven patients failed nonoperative treatment and underwent a palmar digital sympathectomy. These chronic digital ulcerations healed within 6 weeks after surgery. After a 26- to 64-month follow-up period, six of the nine hands remained free of all digital ulcerations. Two patients (three hands) had partial recurrence of the ulceration. Digital sympathectomy can be an effective procedure for treating nonhealing digital ulcers in scleroderma patients after nonoperative treatment has failed. Significant vaso-occlusive disease is likely to be present in these patients, as demonstrated by arteriography. Our initial approach is cessation of all vasoconstricting agents, nifedipine biofeedback, and local antibiotic ointment. Wrist blocks with xylocaine and marcaine are offered if these modalities fail. If these methods do not result in healing of the ulcer within 12 weeks, then digital sympathectomy is considered.
