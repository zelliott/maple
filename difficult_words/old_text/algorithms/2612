In this paper a new meta-heuristic approach based on the nature of honey bees mating has been used for the calibration of a real city in the north of Iran named Langarud. This city has a population of nearly 68,000 people and about 43,000 water consumers. Langarud's area is about 900 km(2). The method was used to determine the Hazen-Williams roughness factor of the main pipes of the town and a correction factor for the nodal demands in the main nodes of the network.
