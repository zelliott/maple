This article describes the outcomes of an observation of care in an acute setting undertaken as part of the Royal College of Nursing Clinical Leadership Programme. Positive responses of staff and managers to the findings and a subsequent education programme have ensured that the use of early warning scores, and indeed early interventions, have been implemented with consequent improvements in patient care.
