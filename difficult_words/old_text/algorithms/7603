Study of 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms has been performed to determine the factors of genetic predisposition to essential hypertension. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with subsequent analysis of restriction fragment length, allele specific PCR or real-time PCR was used for genotyping of 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 14 genes in 145 children with essential hypertension and 144 healthy persons with following complex multivariate statistical analysis. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms--MMP9 (C(-1562) --> T) and NOS3 (Glu298 --> Asp)--rs3918242 and rs1799983--were shown to represent the main independent effects with the highest predictive potential (77.1% as indicated by binary logistic regression and 74.6% testing accuracy shown by Multifactorial Dimensionality Reduction). MMP9 (C(-1562 --> T) and NOS3 (Glu298 --> Asp) potentially may be used to create predictive algorithm for determination of predisposition to arterial hypertension in children.
