The disorders of sexual differentiation and maturation are a fascinating study in physiology. The interaction of chromosomes, regulation of transcription, as well as hormone production and action are far from being completely understood. Aberrations anywhere along these systems can cause abnormal sexual development. It is important for the practicing obstetrician and gynecologist to be cognizant of these conditions and include them in differential diagnoses so that removal of dysgenetic gonads is not delayed, inappropriate sexual assignment is not announced, and the treatment of TS or other sexually immature girls is not handled hastily.
