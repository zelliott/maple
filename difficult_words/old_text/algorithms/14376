In modern medicine, DSA is a powerful technique in visualizations of blood vessels of X-ray images. In DSA, the most important way for motion correction is image registration. In this paper, a new approach to the registration is used. It is based on means of template matching according to a combined invariants-based similarity measure and TPS image warping. Furthermore it has been improved through practice. and tests have proved to remove the motion artifacts effectively and rapidly.
