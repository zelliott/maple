Heart failure (HF) is the one cardiovascular disease that is increasing in prevalence in the United States. As the population continues to age, the incidence will certainly be amplified. However, some studies have shown that HF is correctly diagnosed initially in only 50% of affected patients. Despite the use of history, physical examination, echocardiogram, and chest x-ray, the percentage of correct initial diagnosis of HF is low. Recognizing the symptoms of HF decompensations is often problematic because other diagnoses can mimic them. There are two new diagnostic modalities that offer promise in improving HF diagnostic accuracy and identifying early HF decompensations. These diagnostic modalities include tests utilizing impedance cardiography and the B-type natriuretic peptide assay. They have the potential of increasing the accuracy of HF diagnosis and guide pharmacological treatment in the inpatient and outpatient settings. They may also assist in the recognition (or prediction) of acute HF decompensations.
