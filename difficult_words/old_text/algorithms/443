Rendering realistic organic materials is a challenging issue. The human eye is an important part of nonverbal communication which, consequently, requires specific modeling and rendering techniques to enhance the realism of virtual characters. We propose an image-based method for estimating both iris morphology and scattering features in order to generate convincing images of virtual eyes. In this regard, we develop a technique to unrefract iris photographs. We model the morphology of the human iris as an irregular multilayered tissue. We then approximate the scattering features of the captured iris. Finally, we propose a real-time rendering technique based on the subsurface texture mapping representation and introduce a precomputed refraction function as well as a caustic function, which accounts for the light interactions at the corneal interface.
