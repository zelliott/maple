We have calculated the maximum useful bit density that may be achieved by the synergy of bad bit exclusion and advanced (BCH) error correcting codes in prospective crossbar nanoelectronic memories, as a function of defective memory cell fraction. While our calculations are based on a particular ("CMOL") memory topology, with naturally segmented nanowires and an area-distributed nano/CMOS interface, for realistic parameters our results are also applicable to "global" crossbar memories with peripheral interfaces. The results indicate that the crossbar memories with a nano/CMOS pitch ratio close to 1/3 (which is typical for the current, initial stage of the nanoelectronics development) may overcome purely semiconductor memories in useful bit density if the fraction of nanodevice defects (stuck-on-faults) is below approximately 15%, even under rather tough, 30 ns upper bound on the total access time. Moreover, as the technology matures, and the pitch ratio approaches an order of magnitude, the crossbar memories may be far superior to the densest semiconductor memories by providing, e.g., a 1 Tbit/cm2 density even for a plausible defect fraction of 2%. These highly encouraging results are much better than those reported in literature earlier, including our own early work, mostly due to more advanced error correcting codes.
