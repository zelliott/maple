Seizures are the most common neurologic condition encountered in small animal practice and arise from an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms in the brain. Epilepsy refers to recurrent seizures of any cause. Successful management of epilepsy requires knowledge of the pharmacologic properties of available antiepileptic medications, regular patient evaluations to assess response to therapy and monitor for adverse effects, and thorough client education to ensure that goals and expectations of therapy are understood. Recommendations for emergency care of seizures at home should be provided for patients with seizures that are not controlled with maintenance antiepileptic therapy.
