Double enhancement of spontaneous emission due to increased photon density of states at the emission frequency and the small group velocity of light at the excitation frequency was clearly demonstrated by angle-resolved photoluminescence experiments for dielectric multilayers composed of Ta2O5 and SiO2 with oxygen vacancies as light emitters. Theoretical emission profiles given by the weak modulation approximation agreed well with the experimental observations.
