Sarcoidosis is a diffuse granulomatous inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology. Involvement of the nasal sinuses has been reported only rarely.

This multicentre prospective study was undertaken on patients suffering from histologically confirmed sarcoidosis between October 2001 and August 2002. It comprised a questionnaire for nasal symptoms, a nasal endoscopy and a CT scan of the nasal sinuses.

Among the 62 patients enrolled 38 reported at least one nasal sinus symptom. An abnormality of the CT scan was present in 70% of cases. None were specific for sarcoidosis. Rhinoscopy revealed a mucosal lesion in 11 cases. The presence of mucosal nodules on the turbinates was suggestive of sarcoidosis and was proven histologically in 4 cases (6.5%). In these 4 cases there were symptoms of nasal sinus involvement and extensive CT changes.

Involvement of the nasal sinuses is rare in the course of sarcoidosis. Anterior rhinoscopy allows diagnosis before the development of typical lesions and also the taking of guided biopsies.
