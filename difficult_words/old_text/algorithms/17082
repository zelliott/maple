Genetic algorithms methods utilize the same optimization procedures as natural genetic evolution, in which a population is gradually improved by selection. We have developed a genetic algorithm search procedure suitable for use in protein folding simulations. A population of conformations of the polypeptide chain is maintained, and conformations are changed by mutation, in the form of conventional Monte Carlo steps, and crossovers in which parts of the polypeptide chain are interchanged between conformations. For folding on a simple two-dimensional lattice it is found that the genetic algorithm is dramatically superior to conventional Monte Carlo methods.
