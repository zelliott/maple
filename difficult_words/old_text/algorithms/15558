The aim of this study was to evaluate properties of amorphous oligosaccharide ester derivative (OED) microparticles in order to determine drug release mechanisms in the lung. Trehalose OEDs with a wide range of properties were synthesised using conventional methods. The interaction of spray dried amorphous microparticles (2-3 microm) with water was investigated using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and dynamic vapour sorption (DVS). The in vivo performance of insulin/OED microparticles was assessed using a modified Higuchi kinetic model. A modified Hansen solvent parameter approach was used to analyse the interactions with water and in vivo trends. In water or high humidity, OED powders absorb water, lose relaxation energy and crystallise. The delay of the onset of crystallisation depends on the OED and the amount of water present. Crystallisation follows first order Arrhenius kinetics and release of insulin from OED microparticles closely matches the degree of crystallisation. The induction period depends on dispersive interactions between the OED and water while crystallisation is governed by polarity and hydrogen bonding. Drug release from OED microparticles is, therefore, controlled by crystallisation of the matrix on contact with water. The pulmonary environment was found to resemble one of high humidity rather than a liquid medium.
