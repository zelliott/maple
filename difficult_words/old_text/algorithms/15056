To compare the performance of two predictive radiologic models, logistic regression (LR) and neural network (NN), with five different resampling methods.

One hundred sixty-seven patients with proven calvarial lesions as the only known disease were enrolled. Clinical and CT data were used for LR and NN models. Both models were developed with cross-validation, leave-one-out, and three different bootstrap algorithms. The final results of each model were compared with error rate and the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (Az).

The NN obtained statistically higher Az values than LR with cross-validation. The remaining resampling validation methods did not reveal statistically significant differences between LR and NN rules.

The NN classifier performs better than the one based on LR. This advantage is well detected by three-fold cross-validation but remains unnoticed when leave-one-out or bootstrap algorithms are used.
