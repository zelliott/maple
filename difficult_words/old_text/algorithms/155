Being central players in thrombosis and hemostasis, platelets react in manifold and complex ways to extracellular stimuli. Cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions are mandatory for initial adhesion as well as for final development of stable plugs. Primary interfaces for interactions are plasma membrane proteins, of which many have been identified over the past decades in individual studies. However, due to their enucleate structure, platelets are not accessible to large-scale genomic screens and thus a comprehensive inventory of membrane proteins is still missing. For this reason, we here present an advanced proteomic setup for the detailed analysis of enriched platelet plasma membranes and the so far most complete collection of platelet membrane proteins. In summary, 1282 proteins were identified, of which more than half are termed to be of membrane origin. This study provides a brief overview of gene ontology subcellular and functional classification, as well as interaction network analysis. In addition, the mass spectrometric data were used to assemble a first tentative relative quantification of large-scale data on the protein level. We therefore estimate the presented data to be of major interest to the platelet research field and to support rational design of functional studies.
