The hydrogels prepared by free radical copolymerization of acrylamide and itaconic acid were investigated with regard to their composition and crosslinking degree to find materials with satisfactory swelling and drug release properties. Samples were characterized by measuring the swelling behavior and in vitro release of paracetamol as a model drug in aqueous media with different pH values. The two-factor, three-level experimental design and response surface methodology were applied to statistically evaluate the influence of investigated factors.
