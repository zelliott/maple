By adjusting the spatial coherence of a quasi-monochromatic beam, one can control the distance between two volumes of coherence. We propose to use such a beam in a typical scattering experiment and present a method for determining the degree of spatial correlation of a quasi-homogeneous medium by recording the scattered intensity in only one direction.
