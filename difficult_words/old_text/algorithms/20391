The determination of age at death is an important part of physical and forensic anthropology. Because of resistance to decomposition and the simplicity/accuracy ratio, the direct observation of the os pubis by Suchey-Brooks phase analysis is the preferred reference system for determination of age at death. We propose an age-prediction system using a pubic symphysis numerical database obtained from CT x-ray through quantification of age-linked parameters. Our system increases the accuracy of age estimation and at the same time preserves the integrity of the archeological material.
