We propose an image-reconstruction algorithm of parallel phase-shifting digital holography (PPSDH) which is a technique of single-shot phase-shifting interferometry. In the conventional algorithms in PPSDH, the residual 0th-order diffraction wave and the conjugate images cannot be removed completely and a part of space-bandwidth information is discarded. The proposed algorithm can remove these residual images by modifying the calculation of phase-shifting interferometry and by using Fourier transform technique, respectively. Then, several types of complex amplitudes are derived from a recorded hologram according to the directions in which the neighboring pixels used for carrying out the spatial phase-shifting interferometry are aligned. Several distributions are Fourier-transformed and wide space-bandwidth information of the object wave is obtained by selecting the spectrum among the Fourier-transformed images in each region of the spatial frequency domain and synthesizing a Fourier-transformed image from the spectrum.
