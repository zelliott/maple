It is widely accepted that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is activated at the time of action generation in humans. However, the previous functional neuroimaging studies that have supported this hypothesis temporally integrated brain dynamics and therefore could not demonstrate when DLPFC underwent activation relative to the emergence of voluntary behavior. Data that are time-locked to the instant of voluntary action execution do not reveal DLPFC activation at that moment. Rather, activated foci are seen at the frontal poles. We investigated this apparent conundrum through three differentially constrained experiments, utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify those prefrontal areas exhibiting functional change at the moment of spontaneous action execution. We observed profound functional dissociation between anterior and dorsolateral regions, compatible with their involvement at different points during the temporal evolution of action: bilaterally the frontal poles activated at the moment of execution, while simultaneously (and relative to a prior activation state) left DLPFC 'deactivated.'
