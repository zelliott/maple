The subarachnoid space (SAS) lies between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater of the human brain, normally filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a serious complication of neurological disease that can have high mortality and high risk of disability. Computed tomography (CT) head scans are often used for diagnosing SAH which may be difficult when the hemorrhage is small or subtle. A computer-aided diagnosis system from CT images is thus developed to augment image interpretation.

Supervised learning using the probability of distance features of several landmarks was employed to recognize SAS. For each CT image, the SAS was approximated in four steps: (1) Landmarks including brain boundary, midsagittal plane (MSP), anterior and posterior intersection points of brain boundary with the MSP, and superior point of the brain were extracted. (2) Distances to all the landmarks were calculated for every pixel in the CT image, and combined to construct a high-dimensional feature vector. (3) Using head CT images with manually delineated SAS as training dataset, the prior probabilities of distances for pixels within SAS and non-SAS were computed. (4) Any pixel of a head CT scan in the testing dataset was classified as an SAS or non-SAS pixel in a Bayesian decision framework based on its distance features.

The proposed method was validated on clinical head CT images by comparison with manual segmentation. The results showed that the automated method is consistent with the gold standard. Compared with elastic registration based on grayscale information, the proposed method was less affected by grayscale variation between normal controls and patients. Compared with manual delineation, the average spatial overlap, relative overlap, and similarity index were, respectively, 89, 63, and 76% for the automatic SAS approximation of the 69 head CT scans tested. The proposed method was tested for SAH detection and yielded a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92%.

Automated SAH detection with high sensitivity was shown feasible in a prototype computer-aided diagnosis system. The proposed method may be extended for computer-aided diagnosis of several CSF-related diseases relevant to SAS abnormalities.
