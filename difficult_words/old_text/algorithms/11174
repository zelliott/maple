To validate a new index, the surface-length index (SLI) based on area change in a short-axis view and length reduction in the horizontal long-axis view, which is used to quickly (<1 min) detect right ventricles with an abnormal ejection fraction (EF) during a cardiac MRI examination. SLI can be used to avoid a complete delineation of the endocardial contours of normal right ventricles.

Sixty patients (group A) were retrospectively included to calibrate the SLI formula by optimisation of the area under the ROC curves and SLI thresholds were chosen to obtain 100 % sensitivity. Another 340 patients (group B) were prospectively recruited to test SLI's capacity to detect right ventricles (RVs) with an abnormal EF (<0.5).

The appropriate threshold to obtain 100 % sensitivity in group A was 0.58. In group B, with the 0.58 threshold, SLI yielded a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 51 %. SLI would have saved 35 % of the RV studies in our population, without inducing any diagnostic error. SLI and EF correlation was good (r (2) = 0.64).

SLI combines two simple RV measures, and brings significant improvement in post-processing efficiency by preselecting RVs that require a complete study.

• Assessment of right ventricle ejection fraction (RVEF) with cine-MRI is time consuming. • Therefore, RVEF is not always assessed during cardiac MRI. • Surface-length index (SLI) allows rapid detection of abnormal RVEF during cardiac MRI. • SLI saves one third of the operator time. • Every cardiac MRI could include RVEF assessment by means of SLI.
