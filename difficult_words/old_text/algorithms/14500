Removal of some divalent heavy metal ions (Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Pb(2+), Cd(2+), Co(2+)) from aqueous solutions using carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets was performed. CNT sheets were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition of cyclohexanol and ferrocene in nitrogen atmosphere at 750Â°C, and oxidized with concentrated nitric acid at room temperature and then employed as adsorbent for water treatment. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were used to describe the adsorption behavior of heavy metal ions by oxidized CNT sheets. The obtained results demonstrated that the oxidized CNT sheets can be used as an effective adsorbent for heavy metal ions removal from water. It was found out that kinetics of adsorption varies with initial concentration of heavy metal ions. Preference of adsorption onto the oxidized CNT sheets can be ordered as Pb(2+)>Cd(2+)>Co(2+)>Zn(2+)>Cu(2+). Using the oxidized CNT sheets, waste water treatment without CNT leakage into water is economically feasible. Therefore, CNT sheets have good potential application in environmental protection.
