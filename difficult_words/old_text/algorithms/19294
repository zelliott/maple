The formation of vascular networks in vitro develops along two rather distinct stages: during the early migration-dominated stage the main features of the pattern emerge, later the mechanical interaction of the cells with the substratum stretches the network. Mathematical models in the relevant literature have been focusing just on either of the aspects of this complex system. In this paper, a unified view of the morphogenetic process is provided in terms of physical mechanisms and mathematical modeling.
