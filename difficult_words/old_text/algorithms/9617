Uncertainties in image registration may be a significant source of errors in anatomy mapping as well as dose accumulation in radiotherapy. It is, therefore, essential to validate the accuracy of image registration. Here, we propose a method to detect areas where mono modal B-spline registration performs well and to distinguish those from areas of the same image, where the registration is likely to be less accurate. It is a stochastic approach to automatically estimate the uncertainty of the resulting displacement vector field. The coefficients resulting from the B-spline registration are subject to moderate and randomly performed variations. A quantity is proposed to characterize the local sensitivity of the similarity measure to these variations. We demonstrate the statistical dependence between the local image registration error and this quantity by calculating their mutual information. We show the significance of the statistical dependence with an approach based on random redistributions. The proposed method has the potential to divide an image into subregions which differ in the magnitude of their average registration error.
