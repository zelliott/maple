In this paper, a novel subpixel mapping algorithm based on an adaptive differential evolution (DE) algorithm, namely, adaptive-DE subpixel mapping (ADESM), is developed to perform the subpixel mapping task for remote sensing images. Subpixel mapping may provide a fine-resolution map of class labels from coarser spectral unmixing fraction images, with the assumption of spatial dependence. In ADESM, to utilize DE, the subpixel mapping problem is transformed into an optimization problem by maximizing the spatial dependence index. The traditional DE algorithm is an efficient and powerful population-based stochastic global optimizer in continuous optimization problems, but it cannot be applied to the subpixel mapping problem in a discrete search space. In addition, it is not an easy task to properly set control parameters in DE. To avoid these problems, this paper utilizes an adaptive strategy without user-defined parameters, and a reversible-conversion strategy between continuous space and discrete space, to improve the classical DE algorithm. During the process of evolution, they are further improved by enhanced evolution operators, e.g., mutation, crossover, repair, exchange, insertion, and an effective local search to generate new candidate solutions. Experimental results using different types of remote images show that the ADESM algorithm consistently outperforms the previous subpixel mapping algorithms in all the experiments. Based on sensitivity analysis, ADESM, with its self-adaptive control parameter setting, is better than, or at least comparable to, the standard DE algorithm, when considering the accuracy of subpixel mapping, and hence provides an effective new approach to subpixel mapping for remote sensing imagery.
