Two methods for volume flow calculation from images of methane leakages to the atmosphere are presented. The images contain calibrated gas concentration Ã— path length pixel information, and are processed with a block matching method and a theoretical velocity field method. Results from known methane flow in two laboratory setups and one unknown real leakage from a gas processing plant are compared with the image processing methods. The methods are generic and can be implemented in common infrared systems for gas visualization. This work provides a new tool for estimating and reporting volume flow emissions from gas processing plants to the authorities.
