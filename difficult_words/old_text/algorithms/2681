Patient nonattendance is a frequent occurrence in dermatology clinics, and our responsibility regarding the follow-up of these patients remains nebulous.

This study sought to evaluate the beliefs and practices of physicians at a university-affiliated medical dermatology clinic regarding patient nonattendance at follow-up appointments and to provide an algorithm to deal appropriately with absentee patients based on various Canadian medical association guidelines.

A questionnaire was distributed to the 17 dermatologists practicing at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal medical dermatology clinic. We contacted provincial and national medical associations regarding directives for patient follow-up.

There is a lack of consensus among dermatologists at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal regarding responsibility toward patients who miss their follow-up appointments. However, the majority of survey respondents consider that patient follow-up must be adjusted on a case-by-case basis and that diagnoses at risk for high morbidity and mortality require particular attention, which is in line with various Canadian medical association guidelines.

Dermatologists should have a structured approach to dealing with patients who miss their follow-up appointments to ensure the appropriate care of all patients.
