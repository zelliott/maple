Bromine-modified oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were fragmented in the electrospray source to study the influence of brominated bases on fragmentation. Several 13-mer ODNs containing a brominated pyrimidine base, BrdU (5-bromodeoxyuridine) or BrdC (5-bromodeoxycytidine), were analyzed. Low cone voltage fragmentation yields a loss of the brominated base with a preferential loss for the brominated base closer to the 5'-end (2-position > 4-position > 12-position) as well as a preferential loss of BrdU over BrdC. Higher cone voltage produces backbone fragmentation with complementary a(n)-base and w(m) ions close to the brominated base. On the basis of these observations, we located the brominated base in the sequence for all of the ODNs studied.
