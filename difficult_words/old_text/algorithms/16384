The aim of this review is to summarize the recent developments in the treatment of inflammatory macular edema (ME). Inflammatory ME represents a major cause of visual loss in uveitis and its adequate management is crucial for the maintenance of useful vision in patients with uveitis. Recent studies favor early treatment of inflammatory ME, even in patients with full visual acuity. After recapitulating the standard treatment modalities for inflammatory ME the authors address novel corticosteroid implants. They review the literature on the efficacy of anti-VEGF agents for inflammatory ME and point out their beneficial, but transient effects. Further, they present recent data on the value of systemic biologics in uveitic ME and evaluate the effectiveness of vitrectomy. Finally, they propose an algorithm for the treatment of inflammatory ME and point out that the individual risk-benefit ratio, especially with systemic immunosuppressive therapy, should always be considered.
