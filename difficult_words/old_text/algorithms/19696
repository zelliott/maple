According to the characteristics of four basic P morphologies, combining the wavelet transform and the amplitude and slope of transformed P wave, a new P-wave detecting method based on "wavelet-amplitude-slope" algorithm is presented: First search out all modulus maximum pairs to satisfy the threshold after wavelet transform, and then applying the amplitude and slope criterion exclude the interferes and detect the P peak and its shape, last determine the onset and end of P wave respectively which should be separately calculated for single-peak and double-peak P wave (or biphasic P wave). The approach is applied in experiments of data from MIT/BIH database and randomly collected data of clinical ECG. The experimental statistical results shows that the correct detecting rate is as high as 96% compared to manual annotation.
