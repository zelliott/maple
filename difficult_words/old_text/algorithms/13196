We have developed and proposed a new algorithm for treating patients with epilepsy, which takes into account the genetic criteria for the effectiveness of AEDs and provides an opportunity to significantly reduce the time drug-resistance definition, which in turn reduces the time progression epileptohenesis. Therefore, the use of alternative treatments for epilepsy, it is possible before the occurrence of irreversible changes in the patient's central nervous system. Therefore, treatment for this algorithm accelerates the choice of adequate treatment tactics in a particular patient, which promotes safety in society as active and healthy citizens.
