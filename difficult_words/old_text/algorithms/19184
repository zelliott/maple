We describe the application of a Bayesian variable-number sample-path (VNSP) optimization algorithm to yield a robust design for a floating sleeve antenna for hepatic microwave ablation. Finite element models are used to generate the electromagnetic (EM) field and thermal distribution in liver given a particular design. Dielectric properties of the tissue are assumed to vary within +/- 10% of average properties to simulate the variation among individuals. The Bayesian VNSP algorithm yields an optimal design that is a 14.3% improvement over the original design and is more robust in terms of lesion size, shape and efficiency. Moreover, the Bayesian VNSP algorithm finds an optimal solution saving 68.2% simulation of the evaluations compared to the standard sample-path optimization method.
