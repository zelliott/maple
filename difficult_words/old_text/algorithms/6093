With the use of information from a database of pediatric patients with concomitant nuclear GFR and serum creatinine (Cr), estimated GFR equations were derived on the basis of local laboratory methods and population. These formulas then were compared with those recommended by the National Kidney Foundation for estimating GFR in children. For this, their ability to estimate accurately an individual's true GFR and chronic kidney disease stage, identify patients whose true GFR was <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and to identify correctly deterioration in an individual's GFR over time was compared. Next, two methods to estimate GFR in children without the use of height or weight were developed. The first was a height- and weight-independent formula; the second was a novel approach using the Schwartz formula and calculating a Cr cutoff based on age-based estimates of height and GFR level of interest, i.e., <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Our results suggest that if local laboratory constants are derived and a height is known, then the Schwartz formula offers the most accuracy with least mathematical complexity to perform in the clinical setting. If height is not available but the local laboratory constants have been derived, then the British Columbia's Children's Hospital 2 formula is of value; however, in the setting of estimating pediatric renal function in the outpatient laboratory, where neither of these factors is commonly known, an approach whereby a Cr cutoff for a GFR of interest is developed is suggested. Provided are Cr levels that are based on a reference method of Cr measurement to facilitate this approach for the clinician.
