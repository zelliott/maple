The objective of this study was to develop a method of predicting pipe friction head loss, which is a key factor in pipeline transportation of high-concentration sludge, thereby optimizing design for pipeline systems. The study involved both experimentation and analysis of pipeline transportation. Moreover, the study led to the representation of pipe friction head loss as functions of average velocity, transportation distance, pipe diameter, pipe interior roughness, and solids viscosity and temperature.
