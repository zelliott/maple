The purpose of this study was to determine the recovery period of basketball players after maximal load. Thirteen male subjects, aged 19-26 years, took part in this study. They performed an incremental cardiopulmonary test using an electronically braked bike ERGOLINE 9000. Ventilation and gas exchange were assessed and measured by breath-to-breath method using VMAX229 metabolic card and Sensor Medics gas flow analyzer. Heart rate parameters were established during continuous ECG monitoring and analysis integrated VMAX and Marquette 3.01 system. Quantitative changes of heart rate, oxygen consumption, double rate product, respiratory quotient, and metabolic equivalent were calculated or established by VMAX application algorithm. A recovery was defined through such parameters: T(HR90%)(time needed for 90% heart rate decreasing from heart rate maximum), T(HR90)(time needed for heart rate decreasing to 90 bpm), T(DPR90%)(time needed for 90% decreasing from a maximal double rate product), T(VO290%)(time needed for 90% decreasing from maximal oxygen consumption), T(RQ90%)(time needed for 90% decreasing from peak respiratory quotient), T(RQ0.9)(time needed for respiratory quotient normalization to 0.9 - to a standard value). Full recovery after maximal load was too long and completed during 1200 s, but some processes were completed earlier (lactic acid buffering within 95 s, oxygen requirement within 620 s, and normalization of heart action within 730 s). Further research is needed to explain this peculiarity of recovery.
