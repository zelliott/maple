A supercontinuum laser based double integrating sphere setup in combination with an unscattered transmittance measurement setup was developed and carefully validated for optical characterization of turbid samples in the 500-2250 nm wavelength range. A set of 57 liquid optical phantoms, covering a wide range of absorption and scattering properties, were prepared and measured at two sample thicknesses. The estimated bulk optical properties matched well for both thicknesses, and with theory and literature, without significant crosstalk between absorption and scattering. Equations were derived for the bulk scattering properties μ(s), μ(s)' and g of Intralipid® 20% which can be used to calculate the bulk scattering properties of intralipid-dilutions in the 500-2250 nm range.
