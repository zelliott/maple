This paper describes a computational algorithm (STADEERS--STAtistical Design of Experiments in Enzyme ReactorS) for the statistical design of biochemical engineering experiments. The type of experiment that qualifies for this package involves a batch reaction catalyzed by a soluble enzyme where the activity of the enzyme decays with time. Assuming that both the catalytic action and the deactivation of the enzyme obey known rate expressions, the present code is helpful in the process of obtaining estimates of the kinetic parameters by providing as output the times at which samples should be withdrawn from the reacting mixture. Starting D-optimal design is used as a basis for the statistical approach. This BASIC code is a powerful tool when fitting a rate expression to data because it increases the effectiveness of experimentation by helping the biochemical kineticist obtain data points with the largest possible informational content.
