We demonstrate the use of a simple tool to simultaneously visualize and characterize chromatic and spherical aberrations that are present in multiphoton microscopy. Using two-dimensional Fourier transform spectral interferometry, we measured these aberrations, deducing in a single shot spatiotemporal effects in high-numerical-aperture objectives.
