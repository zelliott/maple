In this paper, we propose a novel approach to clustering noisy and complex data sets based on the eXtend Classifier Systems (XCS). The proposed approach, termed XCSc, has three main processes: (a) a learning process to evolve the rule population, (b) a rule compacting process to remove redundant rules after the learning process, and (c) a rule merging process to deal with the overlapping rules that commonly occur between the clusters. In the first process, we have modified the clustering mechanisms of the current available XCS and developed a new accelerate learning method to improve the quality of the evolved rule population. In the second process, an effective rule compacting algorithm is utilized. The rule merging process is based on our newly proposed agglomerative hierarchical rule merging algorithm, which comprises the following steps: (i) all the generated rules are modeled by a graph, with each rule representing a node; (ii) the vertices in the graph are merged to form a number of sub-graphs (i.e. rule clusters) under some pre-defined criteria, which generates the final rule set to represent the clusters; (iii) each data is re-checked and assigned to a cluster that it belongs to, guided by the final rule set. In our experiments, we compared the proposed XCSc with CHAMELEON, a benchmark algorithm well known for its excellent performance, on a number of challenging data sets. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms CHAMELEON in the successful rate, and also demonstrates good stability.
