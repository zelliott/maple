Tilt testing is accepted as the main tool for the diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope, particularly in the "malignant" vasovagal form. As a result of experience with tilt testing, the cardiovascular responses to head-up tilting in patients with malignant vasovagal syncope (MVVS) have been defined in respect of the vasodepressor (hypotensive) and cardioinhibitory (bradycardic) components. Pacing therapy has been of limited value in the past, with controversy about its role, even in the cardioinhibitory form of MVVS. With the advent of more sophisticated algorithms for pacing (i.e., rate-drop response [RDR], Thera DR) in response to the onset of bradycardia in MVVS, however, this therapy is being reexamined. This article examines the blood pressure and heart rate responses to head-up tilt in patients with MVVS and examines the role of this test in screening such patients for the benefits of pacing with RDR. Careful analysis of the pattern of blood pressure and heart rate response during the tilt test may allow selection of those patients likely to respond to RDR and may provide useful information for initial programming of the algorithm.
