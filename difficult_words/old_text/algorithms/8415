Using image analysers, the influence of noises on the quality of images obtained from three types of digital CCD videocameras was studied. Algorithms for calculating the heterogeneity coefficient of cell structures have been proposed, which take into account the noises on the images. Application of procedures of image smoothing or averaging from a few shots, calculation of differences in heterogeneity coefficients of the object and a free field, and a combination of these methods have significantly reduced the influence of noises and increased the informativeness of texture features.
