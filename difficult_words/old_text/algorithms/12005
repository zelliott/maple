The Partial Least-Squares (PLS) method was used to further study Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) for photohydrolysis quantum yields of selected aromatic halides. The cluster of substituted bromobenzenes and iodobenzenes was further grouped into two clusters, substituted bromobenzenes and substituted iodobenzenes, for which QSPRs were obtained, respectively. The QSPRs obtained by PLS are more significant than those obtained in previous studies. The studies showed that only when the compounds belonging to different groups are studies separately, inherent relationships between molecular properties and their structure characteristics can be revealed. It can be generally concluded that the photohydrolysis quantum yields of the substituted aromatic halides are dependent on the overall characters of the molecules, the characters of the carbon-halogen bonds to be broken in the photolysis, and the character of the halogen atoms to be replaced in the photolysis. Electronegativity has great relevance to the photohydrolysis processes of the compounds. Substituted aromatic halides with large average molecular polarizability and molecular weight values tend to have low photolysis quantum yields.
