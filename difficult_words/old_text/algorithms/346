Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation is an established curative treatment modality for patients with malignant and non-malignant haematological disorders. Since the first related umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) in 1988, the use of UCB as a stem cell source for transplantation has become a standard practice in many countries, with approximately 8000 such transplants having been performed worldwide to date.
