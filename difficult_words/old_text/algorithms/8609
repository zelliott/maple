We report the application of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) in characterizing conformational changes (condensation) of chemically well-defined DNA plasmids. The plasmids: pHbetaAPr-1-neo (10 kbp, contour length 3.4 microm) and pBluescript SKt (2.96 kbp, contour length 1.02 microm) were imaged by a confocal fluorescence microscope using two fluorescent probes: ethidium bromide (EtBr) and propidium iodide (PrIo). It became clear that the DNA molecule exhibits discrete conformational change between the coil and globule states with the addition of a small amount (the order of magnitude being 10(-5) M) of cationic surfactant, spermine and hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB). When the concentrations of both condensing agents are smaller than 6.0x10(-6) M and 2.0 x 10(-6) M for the 10 and 2.96 kbp, both plasmids are in the extended coil state with diffusion constants D(10 kbp)=9.6 x 0(-13) m(2) s(-1) and D(2.96 kbp)=2.5x10(-12) m(2) s(-1), respectively. When the condensing agent in a concentration higher than 1.10 x 10(-5) M is added to pHbetaAPr-1-neo (10 kbp), plasmids are in the condensed globular state and their diffusion constants are D(10 kbp)=8.0 x 10(-12) m(2) s(-1) (spermine) and D(10 kbp)=5.5x10(-12) m(2) s(-1) (HTAB). The globular state of the pBluescript SKt (2.96 kbp) plasmids is characterized by diffusion constants equal to D(2.96 kbp)=9.2x10(-12) m(2) s(-1) (spermine) and D(2.96 kbp)=8.2x10(-12) m(2) s(-1) (HTAB).
