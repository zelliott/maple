A special program package has been developed for input the results of visual monitoring of the behavior of animals during the Porsolt (forced swim) test, open field test, elevated cross labyrinth test, and passive avoidance reflex test into a personal computer (PC) for the subsequent data processing. According to the adopted procedure, all behavioral events are registered by a researcher using the corresponding keys on the PC keyboard. Then, the program calculates the mean values and their standard deviations and presents the results of data processing in the form of tables and graphs on display. The data can be also printed and stored on disk. The disk files can be imported into other programs (Microsoft Office, Microsoft Excel, etc.) for further processing. The proposed software facilitates the procedure and increases the accuracy of experiments. The programs were successfully verified in the laboratories of the Zakusov Institute of Pharmacology.
