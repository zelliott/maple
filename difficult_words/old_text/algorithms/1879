Although there is a body of literature related to how hospital nurses develop skill, judgement or expertise there is little empirical work that focuses on understanding and developing health visiting expertise. The aims of this paper are: to identify a typology of health visitor skills, knowledge and cognition in use and the nature of health visitor expertise; to present an expert model of practice as a practice learning tool; to locate this model in context of my 2007 empirical research. This explored the problems of families and children in need and how they were supported by health visitors. This new practice model is timely in view of the need to train more health visitors, educators and practice facilitators as set out in the Health Visitor Implementation Plan.
