To estimate the uncertainty for quantitative analysis results of geniposide, chloregenic acid and crocinl I in Gardenia jasminoides Ellis.

HPLC method was employed to determine the amounts of geniposide, choloregenic acid and crocinl I in Gardenia jasminoides Ellis. Analyzing the uncertainty sources arising from the procedure of analysis, the standard uncertainty and combined uncertainty and expanded uncertainty were calculated according to the data of HPLC.

This method met the requirements of modern pharmaceutical analysis, and the expand uncertainties for the HPLC method of the three components are 0.1024, 0.2254, 0.1264, respectively.

Applying measurement uncertainty to the evaluation of quantitative analysis results of active components in Gardenia jasminoides Ellis. is an improvement to the actual error evaluation system.
