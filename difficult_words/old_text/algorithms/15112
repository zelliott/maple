A novel method for quantifying hemolysis is described. This method uses a spin filter to separate the free hemoglobin from the red blood cells suspended in the test solution. This procedure enables the use of a closed loop system that continuously measures hemolysis spectrophotometrically. It is shown that hemolysis does not always stop after the solution has been quenched with normal saline. In fact, the process of hemolysis induced by chemicals such as potassium oleate is relatively slow.
