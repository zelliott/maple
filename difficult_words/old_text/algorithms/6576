Although dozens of biological ontologies have been created and deployed, relatively little attention has been given to using ontologies to represent behavior. Ontologies for two different behavior systems are described here. One ontology was a translation of a published ethogram, and the second was coded from video clips in a comparative study of jumping spider courtship.
