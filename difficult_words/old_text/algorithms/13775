We propose a newborn cystic fibrosis (CF) screening test based on the analysis of dried blood spot DNA by a strategy involving simple or multiplex denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR products of CFTR gene fragments, in conjunction with the immunoreactive-trypsin (IRT) assay. From May 1988 to May 1992 we have performed a neonatal screening programme of 42,000 newborns in Brittany. We identified 450 infants with an elevated IRT level. From this cohort, to evaluate the feasibility of measuring IRT in conjunction with mutation analysis in Guthrie cards, a pilot study was initially conducted on 200 individuals with normal IRT and 150 with raised IRT levels. Furthermore, a retrospective study was performed on 189 IRT positive cards, involving mutation scanning of exons 10 and 11 of the CFTR gene, which contains a number of frequent mutations including the deletion delta F508. We show that this approach has several implications for neonatal CF screening especially in decreasing the recall rate and detecting CF carriers.
