We present and analyze a model for the dynamics of the interactions between a pathogen and its host's immune response. The model consists of two differential equations, one for pathogen load, the other one for an index of specific immunity. Differently from other simple models in the literature, this model exhibits, according to the hosts' or pathogen's parameter values, or to the initial infection size, a rich repertoire of behaviours: immediate clearing of the pathogen through aspecific immune response; or acute infection followed by clearing of the pathogen through specific immune response; or uncontrolled infections; or acute infection followed by convergence to a stable state of chronic infection; or periodic solutions with intermittent acute infections. The model can also mimic some features of immune response after vaccination. This model could be a basis on which to build epidemic models including immunological features.
