The local-mean-energy approximation (LMEA) and the local-field approximation (LFA) are commonly applied to include the electron properties like transport and rate coefficients into a hydrodynamic description of gas discharge plasmas. Both the approaches base on the solution of the stationary spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for the electron component, but the consequences of these approaches differ drastically. These consequences of using both the approaches are studied and discussed on a kinetic level and by comparison of results of hydrodynamic investigations of low-pressure glow discharge plasmas. It is found that the LMEA is to be strongly recommended for the application to a hydrodynamic description of dc as well as rf discharge plasmas, while the LFA is conditionally suitable to describe dc glow discharges with rough reaction kinetics only and its application to rf discharge plasmas is inappropriate.
