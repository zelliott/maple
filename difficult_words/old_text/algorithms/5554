An efficient Hg(2+) selective fluorescent probe (vanillin azo coumarin, VAC) was synthesized by blending vanillin with coumarin. VAC and its Hg(2+) complex were well characterized by different spectroscopic techniques like (1)H NMR, QTOF-MS ES(+), FTIR and elemental analysis as well. VAC could detect up to 1.25 μM Hg(2+) in aqueous methanol solution through fluorescence enhancement. The method was linear up to 16 μM of Hg(2+). Negative interferences from Cu(2+), Ni(2+), Fe(3+), and Zn(2+) were eliminated using EDTA as a masking agent. VAC showed a strong binding to Hg(2+) ion as evident from its binding constant value (2.2×10(5)), estimated using Benesi-Hildebrand equation. Mercuration assisted restricted rotation of the vanillin moiety and inhibited photoinduced electron transfer from the O, N-donor sites to the coumarin unit are responsible for the enhancement of fluorescence upon mercuration of VAC. VAC was used for imaging the accumulation of Hg(2+) ions in Candida albicans cells.
