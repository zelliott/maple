This paper reports the experimental and the computational techniques that were specifically developed to provide dose response data for a new method of beta dosimetry, which is reported in an accompanying article (Sh87). The specific experimental techniques consist of setting up, calibrating and obtaining backscattering and resolution corrections for a plastic-scintillator-based beta spectrometer. The computation techniques involve (1) adapting a Monte Carlo electron transport computer code to use measured beta energy distributions as input data and (2) using the code to calculate the energy deposition of these distributions of electrons in a slab of material. The energy deposition of backscattered electrons incident on the slab is also taken into account. Codes, which were developed to calculate the energy deposited by photons in LiF, are used to derive a theoretical value for the TLD response calibration factor. This factor compares well to the experimentally derived result which was obtained by exposing TLDs to a calibrated 137Cs/137mBa photon source.
