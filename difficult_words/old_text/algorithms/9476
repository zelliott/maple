To assess the recent literature on effective use of information received from hemodynamic monitoring.

Dynamic hemodynamic measures are more effective in assessing cardiovascular status than static measures. In this review, we will focus on the application of hemodynamic monitoring to evaluate the effect of therapy.

A systematic approach to an effective resuscitation effort can be incorporated into a protocolized cardiovascular management algorithm, which, in turn, can improve patient-centered outcomes and the cost of healthcare systems, by faster and more effective response in order to diagnose and treat hemodynamically unstable patients both inside and outside of intensive care units.
