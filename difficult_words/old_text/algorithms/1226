A computationally efficient hybrid ray-physical optics (HRPO) model is presented for the analysis and synthesis of multiple-focus ultrasound heating patterns through the human rib cage. In particular, a ray method is used to propagate the ultrasound fields from the source to the frontal plane of the rib cage. The physical-optics integration method is then employed to obtain the intensity pattern inside the rib cage. The solution of the matrix system is carried out by using the pseudo inverse technique to synthesize the desired heating pattern. The proposed technique guides the fields through the intercostal spacings between the solid ribs and, thus, minimal intensity levels are observed over the solid ribs. This simulation model allows for the design and optimization of large-aperture phased-array applicator systems for noninvasive ablative thermal surgery in the heart and liver through the rib cage.
