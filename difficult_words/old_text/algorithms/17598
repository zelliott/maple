Intracoronary pressure measurements and the determination of fractional flow reserve (FFR) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) predict adverse events. Coronary lesions may impair the transmission of pressure waves across a stenosis, potentially acting as a high-frequency filter. The pulse transmission coefficient (PTC) is a nonhyperemic parameter that calculates the transmission of high-frequency components of the pressure signal through a stenosis. It was shown recently that PTC is highly correlated with FFR. This study was designed to examine the change of PTC as compared to FFR following PCI. Pressure signals were obtained by pressure guidewire in 27 lesions pre- and post-PCI and were analyzed with an algorithm that identifies the high-frequency component in the pressure signal. The PTC was calculated at baseline as the ratio between distal and proximal high-frequency components of the pressure waveform across the lesion. FFR measurements were assessed with intracoronary adenosine. There was a significant increase in PTC following PCI (0.15 +/- 0.17 at baseline vs. 0.84 +/- 0.11 post-PCI; P < 0.001). Comparable changes were observed for FFR (0.58 +/- 0.12 at baseline vs. 0.91 +/- 0.05 post-PCI; P < 0.001). PTC is a nonhyperemic parameter for physiologic assessment of coronary artery stenoses. Similar to FFR, PTC is significantly increased following PCI. Thus, it may serve as an adjunct index for the functional assessment of procedural success following PCI.
