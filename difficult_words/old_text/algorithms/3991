Spastic type is the most common form of cerebral palsy. The purpose of this review was to evaluate recent literature for current trends in the surveillance and treatment of spastic hip problems in cerebral palsy.

Cerebral palsy is still the most common physical disability in childhood in developed countries. Surveillance programs have had promising results in the detection of 'at risk' patients. However, neither regular radiographic screening nor surgical treatment indications and procedures have shown any progression in the last decade. In addition, recent studies have focused heavily on nonoperative treatment strategies to improve gait.

Cerebral palsy is a static encephalopathy causing myostatic contractures especially in the knee and hip. Unbalanced hip contractures can lead to silent hip dislocation. Surgical and rehabilitative approaches such as soft tissue lengthening and proximal femoral and pelvic osteotomies can help patients maintain function and comfort. Selective dorsal rhizotomy or Intrathecal Baclofen Pump insertion or, recently, noninvasive techniques such as neurodevelopmental therapy may help patients and caregivers cope with what is still a devastating and inexorably progressive disorder.
