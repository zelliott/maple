Centrifugal pump left ventricular assist device is a useful adjunct in pediatric cardiac surgery, as a bridge to recovery, or in some cases, to transplantation. This form of circulatory support may not have the universal applicability of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, but it is equally or more effective in properly selected patients. The technology for centrifugal pump support is now quite standardized, and the advantages well documented. In this chapter we discuss the problems of indications, case selection, technical aspects of the circuit, and general clinical management. Results since 1989 are also presented.
