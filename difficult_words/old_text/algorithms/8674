We describe two design strategies that could substantially improve the performance of speech enhancement systems. Results from a preliminary study of pulse recovery are presented to illustrate the potential benefits of such strategies. The first strategy is a direct application of a non-linear, adaptive signal processing approach for recovery of speech in noise. The second strategy optimizes performance by maximizing the enhancement system's ability to evoke target speech percepts. This approach may lead to better performance because the design is optimized on a measure directly related to the ultimate goal of speech enhancement: accurate communication of the speech percept. In both systems, recently developed 'neural network' learning algorithms can be used to determine appropriate parameters for enhancement processing.
