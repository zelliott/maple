The goal of the paper is to assess the applicability of sorption models to describe the retention of contaminants on clay materials, both in dispersed and compacted states. A batch method is used to characterize the sorption equilibria between Cs, Ni, and MX-80 bentonite for solid-to-liquid ratios varying from 0.5 to 4200 kg/m3. For compacted bentonite (dry density of 1100 kg/m3), a new method is presented where the material compaction is performed in PEEK capillaries. Sorption edges and isotherms were measured in the presence of a synthetic groundwater. A model considering cation exchange reactions with interlayer cations and surface complexation reactions with edge sites was used for the dispersed state. Montmorillonite was shown to be the dominant interacting phase in MX-80 bentonite. The applicability of the model to compacted bentonite was tested. The results indicate that under conditions where the cation exchange mechanism is dominant, there is no difference between the dispersed and compacted states. For the degree of compaction studied, all exchange sites are available for sorption. For Ni, when surface complexation is the dominant sorption mechanism, a decrease of the Kd values by a factor of about 3 was observed (pH 7-8, trace concentrations). This could be explained quantitatively by a diminution of the conditional interaction constant between Ni and the edge surface site in the compacted state. One consequence of this decrease is that the contribution of the organic matter content of MX-80 bentonite to the total sorption becomes significant.
