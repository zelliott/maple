In 2007, Medtronic Sprint Fidelis defibrillator leads were taken off the market due to a high rate of lead failure. Current data do not allow for risk stratification of patients with regard to lead failure.

We sought to determine predictors of Sprint Fidelis lead failure.

Between 2004 and 2007, 269 Sprint Fidelis leads were implanted in 258 patients in our centre. Variables associated with lead failure were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox survival model.

During a median follow-up of 2.80 years (maximum 5.32), we observed 33 (12.3%) Sprint Fidelis lead failures (5-year survival, 65.6% ± 7.5%). In univariate analysis, age was the only predictor of lead failure (hazard ratio [HR] for 1-year increase 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-0.99; p=0.009). Patients aged<62.5 years (median) had a significantly increased risk of lead failure compared with patients aged>62.5 years (HR 2.80; CI 1.30-6.02; p=0.009). Survival without Sprint Fidelis lead failure was 55.6% ± 10.4%) in patients aged<62.5 years (24/134 leads) vs 78.6% ± 8.8% in patients aged>62.5 years (9/135 leads). The annual incidence of lead failure in patients aged<62.5 years was 11.6% ± 4.9% during the fourth year after implantation and 22.9% ± 13.2% during the fifth year.

Overall, we found a higher rate of Sprint Fidelis lead dysfunction than previously described. Lead failure was much more frequent in younger patients. Our results emphasize the need for close follow-up of younger patients with Sprint Fidelis leads and suggest that, in these patients, the implantation of a new implantable cardioverter defibrillator lead at the time of generator replacement might be reasonable.
