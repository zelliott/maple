The application of fully automated, unattended sample preparation performed by a laboratory robot for the analysis of drugs in biological samples requires the prevention of system failures which may arise in the on-line coupled chromatographic system or in other components of the robotic system. A computer program has been developed which can help to detect such problems. The control program for the robotic sample preparation contains a number of safety measures to intercept robotic or human errors. A routine is implemented, guarding for chromatographic malfunctions and errors in dispensing liquids by the robot. After detection of trouble, sample preparation is interrupted.
