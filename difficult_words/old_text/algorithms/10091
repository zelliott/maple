This article aims to identify the potential indicators of obstructive apnea (OA) in the ECG, based on the traces of QRS area from multiple ECG leads. We compare the difference in these traces' phase relation found during and after each OA episode to the difference between the first and second half of the OA and between split halves of epochs of normal respiration (NR).
