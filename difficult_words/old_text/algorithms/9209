The previous theoretical work of a delivery transfer function (DTF) in radiotherapy is expanded to include the unique intensity modulation method of helical tomotherapy. In addition to the collimation of each beamlet, and the Gaussian scatter convolution spreading of the dose that other radiotherapy units have, helical tomotherapy uses 51 small arcs of varying lengths to adjust the intensity. The blurring from these arcs is not taken into account during treatment planning. A theoretical DTF is constructed, and a calculation is performed which includes this unique source motion in relation to the other DTF components. Various typical delivery parameters are used to generate resolution maps for a constant intensity projection. Near the isocenter, the transverse (to a given beam direction) blurring is small but at larger radii (>6 cm), the source blurring dominates over leaf size. For most clinical situations, this inherent source motion blurring is expected to be negligible.
