To propose management options for cochlear implantation in chronic otitis media based on our experiences.

A retrospective review of 418 cochlear implantations performed by the 2 senior authors between November 1988 and February 2004 was conducted. Nine patients who had chronic otitis media in the ear to be implanted were included. Of these, three showed active inflammation at presentation; the other six cases had undergone previous tympanomastoidectomy surgery and did not show active inflammation at presentation.

Five patients with active inflammation or without an adequate soft tissue layer in the mastoid bowl underwent a two-stage procedure. Four cases who showed inactive inflammation and had an adequate tissue layer to protect the electrode array underwent a single-stage technique, although two of them showed dry tympanic membrane perforation. No local or intracranial inflammation recurred. The electrode was exposed in the mastoid bowl in one case, who was managed with revisional mastoid obliteration with soft tissue.

Complete eradication of inflammation and the securing of a strong protective soft tissue layer over the electrode are prerequisites for cochlear implantation in ears with chronic otitis media.
