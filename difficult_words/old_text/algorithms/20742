The exquisite sensitivity of haematological malignancies to targeted radiation alongside the impressive results achieved by the pioneers in this field suggests that radioimmunotherapy is likely to be a productive area for future clinical research. Recent experimental work has demonstrated that the combination of targeted radiation and antibody effector mechanisms are critical to long-term clearance of tumour. This review provides the background of clinical and biological insights into the mechanisms of action of radioimmunotherapy.
