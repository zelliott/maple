A Monte Carlo simulation model was developed for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospital units. The model allows for the representation of every patient and staff member. Staff-patient interactions, staff handwashing compliance, admission of colonized patients, and antibiotic use are included in the model. The simulation model provides colonization curves for patients and staff and offers the possibility of simulating different kinds of hospital units. Simulation of the spread of an antibiotic-resistant pathogen in an intensive care unit was performed. We studied the impact of handwashing compliance on colonization. The importance of handwashing in preventing colonization and the influence of admission of colonized patients in perpetuating an epidemic were confirmed by the model. The model offers a new approach to modeling the spread of nosocomial pathogens in hospital units. It allows one to study the impact of infection control measures and represents a valuable educational tool for staff.
