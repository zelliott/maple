Recent changes in the epidemiology of dental caries and advances in the development of new diagnostic measurement techniques have stimulated interest in improved methods of assessing changes in dental caries status. Traditional methods for assessing change focus primarily on the development of new lesions at the cavitation level and incorporate incomplete information on the progression of existing cavitated lesions. A methodology to expand the clinical recording of dental caries in clinical studies to include 1) both non-cavitated and cavitated lesions and 2) the surface area affected for restorations is suggested. New indices are proposed to estimate changes in the number of new lesions, the progression of existing carious lesions, and the total change in caries status for a subject. It is anticipated that the new indices will produce more efficient methods of assessing change in caries status in longitudinal clinical studies. The degree of improvement can be estimated directly. Improvements in efficiency may reduce the duration or number of subjects required in caries clinical trials.
