Connectedness of random walk segmentation is examined, and novel properties are discovered, by considering electrical circuits equivalent to random walks. A theoretical analysis shows that earlier conclusions concerning connectedness of random walk segmentation results are incorrect, and counterexamples are demonstrated.
