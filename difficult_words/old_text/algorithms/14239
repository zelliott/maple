Fractional models have proven to be very useful for studying viscoelastic materials. We consider the fractional Zener model (also called four-parameter model) to study both the relaxation function and creep compliance. The analytical results are compared with the known experimental results of the human brain tissue to obtain the best fit and brain mechanical parameters. The results are also compared to the non-fractional Zener model and four-parameter Burgers model, indicating that the four-parameter fractional model gives a substantially better fit for the all experimental data.
