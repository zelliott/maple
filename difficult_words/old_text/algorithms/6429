This contribution provides an overview and imparts basic knowledge on pertinent technical developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver: 3D sequences, respiratory triggering, parallel imaging, and 3 Tesla (3T). 3D sequences can be used as T1-weighted (T1w) sequences for analyzing dynamics of contrast enhancement or as T2w sequences for MR cholangiography. Consistent improvements in respiratory triggering make it possible to obtain good image quality on T2w scans even in patients unable to hold their breath. Parallel imaging as a universal technique to accelerate image acquisition is particularly appropriate for MRI of the liver, and it has been shown that the reduced acquisition time is not achieved at the expense of image quality. Further progress in MRI of the liver can be expected with use of the 3T systems, but hitherto irrelevant problems must still be solved. Overall the innovations presented here, applied alone or in combination, facilitate rapid, robust, and high-quality MRI diagnostic assessment of the liver.
