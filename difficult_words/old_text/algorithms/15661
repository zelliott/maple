The support vector machines (SVMs) method was introduced for predicting the structural class of protein domains. The results obtained through the self-consistency test, jack-knife test, and independent dataset test have indicated that the current method and the elegant component-coupled algorithm developed by Chou and co-workers, if effectively complemented with each other, may become a powerful tool for predicting the structural class of protein domains.
