This study examined the characteristics and operational parameters of the asymmetric reduction of ethyl 4-chloro acetoacetate by bakers' yeast in order to produce S-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyric acid ethyl ester. Eight operational variables were also optimized using the Taguchi method with consideration of the freshness of yeast cells as a noise factor. An L(18) orthogonal array was used to design the experiments. The reaction yield and the product's optical purity were considered as two product quality variables. A desirability function was applied to combine these two qualities as a single objective function. Additionally, the signal-to-noise (SN) ratio was used to estimate the variability in product quality. Optimization was undertaken not only to yield the best performance, but also to minimize the variation in quality. The confirmation experiments indicated that the reaction performance and the robustness of the product quality under the optimized conditions were higher than those obtained in other experiments in this study. Our results further demonstrate that the product's optical purity could be increased to >95% by adjusting the operational level of the main factors.
