To evaluate the effectiveness of octreotide in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma participants on the basis of randomized controlled trials.

We searched the Cochrane Center Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China Journal Full-text Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Database up to June 2008 in any language. Randomized controlled trials of octreotide for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma were selected and evaluated by two investigators. Any disagreement was solved by discussion. Analyses were performed using Review Manager 4.2.

Six randomized controlled trials totaling 352 participants were included. The median survival time was reported in four randomized controlled trials. The results between the octreotide group and the control group (the placebo or best supportive care group) were as follows: 13.0 versus 4.0 months, 1.93 versus 1.97 months, 4.7 versus 5.3 months, and 7.0 versus 2.5 months. Three randomized controlled trials reported 6-month survival rates and 12-month survival rates and meta-analysis results in these two outcomes [(RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.92-1.97); (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.66-11.16) respectively] were not found to be statistically significant by random-effects model. When we analyzed 6-month survival rates by fixed-effect model (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.02-1.66), meta-analysis result reached statistical significance.

As for the limitations of the included trials, the result may not demonstrate a significant superiority of octreotide administration in participants with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma from the available evidence.
