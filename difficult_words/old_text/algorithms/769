PromoSer is a web service that provides an easy and efficient approach to the batch retrieval of a large number of proximal promoters. Since its introduction last year, it has undergone continued development and expansion. At the core, there have been improvements in the filtering of the raw mRNA/EST sequences upon which all predictions are built, improvements in the alignments clustering and transcription start site prediction algorithms, and improvements in the backing database for increased performance. At the user interface level, improvements include enhanced functionality and user options, better integration with other resources on the web and a new visualization tool. PromoSer now also supports queries using a SOAP-based interface and XML-based responses. The service is publicly available at http://biowulf.bu.edu/zlab/PromoSer.
