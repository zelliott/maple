Predicting ozone-induced reduction of carbon sequestration of forests under elevated tropospheric ozone concentrations requires robust mechanistic leaf-level models, scaled up to whole tree and stand level. As ozone effects depend on genotype, the ability to predict these effects on forest carbon cycling via competitive response between genotypes will also be required. This study tests a process-based model that predicts the relative effects of ozone on the photosynthetic rate and growth of an ozone-sensitive aspen clone, as a first step in simulating the competitive response of genotypes to atmospheric and climate change. The resulting composite model simulated the relative above ground growth response of ozone-sensitive aspen clone 259 exposed to square wave variation in ozone concentration. This included a greater effect on stem diameter than on stem height, earlier leaf abscission, and reduced stem and leaf dry matter production at the end of the growing season. Further development of the model to reduce predictive uncertainty is discussed.
