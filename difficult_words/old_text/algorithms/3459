Computed tomography (CT) is increasingly employed in orthodontic treatment. One of the most successful applications is in dental implantology, in which an artificial root is surgically inserted into the jawbone to provide anchorage for a dental prosthesis. For successful implant surgery, it is crucial to locate internal structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve canal (IAC). This paper presents a computerized technique for extracting the IAC. To facilitate the extraction, we first generate panoramic CT images (panoramics) by reformatting the original CT images. The panoramics are a series of cross-sectional images along curved planes through the mandible (lower jawbone). Hollow canals are subsequently detected by analyzing the voxel intensities and 3-D gradient orientations in the panoramics. The axis of the IAC is then traced out by a novel 3-D line-tracking technique. The method is effective for extracting the IAC despite the open structure of the surrounding bone.
