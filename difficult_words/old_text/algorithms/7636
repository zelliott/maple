The SNP-based association analysis has become one of the most important approaches to interpret the underlying molecular mechanisms for human complex diseases. Nevertheless, the widely-used singe-locus analysis is only capable of capturing a small portion of susceptible SNPs with prominent marginal effects, leaving the important genetic component, epistasis or joint effects, to be undetectable. Identifying the complex interplays among multiple genes in the genome-wide context is an essential task for systematically unraveling the molecular mechanisms for complex diseases. Many approaches have been used to detect genome-wide gene-gene interactions and provided new insights into the genetic basis of complex diseases. This paper reviewed recent advances of the methods for detecting gene-gene interaction, categorized into three types, model-based and model-free statistical methods, and data mining methods, based on their characteristics in theory and numerical algorithm. In particular, the basic principle, numerical implementation and cautions for application for each method were elucidated. In addition, this paper briefly discussed the limitations and challenges associated with detecting genome-wide epistasis, in order to provide some methodological consultancies for scientists in the related fields.
