In order to highlight our understanding on ecosystems functioning and resource sharing/competition, either in artificial environment or agrosystems, according to changes in the climatic conditions, it is necessary to measure accurately element fluxes within plants. Stable isotopes allow tracking safely and accurately on a short time frame the behavior of elements in plants. After a short review devoted to isotopic studies of elemental flux within plants, we explain how a direct multiple labelling study might be conducted in a plant, so as to measure over short time nitrogen and sulfur acquisition, and assimilates arising from a labelled source.
