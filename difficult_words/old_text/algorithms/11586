The in vivo investigation of joint kinematics in normal and injured wrist requires the segmentation of carpal bones from 3D (CT) images, and their registration over time. The non-uniformity of bone tissue, ranging from dense cortical bone to textured spongy bone, the irregular shape of closely packed carpal bones, small inter-bone spaces compared to the resolution of CT images, along with the presence of blood vessels, and the inherent blurring of CT imaging render the segmentation of carpal bones a challenging task. We review the performance of statistical classification, deformable models (active contours), region growing, region competition, and morphological operations for this application. We then propose a model which combines several of these approaches in a unified framework. Specifically, our approach is to use a curve evolution implementation of region growing from initialized seeds, where growth is modulated by a skeletally-mediated competition between neighboring regions. The inter-seed skeleton, which we interpret as the predicted boundary of collision between two regions, is used to couple the growth of seeds and to mediate long-range competition between them. The implementation requires subpixel representations of each growing region as well as the inter-region skeleton. This method combines the advantages of active contour models, region growing, and both local and global region competition methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for our application where many of the difficulties presented above are overcome as illustrated by synthetic and real examples. Since this segmentation method does not rely on domain-specific knowledge, it should be applicable to a range of other medical imaging segmentation tasks.
