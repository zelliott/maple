The separation efficiency and kinetics of several commercial HPLC particle types (both fully porous and superficially porous) have been investigated using a pharmaceutical weakly basic N-containing compound as a test molecule. A strong trend between the particle size distribution (PSD) of the particles and the typically employed "goodness of packing"-parameters was observed. The relative standard deviation of the PSD of the tested particles ranged between 0.05 and 0.2, and in this range, a near linear relationship between the A-term constant, the h(min)-value and the minimal separation impedance was found. The experimental findings hence confirm the recent observations regarding the relationship between the narrow PSD of the recently commercialized porous-shell particles and their superior efficiency and kinetic performance. The outcome also suggests that the performance of the current generation of fully porous particle columns could be significantly improved if the PSD of these particles could be reduced.
