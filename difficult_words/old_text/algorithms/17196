The importance of computer-assisted analysis of a non-linear binding phenomenon through Scatchard equation has been widely acknowledged. While several user-friendly softwares [LIGAND, SCTFIT, ALLFIT] are available for determining the binding parameters of nonlinear Scatchard phenomenon, there is no easily available software covering the class of phenomena described by the McGhee and von Hippel formalism [J. Mol. Biol. 86, 469-489 (1974)]. We report here user-friendly software, SCATPLOT, developed in Turbo BASIC, for the numerical estimation of binding parameters of a non-cooperative ligand-substrate interaction doing best fit to the experimental data on the basis of McGhee and von Hippel equation for a nonlinear Scatchard plot. A new parameter has also been incorporated to guide the process of least square analysis and subsequent determination of binding parameters.
