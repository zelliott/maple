Rhinosinusitis is an important health problem which is increasing in frequency and which has a large financial repercussion on society. Better understanding of ARS management has modified our clinical approach leading us to minimize unnecessary use of radiological investigations, overuse of antibiotics, and improve the under utilisation of nasal corticosteroids. The goal of this article is to present important new guidelines mainly based on the European position paper on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps 2012 (EPOS 2012) in order to facilitate ARS management in general practice.
