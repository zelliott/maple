To assess the value of transvaginal ultrasonography with colour blood flow imaging in detecting early ovarian cancer in women with a family history of the disease.

Study of self referred symptomless women with a close relative who had developed the disease. Each woman was screened to detect persistent lesions and defined changes in ovarian volume. Morphological score and pulsatility index were recorded.

Ovarian screening clinic.

1601 self referred women.

Women with a positive screening result were recommended to have further investigations.

Findings at surgery and histology of abnormal ovaries. Morphological score > or = 5 and pulsatility index < 1.0 at last scan.

Women were aged 17 to 79 (mean 47) years; 959 (60%) were premenopausal, 469 (29%) were naturally postmenopausal, and 173 (11%) had had a hysterectomy. 157 women had a pedigree suggestive of the site specific ovarian cancer syndrome and 288 of multiple site cancers. 61 women had a positive screening result (3.8%, 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 4.9%), six of whom had primary ovarian cancer detected at surgery (five stage Ia, one stage III). Use of a high morphological score or a low pulsatility index increased the odds of finding ovarian cancer from 1:9 to about 2:5 (1:1 in the highest risk groups). Five interval cancers were reported (three ovarian and two peritoneal). Eight of the 11 cancers developed in women with pedigrees suggestive of inherited cancer.

Transvaginal ultrasonography with colour flow imaging can effectively detect early ovarian cancer in women with a family history of the disease. The screening interval should be less than two years.
