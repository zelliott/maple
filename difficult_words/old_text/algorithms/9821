The orthotropic model of the plate is established and the genetic simulated annealing algorithm is developed for optimization of the mode distribution of the orthotropic plate. The experiment results indicate that the orthotropic model can simulate the real plate better. And optimization aimed at the equal distribution of the modes in the orthotropic model is made to improve the corresponding sound pressure responses.
