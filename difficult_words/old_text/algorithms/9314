3D reconstruction from electronmicroscopic (EM) serial sections substantially differs from modeling body parts by linking convoluted planes delivered by CT and NMR. Namely, variations both in relative X-Y position and rotation of the target elements between the adjacent images and also additional problems caused by deformed, deteriorated or missing sections can only be overruled by an aligning paradigm, which exploits all the pixel-level information, and results in an optimal fitting with selected precision. This paper presents a complex computer program called Optimal Alignment, which performs the precise elaboration of X-Y shift and relative rotation of two consecutive images. The required searching process will be customized by setting four independent parameters which relate the span and density of the pixel-scanning basic process. Optimalization of fitting accuracy versus running time can be achieved by a rather short training period. The potential precision of Optimal Alignment based on complex algorithms is far superior to manual aligning of EM photographs with the eye-wrist-mouse facility. The resulted database of alignment orientation parameters can serve as an advanced source for the 3D reconstructing programs. Optimal Alignment software tool (supported by Hungarian Space Office grant TP 138) will be demonstrated on a basal forebrain NPY+ axonal reconstruction, performed in L. ZÃ¡borszky's laboratory (supported by NIH grant NSO23945).
