The University of California Davis Medical Center has offered secondary and tertiary care to pregnant patients with abnormal maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels since the start of the California alpha-Fetoprotein Screening Program in April 1986. In our first year of involvement with this method of prenatal screening, 452 patients were referred to our center for further evaluation and follow-up of either high or low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, as determined by the standard multiple of the median adjusted for maternal weight, race, and presence of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. This article presents the first-year results of our clinical experience. Information is presented concerning medical complications, screening and diagnostic test results and their confirmation, clinical procedures performed, and postpartum follow-up reports. Findings of pregnancy outcomes associated with low and high alpha-fetoprotein levels are presented and discussed.
