Scatterplots of microarray data generally contain a very large number of dots, making it difficult to get a good impression of their distribution in dense areas.

We present a fast and simple algorithm for two-dimensional histogram smoothing, to visually enhance scatterplots.

Functions for Matlab and R are available from the corresponding author.
