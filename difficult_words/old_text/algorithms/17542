This paper considers the dynamics of a discrete-time Kolmogorov system for two-species populations. In particular, permanence of the system is considered. Permanence is one of the concepts to describe the species' coexistence. By using the method of an average Liapunov function, we have found a simple sufficient condition for permanence of the system. That is, nonexistence of saturated boundary fixed points is enough for permanence of the system under some appropriate convexity or concavity properties for the population growth rate functions. Numerical investigations show that for the system with population growth rate functions without such properties, the nonexistence of saturated boundary fixed points is not sufficient for permanence, actually a boundary periodic orbit or a chaotic orbit can be attractive despite the existence of a stable coexistence fixed point. This result implies, in particular, that existence of a stable coexistence fixed point is not sufficient for permanence.
