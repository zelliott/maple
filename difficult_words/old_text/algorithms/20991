Most patients who remain comatose for a few hours after a period of global cerebral ischemia have a poor prognosis. Early identification of these patients is desirable to reduce uncertainty about treatment and non-treatment decisions, and to improve relationships with the family. The absence of pupillary light response and corneal reflexes, absent or stereotyped extension motor response to noxious stimulation (3 days after insult); myoclonus status epilepticus; absence of cortical N20 response on somatosensory evoked potential studies; generalised suppression or burst-suppression EEG and serum neuron-specific enolase above 33 microg/L (sampled 1-3 days after insult) have been shown to predict poor outcome. We here propose an algorithm to help intensive care physicians' clinical decision making in post-anoxic coma.
