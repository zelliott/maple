The kinetics of the weakly basic aromatic amine, kynurenine, with glucose were studied as model reactants aimed at mechanistic understanding of pharmaceutically relevant amine-aldehyde reactions. The reaction kinetics of the forward and reverse processes (glycosylamine formation and hydrolysis) were studied under first-order conditions in aqueous solutions at 40 degrees C in the pH range 1-6.5 in the presence of various buffers. The alpha-and beta-glycosylamines were reversibly formed via an acyclic imine that was not present in detectable quantities. Rate-limiting formation of the imine was complex and involved the addition of the amine and aldehyde to form the carbinolamine followed by the acid-catalyzed dehydration to the imine. The pH-rate profile was characterized by three kinetically distinguishable processes. At lower pH values, the profile was consistent with specific acid-catalyzed rate-determining addition of amine and aldehyde. In the pH range of 4-6 a downward bend was attributable to the change in rate determining step from addition to dehydration. In the pH region of 2-3 the rate law was described by specific acid catalysis and solvolysis of the zwitterionic form of kynurenine. Nonlinear buffer effects and Br√∂nsted plots were shown to be consistent with this interpretation of the pH-rate profile.
