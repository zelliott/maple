There are numerous clinical situations in which interventional angiography fully reveals its two-fold diagnostic and therapeutic value. The present review focuses attention on the use of such procedures in certain thoracic emergencies. Indications, diagnostic results and therapeutic advantages are examined together with possible complications. Pulmonary embolism is a serious circulatory condition that is often difficult to diagnose because of the lack of specificity of its accompanying symptoms. In these cases the role of the angiographic radiologist is often three-fold: diagnosis, therapy (possibility of carrying out locoregional thrombolysis), and prophylaxis (positioning of caval filters that prevent the migration of thrombi). Haemoptysis may arise from both the pulmonary and bronchial vessels and may be caused by various pathologies (cancer, angiodysplasia, vasculitis, aspergillosis). Angiographic study in such cases is indispensable for identifying the source of bleeding and for arresting, using embolising material, haemorrhage that it is no longer possible to control with other therapeutic modalities. Foreign bodies held in the vascular tree are in the main fragments of catheters detached accidentally or as a result of incorrect manoeuvres or for defects of construction of the material. Their removal is possible today by using, percutaneously, angiographic techniques (snare loop, basket, hook system, balloon catheters) which make it possible to hook up the fragment and remove it.
