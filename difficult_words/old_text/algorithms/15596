To provide a database of the canthal measurements of Chinese infants born in Hong Kong.

Prospective cross-sectional study.

A total of 2,371 healthy singleton, born consecutively at the Prince of Wales Hospital and the Union Hospital from June 1998 to June 2000, were included in the study. The range of gestation was 33-42 weeks.

Canthal parameters were measured and included the outer canthal distance (OCD), intercanthal distance (ICD) and palpebral fissure length (PFL). The data generally show higher values for males in the parameters measured. The measurements were also compared with data published overseas. PFL and OCD were significantly larger in Hong Kong Chinese newborn babies, whereas ICD was smaller.

This study establishes the first set of gestational age-specific standard of such craniofacial parameters for Chinese newborn babies, potentially enabling early syndromal diagnosis. There are significant inter-racial differences in these canthal parameters.
