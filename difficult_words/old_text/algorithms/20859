A frequency-selective REDOR experiment is described for SI2 spin systems. The experiment causes the net dipolar dephasing of the S spin to evolve only under the influence of one of the I spins. The experiment is based on a single pair of appropriately phased 90 degrees I-spin pulses, and the I spin causing the S-spin dipolar dephasing is determined by the relative phases between the two 90 degrees pulses. The experiment is demonstrated on a sample of 15N2-L-asparagine.
