The project reported here is the first in a series of cost analyses regarding the care planning process among 107 facilities. Process-based costing strategies and data envelopment analyses identified nursing facilities with efficient and less-efficient care planning processes. Having more people and more time devoted to the care planning process did not assure quality or efficiency. Efficiency varied across the nursing facilities and was not related to number of beds, profit status, or location; however, Medicare-certified facilities were less likely to be efficient.
