We briefly review the application of photopolymer recording materials in the area of holographic data storage. In particular we discuss the recent development of the Non-local Polymerisation Driven Diffusion model. Applying this model we develop simple first-order analytic expressions describing the spatial frequency response of photopolymer materials. The assumptions made in the derivation of these formulae are described and their ranges of validity are examined. The effects of particular physical parameters of a photopolymer on the material response are discussed.
