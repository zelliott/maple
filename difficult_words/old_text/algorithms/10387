The aim of this study was to ascertain the effect of the N form (NO(3) (-) , NH(4) (+) and organic N) and N concentration on plant isotopic fractionation and on the contribution of the different N sources to the plant N budget, in order to evaluate the feasibility of using plant δ(15) N values for discriminating between conventional and organic crops. To this end, different N concentrations (applied as NO(3) (-) ), N forms (NO(3) (-) versus NH(4) (+) ), and increasing NO(3) (-) applications to an organic N-based fertilization regime were studied.

When using NO(3) (-) as N source, intra-plant fractionation was significant and tended to increase when NO(3) (-) concentration increased in the root medium. However, negligible net isotopic fractionation was observed when comparing theoretical and measured plant δ(15) N values. On the other hand, when plants are fertilized with a mixture of NO(3) (-) and NH(4) (+) , differences in uptake patterns for both salts could result in variation in plant δ(15) N regarding to the expected value. Finally, the application of NO(3) (-) to plants was detected when it was combined with high levels of organic N sources, from 99:1 organic:inorganic N ratio.

Under certain conditions and following some considerations concerning sampling, δ(15) N values can be considered to be a potential tool to guarantee the authenticity of organic products.
