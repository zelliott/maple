We discuss an analytical approach through which the neural symbols and corresponding stimulus space of a neuron or neural ensemble can be discovered simultaneously and quantitatively, making few assumptions about the nature of the code or relevant features. The basis for this approach is to conceptualize a neural coding scheme as a collection of stimulus-response classes akin to a dictionary or 'codebook', with each class corresponding to a spike pattern 'codeword' and its corresponding stimulus feature in the codebook. The neural codebook is derived by quantizing the neural responses into a small reproduction set, and optimizing the quantization to minimize an information-based distortion function. We apply this approach to the analysis of coding in sensory interneurons of a simple invertebrate sensory system. For a simple sensory characteristic (tuning curve), we demonstrate a case for which the classical definition of tuning does not describe adequately the performance of the cell studied. Considering a more involved sensory operation (sensory discrimination), we also show that, for some cells in this system, a significant amount of information is encoded in patterns of spikes that would not be discovered through analyses based on linear stimulus-response measures.
