The unattended nature of wireless sensor networks makes them very vulnerable to malicious attacks. Therefore, how to preserve secure data collection is an important issue to wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of secure data collection for wireless sensor networks. We explore secret sharing and multipath routing to achieve secure data collection in wireless sensor network with compromised nodes. We present a novel tracing-feedback mechanism, which makes full use of the routing functionality of wireless sensor networks, to improve the quality of data collection. The major advantage of the approach is that the secure paths are constructed as a by-product of data collection. The process of secure routing causes little overhead to the sensor nodes in the network. Compared with existing works, the algorithms of the proposed approach are easy to implement and execute in resource-constrained wireless sensor networks. According to the result of a simulation experiment, the performance of the approach is better than the recent approaches with a similar purpose.
