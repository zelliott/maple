A method and device for measuring glucose concentration in a scattering medium have been developed. A spectral range of 800-1800 nm is considered for wavelength selection because of its deeper penetration into biological tissue and the presence of a glucose absorption band. An algorithm based on selected wavelengths is proposed to minimize interference from other components. The optimal distance between the light source and the detector for diffuse reflectance measurement minimizes the influence of medium scattering. The proposed algorithm and measuring device are tested with a solution containing milk with added glucose. Glucose concentrations between 0 and 2000 mg/dl are determined with a correlation coefficient of 0.977. We also investigate the influence of concentration variations of other substances such as water, hemoglobin, albumin, and cholesterol when they are mixed in a scattering medium.
