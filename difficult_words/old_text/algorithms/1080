A method for determination of the cardiac electric center on the basis of noninvasive multichannel measurements and multipole description of the cardioelectric potential is proposed. The method provides a more accurate and stable spatial location of the cardioelectric generator as compared to other methods (in particular, those based on minimization of the quadrupole potential). The position of the electric center is a useful characteristic for topical diagnosis of the electrophysiological state and function of the heart. Using mathematical models, the dependence of the position of the electric center, determined by the method presented, on the configuration and spatial position of the cardiogenerator is illustrated.
