Computational studies are used to investigate the energies of xenon binding to myoglobin and to describe pathways through the protein interior for a metmyoglobin-xenon complex. Empirical energy calculations indicate a favorable enthalpic contribution of 0.6 to 4.2 kcal/mol to xenon binding for four experimentally determined xenon sites. These calculated enthalpies help to explain the different xenon occupancies observed experimentally. A fifth site, modeled in place of the iron co-ordinated water molecule in the distal cavity, is also predicted to bind xenon. The largest contribution to the binding energy is from van der Waals' interactions with smaller contributions from polarization and protein strain terms. Ligand trajectory calculations as well as a new geometric algorithm define a connecting network of channel-like pathways through the static protein structure. One or two pathways appear to lead most easily from each major internal cavity to the protein surface. The importance of these channels in protein dynamics and their implications as routes for ligand motion are discussed.
