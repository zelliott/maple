Recent developments in the statistical analysis of DNA sequences are reviewed. The pace with which sequence data are being generated and analysed has increased with the growth of the human genome project. Two areas of activity are emphasized: attention to error rates in recorded sequences, and heterogeneity in structure of sequences. There is now empirical evidence suggesting error rates in the range 0.1%-1%, and such rates will affect evolutionary studies since these are about the rates at which DNA sequences from different individuals are expected to differ. Heterogeneity for such quantities as base composition, or lengths between successive subsequences of specified types, may be sufficient to account for observed long-range correlations between bases. The need for statistical models and analyses of DNA sequence data will continue, and will offer interesting challenges.
