Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection generally has a benign clinical course. Upper airway obstruction is a known complication requiring the otolaryngologist's attention. EBV is usually associated with adolescence but has been increasingly documented in younger children. We review 36 pediatric admissions for infectious mononucleosis over a 12-year period at our institution, 11 of which required consultation for airway obstruction. Airway management was based on clinical severity and ranged from monitored observation, with or without nasopharyngeal stenting, to prolonged intubation or emergent tonsilloadenoidectomy. A rare case of a four-year-old with near total upper airway obstruction secondary to panpharyngeal and transglottic inflammatory edema prompted this review and is reported. The otolaryngologist must recognize the potential severity of EBV-related airway compromise and be prepared to manage it.
