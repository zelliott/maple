In Escherichia coli FtsZ organizes into a cytoskeletal ring structure, the Z ring, which effects cell division. FtsZ is a GTPase, but the free energy of GTP hydrolysis does not appear to be used for generation of the constriction force, leaving open the question of the function of the GTPase activity of FtsZ. Here we study the mechanism by which SulA, an inhibitor of FtsZ induced during the SOS response, inhibits FtsZ function. We studied the effects of SulA on the in vitro activities of FtsZ, on Z rings in vivo, and on a kinetic model for FtsZ polymerization in silico. We found that the binding of SulA to FtsZ is necessary but not sufficient for inhibition of polymerization, since the assembly of FtsZ polymers in the absence of the GTPase activity was not inhibited by SulA. We developed a new model for FtsZ polymerization that accounts for the cooperativity of FtsZ and could account for cooperativity observed in other linear polymers. When SulA was included in the kinetic scheme, simulations revealed that SulA with strong affinity for FtsZ delayed, but did not prevent, the assembly of polymers when they were not hydrolyzing GTP. Furthermore, the simulations indicated that SulA controls the assembly of FtsZ by binding to a polymerization-competent form of the FtsZ molecule and preventing it from participating in assembly. In vivo stoichiometry of the disruption of Z rings by SulA suggests that FtsZ may undergo two cooperative transitions in forming the Z ring.
