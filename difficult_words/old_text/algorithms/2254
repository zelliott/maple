To assess the diagnostic value of the combination of computed tomography and angiography in patients with blunt thoracic trauma and suspicion of aortic injury.

Retrospective analysis of six patients, aged 22 to 72 years old, with traumatic thoracic aorta injury secondary to severe trauma, specially car accidents, seen between 1985 and 1994.

An early diagnosis was done in three patients. One patient, in whom diagnosis was delayed, died before surgery. In three cases, CAT scan showed indirect evidence of aortic rupture, consisting in alterations of aortic outline. In other three patients, it showed hemomediastinum, associated to a left hemothorax in one case. Angiography confirmed the diagnosis, localized and characterized the injury in all patients.

The delay in the diagnosis of aortic injury may be fatal. The combination of CAT scan and angiography has a high sensitivity and specificity to localize and characterize lesions of the aorta or its branches or associated organs, essential step for surgical planning. CAT scan restricts the use of angiography, avoiding false negative studies, but cannot be used as the sole diagnostic procedure.
