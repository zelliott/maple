The purpose of this report is to describe our recent experience using a double-skin paddle fibular free flap (DSPFFF) for reconstruction of the through-and-through anterior mandibulectomy defect and to present a reconstructive algorithm based on the extent of lip and mental skin resection.

Retrospective review of 10 consecutive patients with through-and-through anterior mandibulectomy defects.

Outcomes that were examined included methods of reconstruction based on the cutaneous defect, flap complications, fistula rate, and donor site complications.

Seven patients were reconstructed with a DSPFFF. For lip reconstruction, two patients were also concomitantly reconstructed with Karapandzic or lip advancement flaps. Three patients were reconstructed with both a fibular free flap and a second free flap (1 radial forearm fasciocutaneous flap and 2 anterolateral thigh flaps). The transverse dimensions of the DSPFFFs were as great as 15 cm. None of the patients developed a fistula. All free tissue transfers were successful. One patient developed partial loss of the fibular skin paddle used for submental skin replacement.

DSPFFF is a safe and reliable way to reconstruct an anterior through-and-through mandibular defect. Indications for using a DSPFFF are 1) a cutaneous defect that lies at or below the plane of the reconstructed mandible, 2) a transverse width of the oral mucosa and cutaneous defect that does not exceed 15 cm (the approximate distance from the mid-calf to the anterior midline), and 3) a lip defect that, if present, can be reconstructed with local flaps.
