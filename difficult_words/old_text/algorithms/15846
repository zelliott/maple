An algorithm has been developed to provide predictable control of blood glucose for 48 h following acute myocardial infarction. In 29 diabetic patients intravenous infusion of soluble insulin was started upon admission to hospital and the rate adjusted hourly on the basis of bedside capillary glucose estimations. Insulin infusion rates related to glycaemia were higher in obese patients and those with severe cardiac failure. For all patients mean admission glucose levels were reduced from 18.3 +/- 5.9 mmol l-1 to 9.1 +/- 3.3 mmol l-1 at 4 h and to 8.8 +/- 2.5 mmol l-1 at 6 h. Mean glucose concentrations for 48 h after admission were 8.2 +/- 1.3 mmol l-1 for all patients. Admission glucose levels were slightly higher in patients with severe, compared to those without or mild, cardiac failure (P less than 0.1), but levels over the following 48 h were similar. Doubling insulin infusion rates before meals did not achieve tighter glycaemic control. Hypoglycaemia (glucose less than 3 mmol l-1) occurred on 11 occasions in six patients; only two episodes were symptomatic and only two episodes occurred when the insulin rates were doubled before meals. This algorithm produced tighter glycaemic control than previously published protocols, particularly in patients with severe cardiac failure. Hypoglycaemia is uncommon and the algorithm easy to administer by nursing staff.
