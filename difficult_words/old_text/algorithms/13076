Hypothenar hammer syndrome is a rare condition of ulnar artery aneurysm or thrombosis, which can be associated with a neuropathy of the ulnar nerve. There is no agreement regarding an optimal diagnosis and treatment for this syndrome. Most authors suggest angiography as the gold standard for diagnosis and recommend observation for the thrombotic type, and reconstructive surgery for the aneurysmal type. We report here our diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm, reviewing 9 patients with ulnar artery thrombosis and nerve entrapment at Guyon's canal; and an evaluation of the type of management including: anamnesis, diagnostic tests, and reconstructive surgery. We consider resection of the arterial thrombotic segment as the treatment of choice, due to the fact that ulnar arterial thrombosis can induce severe chronic inflammation into Guyon's canal and ulnar nerve sufferance. Therefore, we propose a planned approach, including 3 steps: clinical evaluation with Tinel and Allen's tests; magnetic resonance and ultrasound images; ulnar nerve decompression and arterial reconstruction. We believe that this practice is important for the early therapy of ulnar arterio-neuropathy in affected patients.
