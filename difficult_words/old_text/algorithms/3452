Target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol was initially realized as a device for prefilled syringes (Diprifusor). New TCI systems can be used with any propofol formulation. We compared two different propofol formulations with respect to accuracy of TCI and pharmacokinetics.

A total of 10 volunteers received Diprivan 1% and Propofol 1% MCT Fresenius as TCI using the pharmacokinetic model of the Diprifusor. The prediction error was determined from measured arterial concentrations. A three-compartment model was fitted to the concentration data.

The median prediction error and the median absolute prediction error were -1.4% and 23.3% for Diprivan, and -5.9% and 17.8% for Propofol Fresenius. The drugs did not differ in pharmacokinetics but showed a smaller central volume of distribution than used for infusion control.

The pharmacokinetic model of Diprifusor can also be used for TCI of Propofol Fresenius. The large volume of distribution in this model may cause an overshoot in concentration.
