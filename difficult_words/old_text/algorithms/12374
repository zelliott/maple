A tomographic time-domain reconstruction algorithm for solving the inverse electromagnetic problem is described. The application we have in mind is dielectric breast cancer detection but the results are of general interest to the field of microwave tomography. Reconstructions have been made from experimental and numerically simulated data for objects of different sizes in order to investigate the relation between the spectral content of the illuminating pulse and the quality of the reconstructed image. We have found that the spectral content is crucial for a successful reconstruction. The work has further shown that when imaging objects with different scale lengths it is an advantage to use a multiple step procedure. Low frequency content in the pulse is used to image the large structures and the reconstruction process then proceed by using higher frequency data to resolve small scale lengths. Good agreement between the results obtained from experimental data and simulated data has been achieved.
