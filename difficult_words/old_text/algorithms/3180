Displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) is a quantitative imaging technique that encodes tissue displacement in the phase of the acquired signal. Various DENSE sequences have encoded displacement using methods analogous to the simple multipoint methods of phase contrast (PC) MRI. We developed general n-dimension balanced multipoint encoding for DENSE. Using these methods, phase noise variance decreased experimentally by 73.7%, 65.6%, and 61.9% compared with simple methods, which closely matched the theoretical decreases of 75%, 66.7%, and 62.5% for one-dimensional (1D), 2D, and 3D encoding, respectively. Phase noise covariances decreased by 99.2% and 99.3% for balanced 2D and 3D encoding, consistent with the zero-covariance prediction. The direction bias inherent to the simple methods was decreased to almost zero using balanced methods. Reduced phase noise and improved displacement and strain maps using balanced methods were visually observed in phantom and volunteer images. Balanced multipoint encoding can also be applied to PC MRI.
