The aim of this work is to make known the multicentric project AMCAC, whose objective is to describe the geographical distribution of mortality from all causes in census groups of the provincial capitals of Andalusia and Catalonia during 1992-2002 and 1994-2000 respectively, and to study the relationship between the sociodemographic characteristics of the census groups and mortality. This is an ecological study in which the analytical unit is the census group. The data correspond to 298,731 individuals (152,913 men and 145,818 women) who died during the study periods in the towns of Almeria, Barcelona, Cadiz, Cordoba, Girona, Granada, Huelva, Jaen, Lleida, Malaga, Seville and Tarragona during the study periods. The dependent variable is the number of deaths observed per census group. The independent variables are the percentage of unemployment, illiteracy and manual workers. Estimation of the moderated relative risk and the study of the associations among the sociodemographic characteristics of the census groups and the mortality will be done for each town and each sex using the Besag-York-Mollie model. Dissemination of the results will help to improve and broaden knowledge about the population's health, and will provide an important starting point to establish the influence of contextual variables on the health of urban populations.
