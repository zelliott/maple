By combining tunable broadband pulse generation with the technique of nonlinear spectral compression we demonstrate a prototype scheme for highly selective detection of air molecules by backward stimulated Raman scattering. The experimental results allow to extrapolate the laser parameters required for standoff sensing based on the recently demonstrated backward atmospheric lasing.
