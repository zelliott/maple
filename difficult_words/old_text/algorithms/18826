This paper proposes a non-Gaussian Markov field with a special feature: an explicit partition function. To the best of our knowledge, this is an original contribution. Moreover, the explicit expression of the partition function enables the development of an unsupervised edge-preserving convex deconvolution method. The method is fully Bayesian, and produces an estimate in the sense of the posterior mean, numerically calculated by means of a Monte-Carlo Markov chain technique. The approach is particularly effective and the computational practicability of the method is shown on a simple simulated example.
