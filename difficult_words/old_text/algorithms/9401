To prospectively compare maximum intensity projection (MIP) and volume rendering (VR) of multidetector computed tomographic (CT) data for the detection of small intrapulmonary nodules.

This institutional review board-approved prospective study included 20 oncology patients (eight women and 12 men; mean age, 56 years +/- 16 [standard deviation]) who underwent clinically indicated standard-dose thoracic multidetector CT and provided informed consent. Transverse thin slabs of the chest (thickness, 7 mm; reconstruction increment, 3.5 mm) were created by using MIP and VR techniques to reconstruct CT data (collimation, 16 x 0.75 mm) and were reviewed in interactive cine mode. Mean, minimum, and maximum reading time per examination and per radiologist was documented. Three radiologists digitally annotated all nodules seen in a way that clearly determined their locations. The maximum number of nodules detected by the three observers and confirmed by consensus served as the reference standard. Descriptive statistics were calculated, with P < .05 indicating a significant difference. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test and confidence intervals for differences between methods were used to compare the sensitivities of the two methods.

VR performed significantly better than MIP with regard to both detection rate (P < .001) and reporting time (P < .001). The superiority of VR was significant for all three observers and for nodules smaller than 11 mm in diameter and was pronounced for perihilar nodules (P = .023). Sensitivities achieved with VR ranged from 76.5% to 97.3%, depending on nodule size.

VR is the superior reading method compared with MIP for the detection of small solid intrapulmonary nodules.
