This paper describes a computer-aided navigation system using image fusion to support endoscopic interventions such as the accurate collection of biopsy specimens. An endoscope provides the physician with real-time ultrasound (US) and a video image. An image slice that corresponds to the corresponding image from the US scan head is derived from a preoperative computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance image volume data set using oblique reformatting and displayed side by side with the US image. The position of the image acquired by the US scan head is determined by a miniaturized electromagnetic tracking system (EMTS) after calibrating the endoscope's scan head. The transformation between the patient coordinate system and the preoperative data set is calculated using a 2D/3D registration. This is achieved by calibrating an intraoperative interventional CT slice with an optical tracking system (OTS) using the same algorithm as for the US calibration. The slice is then used for 2D/3D registration with the coordinate system of the preoperative volume. The fiducial registration error (FRE) for the US calibration was 2.0 mm +/- 0.4 mm; the interventional CT FRE was 0.36 +/- 0.12 mm; and the 2D/3D registration target registration error (TRE) was 1.8 +/- 0.3 mm. The point-to-point registration between the OTS and the EMTS had an FRE of 0.9 +/- 0.4 mm. Finally, we found an overall TRE for the complete system to be 3.9 +/- 0.6 mm.
