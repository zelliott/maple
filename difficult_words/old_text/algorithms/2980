Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) provides a means to obtain a detailed video of the small intestine. A single session with WCE may produce nearly 8h of video. Its interpretation is tedious task, which requires considerable expertise and is very stressful. The Model of Deformable Rings (MDR) was developed to preprocess WCE video and aid clinicians with its interpretation. The MDR uses a simplified model of a capsule's motion to flexibly match (register) consecutive video frames. Essentially, it computes motion-descriptive characteristics and produces a two-dimensional representation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract's internal surface - a map. The motion-descriptive characteristics are used to indicate video fragments which exhibit segmentary contractions, peristalsis, refraction phases and areas of capsule retention. Within maps, certain characteristics that indicate areas of bleeding, ulceration and obscuring froth could be recognized. Therefore, the maps allow quick identification of such abnormal areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the number of discovered pathologies and gastrointestinal landmarks increases with the MDR technique.
