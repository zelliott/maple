It is shown that cell settling is a key factor affecting the performance of roller bottle bioreactors. The two-dimensional cross-sectional flow at the center of a roller bottle is simulated using a finite difference method, and the settling behavior of cells is simulated using particle dynamics algorithms and validated experimentally using fluorescent particles. The settling behavior of particles in the roller bottle flow is studied using both steady and time dependent rotation rates. Under steady flow conditions the flow is divided into two regions: one where the particles settle to the wall and one where the particles remain suspended indefinitely. The relative size of these two regions depends on the ratio of the settling velocity to the rotation rate of the bottle. For unsteady flows generated by periodic changes of the bottle rotation direction, the settling of cells is accelerated significantly, leading to complete deposition in just a few turns of the bottle.
