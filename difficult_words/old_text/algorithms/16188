Many patients treated with radiotherapy to the pelvic region report a change in bowel habits. Loose stools, urgency and fecal incontinence may have a significant impact on daily life and social functioning.

We attempted to follow up 789 women, treated with pelvic radiotherapy for a gynecological cancer during 1991 to 2003 at two departments of gynecological oncology in Sweden. A control group of 478 women from the Swedish Population Registry was also included. As a preparatory study, we made in-depth interviews with 26 women previously treated for gynecological cancer. Based on their narratives, we constructed a study-specific questionnaire including 351 questions and validated it face-to-face. The questionnaire covered questions of physical symptoms originating in the pelvis, demographics, psychological and quality of life factors. In relation to bowel symptoms, 60 questions were asked.

Six-hundred and sixteen (78%) gynecological cancer survivors and 344 (72%) control women participated. Two-hundred and twenty-six (37%) cancer survivors reported loose stools at least once a week. Eighty-three percent of the survivors with loose stools every day reported defecation urgency with fecal leakage, compared to 20% of cancer survivors without loose stools. Cancer survivors with loose stools at least once a week were 7.7 times more likely to suffer from defecation urgency with fecal leakage (95% CI 4.4-13.3) compared to those who had loose stools once a month or less. In order to avoid loose stools affected survivors with loose stools often skipped meals (13%), made an active choice of food (47%) and preferentially used prescribed medication (36%).

There is a relation between loose stools and defecation urgency with fecal leakage among long-term gynecological cancer survivors treated with pelvic radiotherapy. Targeting loose stools can possibly help survivors to decrease frequency of fecal leakage.
