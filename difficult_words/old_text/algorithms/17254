A scheme for accurate quantification of (1)H spectra is presented. The method uses maximum-phase finite impulse response (FIR) filters for solvent suppression and an iterative nonlinear least-squares (NLLS) algorithm for parameter estimation. The estimation algorithm takes the filter influence on the metabolites of interest into account and can thereby correctly incorporate a large variety of prior knowledge into the estimation phase. The FIR filter is designed in such a way that no distortion of the important initial samples is introduced. The FIR filter method is compared numerically with the HSVD method for water signal removal in a number of examples. The results show that the FIR method, using an automatic filter design scheme, slightly outperforms the HSVD method in most cases. The good performance and ease of use of the FIR filter method combined with its low computational complexity motivate the use of the proposed method.
