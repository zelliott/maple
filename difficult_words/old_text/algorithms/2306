The efficiency of four fast simulated annealing algorithms for optimizing conformal radiation therapy treatment plans was studied and the resulting plans were compared with each other and to optimized conventional plans.

Four algorithms were selected on the basis of their reported successes in solving other minimization problems: fast simulated annealing with a Cauchy generating function, fast simulated annealing with a Lorentzian generating function, variable step size generalized simulated annealing (VSGSA), and very fast simulated reannealing (VFSR). They were tested on six clinical cases using a multiple beam coplanar conformal treatment technique. Relative beam weights were computed that maximized the minimum tumor dose subject to dose-volume constraints on normal organ doses. Following some initial tuning of the annealing parameters, each algorithm was applied identically to each test case. Optimization tests were run using different random number sequences and different numbers of iterations.

The VSGSA algorithm consistently produced the best results. Using long run times, it generated plans with the highest minimum tumor dose in five of the six cases. For the short run times, the VSGSA solutions averaged larger minimum tumor doses than those of the other algorithms for all six patients, with increases ranging from 0.4 to 5.9 Gy. For three of the patients, the conformal plan gave a clinically significant increase in the minimum tumor dose over the conventional plan, ranging from 8.2 to 13.0 Gy. In two other cases, there was little difference between the two treatment approaches. For one case, the optimized conventional plan was much better than the conformal plan because the conventional beam arrangement included wedges, which offset the multiple beam advantage of the conformal plans.

For equal computing times of both long and short duration, the VSGSA algorithm consistently produced conformal plans that were superior to those produced by the other algorithms. The simple conformal technique used in this study showed a significant potential advantage in the treatment of abdominal tumors. In three of the cases, the conformal plans showed clinically important increases in tumor dose over optimized conventional plans.
