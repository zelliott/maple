We present here a comparison of different heteronuclear dipolar decoupling sequences at the moderate magic-angle spinning (MAS) frequency (ν(r)) of 30 kHz. The radio-frequency (RF) amplitude (ν₁) ranges from the low power (ν₁<ν(r)) to the high power regime (ν₁>2ν(r)) and includes the rotary resonance conditions (ν₁=nν(r)) where n=1, 2. For decoupling at the rotary resonance condition, we recently introduced a modification of TPPM, namely high-phase TPPM, whose properties will be discussed here. Finally, based on earlier published and current experimental results we suggest the optimal sequence for heteronuclear dipolar decoupling at any RF amplitude and MAS frequencies up to 35 kHz.
