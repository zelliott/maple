Velocity measurement is a challenge for a variety of remote sensing systems such as ultrasonic and radar scanners. However, current Doppler-based techniques require a comparatively long data acquisition time. It has been suggested to use coded signals, such as linear frequency-modulated signals (chirp), for ultrasonic velocity estimation by extracting the needed information from a set of several sequential coded pulses. In this study, a method for velocity estimation using a single linear frequency-modulated chirp transmission is presented and implemented for ultrasonic measurements. The complex cross-correlation function between the transmitted and reflected signals is initially calculated. The velocity is then calculated from the phase of the peak of the envelope of this cross-correlation function. The suggested method was verified using computer simulations and experimental measurements in an ultrasonic system. Applying linear regression to the data has yielded very good correlation (r = 0.989). With the suggested technique, higher frame rates of velocity mapping can be potentially achieved relative to current techniques. Also, the same data can be utilized for both velocity mapping and image reconstruction.
