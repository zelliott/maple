We describe comprehensive hypospadias reoperation based on presence or absence of a supple urethral plate using the 3 surgical techniques of transurethral incised plate, 1-stage inlay graft and 2-stage buccal graft.

We reviewed prospective data from all reoperative hypospadias urethroplasties performed by one of us (WTS) between 2000 and 2008. Patient age, number of operations, indications for additional surgery, meatal location, reoperative surgical technique and outcomes were extracted.

A total of 133 patients underwent reoperation by transurethral incised plate (69), 1-stage inlay graft (16) or 2-stage buccal graft (48) urethroplasty. Mean number of prior failed repairs was 1.1, 1.9 and 4.3, respectively. Followup was available in 121 patients (91%), with 90 (74%) undergoing 1 successful reoperative urethroplasty. Complications occurred in 19%, 15% and 38% of patients, respectively, and most often consisted of fistulas or glans dehiscence.

Hypospadias reoperation can be accomplished using these 3 techniques without skin flaps, a potential advantage given the relative paucity of skin after failed repair. Fistulas after transurethral incised plate urethroplasty correlate with barrier layers used, while glans dehiscence is more likely in 2-stage buccal graft repairs when cheek rather than lip is used within the glans.
