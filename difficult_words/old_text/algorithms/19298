Some probabilistic results on simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in DNA sequences are derived and used to quantify the nonrandomness of SSRs as an index of nonrandomness. The applicability of the index of nonrandomness is illustrated using several examples from the literature on selected human diseased genes.
