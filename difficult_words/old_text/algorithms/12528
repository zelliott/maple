Salivary fistulas after head and neck microvascular reconstruction are difficult problems whose treatment remains controversial. Although aggressive, early operative intervention has been suggested by some groups, we have found that many patients respond to conservative management with bedside debridement and aggressive local wound care. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to review our experience with the management of postoperative salivary fistulas.

A retrospective review was performed and all patients who developed a salivary fistula after microvascular head and neck reconstruction over a 7-year period at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were identified and evaluated.

Six hundred thirty-seven patients underwent reconstruction during the study period. Of these, 35 patients developed a postoperative salivary fistula (5.4%). The majority of patients (81%) who developed fistulas shortly after the index procedure (<30 days) were successfully treated with conservative management. Similarly, 50% of late salivary fistulas (>30 days) responded to bedside debridement and wound care. There were no significant differences in the rate of total flap loss, carotid artery blowout, delay in onset of adjuvant radiation therapy (>6 weeks), or return to oral feeds between the conservative and operatively managed groups.

Aggressive surgical intervention in early postoperative salivary fistulas is usually not necessary, although the treatment plan should be individualized. Bedside debridement and aggressive wound care are adequate in most cases of early salivary fistulas. This approach is not associated with an increased rate of complications.
