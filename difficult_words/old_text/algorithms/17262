A soil isolate representing the putatively novel species 'Nocardia uniformis' was found to have morphological, staining and chemotaxonomic properties consistent with its classification in the genus Nocardia. An almost complete sequence of the 16S rDNA of the strain was determined following cloning and sequencing of the amplified gene. The sequence was aligned with those available for nocardiae and phylogenetic trees were inferred using four tree-making algorithms. The organism was consistently associated with the type strain of Nocardia otitidiscaviarum albeit with a relatively low bootstrap value recorded for neighbour-joining analysis. The strain was also readily separated from representatives of all validly described Nocardia species using a set of phenotypic properties. The genotypic and phenotypic data indicate that the strain should be assigned to the genus Nocardia as a new species. The name proposed for the new species is Nocardia uniformis. The type strain is JCM 3224T.
