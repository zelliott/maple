The accumulating evidence for the role of homocysteine as a risk factor for atherosclerosis is persuasive. A high plasma homocysteine concentration induces pathologic changes in the arterial wall and thus is strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, manifested as cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular events. Studies are being conducted to determine whether lowering homocysteine levels prevents occlusive events. At present, testing for elevated homocysteine concentrations should be considered in patients with premature atherosclerosis or a strong family history of atherosclerosis, since hyperhomocysteinemia is a common risk factor in these patients. Treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia is straightforward and associated with minimal risk. This disorder is usually correctable with vitamin supplements containing folic acid.
