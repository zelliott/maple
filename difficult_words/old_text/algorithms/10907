Vancomycin, a "last chance" antibiotic, is a glycopeptide consisting of an oligopeptide unit being potentially the effective binder of Cu2+ ions. The potentiometric and spectroscopic studies (UV-Vis, CD, EPR, NMR) have shown that, indeed, the peptide unit binds cupric ions very effectively forming almost instantly the 3N complex involving the N-terminal nitrogen donors in the metal ion coordination. The comparison of the binding ability of vancomycin with other peptide chelators clearly shows the efficiency of this antibiotic in metal ion coordination. It is very likely that Cu2+ ions may play a crucial role in the pharmacology of vancomycin, particularly when administered in high doses.
