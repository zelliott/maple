We use the concept of steady-state characteristic of a population using a single limiting resource, in order to discuss the issue of the competition of many species for the same resource. The steady-state characteristic is a curve that is associated to each species, likely to be determined empirically. Once one knows the steady-state characteristics and the dynamic of the renewal of the resource, it is possible to predict to some extent the issue of the competition and to give sufficient conditions for coexistence.
