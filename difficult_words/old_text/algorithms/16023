We studied the complexity of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in schizophrenic patients by estimating the first Lyapunov exponent (L1), which might serve as an indicator of the specific brain function in schizophrenia. We recorded the EEG from 25 schizophrenic patients (12 male, 13 female; age=25.1+/-7.0 years) fulfilling DSM-IV criteria and 15 healthy controls (9 male, 6 female; age=27. 8+/-4.2 years) at 16 electrodes, different from previous studies which recorded the EEGs at limited electrodes. We employed a method with an optimal embedding dimension to calculate the L1s. For limited noisy data, this algorithm was strikingly faster and more accurate than previous ones. Our results showed that the schizophrenic patients had lower values of the L1 at the left inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions compared with normal controls. These results for L1 in non-linear analysis have some differences from those for power ratios in linear analysis. These suggest that the non-linear analysis of the EEGs such as the estimation of the L1 might be a useful tool in analyzing EEG data to explore the neurodynamics of the brains of schizophrenic patients.
