This paper introduces an ECG computing algorithm that computes ECG based on the action potential of single cardiac cell. Taking solid angle analysis as tool, this algorithm analyzes the field potential of a cardiac cell that connects and communicates with neighboring cells. This algorithm has been implemented in our electrophysiological model CardioAuto, which was built with extended Cellular 3.0-a cellular automata system. Algorithm and simulation results reveal that it is the transmembrane potential slope among cell group that contributes to ECG waveform generation and determines the waveform deflection. To a specific lead location, whenever cell group has a transmembrane potential slope that proximal end is higher than distal end, a downward ECG deflection is generated. Whenever cell group has a reverse transmembrane potential slope, an upward ECG deflection is generated. Whenever there is no transmembrane potential slope, ECG keeps on baseline. According to our algorithm, the significance of normal and many abnormal ECG waveforms can be analyzed and interpreted at cellular level.
