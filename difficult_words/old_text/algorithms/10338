This works addresses the problem of reconstructing multiple T1- or T2-weighted images of the same anatomical cross section from partially sampled K-space data. Previous studies in reconstructing magnetic resonance (MR) images from partial samples of the K-space used compressed sensing (CS) techniques to exploit the spatial correlation of the images (leading to sparsity in wavelet domain). Such techniques can be employed to reconstruct the individual T1- or T2-weighted images. However, in the current context, the different images are not really independent; they are images of the same cross section and, hence, are highly correlated. We exploit the correlation between the images, along with the spatial correlation within the images to achieve better reconstruction results than exploiting spatial correlation only. For individual MR images, CS-based techniques lead to a sparsity-promoting optimization problem in the wavelet domain. In this article, we show that the same framework can be extended to incorporate correlation between images leading to group/row sparsity-promoting optimization. Algorithms for solving such optimization problems have already been developed in the CS literature. We show that significant improvement in reconstruction accuracy can be achieved by considering the correlation between different T1- and T2-weighted images. If the reconstruction accuracy is considered to be constant, our proposed group sparse formulation can yield the same result with 33% less K-space samples compared with simple sparsity-promoting reconstruction. Moreover, the reconstruction time by our proposed method is about two to four times less than the previous method.
