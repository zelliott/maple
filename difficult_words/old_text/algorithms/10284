Although it is generally believed that venous thromboembolism (VTE) after shoulder surgery is very rare, there are increasing reports of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) associated with shoulder surgery. To our knowledge only few studies have reviewed the available evidence on the subject. The purpose of this study was to review the available evidence in the published literature regarding incidence, risk factors, diagnosis and management of DVT/PE following shoulder surgery (Level IV evidence).
