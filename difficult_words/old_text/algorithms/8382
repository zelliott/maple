A time-resolved indeterministic Monte Carlo (IMC) simulation technique is proposed for the efficient construction of the early part of the temporal point spread function (TPSF) of visible or near infrared photons transmitted through an optically thick scattering medium. By assuming a detected photon is a superposition of photon components, the photon is repropagated from a point in the original path where a significant delay in forward propagation occurred. A weight is then associated with each subsequently detected photon to compensate for shorter components. The technique is shown to reduce the computation time by a factor of at least 4 when simulating the sub-200 picosecond region of the TPSF and hence provides a useful tool for analysis of single photon detection in transillumination imaging.
