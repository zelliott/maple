A mathematical model is proposed for prediction of the efficacy of glucocorticoid therapy developed on the basis of the Bayes theorem and successive Wald's analysis. The model uses the retrospective values of the results of radioligand determination of the number of glucocorticoid receptor of lymphocytes and static renal scintigraphy. By means of the blind method the informative value of the mathematical model to predict the inefficacy of glucocorticoid therapy in nephrotic glomerulonephritis was 96%. A nomogram was developed.
