A capacitor pressure sensor (CPS) is modeled for accurate readout of applied pressure using a novel artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed functional link ANN (FLANN) is a computationally efficient nonlinear network and is capable of complex nonlinear mapping between its input and output pattern space. The nonlinearity is introduced into the FLANN by passing the input pattern through a functional expansion unit. Three different polynomials such as, Chebyschev, Legendre and power series have been employed in the FLANN. The FLANN offers computational advantage over a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for similar performance in modeling of the CPS. The prime aim of the present paper is to develop an intelligent model of the CPS involving less computational complexity, so that its implementation can be economical and robust. It is shown that, over a wide temperature variation ranging from -50 to 150 degrees C, the maximum error of estimation of pressure remains within +/- 3%. With the help of computer simulation, the performance of the three types of FLANN models has been compared to that of an MLP based model.
