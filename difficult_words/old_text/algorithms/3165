Subtraction methods in angiography are generally applied in order to enhance the visualization of blood vessels by eliminating bones and surrounding tissues from X-ray images. The main limitation of these methods is the sensitivity to patient movement, which leads to artifacts and reduces the clinical value of the subtraction images. In this paper we present a novel method for rigid motion compensation with primary application to road mapping, frequently used in image-guided interventions. Using the general concept of image-based registration, we optimize the physical position and orientation of the C-arm X-ray device, thought of as the rigid 3D transformation accounting for the patient movement. The registration is carried out using a hierarchical optimization strategy and a similarity measure based on the variance of intensity differences, which has been shown to be most suitable for fluoroscopic images. Performance evaluation demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed approach to compensate for potential intra-operative patient motion, being more resilient to the fundamental problems of pure image-based registration.
