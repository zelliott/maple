We present a simple and efficient scheme that combines multiple descriptions coding with wavelet transform under JPEG2000 image coding architecture. To reduce packet losses, controlled amounts of redundancy are added to the wavelet transform coefficients to produce multiple descriptions of wavelet coefficients during the compression process to produce multiple descriptions bit-stream of a compressed image. Even if a receiver gets only parts of descriptions (other descriptions being lost), it can still reconstruct image with acceptable quality. Specifically, the scheme uses not only high-performance wavelet transform to improve compression efficiency, but also multiple descriptions technique to enhance the robustness of the compressed image that is transmitted through unreliable network channels.
