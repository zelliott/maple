The authors have developed the algorithm for differential diagnosis of coronary heart disease associated with arterial hypertension. The algorithm was devised using the comparative data of precordial mapping made for 29 and 60 coronary disease patients with arterial hypertension and coronary stenosis without left ventricular myocardial cicatrices, hypertrophy and dilatation, respectively, as well as for 30 hypertensive subjects without coronary angiography signs of coronary stenosis, but with left ventricular hypertrophy established at echocardiography. Sixty normal subjects served as control. The algorithm sensitivity reached 70%, specificity 73%.
