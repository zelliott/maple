Metabolic myopathies are a clinically and etiologically heterogeneous group of disorders due to defects in muscular energy metabolism. They include glycogen storage diseases, fatty acid oxidation defects, and mitochondrial disorders. The typical manifestations of a metabolic myopathy are exercise-induced myalgias, exercise intolerance, and cramps. Evaluating subjects with such symptoms is not easy because of the frequent lack of clinical features. Exercise tests are, therefore, reliable screening tools. Here, we discuss the possible role of such exercise testing techniques in the diagnostic approach of a patient with suspected metabolic myopathy.
