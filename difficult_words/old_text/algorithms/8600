Medical image segmentation techniques typically require some form of expert human supervision to provide accurate and consistent identification of anatomic structures of interest. A novel segmentation technique was developed that combines a knowledge-based segmentation system with a sophisticated active contour model. This approach exploits the guidance of a higher-level process to robustly perform the segmentation of various anatomic structures. The user need not provide initial contour placement, and the high-level process carries out the required parameter optimization automatically. Knowledge about the anatomic structures to be segmented is defined statistically in terms of probability density functions of parameters such as location, size, and image intensity (eg, computed tomographic [CT] attenuation value). Preliminary results suggest that the performance of the algorithm at chest and abdominal CT is comparable to that of more traditional segmentation techniques like region growing and morphologic operators. In some cases, the active contour-based technique may outperform standard segmentation methods due to its capacity to fully enforce the available a priori knowledge concerning the anatomic structure of interest. The active contour algorithm is particularly suitable for integration with high-level image understanding frameworks, providing a robust and easily controlled low-level segmentation tool. Further study is required to determine whether the proposed algorithm is indeed capable of providing consistently superior segmentation.
