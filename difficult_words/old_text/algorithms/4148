Renal transplant patients often require imaging to ensure appropriate graft placement, to assess integrity of transplant vessel anastomosis and to evaluate for stenosis that can be a cause of graft failure. Because there is risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in the setting of renal insufficiency, the use of non-contrast MRA in these patients is helpful. In this study, the ability of two non-contrast MRA methods - 3D radial linear combination balanced SSFP (VIPR-SSFP) and inflow-weighted Cartesian SSFP (IFIR) - to visualize the transplant renal vessels is compared. Twenty-one renal transplant patients were scanned using the VIPR-SSFP and IFIR sequences. Diagnostic efficacy of the sequences was scored using a four point Likert scale according to the following criteria: overall image quality, fat suppression, and arterial/venous visualization quality. Average scores for each criterion were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In addition to significantly improved venous visualization, the VIPR-SSFP sequence provided significantly improved fat suppression quality (p<0.03) compared to IFIR. VIPR-SSFP also identified several pathologies such as renal arterial pseudoaneurysm that were not visible on the IFIR images. However, IFIR afforded superior quality of arterial visualization (p<0.005). These two methods of non-contrast MR imaging each have significant strengths and are complementary to each other in evaluating the vasculature of renal allografts.
