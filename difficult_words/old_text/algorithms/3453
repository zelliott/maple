We present an empirical model of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal based on the construction of a stochastic limit cycle oscillator using Ito calculus. This formulation, where the noise influences actually interact with the dynamics, is substantially different from the usual definition of measurement noise. Analysis of model data is compared with actual EEG data using both traditional methods and modern techniques from nonlinear time series analysis. The model demonstrates visually displayed patterns and statistics that are similar to actual EEG data. In addition, the nonlinear mechanisms underlying the dynamics of the model do not manifest themselves in nonlinear time series analysis, paralleling the situation with real, non-pathological EEG data. This modeling exercise suggests that the EEG is optimally described by stochastic limit cycle behavior.
