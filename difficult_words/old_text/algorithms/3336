Traditionally, management of exposed hardware has included irrigation and d√©bridement, intravenous antibiotics, and likely removal of the hardware. Increasingly, the goal of wound closure without hardware removal using plastic surgical techniques of soft-tissue reconstruction has been emphasized. Identification of parameters for retaining exposed hardware may assist surgeons with management decisions and outcomes.

A current literature review was performed to identify parameters with prognostic relevance for management of exposed hardware before soft-tissue reconstruction.

The following parameters were identified as important for the potential salvage of exposed hardware with soft-tissue coverage: hardware location, infection, duration of exposure, and presence of hardware loosening.

Management of exposed hardware has included the removal of the hardware. However, if certain criteria are met--specifically, stable hardware, time of exposure less than 2 weeks, lack of infection, and location of hardware--salvage of the hardware with plastic surgical soft-tissue coverage may be a therapeutic option.
