In this study, a three-zone carousel process based on a proper molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) resin was developed for continuous separation of Cu(2+) from Mn(2+) and Co(2+). For this task, the Cu (II)-imprinted polymer (Cu-MIP) resin was synthesized first and used to pack the chromatographic columns of a three-zone carousel process. Prior to the experiment of the carousel process based on the Cu-MIP resin (MIP-carousel process), a series of single-column experiments were performed to estimate the intrinsic parameters of the three heavy metal ions and to find out the appropriate conditions of regeneration and re-equilibration. The results from these single-column experiments and the additional computer simulations were then used for determination of the operating parameters of the MIP-carousel process under consideration. Based on the determined operating parameters, the MIP-carousel experiments were carried out. It was confirmed from the experimental results that the proposed MIP-carousel process was markedly effective in separating Cu(2+) from Mn(2+) and Co(2+) in a continuous mode with high purity and a relatively small loss. Thus, the MIP-carousel process developed in this study deserves sufficient attention in materials processing industries or metal-related industries, where the selective separation of heavy metal ions with the same charge has been a major concern.
