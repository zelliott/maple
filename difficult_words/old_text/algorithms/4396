An iterative algorithm is presented that allows the user to model the subsurface residence time of shallow ground water comprising stream base flow based on decadal scale variation of tritium concentrations. The algorithm accounts for the effects of radioactive decay, the shallow subsurface mixing of ground water with precipitation, and ground water flux. The inverse of the best-fitting modeled flux through the saturated zone is equivalent to the residence time. The data required for this model include at least two measurements of tritium in base flow for a given stream location made at least a decade apart and the long-term tritium input in precipitation for the region of interest. The model is sensitive to relatively small changes in tritium concentrations and is limited by analytic uncertainties to an accuracy of approximately +/-5 years. The algorithm was applied to stream base flow for several basins in the Piedmont Province of Georgia in which tritium concentrations were measured during the early 1990s and again in the 2000s. The model results produced highly concordant residence times for three hydrogeologically similar basins in the Upper Ocmulgee Basin in North Central Georgia. The best estimate of the average residence time for ground water comprising base flow in this Piedmont basin using this new method is between approximately 14 and 18 years. These results are generally consistent with calculations made in previous studies, and these relatively long residence times can be attributed to the storage of water in the clay soils that dominate Piedmont Province watersheds.
