Sib pair linkage studies are now widely used to investigate the genetic factors implicated in complex quantitative traits. To increase the power of these approaches, it has been proposed to select extremely discordant (ED) sib pairs which are expected to contain the highest linkage information. However, it is known that sibships of larger size contain more linkage information than independent sib pairs. In this paper we compare, in terms of power and cost considerations, the ED strategy, which uses information on sib pairs only, to the recently developed 'Maximum Likelihood Binomial' sibship-oriented method performed on the whole sibships from which the ED sib pairs have been extracted. We show that the use of these whole sibships is an efficient alternative to approaches focusing on ED sib pairs only.
