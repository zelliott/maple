We discuss the Dempster-Shafer belief structure. We introduce the idea of a cumulative distribution induced by a Dempster-Shafer belief structure. We call these belief-cumulative distribution (B-CDs) functions. We study the properties of these distribution functions and show that they are interval functions. We investigate the possibility of using these distribution functions as a tool for knowledge representation.
