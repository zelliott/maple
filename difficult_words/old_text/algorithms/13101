Coimaging employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging and MRI is used for rapid in vivo oximetry conducted simultaneously across multiple organs of a mouse. A recently developed hybrid EPR-NMR coimaging instrument is used for both EPR and NMR measurements. Oxygen sensitive particulate EPR probe is implanted in small localized pockets, called sites, across multiple regions of a live mouse. Three dimensional MRI is used to generate anatomic visualization, providing precise locations of implant sites. The pOâ‚‚ values, one for every site, are then estimated from EPR measurements. To account for radio frequency (RF) phase inhomogeneities inside a large resonator carrying a lossy sample, a generalization of an existing EPR data model is proposed. Utilization of known spectral lineshape, sparse distribution, and known site locations reduce the EPR data collection by more than an order of magnitude over a conventional spectral-spatial imaging, enhancing the feasibility of in vivo EPR oximetry for clinically relevant models.
