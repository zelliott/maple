Indications for surgical therapy in uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease have decreased considerably since the introduction of H2-receptor blocking drugs and more recently omeprazole. On the other side, the number of acute complications such as perforation or hemorrhage has remained nearly constant. The recent literature seems to indicate that the pattern of patients presenting with complications has changed and that the number of acute ulcers has increased. In a review of 283 patients, we found 150 perforated ulcers (PU) and 133 bleeding ulcers (BU). Almost all the patients with PU and 70% of the patients with BU have been treated operatively. The mortality is 14.3% and 12.5%, respectively. The vast majority of our patients have chronic ulcers, and only 7% have acute or subacute lesions confirmed by histologic examination. Based on our experience and the literature, we propose a therapeutic algorythm for these two conditions.
