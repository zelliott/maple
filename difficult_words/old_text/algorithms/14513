The Serbian natural zeolite is moderately effective in removing the zinc(II) ions from aqueous solutions. At 298 K the sorption capacity varies from 13 to 26% for the initial Zn(II) solution concentration of 100 and 600 mg Zndm(-3), respectively. The sorption isotherm at 298-338 K is best represented by the Langmuir model and the sorption kinetics by the pseudo-second-order model. The sorption involves a combination of film diffusion, intra-particle diffusion, and a chemical cation-exchange between the Na(+) ions of clinoptilolite and Zn(2+) ions. The sorption was found to be endothermic and spontaneous in the 298-338 K range. The exhausted sorbent can remove phosphate ions and it exhibits an excellent antibacterial activity towards Acinetobacter junii. By dehydration at about 500 Â°C it transforms to a ZnO-containing product featuring nano-sized wurtzite ZnO particles widespread over the clinoptilolite surface.
