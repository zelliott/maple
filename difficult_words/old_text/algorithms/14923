In this paper, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE's) are synthesized by an active auditory model, and decomposed by continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to study the frequency-latency relationship and the generation of TEOAE signals. The controlled voltage sources that relate to the mobile mechanism of the outer hair cells (OHC's) are proposed to serve as the generation sources of TEOAE signals. The state-variable method is adopted to calculate the auditory model. The mother wavelet used in CWT is selected on basis of the model. The results of this study show that the simulated TEOAE signal is similar to the clinically detected ones not only in the time-domain waveform, but also in the frequency-latency relationship. It seems to be clear that the generation of TEOAE signals is related to the same active mechanism as the cochlear sharp frequency selectivity.
