The sensitivity of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, second edition (DISC-2.1) was examined for certain "rare" disorders: eating disorders, major depressive episode, obsessive compulsive disorder, psychosis, tic disorders, and substance use disorders.

Subjects recruited from specialized centers were interviewed with the DISC-2.1; the centers' diagnoses served as the criterion measure.

Overall the DISC showed good to excellent sensitivity (range = 0.73 to 1.0). Used alone, the DISC-P (parent interview) was generally more sensitive than the DISC-C (child interview). Areas for additional instrument revision were identified. Recommendations about informant choice by diagnosis are offered.

The strategy used in this study was useful for assessing the DISC's sensitivity for these disorders. Additional work examining specificity of the DISC remains to be done. The DISC should prove a useful adjunct in clinical settings given the ease and relatively low cost of administration.
