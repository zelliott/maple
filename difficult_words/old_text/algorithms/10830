The paper describes the algorithm of choice of the threshold level of fluorescence, which identifies the positive and negative results of lanthanide immunofluorescence assay when IgM and IgG antibodies to the causative agents of Ixodes tick-borne borreliosis are detected in the sera of patients. The diagnostic specificity index of the method in detecting antibodies of both types was 95.3% for the chosen value. According to the time of sampling, the diagnostic sensitivity indices for IgM and IgG antibodies were 10.4 to 40.9% and 3.3 to 18.2%, respectively.
