A quantitative biomechanical model describes the tissue transformation during healing of a transverse osteotomy of a sheep metatarsal. The model predicts bridging of the bone ends through cartilage, followed by the growth of a callus cuff, and finally, the resorption of callus after ossification of the interfragmentary gap. We suggest bone density or the modulus of elasticity do not sufficiently characterize healing tissue for predictive purposes. In addition to the stimulus reflected by strain energy density we introduce a new osteogenic factor based upon stress gradients and which predicts areas of a high osteogenic capacity. Our model distinguishes three basic types of tissue, namely bone, cartilage and fibrous tissue. A fuzzy controller is proposed to model the tissue reaction. A set of fuzzy rules derived from medical knowledge has been implemented to describe tissue transformation such as intramembraneous or chondral ossification, atrophy or destruction. Fuzzy logic is able to model tissue transformation processes within the numerical simulation of remodeling processes. This approach improves the simulation tools and affords the potential to optimize planning of animal experiments and conduct parametric studies.
