The choice of the most suitable chemotherapy schedule for the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer has been reviewed by the TTD group, as well as the principles of risk assessment for patients with stage II disease. In the light of data now available, oxaliplatin- based schedules (FOLFOX4 or FLOX) are recommended. Alternatives in special situations are monotherapy with capecitabine, UFT/LV, or 5- FU/LV in infusion. In patients with stage II disease, the indication of chemotherapy must be individualized and based on the patient's risk of recurrence (perforation, obstruction, peritumoral lymphovascular involvement, poorly differentiated histology, number of lymph nodes examined < or = 11, pre-surgical CEA), and comorbidities that can compromise the safety of treatment or survival of the patient.
