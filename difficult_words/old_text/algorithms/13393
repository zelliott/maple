Drug safety and adverse drug reactions in the community are of concern in the geriatric population. To help decrease the number of adverse drug reactions, the New Mexico Prescription Improvement Coalition created a consensus panel, the Potentially Inappropriate Medications (PIMs) Advisory Board.

To develop consensus guidelines that would promote decreasing the use of PIMs, as defined by the Beers' criteria, through the promotion of safer alternative therapies and strategies.

A consensus panel of clinical pharmacists, geriatricians, nurses, managed care specialists, and consumers evaluated the Beers' criteria and created clinical guidelines addressing the use of PIMs in older adults and disease state alternative treatment recommendations and strategies. The guidelines were distributed and made available electronically to health care providers. In addition, educational sessions were provided to health care providers throughout the state. Since development of the guidelines in 2009, they have been distributed to over 7500 practitioners and 140 pharmacists throughout New Mexico.

The PIMs clinical guidelines were endorsed by 27 state-level health care organizations and have been promoted through several managed care organizations. The Web-based version of the guidelines have been viewed an average of 163 times per month and the alternative treatment recommendations and strategies was viewed an average of 407 times per month.

Use of a consensus process to develop and promote guidelines that include alternative treatment recommendations and strategies can increase awareness of the use of medications that require caution in the elderly and promote safer prescribing practices.
