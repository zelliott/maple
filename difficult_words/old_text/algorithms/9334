Brain function requires oxygen and maintenance of brain capillary oxygenation is important. We evaluated how faithfully frontal lobe near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) follows haemoglobin saturation (SCap) and how calculated mitochondrial oxygen tension (PMitoO2) influences motor performance. Twelve healthy subjects (20 to 29 years), supine and seated, inhaled O2 air-mixtures (10% to 100%) with and without added 5% carbon dioxide and during hyperventilation. Two measures of frontal lobe oxygenation by NIRS (NIRO-200 and INVOS) were compared with capillary oxygen saturation (SCap) as calculated from the O2 content of brachial arterial and right internal jugular venous blood. At control SCap (78%+/-4%; mean+/-s.d.) was halfway between the arterial (98%+/-1%) and jugular venous oxygenation (SvO2; 61%+/-6%). Both NIRS devices monitored SCap (P<0.001) within approximately 5% as SvO2 increased from 39%+/-5% to 79%+/-7% with an increase in the transcranial ultrasound Doppler determined middle cerebral artery flow velocity from 29+/-8 to 65+/-15 cm/sec. When SCap fell below approximately 70% with reduced flow and inspired oxygen tension, PMitoO2 decreased (P<0.001) and brain lactate release increased concomitantly (P<0.001). Handgrip strength correlated with the measured (NIRS) and calculated capillary oxygenation values as well as with PMitoO2 (r>0.74; P<0.05). These results show that NIRS is an adequate cerebral capillary-oxygenation-level-dependent (COLD) measure during manipulation of cerebral blood flow or inspired oxygen tension, or both, and suggest that motor performance correlates with the frontal lobe COLD signal.
