We report on the application of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) classification method to the task of categorizing texts according to their register and the style of their author. The SOM has been selected as its performance in various data-mining applications has been found to be highly successful. Here, the method is evaluated against the task of clustering textual data which are corpora of texts written in the Greek language; the parameters used depict linguistically important structural properties of the texts. The experiments reported indicate that the SOM results are equivalent to those generated by statistical methods.
