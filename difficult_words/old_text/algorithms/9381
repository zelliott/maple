This guidance for the management of patients with chronic urticaria and angio-oedema has been prepared by the Standards of Care Committee (SOCC) of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI). The guideline is based on evidence as well as on expert opinion and is aimed at both adult physicians and paediatricians practising in allergy. The recommendations are evidence graded. During the development of these guidelines, all BSACI members were included in the consultation process using a web-based system. Their comments and suggestions were carefully considered by the SOCC. Where evidence was lacking a consensus was reached by the experts on the committee. Included in this guideline are clinical classification, aetiology, diagnosis, investigations, treatment guidance with special sections on children with urticaria, and the use of antihistamines in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Finally, we have made recommendations for potential areas of future research.
