The Young's modulus of graphene is estimated by measuring the strain applied by a pressure difference across graphene membranes using Raman spectroscopy. The strain induced on pressurized graphene balloons can be estimated directly from the peak shift of the Raman G band. By comparing the measured strain with numerical simulation, we obtained the Young's modulus of graphene. The estimated Young's modulus values of single- and bilayer graphene are 2.4 ± 0.4 and 2.0 ± 0.5 TPa, respectively.
