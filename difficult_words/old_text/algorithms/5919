We present a selective spatial tessellation algorithm that is specifically optimized for instrument-to-tissue and instrument-to-instrument collision detection cases, which are the essential part of interaction modeling in surgery simulation with haptic feedback. Virtual surgeries demand haptic rate collision solutions only when instruments are involved in collisions. Other collision cases can be processed at slower rates. The proposed selective tessellation algorithm is capable of differentiating among various collision cases and assigning different priorities to their processing. Without making assumptions about any object movement, the algorithm derives clipping volume as collision detection regions which tightly enclose the objects of interest. Results of implementation of the algorithm in a surgical simulation are provided.
