An algorithm and a personal computer program for automatic distinguishing between EEC records containing evoked and no potentials, based on the detected invariants reflecting experts' experience in evoked potential analysis have been developed. The efficiency of the programme (its high accuracy and speed, low volume) has been demonstrated in the system for automatic determination of the hearing level by long-latent evoked potentials. It is easily modifiable to identify evoked potentials from other modalities (visual, somatosensory ones) in the systems using the traditional and/or up-to-date computerized EEC equipment.
