Posaconazole (PSZ) may be an attractive alternative for antifungal prophylaxis in children with chronic granulomatous disease. Experience with PSZ in pediatric patients is limited, and no specific dose recommendations exist. A twice daily dosing algorithm based on allometric scaling (body-weight based) for PSZ results in adequate exposure and appears to be safe in children with chronic granulomatous disease.
