A cultured, allogeneic, bi-layered human skin equivalent has recently become available to help clinicians manage difficult-to-heal venous ulcers. This skin equivalent has an epidermis and dermis similar to human skin. Its living keratinocytes and fibroblasts are from cultured cell banks derived from human neonatal foreskin. Because the skin equivalent is made up of viable human cells, it cannot be terminally sterilized. Safety concerns, which have been addressed, include the risk of possible transmission of infection, immunogenicity, immunological graft rejection, and tumor formation. However, the maternal blood of the neonatal donor and the master cell banks are screened for infectious agents. Additionally, the human skin equivalent is produced under strict aseptic control, with sterility continuously monitored by the Good Manufacturing Processes. This paper reviews the characteristics of this human skin equivalent and provides practice guidelines.
