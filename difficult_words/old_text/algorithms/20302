A physiologically based toxicokinetic model was developed for inhalation exposure of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB) in man. The model consists of six compartments for TMB and one compartment for the metabolite 3,4-dimethylhippuric acid (DMHA). Based on previous experimental findings from human exposures to TMB, liver metabolism was divided in two pathways, one of the first order and one of the Michaelis-Menten type. Muscle tissue was split in two compartments to account for working and resting muscle tissues during bicycle exercise. The model was used to investigate how various factors influence potential biomarkers of exposure, i.e., TMB in blood and exhaled air and DMHA in urine. Increasing the work load from rest to moderate exercise (100 W) more than doubled all biomarker levels end of shift. The effect on next morning levels was even more pronounced, illustrated by a fivefold increase in the DMHA excretion rate. Simulations of five daily 8-h exposures suggest that biomarker levels end of shift remain fairly constant whereas the levels prior to shift increase gradually during the week. This suggests that end of shift levels reflect the exposure of the same day whereas levels Friday morning reflect exposure during the entire working week. Simulations with randomly generated exposures show that the variability due to fluctuating exposure is lower next morning than end of shift. End of shift exhalation rate of TMB is more sensitive to fluctuation than TMB in venous blood and DMHA in urine. Biomarker levels for 25 ppm exposure at different sampling times are given.
