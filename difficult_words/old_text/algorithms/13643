Unintentional renal artery occlusion after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is an uncommon phenomenon. The sequelae from this specific complication are severe; consequently, the topic of renal artery coverage is a pertinent issue. We present a case series of patients undergoing EVAR with unintentional renal artery coverage, review the treatment options available, and suggest a treatment algorithm for this scenario based on the evidence.

We report four patients who were found to have renal artery occlusion after EVAR detected up to 5 weeks postoperatively. Renal revascularization was achieved using endovascular renal artery stenting in two patients, and open hepato-spleno-renal bypass in the remaining two cases. Treatment strategies used led to symptom resolution and recovery of renal function in all cases.

Both open and endovascular techniques may be used as procedures to treat this condition-the choice of procedure is primarily determined by accessibility of the renal orifice.
