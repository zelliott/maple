A proposed benefit of dual-chamber arrhythmia discrimination is a reduction in inappropriate therapy in implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). The aim of this meta-analysis was to establish whether dual-chamber arrhythmia discrimination algorithms reduce inappropriate device therapy.

Public domain databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, were searched from 1996 to 2006. Two investigators abstracted data independently. Pooled estimates were calculated using both fixed-effects and random-effects models. We retrieved 5 prospective studies comparing dual-chamber with single-chamber arrhythmia discrimination, accumulating data on 748 patients. Pooled per-patient based analysis demonstrated that the number of patients receiving inappropriate ICD therapy was not different between single- and dual-chamber devices (odds ratio [OR] 1.23; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.81; p=0.31). Per-episode based analysis demonstrated a favoring benefit for dual-chamber arrhythmia discrimination (OR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.78; p<0.001). A mean reduction of 1.1 inappropriately treated atrial episodes per patient was observed with dual-chamber arrhythmia discrimination (p<0.001).

Dual-chamber arrhythmia discrimination is associated with a reduction in the number of inappropriate treated episodes. The number of patients who experience inappropriate therapy is not reduced by dual-chamber discrimination.
