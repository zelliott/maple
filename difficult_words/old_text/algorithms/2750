The first purpose of the study was to optimize empirically the detection of prior inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) and prior anterior myocardial infarction (AMI) by electrocardiogram (ECG). The second purpose was to compare the diagnostic performances of the new criteria with those of 3 widely used commercial diagnostic ECG algorithms.

We analyzed the digital ECG data from 1138 subjects with suspected coronary artery disease in whom the presence or absence of prior IMI or AMI was documented by coronary angiography and left ventriculography. We used receiver operating characteristic curves to develop the new criteria for prior IMI and AMI using a training set of 562 subjects and then tested their diagnostic performances using a separate test set of 576 subjects. In both the training and test sets, we used Ï‡(2) test to compare the performances of the new criteria with those of 3 commercial computerized diagnostic algorithms.

The best criterion for prior IMI was the algebraic sum of the Q and T amplitudes in leads III and aVF. Its sensitivities/specificities were 71%/98% and 74%/98% in the training and test sets, respectively. The best criterion for prior AMI was the algebraic sum of the Q, R, and T amplitudes minus the Q duration in leads V(2), V(3), and V(4). Its sensitivities/specificities were 68%/98% and 65%/98% in the training and test sets, respectively. In both the training and test sets, these diagnostic performances were generally superior to those of the 3 commercial algorithms.

Using digital ECG data, we developed and tested new criteria for prior IMI and AMI whose diagnostic performances are generally superior to each of 3 widely used commercial ECG diagnostic algorithms.
