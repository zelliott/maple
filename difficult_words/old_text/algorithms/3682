The purpose of these studies was to determine the performance characteristics of the Cozart microplate EIA for the detection of cocaine and cocaine metabolites in oral fluid. A total of 217 samples were collected using the Cozart RapiScan oral fluid Collection System from donors who were receiving treatment and being monitored for their addiction. The samples were screened in the laboratory using the Cozart microplate EIA for cocaine and metabolites and confirmed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The samples were stored frozen until analysis by GC-MS. Of the 217 samples tested, 116 were positive for cocaine and/or cocaine metabolites. The Cozart microplate EIA for cocaine, using a cutoff of 30 ng/mL benzoylecgonine equivalents in neat oral fluid, had a sensitivity of 95.7% +/- 2.0% and specificity of 100% +/- 0.7%. A series of potential adulterants of oral fluid were evaluated and shown not to alter the outcome of the test result.
