Blocks are ungapped multiple alignments of related protein sequence segments that correspond to the most conserved regions of the proteins. The Blocks Database is a collection of blocks representing known protein families that can be used to compare a protein or DNA sequence with documented families of proteins. Protocols in this unit describe the analysis of proteins and families using Blocks-based tools, including searching, exploring relationships with trees, making new blocks, and designing PCR primers from blocks for isolating homologous sequences.
