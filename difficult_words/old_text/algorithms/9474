The following review intends to outline the unique aspects of providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation for the poisoned patient and highlights both current practice and new therapies that apply to toxicologic cases.

Although there are few prospective randomized studies to further evidence-based care of the poisoned patient, there have been several reports of novel uses of both established medications and new medications in toxicologic patients. These case reports highlight treatment possibilities and potential avenues for further research.

It is important for providers to recognize the limitations of standard advanced cardiac life support algorithms when caring for poisoned patients. Toxicologic causes of cardiopulmonary compromise should be considered along with administration of appropriate antidotes and adjunctive therapies.
