Currently, there is no treatment standard for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (PaCa) after chemoradiation. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively assess overall survival and toxicity of chemotherapy in addition to chemoradiation in this patient group.

Three-dimensional conformal irradiation to the primary tumor (55.8 Gy) and the lymphatics (50.4 Gy) was combined with 5-fluorouracil- or gemcitabine-based chemotherapy followed by additional chemotherapy with gemcitabine until progression or no further treatment. Decision for chemotherapy was taken at the discretion of the attending physician considering the patient's desire.

A total of 172 patients were addressed to the local tumor board. Patients with (neo)adjuvant treatment or metastatic disease were excluded (n = 90). 82 patients were treated with chemoradiation and had additional chemotherapy (n = 40) or no further treatment (n = 42). Characteristics of the two groups were equally distributed. Patients with chemotherapy had significantly longer overall survival as compared to patients without (13 months vs. 8 months; p < 0.0001; median survival = 10.7 months for all patients). Acute toxicity of maintenance chemotherapy was relatively mild.

Maintenance chemotherapy after chemoradiation for patients with locally advanced PaCa may significantly increase survival rates without severe side effects and is therefore recommended as standard treatment following chemoradiation.
