Bolus chase 3-dimensional MR angiography (3D MRA) is a recent development that extends the effective field of view for arterial imaging from the typical single 40-50 cm to over 100 cm. This technique is well suited for imaging long vascular territories such as the lower extremity. Bolus chase peripheral 3D MRA is achieved with overlapping 3D gradient-echo scans during the arterial transit of a single intravenous injection of gadolinium-chelate contrast media. This technique can depict the arteries from the infrarenal aorta to the ankles in less than 2 minutes. The initial experiences with bolus chase peripheral MRA using an automated algorithm that controls both table translation and 3D data acquisition are described. Suggestions for future refinements to the technique are also discussed.
