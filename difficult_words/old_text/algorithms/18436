Introduction of new antiretroviral agents and development of new prophylaxis schedules against opportunistic microorganisms have allowed increase in survival as well as better quality of life in HIV-infected patients. These new treatment schedules have changed the epidemiology of opportunistic infections that previous to use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), formerly occurred with high frequency in HIV-infected children. Specifically, pneumonia due to Pneumocystis carinii formerly occurred in 12 to 80% of these patients and was associated with high mortality. Currently, with use of combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prophylactic treatments important reduction of PCP has been observed. However, despite these benefits ART is not yet available for many patients from several developing countries who are at risk for opportunistic infections, mainly due to Pneumocystis carinii, which can affect life expectancy. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was a review of epidemiologic, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of P. carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected children.
