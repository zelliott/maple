Physicians complained because outpatients had to wait for platelet transfusions because of product unavailability. Platelet use had increased 30%, and additional platelet shipments from our supplier were often required. A Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) committee identified 2 positive impact factors: adjust inventory stocked and recommend a 4-unit dose for cardiac surgery, on the basis of supplier data validating that platelets in 4 concentrates exceeded the minimum apheresis standard. Subsequent to these changes, all orders have been filled immediately, and the average platelet use in cardiac surgery has decreased from 7 to 4 units. There have been no instances of inability to fill platelet orders. Currently, 96% of cardiac surgery platelet orders are for 4 units. Prior to the adjustment to inventory, 24 requests in 6 months were placed with our supplier for additional platelet deliveries. Requests have decreased to 3 in 6 months.
