No procedure has yet been identified as the standard for the detection and management of choledocholithiasis in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

A prospective study involved 1305 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intravenous cholangiography was performed on all patients except those with jaundice or cholangitis, acute pancreatitis, or allergy to contrast material. Patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) and endoscopic sphincterotomy when there was a strong suspicion of choledocholithiasis, positive or inconclusive findings on intravenous cholangiography or allergy to contrast material with signs of possible choledocholithiasis. Intraoperative cholangiography was performed when patients did not undergo ERC or intravenous cholangiography and whenever the surgeon was in doubt about biliary anatomy or biliary clearance.

Two hundred thirty-one patients (17.7%) were referred for preoperative ERC; 14 of them were referred for open surgery because of failure of ERC or sphincterotomy. Only 54 patients underwent intraoperative cholangiography. Bile duct stones, detected in 186 cases (14.2%) (68 of which were asymptomatic), were removed before surgery in 162 cases (87.1%) and during surgery in 20 (10.7%). Self-limited pancreatitis occurred in 3.6% of the patients after sphincterotomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 98.7% of the cases. The conversion rate was 8% if sphincterotomy had been performed previously, and 3% after standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (p < 0.001). The morbidity rate was 5% and the mortality rate 0.08%. During the follow-up period 4 patients had retained stones that were treated endoscopically.

Preoperative ERC followed by laparoscopy is the best approach to treatment of patients with cholecystolithiasis and suspected choledocholithiasis.
