Recent studies have extensively examined the large-scale genetic variants in the human genome known as copy-number variations (CNVs), and the universality of CNVs in normal individuals, along with their functional importance, has been increasingly recognized. However, the absence of a method to accurately infer alleles or haplotypes within a CNV region from high-throughput experimental data hampers the finer analyses of CNV properties and applications to disease-association studies. Here we developed an algorithm to infer complex haplotypes within a CNV region by using data obtained from high-throughput experimental platforms. We applied this algorithm to experimental data and estimated the population frequencies of haplotypes that can yield information on both sequences and numbers of DNA copies. These results suggested that the analysis of such complex haplotypes is essential for accurately detecting genetic differences within a CNV region between population groups.
