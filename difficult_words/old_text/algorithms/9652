We review the theory of spherical diffraction gratings with regard to their imaging properties in off-plane arrangements. Our study is restricted to gratings with equally spaced grooves, and it is focused on the quadrature configuration, where the incident and diffraction planes are orthogonal to each other. We identify regions of low astigmatism and propose some monochromator mounts.
