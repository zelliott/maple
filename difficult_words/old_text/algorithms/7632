In this paper we discuss a proposal on the essential structural aspects of Darwinian Evolution Theory. Using this point of view we apply a mathematical ago-antagonist theory inspired by Y. Cherruault's (1998) ideas, which we have extended. In the ago-antagonist model, the phenotype characters measure the individual propensity to perform an innovative x(t) (agonist) or conservative y(t) (antagonist) action with respect to mutation and to speciation process. We have mathematically introduced the conflict concept and we present a model that takes into account the environmental effects by means of a stochastic multiplicative process. We shortly discuss the properties of the related stochastic differential equations.
