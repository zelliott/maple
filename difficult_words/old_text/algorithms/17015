Performance of the linear regression-based ST/HR (heart rate) slope, the simple ST/HR index, and ST segment depression alone for the identification of anatomically severe coronary obstruction was examined in relation to the definition of the extent of disease and the presence or absence of beta-blockade during treadmill exercise using the Cornell protocol in 172 catheterized patients. Whether severe disease was defined by three-vessel obstruction, by Gensini scores partitioned at 35 or at 48, or by Duke jeopardy scores exceeding 6, the 83% to 100% sensitivities of an ST/HR slope criterion of 6.0 microV/beat/min were each significantly higher than the corresponding 65% to 80% sensitivities of 150 microV of ST segment depression closely matched specificities. The ST/HR slope was significantly more sensitive than a simple ST/HR index criterion of 3.4 microV/beat/min for detection of high Gensini scores, but despite consistently intermediate performance trends, in no case did sensitivity of the simple ST/HR index criterion significantly exceed that of ST depression alone. Each method performed better and with comparable sensitivity in patients not receiving beta-blockers. In contrast, the 82% to 100% sensitivities of the ST/HR slope for identification of severe disease were significantly higher than the 63% to 77% sensitivities of ST depression in patients taking beta-blocking drugs; however, simple heart rate adjustment using the ST/HR index had intermediate performance that in no case was significantly more sensitive than ST segment depression alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
