Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease that is highly prevalent in women of childbearing age. A review is done about the characteristics of the placental barrier, the passage of drugs through it and the use of drugs during pregnancy: those which are potentially safe drugs, those drugs that can only be used if there is a life threatening condition for the mother, drugs that are contraindicated and those with insufficient data on safety and therefore should be avoided, the latter group comprises biological drugs. Also a review is done about the use of drugs during lactation, a period that a flare of rheumatoid arthritis can occur.
