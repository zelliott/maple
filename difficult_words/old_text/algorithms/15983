This paper introduces an effective technique for the compression of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The technique is based on a new class of non-orthogonal discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The performance of ECG compression algorithm is measured by its ability to minimize distortion while retaining all clinically significant features of the signal. The percent root-mean square difference (PRD) is used as an accepted standard for measuring the signal distortion. However, there is no standard for measuring the clinically significant features retained after signal reconstruction. The coefficients of the DWT are calculated such that the square of the difference between the original signal and the reconstructed one is minimum in least mean square sense. The resulting transforms deal with signals of arbitrary lengths; that means the signal length is not restricted to be a multiple of power of 2. Numerical results comparing the performance of the constructed non-orthogonal transform with that of W-transform and Daubechies D(4) orthogonal transform are given. These results show that, independent of signal length, the decomposition of the signal up to the fourth level is sufficient for getting minimum PRD. In addition, the proposed technique yields the lowest PRD compared to the other two algorithms and for a compression ratio less than 10 the optimal transform can be obtained for only one ECG period. However, for a higher compression ratio the PRD is smaller for long signals.
