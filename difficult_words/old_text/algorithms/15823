A method is presented for measuring protein surface shape. It is an improvement of an earlier method that intersects a sphere with the solvent-excluded volume of a protein molecule. The new method, called a shape distribution, produces a more sophisticated description of the region of the sphere inside the protein than is provided by simply measuring the region's area or solid angle. This method is applied to the prediction of molecular complexes in three systems: the hemoglobin nonallosteric interface, trypsin and trypsin inhibitor, and heme and apomyoglobin. It does not uniquely predict the correct structure, even though the individual structures are taken from the experimentally determined complex structure. However, it does provide a list of several hundred predicted complexes, one of which is correct, and from which the correct complex might be extracted by a subsequent chemical filter.
