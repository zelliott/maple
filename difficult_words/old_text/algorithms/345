The Density Classification Task is a well known test problem for two-state discrete dynamical systems. For many years researchers have used a variety of evolutionary computation approaches to evolve solutions to this problem. In this paper, we investigate the evolvability of solutions when the underlying Cellular Automaton is augmented with a type of memory based on the Least Mean Square algorithm. To obtain high performance solutions using a simple non-hybrid genetic algorithm, we design a novel representation based on the ternary representation used for Learning Classifier Systems. The new representation is found able to produce superior performance to the bit string traditionally used for representing Cellular automata. Moreover, memory is shown to improve evolvability of solutions and appropriate memory settings are able to be evolved as a component part of these solutions.
