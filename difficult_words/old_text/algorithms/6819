ProPred is a graphical web tool for predicting MHC class II binding regions in antigenic protein sequences. The server implement matrix based prediction algorithm, employing amino-acid/position coefficient table deduced from literature. The predicted binders can be visualized either as peaks in graphical interface or as colored residues in HTML interface. This server might be a useful tool in locating the promiscuous binding regions that can bind to several HLA-DR alleles.

The server is available at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/propred/
