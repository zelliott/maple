The existence of differences in the dynamic organization of frequently and the rarely occurring dipeptide fragments in globular and membrane proteins was shown. The dynamic isomorphism and the collective degrees of freedom in these fragments were analyzed. A topological classification of the maps of the levels of free energy for pairs of dihedral angles of the main chain and side residues was carried out.
