Both acute and chronic pain are common coexisting problems in patients with heart failure. Because nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids are contraindicated in heart failure, traditional pain management algorithms require modification. This article reviews pertinent pain management principles, including pain vocabulary, barriers to pain management, and general pain assessment and treatment measures. Issues unique to the heart failure patient are discussed and specific interventions for the heart failure patient with acute or chronic pain are then delineated.
