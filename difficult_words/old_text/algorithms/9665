The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of steady-state True fast imaging with steady precession (TrueFISP) four-dimensional imaging of mouse heart at high resolution and its efficiency for cardiac volumetry. Three-dimensional cine-imaging of control and hypoxic mice was carried out at 4.7 T without magnetization preparation or ECG-triggering. The k-space lines were acquired with the TrueFISP sequence (pulse repetition time/echo time = 4/2 ms) in a repeated sequential manner. Retrospective reordering of raw data allowed the reconstruction of 10 three-dimensional images per cardiac cycle. The acquisition scheme used an alternating radiofrequency phase and sum-of-square reconstruction method. Black-blood three-dimensional images at around 200 mum resolution were produced without banding artifact throughout the cardiac cycle. High contrast to noise made it possible to estimate cavity volumes during diastole and systole. Right and left ventricular stroke volume was significantly higher in hypoxic mice vs controls (20.2 +/- 2 vs 15.1 +/- 2; P < 0.05, 24.9 +/- 2 vs 20.4 +/- 2; P < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, four-dimensional black-blood TrueFISP imaging in living mice is a method of choice to investigate cardiac abnormalities in mouse models.
