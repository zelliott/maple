A three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction algorithm based on contours identification from biplanar radiographs is presented. It requires, as technical prerequisites, a method to calibrate the biplanar radiographic environment and a surface generic object (anatomic atlas model) representing the structure to be reconstructed. The reconstruction steps consist of: the definition of anatomical regions, the identification of 2D contours associated to these regions, the calculation of 3D contours and projection onto the radiographs, the associations between points of the X-rays contours and points of the projected 3D contours, the optimization of the initial solution and the optimized object deformation to minimize the distance between X-rays contours and projected 3D contours. The evaluation was performed on 8 distal femurs comparing the 3D models obtained to CT-scan reconstructions. Mean error for each distal femur was 1 mm.
