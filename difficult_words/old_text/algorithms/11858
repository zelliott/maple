The effect of some steroid hormones and their synthetic analogs--dexamethasone, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and cytostatics--on the fibroblast nuclei in a monolayer culture was studied. Their proliferation was studied at the same time by the radioindicator method. The method of computerized morphodensitometry with the use of the apparatus-programmer complex DiaMorf (Russia) showed that the compounds under study induce reorganization of interphase chromatin of fibroblast nuclei over the molecules, the amount of which may be recorded by means of the computer system of analysis of cell and tissue images.
