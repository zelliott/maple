Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging viral infectious disease. The SARS outbreak in Singapore started in mid-March 2003. Emergency departments, being the primary portal of entry into the hospitals, had to come up with rapid strategic changes and modifications to accommodate and manage this public health problem effectively. This report discusses the changes in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Singapore General Hospital, the largest public, teaching and tertiary hospital in Singapore, during this outbreak. It will highlight the safety aspects and universal precautions undertaken, the changes to the triage system, working hours, admission policies, as well as the fluctuations in the patient load.
