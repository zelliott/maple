Druggable Protein-protein Interaction Assessment System (Dr. PIAS) is a database of druggable protein-protein interactions (PPIs) predicted by our support vector machine (SVM)-based method. Since the first publication of this database, Dr. PIAS has been updated to version 2.0. PPI data have been increased considerably, from 71,500 to 83,324 entries. As the new positive instances in our method, 4 PPIs and 10 tertiary structures have been added. This addition increases the prediction accuracy of our SVM classifier in comparison with the previous classifier, despite the number of added PPIs and structures is small. We have introduced the novel concept of 'similar positives' of druggable PPIs, which will help researchers discover small compounds that can inhibit predicted druggable PPIs. Dr. PIAS will aid the effective search for druggable PPIs from a mine of interactome data being rapidly accumulated. Dr. PIAS 2.0 is available at http://www.drpias.net.
