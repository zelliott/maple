In this paper we propose a calculation of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) not affected by hypertriglyceridemia by using lipid quantities directly measured in total serum. We also propose an algorithm for the classification of nonchylomicronemic dyslipemias. Plasma apolipoproteins (apo) A-I, B, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and cholesterol of lipoproteins were measured in a group of 38 normolipemic and 120 dyslipemic patients (42 phenotype IIa, 38 IIb, and 40 IV) classified according to TG and LDL-C values. Discriminant analysis was applied to obtain the best classification with the lowest number of quantities directly measured from total serum (TC, TG, and apo B), and multiple regression analysis was performed to find an equation to calculate LDL-C from these quantities. Apo B seems to be a useful discriminator between normolipemic and phenotype IIa patients, by using a cutoff value of 1.35 g/L obtained by ROC curve analysis. The proposed algorithm, based on lipid quantities measured by easily automated methods, is shown to be a good alternative for the classification of nonhyperchylomicronemic dyslipemia. LDL-C calculated from TC, TG, and apo B proved a better estimate of true LDL-C than the estimate obtained with Friedewald's formula.
