The effects of hydrogen-bond forming and breaking kinetics on the linear and coherent third-order infrared spectra of the OH stretch of HOD in D2O are described by Markovian, not necessarily Gaussian, fluctuations and simulated using the stochastic Liouville equations. Slow (0.5 ps) fluctuations are represented by a collective electrostatic coordinate, whereas fast (<100 fs) frequency fluctuations are described using either a second collective electrostatic coordinate or a four-state jump (FSJ) model for hydrogen-bonding configurations. Parameters for both models were obtained using a 1-ns molecular-dynamics trajectory calculated using the TIP4P force field combined with an electrostatic ab initio map. The asymmetry of the photon-echo spectra (larger linewidth on the blue side than on the red side) predicted by the FSJ is in better agreement with recent experiments.
