Air-coupled ultrasonic spectroscopy is described, whereby the output from a pulse compression system is used. It is demonstrated that the cross-correlation operation used within a pulse-compression system preserves amplitude and phase information. This approach allows the signal-to-noise ratio and, hence, signal-detection capability to be improved by the cross-correlation, while allowing noncontact spectral information for solid samples to be obtained. Results are presented for chocolate samples, where measurements of interest to the food industry have been obtained.
