The purpose of the paper is an experimental study of the formation of class descriptions, taking place during learning, in assembly neural networks. The assembly neural network is artificially partitioned into several sub-networks according to the number of classes that the network has to recognize. The features extracted from input data are represented in neural column structures of the sub-networks. Hebbian neural assemblies are formed in the column structure of the sub-networks by weight adaptation. A specific class description is formed in each sub-network of the assembly neural network due to intersections between the neural assemblies. The process of formation of class descriptions in the sub-networks is interpreted as feature generalization. A set of special experiments is performed to study this process, on a task of character recognition using the MNIST database.
