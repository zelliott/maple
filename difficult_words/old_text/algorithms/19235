We have calculated the electron density distribution of the Pf1 strain of filamentous bacteriophage by a maximum entropy method. In the calculation we included native X-ray fibre diffraction data extending to 3 A resolution in the meridional direction on 60 layerlines that are resolved to 4 A in the equatorial direction, and lower resolution data from a single isomorphous derivative iodinated on the Tyr25 residue. The electron density map indicates that the 46-residue protein subunit is a single, gently curved stretch of alpha-helix with its axis at an angle of about 20 degrees to the axis of the virion. The alpha-helix subunit curves around the virion axis by about 1/6 turn, and decreases from about 27 A radius to about 13 A radius in the virion as the amino acid sequence of the subunit runs from the N terminus to the C terminus. Nearest-neighbour alpha-helical subunits are about 10 A apart along their length, and the axis of each subunit makes an unexpected negative angle with its nearest neighbours in the virion. To confirm the validity of the maximum entropy calculation, we have varied the constraints on the calculation. All variations result in either a map that is close to the original map or a map that cannot be interpreted in terms of secondary structure: we find only one map that makes structural sense.
