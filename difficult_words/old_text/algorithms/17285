The electrotransport transdermal fentanyl system (ET [fentanyl]), uses a small electrical current to enhance delivery of fentanyl to systemic circulation. Intermittent doses can be administered by periodic application of the current. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of the frequency of intermittent drug delivery by ET (fentanyl) and compare the drug delivery to systemic circulation by ET (fentanyl) with intravenous administration. The topical safety was also determined for the ET (fentanyl) system. Nine adult male volunteers completed this three-treatment, randomized, 24-h, crossover study. ET (fentanyl) treatments with 200 microA direct current applied for 30 min at frequent (hourly) or infrequent (4-hourly) intervals over a 24-h period were compared. Also, the drug delivery to systemic circulation from ET (fentanyl) was compared with intravenous fentanyl 75 microg infused over 30 min every 4 h over a 24-hour period. The mean serum fentanyl concentration achieved with the hourly ET (fentanyl) regimen was higher than that for the 4-hourly ET (fentanyl) regimen as expected from the higher frequency of drug doses. The amount of fentanyl delivered estimated per dose from the ET (fentanyl) system using the iv fentanyl treatment as the reference was similar for the two ET regimens throughout the dosing period. This indicates consistent drug delivery regardless of the frequency of ET dosing. The majority of subjects reported either no, or barely perceptible, erythema 24 h after removal of the system.
