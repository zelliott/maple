This letter proposes a degradation and cognition model to estimate speech quality impairment because of packet loss concealment (PLC) algorithm implemented in the speech CODEC SILK. By considering the fact that the quality degradation caused by packet loss is highly related to the PLC algorithm, the impact of quality degradation on various types of previous and lost packet classes is analyzed. Then, the PLC effects to the proposed class types are measured by the class conditional expectation of the degradation scores. Finally, the cognition module is derived to estimate the total quality degradation in a mean opinion score (MOS) scale. When assessed for correlation with subject test results, the correlation coefficient of the encoder-based class model is 0.93, and that of the decoder-based model is 0.87.
