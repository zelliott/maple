The diagnosis of thyroid disease now often can be achieved reliably by measuring thyrotropin (TSH) alone. Thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine, and other analytes are only needed if TSH and the accompanying clinical condition are discordant. We describe here work that confirms the age independence of TSH in both inpatient and outpatient euthyroid hospital populations between ages 20 and at least 80 years, and demonstrates that although free T4 does vary with age, the range of variation remains within the T4 reference interval. On this basis, TSH-based thyroid diagnostic algorithms can be used reliably in adults without reference to age-related reference intervals.
