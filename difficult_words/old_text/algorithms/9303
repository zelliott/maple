Determining the unknown material parameters of intact ventricular myocardium can be challenging due to highly nonlinear material behavior. Previous studies combining a gradient-search optimization procedure with finite element analysis (FEA) were limited to two-dimensional (2D) models or simplified three-dimensional (3D) geometries. Here we present a novel scheme to estimate unknown material parameters for ventricular myocardium by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with nonlinear finite element analysis. This approach systematically explores the domain of the material parameters. The objective function to minimize was the error between simulated strain data and finite element model strains. The proposed scheme was validated for a 2D problem using a realistic material law for ventricular myocardium. Optimized material parameters were generally within 0.5% of the true values. To demonstrate the robustness of the new scheme, unknown material parameters were also determined for a realistic 3D heart model with an exponential hyperelastic material law. When using strains from two material points, the algorithm converged to parameters within 5% of the true values. We conclude that the proposed scheme is robust when estimating myocardial material parameters in 2D and 3D models.
