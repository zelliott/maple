Ambulatory electrocardiographic (AECG) monitoring is an essential tool in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with cardiac arrhythmias. Recent advances in solid-state technology have improved the quality of the ECG signals and new dedicated algorithms have expanded the clinical application of software-based AECG analysis systems. These advances, in addition to the availability of inexpensive large storage capacities, and very long-term continuous high-quality AECG monitoring, have opened new potential uses for AECG. New digital recorders have the capability of multichannel simultaneous recordings (from 3 to 12 leads) and for telemetred signal transduction. These possibilities will expand the traditional uses of AECG for arrhythmia detection, as arrhythmia monitoring to assess drug and device efficacies has been further defined by new studies. The analysis of transient ST-segment deviation still remains controversial, but considerably more data are now available, especially about the prognostic value of detecting asymptomatic ischaemia. Heart rate variability analysis has shown promise for predicting mortality rates in cardiac patients at high risk. We review recent advances in this field of non-invasive cardiac testing.
