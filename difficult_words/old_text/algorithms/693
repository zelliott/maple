We propose a method for displaying micro-objects in space that is based on three-dimensional (3D) integral imaging, in which elemental images are calculated from a two-dimensional sampling of the optical field along different depths by use of confocal scanning microscopy. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate that a uniformly magnified 3D biological specimen can be displayed in space, and thus integral imaging can be used for 3D display of confocal microscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of 3D integral imaging of (semitransparent) micro-objects.
