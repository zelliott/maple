A three-dimensional warping registration algorithm was created and compared to rigid body registration of magnetic resonance (MR) pelvic volumes including the prostate. The rigid body registration method combines the advantages of mutual information (MI) and correlation coefficient at different resolutions. Warping registration is based upon independent optimization of many interactively placed control points (CP's) using MI and a thin plate spline transformation. More than 100 registration experiments with 17 MR volume pairs determined the quality of registration under conditions simulating potential interventional MRI-guided treatments of prostate cancer. For image pairs that stress rigid body registration (e.g. supine, the diagnostic position, and legs raised, the treatment position), both visual and numerical evaluation methods showed that warping consistently worked better than rigid body. Experiments showed that approximately 180 strategically placed CP's were sufficiently expressive to capture important features of the deformation.
