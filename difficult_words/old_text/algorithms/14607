The response rate has been frequently used as the primary endpoint of phase II cancer clinical trials. It may not be an appropriate endpoint when a new treatment is not expected to produce any tumour shrinkage. When a large database for a historical control is available, the direct comparison of survival curves between a new treatment and the historical control may be made in phase II cancer clinical trials. In this paper, a one-sample log-rank test is introduced for the design and analysis of phase II cancer clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints. Corrections to the one-sample log-rank test are also derived based on the Edgeworth expansion. Simulations showed that the original one-sample log-rank test may be preferred if strictly controlling for type I error is important or when the sample size of a phase II trial is as large as 50, and a corrected one-sample log-rank test is used if the sample size of a phase II trial is small. A data set from a clinical trial conducted by the NCIC Clinical Trials Group is used to illustrate the proposed procedures.
