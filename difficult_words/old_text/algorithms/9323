Two algorithms are commonly applied in computerized temporal discounting procedures (Decreasing Adjustment and Double-Limit Algorithms); however, the degree to which the two algorithms produce similar patterns of discounting is unknown. The present experiment compared the two common algorithms across sign (gains and losses) and magnitude ($10 and $1000) conditions. Twenty participants made choices between larger later and smaller sooner alternatives that were presented by each of the algorithms in separate conditions. Strong correlations were found between the two measures; however, the Decreasing Adjustment Algorithm tended to produce lower indifference points and higher rates of discounting than the Double-Limit Algorithm. Both algorithms found significant magnitude effects. Less consistent results were found when comparing the two algorithms across sign. The present results suggest that researchers should apply caution when making comparisons between outcomes of delay discounting studies that have used the two different algorithms. However, the interpretation of findings from individual studies is probably not strongly affected by the use of different computer algorithms.
