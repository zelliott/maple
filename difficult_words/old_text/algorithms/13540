The aim of this study was to compare the estimations provided by three different means of measuring the resting energy expenditure (REE) in anorexia nervosa (AN) patients. REE was measured, after 24 h of refeeding, using a portable multisensor body monitor [SenseWear Pro2 Armband (SWA)], FitMate™ method and the Müller equation for individuals with body mass index < 18.5, the latter being based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry assessment of body composition. The mean differences between REE values estimated by SWA and those provided by the Müller equation and the FitMate™ method were significantly different from zero in both cases. In contrast, the mean differences between FitMate™ method and Müller equation were weakly significantly different from zero, and a significant correlation was noted between these two methods. In conclusion, the SWA does not appear to be an alternative to FitMate™ and Müller equation methods for assessing REE in AN patients.
