Advances in technical aspects of pancreas transplantation and improvements in immunosuppression over the last decade have led to significant improvements in pancreas transplant outcomes in the short-term. Simultaneous kidney pancreas transplantation remains an attractive option for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and late chronic kidney disease (CKD), with 1-year pancreas graft survival rates of 86% in 2004. For the individual patient with T1DM and CKD, the various transplant options must be considered carefully, with attention to the timing of surgery relative to the need for dialysis, the challenge in managing diabetes with noninvasive medical therapy, and the assumption of risks attendant to each surgical option. This review summarizes the current status of simultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation and compares and contrasts outcomes with other potential treatment options.
