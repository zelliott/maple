This paper investigates the principal components (PCs) of natural gray and color images. A horizontal and vertical typology of PCs is found which leads to the identification of groups of basis functions for steerable bandpass filters. Using this system, the contribution of spatio-chromatic structure to the total variance can be quantified for selected spatial frequencies.
