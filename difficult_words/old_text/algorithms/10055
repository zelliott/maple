This report describes an integrated software package, DataView, which contains a number of tools for analysing rhythmic neural activity. These include simple autocorrelation, a merge-and-drop filter, an enhanced version of the Poisson surprise method and a flexible hill-and-valley analysis tool. The package contains facilities for identifying, examining, and if appropriate, correcting, outliers arising from misidentification or rhythm abnormalities. The package has a full graphical user interface which provides flexible and rapid feedback on the progress of analysis, and the consequences of choices regarding parameters for the various tools. The user can thus easily experiment with different methodologies and tool settings, and tune the analysis to the most appropriate form for the data in question.
