To determine diagnostic value of the method of ECG in 12 conventional leads for diagnosis of pulmonary heart.

The ECG data for 41 patients with clinical diagnosis "pulmonary heart", a risk group of 59 patients with suspected diagnosis "pulmonary heart" and healthy residents of the Komi Republic (n = 968) and Arkhangelsk region (n = 62) have been analysed. The ECGs were recorded using standard electrocardiographs with manual measurement of the amplitude and temporal parameters.

We have analysed 215 diagnostic ECG criteria of "pulmonary heart" used in practice, selected 19 informative indices and developed 19 new ones. On the basis of 17 most significant criteria a short algorithm and a program of diagnosis of "pulmonary heart" for IBM PC have been elaborated. The test of the algorithm efficiency by a blind method confirmed the clinical diagnosis in 81.3% of cases, hypodiagnosis and hyperdiagnosis in 6.2 and 12.5%, respectively.

A widespread and noninvasive ECG method proved promising in diagnosis of pulmonary heart.
