The diagnosis and treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in mood-disordered patients is complex and somewhat controversial. The psychiatrist must recognize that such subclinical states may contribute to depression, mood cycling, or delayed response to treatment if undetected. Autoimmune thyroiditis, which may ultimately lead to various grades of hypothyroidism, may also be seen in depressed populations, particularly in postpartum females. The author discusses these issues by means of a clinical vignette, then proposes an algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroid states in mood disordered populations.
