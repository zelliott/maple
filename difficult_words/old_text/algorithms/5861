The problem of analyzing heart rate variability in the presence of ectopic beats is revisited. Based on the integral pulse frequency modulation model and the closely related heart timing signal, a new technique is introduced which corrects for the occasional presence of ectopic beats. The correction technique, which involves the occurrence times of a certain number of beats preceding the ectopic beat, is computationally very efficient. From actual heart rate data, the results show that the new technique is associated with a much lower computational complexity (flops reduced by a factor of about 3000) than the original heart timing technique, while producing similar performance. It is also shown that the power spectrum and related clinical indices obtained by the new technique are more accurately estimated than by other methods.
