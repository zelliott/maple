Head and neck cancer represents 5 % of oncologic cases in adults. Early stage treatments are local with surgery and/or radiotherapy. For locally advanced stages, treatment requires radiotherapy combined with platinum-based drugs or cetuximab. Induction chemotherapy should be considered for selected cases. In the case of metastatic disease, adjuvant or palliative treatment is based on platinum agents and cetuximab.
