The aim of the present in vitro and in vivo studies was to compare the permeation and penetration of a 2.5% ketoprofen (CAS 22071-15-4) gel [Phardol Schmerz-Gel (Test-D)] with the permeation and penetration of two other ketoprofen gels (Ref-I, Ref-E) and an ibuprofen (CAS 15687-27-1) gel (Ref-D) on excised human skin. Furthermore, in vivo studies were performed. The permeation studies utilizing static Franz diffusion cells allow the determination of the transdermal (systemic) transport, whereas the penetration studies in vitro (according to the Saarbr√ºcker model) and in vivo permit setting up a concentration-depth profile. For this purpose the permeation kinetics of ketoprofen from three different gels (each containing 2.5% ketoprofen) over a period of two days were determined at heat-separated human skin of different donors. The in vitro permeability coefficients for Test-D (6.50 x 10(-7) cm x s(-1)) and Ref-I (5.72 x 10(-7) cm x s(-1)) were comparable and the transport occurred for both by a factor of 8-9 faster than with Ref-E (0.78 x 10(-7) cm x s(-1)). In parallel to the permeation studies with ketoprofen, the permeability coefficient of caffeine from an ointment was assessed using the skin biopsies of the same donors as a quality assurance. In a second part of the studies, the in vitro penetration of ketoprofen from Test-D was determined over a period of 3 h at three different skin biopsies in comparison to a commercially available 5% ibuprofen gel (Ref-D). As a main result a concentration-depth profile for ketoprofen and ibuprofen could be issued. The ketoprofen (37.7 +/- 12.1 microg/cm2) and the ibuprofen (30.1 +/- 6.0 microg/cm2) penetrate to the same order of magnitude into the upper part of the Stratum corneum, whereas ibuprofen stronger accumulates in the deeper layers (ketoprofen: 27.3 +/- 8.5 microg/cm2; ibuprofen: 73.7 +/- 31.1 microg/cm2). An additional in vivo penetration study was performed with Test-D to set up an in vitro-in vivo (IVIV) correlation. Over a period of 3 h, the amount of ketoprofen in the Stratum corneum in vivo was 78.4 +/- 19.1 microg/cm2 being comparable to the in vitro data.
