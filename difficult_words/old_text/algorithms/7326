To analyze the common dental agenesis patterns of the oligodontia patients.

The information of 64 oligodontia patients was collected, including the histories, oral examinations and panoramic radiographs. The Tooth Agenesis Code (TAC) procedure was used to analyze the agenesis pattern of each quadrant.

In the maxilla, 63% (40/64) (right side) and 58% (37/64) (left side) could be described using eight different patterns. The most common pattern was agenesis of the maxillary lateral incisor, canine and both premolars.In the mandible, 52% (33/64) (right side) and 53% (34/64) (left side) of the patients could be described using only five different patterns, the most common pattern was agenesis of both mandibular premolars.

Common patterns of tooth agenesis were successfully identified in non-syndromic oligodontia patients.
