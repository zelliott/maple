A single-stage method is used for evaluating factor VIII (fVIII) clotting activity. This method is based on evaluation of activated partial thromboplastin time with fVIII-deficient plasma as the substrate. The activity of fVIII in the plasma is estimated by the graphic analytical method, which is difficult and not sufficiently accurate. An analytical method for estimating the activity of fVIII is validated. The authors prove the adequacy of empirical model used for evaluation of fVIII activity on the basis of results of processing of a vast scope of experimental data. The range of values for this parameter is -6.00 +/- 0.16.
