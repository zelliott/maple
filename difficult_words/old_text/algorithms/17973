To evaluate the outcome of patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy treated within the Edinburgh unit to date.

Information was collected from the medical case notes on the clinical features, method of treatment, postoperative complications, and length of follow up for each patient. A questionnaire was devised to assess patient satisfaction and facial volume was evaluated using three-dimensional imaging.

Forty-six patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy were treated over a 3-year period. Twenty-six patients received Coleman fat injections, 10 patients were treated with Newfill, eight patients were treated with Bio-alcamid, 21 patients received liposuction, and three patients had a minimal access cranial suspension facelift. Follow up ranged from 1 to 14 months. Patient and surgeon satisfaction was high with autologous fat injections although fat resorption occurred in nine patients. Aesthetic improvement with Newfill was moderate and required up to seven treatment sessions. The results of treatment with Bio-alcamid were good immediately postoperatively, although two patients required further corrective procedures. Two patients who had liposuction to the dorso-cervical fat pad reported recurrence at 5 and 9 months, respectively.

Based on our experience, a treatment algorithm has been devised to aid management decisions. We favour the use of autologous fat injections for facial lipoatrophy but have found fillers to be useful in patients with inadequate fat reserves.
