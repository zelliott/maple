Postcardiotomy sternal wound complications remain challenging. The prevailing approach for deep sternal wound infection of debridement and flap coverage without osseous closure makes subsequent reoperation difficult.

An analysis of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery at a single institution between 1986 and 2001 was conducted. Prospective data collection and chart review were used to compare different treatment strategies for sternal complications.

Of 5337 patients, 122 had sternal wound complications (2.2%) comprising 15 (0.3%) uninfected dehiscences (El Oakley class 1), 45 (0.8%) superficial infections (El Oakley class 2A), and 62 (1.1%) deep sternal wound infections (El Oakley class 2B). Thirty-two patients with deep sternal infection were treated by debridement, rewiring, and delayed primary closure. There were initial treatment failures in 6 patients (18.8%) and ultimate failures in 2 patients (6.3%), both of whom died. One of these patients had previously received external beam radiation after a radical mastectomy for breast cancer. Median length of stay was 32 days and median time to wound healing was 85 days. Twenty-five patients were managed by muscle flap coverage without sternal reclosure. There were 6 initial treatment failures (24%) but no ultimate failures or deaths (p = NS). Median length of stay was 31 days and median infection time was 161 days.

In patients with postcardiotomy deep sternal wound infection without previous chest radiation, debridement, rewiring, and delayed skin closure is effective. It offers a shorter healing time and probably makes late cardiac reoperation safer. We propose an algorithm for the management of poststernotomy complications.
