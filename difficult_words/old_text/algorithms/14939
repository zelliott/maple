Chronic myelogenous leukemia in more than 90% of patients is associated with the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome, which results in aberrant BCR-ABL chimeric gene expression. The mean overall survival on standard chemotherapy (which is not curative) ranges between 54-72 months. Selected patients with CML can be cured by allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. Only 30% of patients has an optimal HLA-identical sibling donor. It is possible to find well-matched unrelated donor for another 20-30% of patients, however matched-unrelated donor transplantation is still associated with relative high risk of complications and cannot be used in elderly patients. Interferon alpha treatment in monotherapy or in combination with ARA-C can induce a cytogenetical and molecular remission in selected group of patients, which benefits with significantly prolonged survival. Nevertheless the cost of this treatment is high and long period of therapy is required to assess its efficacy. In patients lacking matched related or unrelated donors for allogeneic transplantation, autologous stem cell transplantation could be the alternative method of treatment. Discussed in the paper method of mobilization and transplantation of Philadelphia-negative peripheral-blood progenitor cells collected during early phase of bone marrow regeneration after "mobilizing" chemotherapy (mini-ICE) enables to achieve a complete or major cytogenetical response in about 77% of patients. There is only minimal morbidity and no transplant-related mortality. This procedure and the post-transplant immunotherapy (IFN alpha, interleukin-2) can considerably suppress the pathological clone and significantly prolong the overall survival in CML patients not eligible for allogeneic transplantation.
