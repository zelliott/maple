ROSO is software to design optimal oligonucleotide probe sets for microarrays. Selected probes show no significant cross-hybridization, no stable secondary structures and their Tm are chosen to minimize the Tm variability of the probe set.

The program is available on the internet. Sources are freely available, for non-profit use, on request to the authors.
