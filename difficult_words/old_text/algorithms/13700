This paper shows how the AMDIS (Automated Medical Diagnosis with Intelligent Systems) integrated system can be employed to build a fuzzy medical expert system in the domain of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The fundamental aims of the expert system are to standardize knowledge and support physicians in the early detection of postmenopausal osteoporosis. A wide range of diagnostic situations has been considered for both categories of the disease, with judgments that range from disease is excluded to disease is definite. The salient aspects of the approach are the use of fuzzy logic as an analytic language for the representation and manipulation of knowledge and strategies and the integration of structured interview techniques and learning-by-example to address the knowledge acquisition task.
