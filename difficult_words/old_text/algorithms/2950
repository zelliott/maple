Optimization of media components for the growth and biomass production of Halobacterium salinarum VKMM 013 was carried out using response surface methodology. A second order quadratic model was estimated and media components were determined based on quadratic regression equation generated by model. These were 6.35 g L(-1) of KCl, 9.70 g L(-1) of MgSO(4), 13.38 g L(-1) of gelatin and 12.00 g L(-1) of soluble starch in nutrient broth supplemented with artificial seawater with 20% (w/v) of NaCl. In these optimal conditions, the obtained cell concentration of 0.746 g L(-1) dry weight was in agreement with the predicted cell concentration. The optimized media significantly shortened the time required for cell culture to reach the stationary phase while providing a nearly 2.4-fold increase in biomass production. Furthermore, in cell cultures of three other halophilic archaea the use of optimized media enhanced growth rate and provided high-cell density.
