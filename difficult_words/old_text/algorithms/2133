Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most common health disorder to afflict elderly men. Although 67% of men aged 70 years have ED, and their interest in sexual intercourse remains high, less than 5% receive adequate treatment. In this report, we review recent developments in our understanding of the pathophysiology of ED, how geriatricians can perform an office-based evaluation, and rational (evidence-based) treatment of this important disorder.
