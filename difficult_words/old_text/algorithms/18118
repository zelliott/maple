A novel method for the determination of the particle contact angle at the liquid/gas or liquid/liquid interface based on the excluded area concept revealed, in spite of its simplicity, some serious difficulties connected with the exact quantitative particle deposition at the interface and with changes in the particulate contact angle upon binary monolayer compression. The comprehensive theoretical consideration of the contact angle behavior made for such a system allowed considerable improvements: firstly, the prediction of direction of the particles' displacement at surface pressure increase is now possible and hence an unambiguous identification of particle hydrophobicity can be done. Secondly, the analytical relation describing the dependence of the particulate contact angle on the surface tension (surface pressure) was derived, allowing the prediction of whether or not particles of a given hydrophobicity will be expelled from the monolayer at certain surface pressure and of the area relinquished by the displaced particles. Thirdly, the transformation of this relation upon taking into consideration the initial conditions led to a linear dependence between excluded area and normalized surface tension allowing the determination of the particle contact angle and the exact number of deposited particles simultaneously and independently of each other. Finally, the application of the improved approach to the previously collected experimental data yielded reasonable values for both particle contact angle and number of deposited particles.
