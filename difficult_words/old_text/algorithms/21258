The geminate rate constants for CO, O2, NO, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and n-butyl isocyanide rebinding to soybean leghemoglobin and monomeric component II of Glycera dibranchiata hemoglobin were measured at pH 7, 20 degrees C using a dye laser with a 30-ns square-wave pulse. The results were compared to the corresponding parameters for sperm whale myoglobin and the isolated alpha and beta subunits of human hemoglobin (Olson, J.S., Rohlfs, R.J., and Gibson, Q.H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem., 262, 12930-12938). The rate-limiting step for O2, NO, and isonitrile binding to all five proteins is ligand migration up to the initial geminate state, and the rate of this process determines the overall bimolecular association rate constant for these ligands. In contrast, iron-ligand bond formation limits the overall bimolecular rate for CO binding. The distal pockets in leghemoglobin and in Glycera HbII are approximately 10 times more accessible kinetically to diatomic ligands than that in sperm whale myoglobin. This difference accounts for the much larger association rate constants (1-2 x 10(8) M-1 s-1) that are observed for O2 and NO binding to leghemoglobin and Glycera HbII. The rates of isonitrile migration through leghemoglobin are also very large and indicate a very fluid or open distal structure near the sixth coordination position. In contrast, there is a marked decrease in the rate of migration up to and away from the sixth coordination position in Glycera HbII with increasing ligand size. These results were also used to interpret previously published rate constants and quantum yields for the high (R) and low (T) affinity states of human hemoglobin. In contrast to the differences between the monomeric proteins, the differences between the CO-, O2-, and NO-binding parameters for R and T state hemoglobin appear to be due to a decrease in the geminate reactivity of the heme iron atom, with little or no change in the accessibility of the distal pocket.
