LTR retrotransposons constitute one of the most abundant classes of repetitive elements in eukaryotic genomes. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for detection of full-length LTR retrotransposons in genomic sequences. The algorithm identifies regions in a genomic sequence that show structural characteristics of LTR retrotransposons. Three key components distinguish our algorithm from that of current software - (i) a novel method that preprocesses the entire genomic sequence in linear time and produces high quality pairs of LTR candidates in running time that is constant per pair, (ii) a thorough alignment-based evaluation of candidate pairs to ensure high quality prediction, and (iii) a robust parameter set encompassing both structural constraints and quality controls providing users with a high degree of flexibility. Validation of both our serial and parallel implementations of the algorithm against the yeast genome indicates both superior quality and performance results when compared to existing software.
