The performance of the perfectly matched layer absorption boundary condition is fully exploited when it is applied to the planewave based transfer-scattering matrix method in photonic crystal device simulation. The mode profile of one dimensional dielectric waveguide and the optical properties of sub-wavelength aluminum grating with semi-infinite substrate are studied to illustrate the accuracy and power of this approach.
