The PRODISTIN Web Site is a web service allowing users to functionally classify genes/proteins from any type of interaction network. The resulting computation provides a classification tree in which (1) genes/proteins are clustered according to the identity of their interaction partners and (2) functional classes are delineated in the tree using the Biological Process Gene Ontology annotations.

The PRODISTIN Web Site is freely accessible at http://gin.univ-mrs.fr/webdistin
