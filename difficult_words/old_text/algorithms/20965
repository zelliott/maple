Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a new endoluminal therapeutic technique involving the use of cutting devices to permit a larger resection of the tissue over the muscularis propria. The major advantages of the technique in comparison with polypectomy and endoscopic mucosal resection are controllable resection size and shape and en bloc resection of a large lesion or a lesion with ulcerative findings. This technique is applied for the endoscopic treatment of epithelial neoplasms in the gastrointestinal tract from the pharynx to the rectum. Furthermore, some carcinoids and submucosal tumors in the gastrointestinal tract are treated by ESD. To determine the indication, two aspects should be considered. The first is a little likelihood of lymph node metastasis and the second is the technical resectability. In this review, practical guidelines of ESD for the gastrointestinal neoplasms are discussed based on the evidence found in the literature.
