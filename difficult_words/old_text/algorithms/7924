Three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) is an additional ultrasound modality that is poised to become an integral part of the routine echocardiogram. Incorporating 3DE into clinical daily practice continues to be a challenge for many laboratories. The following review will focus on workflow processes related to methodology and protocols in order to incorporate 3DE into clinical practice.

Several studies have shown the clinical utility and feasibility of both transthoracic and transesophageal 3DE. In addition, many centers performing 3DE studies utilize a focused 3DE protocol as opposed to a full 3DE protocol. A majority of the studies noted limitations with respect to artifacts inherent in gated imaging and preferred real-time 3DE or rather volume imaging. A recurrent message from several recent publications is that the ultimate success and widespread clinical application of 3DE will rely mainly on improved 3D image resolution and volume rates.

Continuous technology improvements have led to real-time full-volume 3D imaging that is no longer prone to the artifact issues encountered with gated 3D imaging. Additional improvements to 3DE image quality and time-saving automatic quantitative analysis tools will continue to define the emerging role for routine 3DE.
