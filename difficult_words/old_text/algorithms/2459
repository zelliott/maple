Transport of essential solutes across biological membranes is one of the fundamental characteristics of living cells. Although selenium is an essential micronutrient, little is known about the cellular mechanisms of chemical species-specific selenium transport in fish. We report here the kinetic and pharmacological transport characteristics of selenite and its thiol (glutathione and l-cysteine) derivatives in primary cultures of hepatocytes and isolated enterocytes of rainbow trout. Findings from the current study suggest an apparent low-affinity linear transport system for selenite in both cell types. However, we recorded high-affinity Hill kinetics (K(d)=3.61±0.28 μmol l(-1)) in enterocytes exposed to selenite in the presence of glutathione. The uptake of selenite in the presence of thiols was severalfold higher than uptake of selenite alone (at equimolar concentration) in both hepatocytes and enterocytes. Cellular accumulation of selenium was found to be energy independent. Interestingly, we observed a decrease in selenite transport with increasing pH, whereas selenite uptake increased with increasing pH in the presence glutathione in both cell types. The cellular uptake of selenite demonstrated a pronounced competitive interaction with a structurally similar compound, sulfite. The uptake of selenite as well as its thiol derivatives was found to be sensitive to the anion transport blocker DIDS, irrespective of the cell type. Inorganic mercury (Hg(2+)) elicited an inhibition of selenite transport in both cell types, but augmented the transport of reduced forms of selenite in hepatocytes. Based on the substrate choice and comparable pharmacological properties, we advocate that multiple anion transport systems are probably involved in the cellular transport of selenite in fish.
