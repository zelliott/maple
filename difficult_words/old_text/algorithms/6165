For what we believe to be the first time, digital holographic microscopy is applied to perform optical diffraction tomography of a pollen grain. Transmission phase images with nanometric axial accuracy are numerically reconstructed from holograms acquired for different orientations of the rotating sample; then the three-dimensional refractive index spatial distribution is computed by inverse radon transform. A precision of 0.01 for the refractive index estimation and a spatial resolution in the micrometer range are demonstrated.
