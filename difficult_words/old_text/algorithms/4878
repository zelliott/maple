The presence in the serum of specific autoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), and antiextractable nuclear antigens (anti-ENA), is one of the diagnostic criteria for autoimmune rheumatic disease, and the requests for these tests in the last few years have grown remarkably. A guideline for reducing clinically inappropriate requests in autoantibody testing (ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-ENA) has been applied in the Parma Hospital since 2007. The results for the period January-December 2007 were compared to those of the previous period January-December 2006, and a significant reduction in the number of anti-dsDNA (23.9%) and anti-ENA (20.7%) was found. The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of a similar guideline in a wide area (Parma, Modena, Piacenza, Reggio-Emilia) with reference to the diagnosis of autoimmune rheumatic disease. This project, supported by a regional grant for innovative research projects, was started in January 2008 and consists of three different steps: (1) a study group of clinicians and laboratory physicians to evaluate the diagnostic criteria, the analytical procedures, and the number of tests performed in different hospitals; (2) developing common guidelines for autoantibody testing that takes into account the different clinical needs with the aim of improving efficiency and clinical effectiveness of diagnosis and monitoring; and (3) assessing compliance with the guidelines in the different hospitals that are evaluating the second-level test (anti-dsDNA, anti-ENA) decrease. We think that the validation of guidelines for the laboratory diagnosis of autoimmune rheumatic disease can represent a tool for improving patients' outcomes and economic efficiency.
