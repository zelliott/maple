Tissue-implanted ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio devices are being employed in both humans and animals for telemetry and telecommand applications. This paper describes the experimental measurement and electromagnetic modeling of propagation from 418-MHz and 916.5-MHz sources placed in the human vagina. Whole-body homogeneous and semi-segmented software models were constructed using data from the Visible Human Project. Bodyworn radiation efficiencies for a vaginally placed 418-MHz source were calculated using finite-difference time-domain and ranged between 1.6% and 3.4% (corresponding to net body losses of between 14.7 and 18.0 dB). Greater losses were encountered at 916.5 MHz, with efficiencies between 0.36% and 0.46% (net body loss ranging between 23.4 and 24.4 dB). Practical measurements were in good agreement with simulations, to within 2 dB at 418 MHz and 3 dB at 916.5 MHz. The degree of tissue-segmentation for whole-body models was found to have a minimal effect on calculated azimuthal radiation patterns and bodyworn radiation efficiency, provided the region surrounding the implanted source was sufficiently detailed.
