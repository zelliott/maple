During the last decade we have assisted in the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ovarian cancer, based on the best knowledge of molecular biology. One of the most promising strategies under investigation is antiangiogenic therapy. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal humanised antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which has shown antitumour activity in ovarian cancer in preclinical models as well as in clinical trials, both in monotherapy and in combination with other therapies. Currently, ongoing phase III trials are testing bevacizumab as a front-line therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Bevacizumab has been generally well tolerated with mild frequent toxicities (proteinuria, hypertension and bleeding). However, the drug may result in other uncommon, but potentially life-threatening side effects, such as arterial thromboembolism, wound healing complications, and gastrointestinal perforation or fistulae, which should be considered when the drug is administered. Other new therapeutic antiangiogenic strategies that include small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antibodies neutralising the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and soluble VEGFR hybrids (VEGF Trap) are being investigated with promising early results.
