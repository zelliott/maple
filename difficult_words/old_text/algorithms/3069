Dose verification of intensity-modulated arc therapy using an ERGO++ treatment planning system and Elekta internal multileaf collimators is described. Prostate intensity-modulated arc therapy was planned using the arc modulation optimization algorithm inverse planning module of ERGO++. After transferring the plan to Elekta Synergy's controller (Elekta Ltd, Crawley, UK), the isocentre dose was measured and compared with a calculated dose using a pinpoint chamber and a water phantom in a cylindrical acrylic enclosure. Subsequently, an EDR2 film was placed inside a multilayer plastic phantom, and total dose distributions were measured in three axial planes as well as in the coronal and sagittal planes to compare the actual dose with the calculated dose. The dose discrepancy at the isocentre was 1.7%. The calculated gamma indices were less than 1 over 90% of the three axial planes, as well as in the coronal and sagittal planes, having a dose greater than 50% of the maximum target dose.
