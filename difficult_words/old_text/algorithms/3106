Based on digital signal method, we propose a new representation of DNA primary sequence. The representation can completely avoid loss of information in the transfer of data from a DNA sequence to its mathematical representation. Afterwards, we suggest one such approach to reach quantification of similarities based on digital signal similarity theory. The examination of similarities/dissimilarities among the coding sequences of the first exon of beta-globin gene of 11 species shows the utility of the scheme.
