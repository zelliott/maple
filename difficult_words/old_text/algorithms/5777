Moderator-based treatment algorithms for depression are available to assist clinicians by providing a highly structured approach for the monitoring and assessment of medication efficacy and risks. Algorithm-based treatment strategies provide consistent care and improve outcomes, and patients treated with measurement-based care experience greater reduction of symptoms, faster remission rates, and better overall efficacy than care as usual. Additionally, electronic medical records have the potential to provide interactive guidance on optimal treatment choices during patient follow-up visits. This Webcast focuses on evaluating predictors of treatment response within the context of using algorithms and integrating this information into clinical practice via electronic medical records.
