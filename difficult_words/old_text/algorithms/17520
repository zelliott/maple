A new method for the accurate determination of carbon-carbon coupling constants is described. The method is based on a modified ADEQUATE experiment, where a J-modulated spin-echo sequence precedes the ADEQUATE pulse scheme. The J-modulation and scaling of carbon-carbon couplings is based on simultaneous incrementation of 13C chemical shift and coupling evolution periods. The time increment for the homonuclear carbon-carbon coupling evolution can be suitably scaled with respect to the corresponding increment for the chemical shift evolution. Typically a scaling factor of 2 to 3 is employed for the measurement of one-bond coupling constants, while multiplication by a factor of 10 to 15 is applied when small long-range couplings are determined. The same pulse scheme with coupling evolution period optimized for one-bond or long-range couplings allows the determination of the corresponding carbon-carbon coupling constants. The splittings of the ADEQUATE crosspeaks in the F1 dimension yield the appropriately multiplied coupling constants.
