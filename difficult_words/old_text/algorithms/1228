We have been investigating analysis of knee joint vibration or vibroarthrographic (VAG) signals as a potential tool for noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of cartilage pathology. In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparative study of different parametric representations of VAG signals. Dominant poles and cepstral coefficients were derived from autoregressive models of adaptively segmented VAG signals. Signal features and a few clinical features were used as feature vectors in pattern classification experiments based on logistic regression analysis and the leave-one-out method. The results using 51 normal and 39 abnormal signals indicated the superior performance of cepstral coefficients in VAG signal classification with an accuracy rate of 75.6%. With 51 normal and 20 abnormal signals limited to chondromalacia patella, cepstral coefficients again gave the highest accuracy rate of 85.9%.
