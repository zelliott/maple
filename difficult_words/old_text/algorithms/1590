Memory Clinics provide evidence based diagnosis and treatment of dementia. Whenever a diagnosis of dementia is made, it is important to inform the patients about the possible impact of dementia on driving. Patients and their next of kin require competent advice whenever this difficult question is addressed and the mobility desire and the risks related to driving need to be carefully weight up. The time of diagnosis does not necessarily equate to the time when a person with dementia becomes an unsafe driver. The cause and severity of dementia, comorbidities and the current medication need to be carefully taken into account for this decision. On behalf of the association of the Swiss Memory Clinics, a group of experts has developed recommendations to assess fitness to drive in cognitively impaired older adults.
