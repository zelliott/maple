Up to October 1994, twenty-four HTLV-I and 113 HTLV-II infected persons have been identified in Spain. A third of HTLV-I carriers were immigrants coming from endemic regions. In contrast, most HTLV-II-infected persons were Spanish native drug users. Four cases of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (TSP) were found, and three patients suffered lymphoma (ATL). A former drug user carrying HTLV-II infection developed a severe proximal myopathy. Studies performed on more than 100,000 blood donors allowed the identification of only two persons with HTLV-I infection.
