To reconstruct images from truncated projections collected along a spiral trajectory, the most common approach is to smoothly extrapolate each projection to suppress truncation artifacts. Based on the work of Dennerlein, a local reconstruction algorithm is developed for spiral cone beam computed tomography (CT), which does not need explicit projection extrapolation. This algorithm is a filtered-backprojection (FBP) format and contains three major steps: cosine weight, filtration, and backprojection. While the cosine weight and backprojection steps are the same as the classical Feldkamp - Davis - Kress (FDK) scheme, the filtering step contains two steps: Laplace filtering and Radon transform-based filtering. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a better performance than FDK algorithm for region-of-interest (ROI) reconstruction of spiral cone-beam CT.
