After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Discuss the critical anatomic structures of the nose that are affected in naso-orbital ethmoid fractures. 2. Discuss the advantages of early, complete nasal reconstruction of these fractures. 3. Apply a clinical algorithm to such nasal reconstruction. 4. List the techniques used in aesthetic reconstruction of the nose in naso-orbital ethmoid fractures.

Fractures of the naso-orbital ethmoid complex pose challenging management issues. Although basic treatment principles have been well described, the aesthetic management of the nasal component has not been adequately addressed in the literature.

When secondary nasal deformities occur, they are difficult to correct. Optimal primary correction of the nasal deformity is accomplished using the following four principles: (1) rigid fixation of the nasal pyramid and restoration of nasal height and length; (2) restoration of tip projection; (3) septal reduction/reconstruction; and (4) lateral nasal wall augmentation.

Successful management of naso-orbital ethmoid fractures is a complex and challenging task. Both the bony and soft-tissue components must be addressed and the extent of the injury must be adequately diagnosed to avoid omission of critical steps in the reconstruction. Inadequate treatment of naso-orbital ethmoid fractures can produce a severe cosmetic deformity that is very difficult to correct secondarily.

The authors discuss the nasal component of naso-orbital ethmoid complex injuries and detail the key principles in their algorithm for aesthetic nasal reconstruction.
