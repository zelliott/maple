To refine the billing to institutions whose operations of sterilization are outsourced, a sterilization cost approach was developed. The aim of the study is to determine the value of a sterilization unit (one point "S") evolving according to investments, quantities processed, types of instrumentation or packaging.

The time of preparation has been selected from all sub-processes of sterilization to determine the value of one point S. The time of preparation of sterilized large and small containers and pouches were raised. The reference time corresponds to one bag (equal to one point S). Simultaneously, the annual operating cost of sterilization was defined and divided into several areas of expenditure: employees, equipments and building depreciation, supplies, and maintenance.

A total of 136Â crossing times of containers were measured. Time to prepare a pouch has been estimated at one minute (one S). A small container represents four S and a large container represents 10S. By dividing the operating cost of sterilization by the total number of points of sterilization over a given period, the cost of one S can be determined.

This method differs from traditional costing method in sterilizing services, considering each item of expenditure. This point S will be the base for billing of subcontracts to other institutions.
