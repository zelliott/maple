Syncope is a significant patient care issue. There are approximately half a million cases annually. Syncope may represent a life-threatening condition or a benign process. Identifying the cause of syncope is often difficult because it occurs sporadically and the cause is usually not obvious. The literature states that as many as 25% to 50% of patients who experience syncope remain undiagnosed. Taking a very practical approach when caring for these patients includes a very detailed health history, electrocardiogram, and a logical approach based on what is known and what was learned from the patient's medical history.
