In the post-genomic era the concept of personalized medicine and molecular medicine emphasizes the utility of the proteomics approach. Proteomics is the global analysis of cellular proteins and complements the genomics approach. Proteins, in principle do all the work of the cell and ultimately dictate all biological processes and the cellular fate. Proteomics uses a combination of sophisticated techniques including two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, image analysis, mass spectrometry, amino acid sequencing and bioinformatics to identify and characterize proteins. This review aims at providing the various approaches and pitfalls associated with this technique and gives a brief overview of the utility of this approach in the area of biomedical research.
