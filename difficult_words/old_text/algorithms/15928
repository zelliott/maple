Local flap reconstruction of pedal defects can be accomplished with a variety of techniques. Multiple geometric constructs have been described for closure of foot defects. Each has its own unique principles which can be adapted to certain locations and premorbid conditions. Local flaps considered for closure of foot defects should lie within the higher level of any algorithm, due to their versatility, reproducibility, and long term functional outcomes. In addition, hospitalization, length of anesthesia, and perioperative care can be much less with the use of local flaps.
