The Friedewald formula (LDL-F) for the estimation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations is the most often used formula in clinical trials and clinical practice. However, much concern has been raised as to whether this formula is applicable in all patient populations such as the presence of chylomicronaemia and/or hypertriglyceridaemia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate various LDL cholesterol calculation formulas as well as LDL cholesterol levels provided by the Lipoprint LDL System (LDL-L) in patients with the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn).

LDL-F showed significant differences from other formulas in the total cohort, as well as in MetSyn individuals. This was not the case in nonMetSyn subjects, where LDL-F did not differ with other formulas, with the exception of one formula (LDL by Planella, LDL-P). The bias between LDL-F and other LDL estimation formulas were significantly higher in MetSyn subjects compared to nonMetSyn individuals, except for LDL-L which produced similar bias with LDL-F in both study groups.

LDL-F seems to exhibit some limitations as far as the calculation of LDL-C levels in patients with the MetSyn is concerned. LDL-L might be more accurate in MetSyn subjects, but so far its use is limited for the estimation of small, dense LDL (sdLDL) cholesterol levels and mean LDL particle size for research purposes only.
