In contrast to the negative results of the primary analysis, secondary analyses of the HEMO study do support the clinical importance of middle molecule removal. This is in agreement with the findings of large observational studies showing an improvement in mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients treated with high-flux hemodialysis or convective techniques as compared to low-flux hemodialysis. For practical assessment of middle molecule removal, we suggest using the Kt/V of beta2-microglobulin (Kt/Vbeta2-m) with a reference (adequate) value of >or=0.66, which was the average value for the high-flux arm in the HEMO study. For patients on low-flux hemodialysis, where Kt/Vbeta2-m cannot reliably be assessed, we suggest using the Kt/V of vitamin B12 (Kt/VB12), with a reference (adequate) value of >or=0.74, adapted from the findings of the Case Mix Adequacy Study (AJKD 1999). To simplify the routine assessment of these indices, two nomograms are introduced: the first allows to estimate Kt/Vbeta2-m from the post- to pre-dialysis beta2-microglobulin concentration ratio, the second allows to estimate the diffusion dialysis clearance of vitamin B12 from the in vitro dialyzer KoAB12 and actual plasma water flow rate. While waiting for specific trials addressing the issue of dialysis adequacy related to middle molecule removal, clinical experience with the middle molecule indices could provide further quantitative tools for dialysis prescription and favor an increase in dialysis time (or frequency) and/or the use of high-flux hemodialysis and convective techniques.
