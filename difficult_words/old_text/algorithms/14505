A stirred flow reactor was used to study the influence of phosphorus on the adsorption and desorption kinetics of copper in two acid soils on granite and amphibolite. The presence of P was found to significantly increase Cu adsorption in both soils, albeit at different types of sites (mainly in slow adsorption sites in the soil on granite, and both in fast and slow adsorption sites in that on amphibolite). The increased Cu sorption at fast sites in the amphibolite soil was due to its high content in Fe oxyhydroxides, which bound P and released OH(-) as a result, thereby raising the pH and leading to a higher sorption capacity during fast reactions. On the other hand, the increased Cu sorption at slow adsorption sites was due to Cu(2+) acting as a bridging element between P and organic matter.
