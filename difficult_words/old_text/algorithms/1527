Therapy of Ewing's sarcoma consists of adequate local treatment for control of the primary tumor (surgery or radiotherapy or a combination of both) and systemic therapy. Tumors with favorable prognosis (small tumor volume, good response to chemotherapy) may be managed by a single local modality. In tumors with poor prognosis, combined local treatment (surgery plus radiotherapy) seems to improve local control and survival. As an innovative approach, preoperative radiotherapy for high-risk tumors is investigated in the EICESS-92-study.
