Computer modeling was used to measure the fractional volumes available to prolate spheroid objects in a random, inert network of fibers. The data fit the Ogston equation exactly when the object was a sphere (axial ratio = 1). When the axial ratio was increased from 1 to 9, the Ogston equation was still obeyed if the fiber concentration is multiplied by a factor, A, which increases linearly in proportion to the axial ratio. The factor A allows one to adjust the retardation coefficient derived from gel electrophoresis, KR, for spherical objects to that of prolate spheroids with axial ratios from 1 to 9. Potentially, the same adjustment of KR is possible for objects of other shapes.
