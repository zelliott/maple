We describe an algorithm for aligning two sequences within a diagonal band that requires only O(NW) computation time and O(N) space, where N is the length of the shorter of the two sequences and W is the width of the band. The basic algorithm can be used to calculate either local or global alignment scores. Local alignments are produced by finding the beginning and end of a best local alignment in the band, and then applying the global alignment algorithm between those points. This algorithm has been incorporated into the FASTA program package, where it has decreased the amount of memory required to calculate local alignments from O(NW) to O(N) and decreased the time required to calculate optimized scores for every sequence in a protein sequence database by 40%. On computers with limited memory, such as the IBM-PC, this improvement both allows longer sequences to be aligned and allows optimization within wider bands, which can include longer gaps.
