The study of arterial mechanics concerns functional characteristics depending on wall elasticity and flow profile. Wall elasticity can be investigated through the estimation of parameters like the arterial distensibility, which is of high clinical interest because of its known correlation not only with the advanced atherosclerotic disease, but also with aging and major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The flow velocity profile is also clinically relevant, because it modulates endothelial function and can be responsible for the development and distribution of atherosclerotic plaques. A clinically relevant variable extracted from the blood velocity profile is the wall shear rate (WSR), which represents the spatial velocity gradient near the vessel wall. This paper describes an integrated ultrasound system, capable of detecting both the velocity profile and the wall movements in human arteries. It basically consists of a PC add-on board including a single high-speed digital signal processor. This is dedicated to the analysis of echo-signals backscattered from 128 range cells located along the axis of the interrogating ultrasound (US) beam. Echoes generated from the walls (characterized by high amplitudes and low Doppler frequencies) and from red blood cells (characterized by low amplitudes and relatively high Doppler frequencies) are independently processed in real-time. Wall velocity is detected through the autocorrelation algorithm, while blood velocity is investigated through a complete spectral analysis of all signals backscattered by erythrocytes and WSR is extracted from the estimated velocity profile. Preliminary applications of the new system, including the simultaneous analysis of blood flow and arterial wall movement in healthy volunteers and in a diseased patient, are discussed, and first results are presented.
