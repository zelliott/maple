The nonlinear response of silica--gold nanoshells (SGNs) in chloroform was studied using laser pulses of 65 fs at 1560 nm. The experiments were performed using the thermally managed Z--scan technique that allows measurements of the electronic contribution for the nonlinear response, free from thermal influence. The results were analyzed using an analytical approach based on the quasi--static approximation that allowed extraction of the nonlinear susceptibility of a SGN from the data. High third--order susceptibility, χsh((3)) = - 1.5 x 10(-11) m(2)/V(2), approximately four orders of magnitude larger than for gold nanospheres in the visible, and large fifth--order susceptibility, χsh((5)) = - 1.4 x 10(-24) m(4)/V(4), were obtained. The present results offers new perspectives for nonlinear plasmonics in the near--infrared.
