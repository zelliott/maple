Epistaxis in the anticoagulated patient poses a complicated management problem, which requires interdisciplinary collaboration. The aetiology of the majority of cases of epistaxis remains idiopathic, but an ageing population and the prevalence of ischaemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease has meant that there are increasing numbers of patients on long term oral anticoagulant therapy. This has led to a concomitant increase in the incidence of complications experienced. We have reviewed the available relevant literature and guidelines in the current management practice in this scenario. In light of this, we propose a more standardised algorithm for the management of epistaxis in this challenging group of patients.
