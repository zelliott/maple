Synchronization has been observed in various systems, including living beings. In a previous study, we reported a new phenomenon with antisynchronization in calling behavior of two interacting Japanese tree frogs. In this paper, we theoretically analyse nonlinear dynamics in a system of three coupled oscillators, which models three interacting frogs, where the oscillators of each pair have the property of antisynchronization; in particular, we perform bifurcation analysis and Lyapunov function analysis.
