Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the heart is a rapidly evolving application for comprehensive assessment of coronary arterial anatomy, myocardial function, perfusion, and myocardial viability. Thus, cardiac CTA is capable of retrieving the most critical information for guiding the management of patients with suspected coronary heart disease (CHD). Ongoing technologic advancements have allowed acquiring such information within minutes, at radiation doses that are lower than those from conventional computed tomography imaging or common nuclear imaging techniques. Cardiac CTA has positioned itself as an imaging modality that may be well suited to fulfill central needs of cardiovascular medicine. This article reviews the evidence for the clinical utility of cardiac CTA in patients with suspected CHD.
