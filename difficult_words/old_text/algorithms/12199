Pseudo second order kinetic expressions of Ho, Sobkowsk and Czerwinski, Blanachard et al. and Ritchie were fitted to the experimental kinetic data of malachite green onto activated carbon by non-linear and linear method. Non-linear method was found to be a better way of obtaining the parameters involved in the second order rate kinetic expressions. Both linear and non-linear regression showed that the Sobkowsk and Czerwinski and Ritchie's pseudo second order model were the same. Non-linear regression analysis showed that both Blanachard et al. and Ho have similar ideas on the pseudo second order model but with different assumptions. The best fit of experimental data in Ho's pseudo second order expression by linear and non-linear regression method showed that Ho pseudo second order model was a better kinetic expression when compared to other pseudo second order kinetic expressions. The amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium, q(e), was predicted from Ho pseudo second order expression and were fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich and Redlich Peterson expressions by both linear and non-linear method to obtain the pseudo isotherms. The best fitting pseudo isotherm was found to be the Langmuir and Redlich Peterson isotherm. Redlich Peterson is a special case of Langmuir when the constant g equals unity.
