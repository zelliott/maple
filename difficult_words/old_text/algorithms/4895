This paper presents a 2-D model to calculate the electric current densities and the biopotential differences generated due to a breast cancerous cell during the hyperpolarization of the G1/synthesis (G1/S) transition. The proposed model is based on semiconductor diffusion-drift analysis, and aims to understand the biophysics associated with growing breast cancerous cells. The effect of the duration of the G1/S transition, and the diffusivity and the mobility of the cancerous cell boundary is investigated. The results show that shorter G1/S transition durations, and higher diffusivity and mobility at the cell boundary provide higher magnitude of the electric signals.
