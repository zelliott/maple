High anisotropy L1(0) ordered FePt thin films are considered to have high potential for use as high areal density recording media, beyond 1 Tera bit/in2. In this paper, we review recent results on the synthesis and magnetic properties of L1(0) FePt nanocomposite films. Several fabrication methods have been developed to produce high-anisotropy FePt films: epitaxial and non-epitaxial growth of (001)-oriented FePt:X (X = Au, Ag, Cu, C, etc.) composite films that might be used for perpendicular media; monodispersed FePt nanocluster-assembled films grown with a gas-aggregation technique and having uniform cluster size and narrow size distribution; self-assembled FePt particles prepared with chemical synthesis by reduction/decomposition techniques, etc. The magnetic properties are controllable through variations in the nanocluster properties and nanostructure. FePt and related films show promise for development as heat-assisted magnetic recording media at extremely high areal densities. The self-assembled FePt arrays show potential for approaching the ultimate goal of single-grain-per-bit patterned media.
