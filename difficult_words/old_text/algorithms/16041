Based on the premise that similar surface properties between the adhesive and the substrate would yield a strong adhesive bond, copolymers of acrylic acid (AA) and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (EHA), P(AA-co-EHA), were designed and synthesized for buccal mucoadhesion. A series of linear copolymers with varying feed ratios of the two monomers (AA and EHA) were synthesized through free radical copolymerization at 69+/-0.5 degrees C using azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) as initiator. The reactions were carried out in THF under nitrogen for 24 h. The glass transition temperatures, T(g), of the copolymers were determined using DSC. The adhesion studies were conducted to determine the effects of copolymer composition, contact time between the substrate and the adhesive, and crosshead speed on mucoadhesive performance of the copolymer films using a computer interfaced Instron material testing system. The glass transition temperature of the copolymers decreased with increasing EHA content. Wet glass surface as substrate was shown not to be a good substrate model for adhesion determination studies. The copolymer composed of 46:54 mol.% AA:EHA (an almost 1:1 ratio in the repeat units) yielded the highest mucoadhesive force in contact with porcine buccal mucosa which was significantly greater (P<0.05) than that of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) (used as positive control). The mucoadhesive force for all copolymers studied was significantly (P<0.05) greater than that of the negative control (backing material without copolymer film) except for the EHA homopolymer. Crosshead speed increased mucoadhesive force linearly and had a more pronounced effect on the mucoadhesive performance than time of contact between the adhesive and the substrate.
