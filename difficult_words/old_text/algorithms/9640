A linear third-order model of the ocular motor plant for horizontal saccadic eye movements is presented consisting of a linear ocular motor plant and a time-optimal saccadic controller based on physiological considerations. The ocular motor plant consists of the eyeball and two extraocular muscles. All parameters and initial conditions are estimated or measured from physiological data. The neural inputs are described by pulse-slide-step waveforms with a post inhibitory rebound burst and based on a time-optimal controller. Model parameters are estimated using the system identification technique. The static and dynamic behaviors of the model are in excellent agreement with the experimental data.
