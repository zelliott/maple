A novel technique for the 3D reconstruction of the spine from X-ray images is presented. The algorithm is based on the self-calibration of biplanar radiographs. It allows the 3D reconstruction of spines from old uncalibrated preoperative and postoperative radiographs. The reliability of the new self-calibration technique was investigated by validating its results against those of the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) on real images. An accuracy experiment was also performed using a dry spine specimen under controlled conditions. The results indicate that self-calibration is a viable technique, accurate enough to extract meaningful 3D clinical data for retrospective studies.
