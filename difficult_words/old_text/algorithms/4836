In a cross-over randomized pilot study, the relative absorption of vitamins C, B(6) and B(12) were tested using a commercial vitamin-water (VW) and a standardized mixed meal (MM).

Twelve adults (22.9+/-3.7 years), received the VW and the MM, randomly ordered, with a minimum 7-day washout period between. Blood was drawn pre-ingestion and over a post-ingestion period of 300+ min. Test meal quantities were formulated to contain equal amounts of vitamins B(6), B(12), and C as per the water label. Analysis revealed that a scaling factor had to be used to balance the actual content differences between test products.

Using the adjusted numbers for actual water vitamin concentration, there were no differences in the maximum concentration and the 5-h area under the curve for vitamins B(6), B(12) or C between the VW and the MM.

VW was found to provide similar in vivo nutrition as the test MM at a caloric saving.
