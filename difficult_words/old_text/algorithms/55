The physical and chemical changes occurring in blood that has been inoculated into a blood culture bottle can be used as means to detect the presence of microorganisms in blood cultures. These changes include primarily the conversion of oxy- to deoxyhemoglobin within the red blood cells (RBCs) and changes in the cell number densities. These changes in the physical and chemical properties of blood can be readily detected using spectrophometric methods thus enabling the continuous monitoring of blood culture vials to provide quantitative information on the growth behavior of the microorganisms present. This paper reports on the application of spectrophotometric information obtained from diffuse reflectance measurements of aerobic blood cultures to detect microbial growth and compares the results to those obtained using the standard blood culture system.
