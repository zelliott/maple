Alpha-latrotoxin evokes massive [3H]GABA release from rat brain synaptosomes by stimulating exocytosis and outflow from non-vesicular pool. In the present study, GABA transporter-mediated [3H]GABA release was shown to be involved in alpha-latrotoxin-triggered release of [3H]GABA from non-vesicular pool. The following agents have been exploited as tools: (1) a protonophore carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazon (FCCP) and bafilomycin A1 for evoking depletion of synaptic vesicle [3H]GABA and enlargement of non-vesicular pool; (2) a non-substrate high-affinity GABA transport blocker NO-711 for determining participation of GABA carrier in the toxin-stimulated GABA release; (3) a competitive inhibitor of GABA reuptake nipecotic acid for heteroexchange [3H]GABA release. As shown by the experiments with nipecotic acid, FCCP and bafilomycin A1 considerably increase the content of non-vesicular [3H]GABA. The treatment of the synaptosomes with these agents modified the response to alpha-latrotoxin, particularly to its subnanomolar concentrations: the lack or substantial lowering of the toxin-evoked release during the first 2 min after the toxin addition and substantial enhancement of release up to the 5th minute were observed. Only the step of enhanced release was sensitive to GABA transporter blocker NO-711. Distinct sensitivity to NO-711 was shown to be characteristic for different steps of alpha-latrotoxin-stimulated [3H]GABA release from the control, untreated synaptosomes: lack of any effect of NO-711 during the first 2 min and powerful inhibition in 10 min after the toxin application. Taken together these data appear to indicate that the toxin non-simultaneously from vesicular and non-vesicular origins releases the neurotransmitter, the first rapid step reflects exocytosis stimulation, and the second tardy step is at least in part due to the release mediated by GABA transporters. The incomplete inhibition with NO-711 of the tardy step of the release evoked by nanomolar toxin concentrations suggests the participation not only of the GABA transporters.
