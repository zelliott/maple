The aim of this study is to evaluate familial thrombophilia factors in infertile patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

This analytic study was performed on 123 infertile women with PCOS as the case group, and 73 infertile women with male factor as the control group, who were under treatment. Blood samples were taken on the third day of the menstrual cycle for evaluation of protein S, protein C, antithrombin III, APC-resistance, homocysteine levels and additional metabolic and endocrine parameters for both groups. Comparisons between groups were performed by the t-test, and Fisher exact test. p<0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.

Although the mean value of protein S and protein C in the case group was lower than the control group, there was no significance difference (p=0.752 and p=0.602, respectively). The mean of antithrombin III, activated protein C resistance (APC-R) and homocysteine levels in the two groups were not significant (p=0.756, p=0.603 and p=0.157, respectively).

We were unable to determine a positive relationship between PCOS and thrombophilia. The existence of a possible trend towards high prevalence of thrombophilia in women with PCOS needs further research.
