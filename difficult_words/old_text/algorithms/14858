Humans use intuition and experience to classify everything they perceive, but only if the distinguishing patterns are visible. Machine-learning algorithms can learn class information from data sets, but the created classes' meaning isn't always clear. A proposed mixed-initiative approach combines intuitive visualizations with machine learning to tap into the strengths of human and machine classification. The use of visualizations in an expert-guided clustering technique allows the display of complex data sets in a way that allows human input into machine clustering. Test participants successfully employed this technique to classify analytic activities using behavioral observations of a creative-analysis task. The results demonstrate how visualization of the machine-learned classification can help users create more robust and intuitive categories.
