As ultrasound becomes more widely utilized in pregnancy and imaging technology improves, cleft lip and palate will become more commonly identified in prenatal life. In efforts to meet the needs for information regarding cause and management, pregnant women and their partners are increasingly referred to cleft and craniofacial treatment programs. This group of patients provides unique challenges to professionals unfamiliar with the issues inherent to this population. Information regarding the extent of the defect and the absence of associated abnormalities is usually incomplete. Treatment teams may be uncomfortable with the possibility that couples may choose not to continue a pregnancy on the basis of what they hear. Currently between 14% and 25% of cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, is detected antenatally. About 12% of presumably isolated clefts will be one feature in a broader pattern of malformation. This article reviews the current status of ultrasound in the detection of clefts during pregnancy and outlines a strategy for counseling based on the author's experience in both a prenatal diagnosis program and a cleft-craniofacial treatment team.
