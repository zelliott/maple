Mechanical stresses play a key role in regulating cell growth and cell differentiation. Using mechanical and physiological data available in the literature, we are able to construct a growth curve of a child, which we compare to the standard curve. It appears likely that the impact of hormones on pubertal growth rate sprout followed by growth arrest can be solely explained by increased mechanical stresses. The uptake of hormones by the muscles results in increased mechanical stress on the chondrocyte before and at the puberty, resulting in a peak in growth followed by growth cessation.
