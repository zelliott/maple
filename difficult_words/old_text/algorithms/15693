We performed this prospective cohort study to correlate the findings of left ventricular angiography (LVA) and NOGA left ventricular electromechanical mapping (LVEM) in the evaluation of cardiac wall motion and also to establish standards for wall motion assessment by LVEM. Fifty-five patients (35 men; mean age, 60.4 +/- 11.8 years) eligible for elective left cardiac catheterization underwent LVA and LVEM. Wall motion scores, LV ejection fractions (LVEF), and LV volumes derived from LVA versus LVEM data were compared and analyzed statistically. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the accuracy of LVEM in distinguishing between normal, hypokinetic, and akinetic/dyskinetic wall motion. Mean LVEM procedure time was 37 +/- 11 minutes. The LVEM and LVA findings differed for mean LVEF (55% +/- 13% vs 36% +/- 9%), mean end-systolic volume (56 +/- 13 mL vs 36 +/- 10 mL), and mean end-diastolic volume (174 +/- 104 mL vs 123 +/- 65 mL). Mean wall motion scores (+/- SD) for normokinetic, hypokinetic, and akinetic/dyskinetic segments were 13.9% +/- 5.6%, 8.3% +/- 5.2%, and 3.2% +/- 3.1%, respectively. Cutpoints for differentiating between wall motion types were 12% and 6%. The ROC curves showed LVEM to have a 93% accuracy in differentiating between normokinetic and akinetic/dyskinetic segments and a 73% accuracy between normokinetic and hypokinetic segments. These data suggest that LVEM can differentiate between normal and abnormal cardiac wall motion, although it is more accurate at differentiating between normokinetic and akinetic/dyskinetic motion than between normokinetic and hypokinetic motion.
