In the period from 1949 to 1956, liquid radioactive waste was routinely and accidentally discharged by the Mayak Production Association, Southern Urals, Russia, into the Techa river. Based on a novel approach, the contamination of the Techa river water, the bottom sediments and the adjacent flood plains was modelled, and internal and external doses were estimated for two villages located downstream of the site of liquid radioactive waste release. Altogether, 11 radionuclides that occurred in the liquid radioactive waste were included in the calculations. The results suggest significantly higher doses than previously assumed, with the major contribution in the year 1951. Radionuclides with half-lives of less than 1 year, such as 89Sr, 131I, 95Zr+95Nb, 103Ru+103mRh, 140Ba+140La, and 144Ce+144Pr, represent the major sources and, in contrast, long-lived radionuclides, such as 90Sr and 137Cs that have so far been assumed to be most important, did not dominate the doses. For adults from the village Metlino, located 7 km downstream of the site of liquid radioactive waste discharge, the committed effective doses due to intake of radionuclides were calculated to be about 2.3 Sv, while the external doses were between about 1.2 Sv and 6.9 Sv. On the other hand, for adults from Muslyumovo, located 75 km downstream, the committed effective doses due to intake of radionuclides were calculated to be about 0.5 Sv, while the external doses were between 0.5 Sv and 2.0 Sv. The values for the skin doses to the Metlino and Muslyumovo populations were about 7.1 Sv and 1.3 Sv, respectively. It is concluded that the current dose estimates for the residents of the Techa river need, therefore, reevaluation.
