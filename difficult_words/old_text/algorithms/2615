The declining death rate from ectopic pregnancy over the last 30 years has resulted not from improvements in operative technique, anesthesia, or blood banking but primarily due to more rapid diagnosis that allows for earlier treatment. Algorithms have been developed to eliminate delays in ordering the various diagnostic tests in the appropriate order. Diagnostic tests include serum human chorionic gonadotropin and progesterone levels, culdocentesis, dilatation and curettage, transvaginal ultrasound, and laparoscopy.
