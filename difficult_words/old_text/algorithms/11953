We have constructed a human fetal brain cDNA library in an Escherichia coli expression vector for high-throughput screening of recombinant human proteins. Using robot technology, the library was arrayed in microtiter plates and gridded onto high-density filter membranes. Putative expression clones were detected on the filters using an antibody against the N-terminal sequence RGS-His(6) of fusion proteins. Positive clones were rearrayed into a new sublibrary, and 96 randomly chosen clones were analyzed. Expression products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, affinity purification, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and the determined protein masses were compared to masses predicted from DNA sequencing data. It was found that 66% of these clones contained inserts in a correct reading frame. Sixty-four percent of the correct reading frame clones comprised the complete coding sequence of a human protein. High-throughput microtiter plate methods were developed for protein expression, extraction, purification, and mass spectrometric analyses. An enzyme assay for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in native extracts was adapted to the microtiter plate format. Our data indicate that high-throughput screening of an arrayed protein expression library is an economical way of generating large numbers of clones producing recombinant human proteins for structural and functional analyses.
