Impedance control is one of the most effective methods for controlling the interaction between a manipulator and a task environment. In conventional impedance control methods, however, the manipulator cannot be controlled until the end-effector contacts task environments. A noncontact impedance control method has been proposed to resolve such a problem. This method on only can regulate the end-point impedance, but also the virtual impedance that works between the manipulator and the environment by using visual information. This paper proposes a learning method using neural networks to regulate the virtual impedance parameters according to a given task. The validity of the proposed method was verified through computer simulations and experiments with a multijoint robotic manipulator.
