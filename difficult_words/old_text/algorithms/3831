Basing on rheo- and photoplethysmography combined with mathematical methods and computers the authors have developed a method for the differential diagnosis of periodontal diseases (gingivitis, periodontitis). Diagnostic studies carried out in 200 patients have shown a high probability (at least 92 percent) of the method for the differential diagnosis of periodontal diseases.
