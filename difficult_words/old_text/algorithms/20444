The present study aimed to investigate new pore induction as a flux-enhancing mechanism in human epidermal membrane (HEM) with low to moderate voltage electric fields. The extent of pore induction and the effective pore sizes of these induced pores were to be assessed using a low frequency (12.5 Hz) low to moderate voltage (2. 0 to 4.0 V) square-wave alternating current (ac) "passive" permeation method (ac iontophoresis). This ac approach was to allow for inducing and sustaining a state of pore induction in HEM while permitting no significant transport enhancement via electroosmosis; thus, transport enhancement entirely due to new pore induction (enhanced passive permeation) was to be assessed without any contributions from electroosmosis. Good proportionality between the increase in HEM permeability and its electrical conductance was found with the "passive" transport data obtained during square-wave ac iontophoresis using urea as the model permeant. Typically, at 3.0 to 4.0 V, HEM conductance increases (and permeability increases) ranged from around 3- to 30-fold. These results appear to be the first direct evidence that new pore induction in HEM is a significant flux enhancing mechanism under moderate voltage conditions. The extents of pore induction in HEM under low frequency moderate voltage (2.0 to 3.0 V) ac, pulsed direct current (dc), and continuous dc were also compared. The extents of pore induction from square-wave ac and pulsed dc were generally of the same order of magnitude but somewhat less than that observed during continuous dc iontophoresis at the same applied voltage and duration, suggesting less extent of pore induction with reversing polarity or when a brief delay is provided between pulses to allow for membrane depolarization. The average effective pore sizes calculated for the induced pores from the experimental data with urea and mannitol as probe permeants and the hindered transport theory were 12 +/- 2 A, which are of the same order of magnitude as those of preexisting pores determined from conventional passive diffusion experiments.
