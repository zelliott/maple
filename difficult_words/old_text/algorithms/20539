In addition to morphological and anatomical information, functional information is increasingly used in clinical routine to assess pathological alterations of the brain. In addition to nuclear-medical methods there is a growing interest in using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate tissue perfusion of the brain. The method employed is based on the indicator-dilution method after bolus injection of a contrast agent. In this paper we present the implementation of an efficient algorithm to calculate quantitatively the regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV). Computation requires about 1 min on a Macintosh Quadra 660AV. The results are represented as parameter images that allow global overall visual inspection as well as quantitative local evaluation by means of user-defined regions of interest.
