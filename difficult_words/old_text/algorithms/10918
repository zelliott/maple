A 68-year-old man presented with a history of significant urinary urge incontinence, pollakiuria, and weak bladder sensation. He also reported mild fecal incontinence and a hypotrophic and slightly weaker left leg. At 63 years of age he had presented to a urologist for treatment of irritative lower urinary tract symptoms and incontinence. A transurethral resection of the prostate had been performed. After the operation, the symptoms had persisted and the incontinence seriously worsened.

Clinical neurologic examination, videourodynamic examination, neurophysiologic examination, and MRI of the spinal cord.

Neurogenic bladder dysfunction caused by adult tethered cord syndrome with myelon up to S2 level, spina bifida occulta, and lipoma infiltrating the conus medullaris.

Conservative anticholinergic treatment failed, and injection of botulinum-A toxin is planned.
