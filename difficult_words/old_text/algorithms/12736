The paper presents a case where an implant for a part of the sternum (with costal cartilages) affected by cancer was created and implanted by using the specific reverse modeling method and solid free-form fabrication. The method provides surgeons with a fast and reliable tool for tissue engineering and implantation and therefore improves the quality of life for patients. Digital images of healthy sternum samples were used to develop a reverse modeling algorithm that semi-automatically generates a necessary and sufficient simplification of the tissue geometry to be fabricated in an inexpensive and applicable manner. In this particular case, the redesign of the missing part of the sternum in CAD software took three designer-hours. At the same time, the suitable simplification of the geometry affects the fabrication of simpler and less expensive casting molds. Furthermore, the core of the developed algorithm for the reverse modeling of sternum can be applied in the reverse modeling improvement of other tile (or plate-like) bones.
