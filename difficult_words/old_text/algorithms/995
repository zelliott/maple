Independent component analysis (ICA) is a new technique in statistical signal processing to extract independent components from multidimensional measurements of mixed signals. In this paper, for the processing of functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) data, two signals of near voxels are used as the mixed signals and are separated by ICA. The correlation coefficients between the reference signal and the separated signals are calculated and those voxels whose correlation coefficients are greater than a threshold are considered to be the activated voxels by the stimulation, and so the functional localization of the stimulation is completed. The validity of the method was primarily proved by trial of real brain functional magnetic resonance imaging data.
