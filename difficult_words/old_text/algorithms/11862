This paper proposes a method for the reconstruction of foot-ground reaction forces from force platform recordings of two consecutive footfalls. The reconstruction algorithm uses zero-derivative criterion (inflection point) to detect contralateral foot contacts and subtracts contralateral forces from the combined force-time curve in order to reconstruct force-time data. Experimental results suggest that the method can be applied to separate accurately foot-specific gait forces from corrupted force-time data as a result of incorrect stepping on a force platform.
