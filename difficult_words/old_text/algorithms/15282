Response regulator proteins within two-component signal transduction systems are activated by phosphorylation and can catalyze their own covalent phosphorylation using small molecule phosphodonors. To date, comprehensive kinetic characterization of response regulator autophosphorylation is limited to CheY, which follows a simple model of phosphodonor binding followed by phosphorylation. We characterized autophosphorylation of the response regulator PhoB, known to dimerize upon phosphorylation. In contrast to CheY, PhoB time traces exhibited an initial lag phase and gave apparent pseudo-first order rate constants that increased with protein concentration. Furthermore, plots of the apparent autophosphorylation rate constant versus phosphodonor concentration were sigmoidal, as were PhoB binding isotherms for the phosphoryl group analog BeF3(-). Successful mathematical modeling of the kinetic data necessitated inclusion of the formation of a PhoB heterodimer (one phosphorylated and one unphosphorylated monomer) with an enhanced rate of phosphorylation. Specifically, dimerization constants for the PhoB heterodimer and homodimer (two phosphorylated monomers) were similar, but the rate constant for heterodimer phosphorylation was ~10-fold higher than for the monomer. In a test of the model, disruption of the known PhoB(N) dimerization interface by mutation led to markedly slower and noncooperative autophosphorylation kinetics. Furthermore, phosphotransfer from the sensor kinase PhoR was enhanced by dimer formation. Phosphorylation-mediated dimerization allows many response regulators to bind to tandem DNA-binding sites and regulate transcription. Our data challenge the notion that response regulator dimers primarily form between two phosphorylated monomers and raise the possibility that response regulator heterodimers containing one phosphoryl group may participate in gene regulation.
