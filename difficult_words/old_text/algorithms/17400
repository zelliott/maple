Many patients with metastatic breast cancer receive several types of chemotherapy, although it is recognized that there is a declining probability of response. A major problem confronts oncologists in deciding when to recommend to patients that no further chemotherapy should be given. To address this problem we have assessed prospectively, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and costs of health care for 35 patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving third line chemotherapy in a representative clinical situation. HRQL and utilities were measured longitudinally using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and the time trade-off method. Patients received a median of 2 cycles of chemotherapy and lived a median of 4.3 months. Twelve patients (34%) had substantial (> 10 points) improvement in the Global QL subscale and more than 30% of patients had similar changes in emotional and social function. The median baseline utility score was 0.9 and utilities correlated poorly with HRQL subscale. Eighteen patients had measurable disease and one patients experienced a partial response. Grade 3/4 toxicity occurred in 30% of patients. The average cost of management from study entry to death was CDN$ 17,260 (approximately US$ 12,000). Sixteen percent of this cost was associated directly with chemotherapy while hospital admissions and outpatient visits accounted for 50% and 14% of the total cost respectively. We conclude that: (a) many patients receiving third line chemotherapy maintain or improve indices of HRQL despite short survival and a low response rate: this might be due to chemotherapy, placebo effect, or a shift in frame of reference for HRQL; (b) patients were unwilling to trade quantity for quality of life; and (c) response rates and survival may be overestimated in patients selected for clinical trials.
