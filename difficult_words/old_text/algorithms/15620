Historically, increased mechanical stiffness during tissue palpation exams has been associated with assessing organ health as well as with detecting the growth of a potentially life-threatening cell mass. As such, techniques to image elasticity parameters (i.e., elastography) have recently become of great interest to scientists. In this work, a new method of elastography will be introduced within the context of mammographic imaging. The elastography method proposed represents a non-rigid iterative image registration algorithm that varies material properties within a finite element model to improve registration. More specifically, regional measures of image similarity are used within an objective function minimization framework to reconstruct elasticity images of tissue stiffness. Numerical simulations illustrate: (1) the encoding of stiffness information within the context of a regional image similarity criterion, (2) the methodology for an iterative elastographic imaging framework and (3) elasticity reconstruction simulations. The real strength in this approach is that images from any modality (e.g., magnetic resonance, computed tomography, ultrasound. etc) that have sufficient anatomically-based intensity heterogeneity and remain consistent from a pre- to a post-deformed state could be used in this paradigm.
