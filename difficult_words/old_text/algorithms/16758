The coupling between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) regulates various signal transductions from extracellular space into the cell. However, the coupling mechanism between GPCRs and G proteins is still unknown, and experimental determination of their coupling specificity and function is both expensive and time consuming. Therefore, it is significant to develop a theoretical method to predict the coupling specificity between GPCRs and G proteins as well as their function using their primary sequences. In this study, a novel four-layer predictor (GPCRsG_CWTIT) based on support vector machine (SVM), continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and information theory (IT) is developed to classify G proteins and predict the coupling specificity between GPCRs and G proteins. SVM is used for construction of models. CWT and IT are used to characterize the primary structure of protein. Performance of GPCRsG_CWTIT is evaluated with cross-validation test on various working dataset. The overall accuracy of the G proteins at the levels of class and family is 98.23 and 85.42%, respectively. The accuracy of the coupling specificity prediction varies from 74.60 to 94.30%. These results indicate that the proposed predictor is an effective and feasible tool to predict the coupling specificity between GPCRs and G proteins as well as their functions using only the protein full sequence. The establishment of such an accurate prediction method will facilitate drug discovery by improving the ability to identify and predict protein-protein interactions.
