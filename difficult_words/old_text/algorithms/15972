The spectral sensitivities of middle- (M-) and long- (L-) wavelength-sensitive cones have been measured in dichromats of known genotype: M-cone sensitivities in nine protanopes, and L-cone sensitivities in 20 deuteranopes. We have used these dichromat cone spectral sensitivities, along with new luminous efficiency determinations, and existing spectral sensitivity and color matching data from normal trichromats, to derive estimates of the human M- and L-cone spectral sensitivities for 2 and 10 degrees dia. central targets, and an estimate of the photopic luminosity function [V(lambda)] for 2 degrees dia. targets, which we refer to as V(2)*(lambda). These new estimates are consistent with dichromatic and trichromatic spectral sensitivities and color matches.
