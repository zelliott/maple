Numerous empirical studies identified fractal noise in human behavior.  According to the theory of Self Organized Criticality, long memory 1/f scaling  is a signature of stable and adaptive complex dynamical systems. This article  discusses the following aspects of fractality research: (a) generation of fractal  noise in simulation studies; (b) quality of some popular estimators of fractal  parameters; (c) measurement artifacts in cognitive performances. 36 time series  obtained in response tasks experiments under three different task conditions serve  as empirical basis.
