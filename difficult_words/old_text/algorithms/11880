In this paper a new algorithm is presented for the segmentation and display of blood vessels from images obtained with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and other three-dimensional (3D) angiographic imaging techniques. The algorithm developed is based on the observation that vessels are strongly evident in the maximum intensity projection (MIP) Z-buffer as regions of high continuity and low local roughness. Roughness is measured here by the minimum chi2 value of a low-order local least-squares fit in the principal directions through each point in the MIP Z-buffer. Although some background pixels in the Z-buffer exhibit low local roughness, the size of the connected region is nearly always much smaller than even the very smallest vessels that appear in the MIP image. It is shown that by applying connectivity to the regions of low roughness, there is nearly complete separation between vascular detail and background. When connectivity is further applied in the original 3D image, vascular bed segmentation becomes nearly complete. The algorithm consists of three basic steps: a) determination of the minimum local roughness at each point in the MIP Z-buffer; b) connection of all neighboring points of low local roughness; and c) connection of all points in the original 3D image matrix that are connected to the points determined in the MIP Z-buffer and that are above an intensity threshold. The algorithm as presented is not optimized but demonstrates a very strong potential for improved portrayal of vascular detail.
