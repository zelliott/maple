This paper develops a new neuroadaptive control architecture for nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems. The proposed framework involves a novel controller architecture involving additional terms in the update laws that are constructed using a moving time window of the integrated system uncertainty. These terms can be used to identify the ideal system weights of the neural network as well as effectively suppress and cancel system uncertainty without the need for persistency of excitation. A nonlinear parametrization of the system uncertainty is considered and state and output feedback neuroadaptive controllers are developed. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach we apply our results to a spacecraft model with unknown moment of inertia and compare our results with standard neuroadaptive control methods.
