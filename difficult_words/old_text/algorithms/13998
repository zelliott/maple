Chiral analysis is an important task of analytical chemistry. Besides separation techniques, mass spectrometry can be applied in this field. One mass spectrometric approach is based on Cooks' kinetic method. The method was successfully applied in a static system in which the concentration of the analyte as well as the chiral selector solution was constant during the experiment. The application of the kinetic method in dynamic systems (changing concentration of analyte) is presented. Such systems allow the speeding up of the analytical process (flow injection analysis (FIA)) or the use of the kinetic method for chiral detection after liquid chromatographic separation. The influence of the concentration of the components of the chiral selector solution as well as its flow rate on the recognition of enantiomers was evaluated. A new procedure for correction for the differences between ratio of enantiomers in the liquid phase and their observed ratio in the gas phase is also described. A significant improvement in accuracy using this procedure was achieved. Applicability of the method was demonstrated in the analysis of amino acids using FIA as well as HPLC/MS. After an achiral separation of leucine and isoleucine, chiral mass spectrometric detection was successfully used for enantiomeric recognition.
