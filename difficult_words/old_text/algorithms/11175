To assess the influence of different table feeds (TFs) on vascular enhancement and image quality in patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) undergoing computed tomography (CT) angiography of the lower extremities (run-off CTA).

Seventy-nine patients (71 ± 8 years) with an AAA (>30 mm) who underwent run-off CTA between January 2004 and August 2011 were included in this retrospective institutional review board-approved study. Run-off CTA was conducted using 16- and 64-row CT. The range of TFs was 30-86 mm/s and was categorised in quartiles TF1 (32.6 ± 1.9 mm/s), TF2 (38.9 ± 0.9 mm/s), TF3 (43.9 ± 3.1 mm/s) and TF4 (57.4 ± 10.5 mm/s). Image quality was rated independently by two radiologists and vessel enhancement was assessed.

Image quality was diagnostic at all aortic, pelvic and almost all thigh levels. Below the knee, the number of diagnostic levels was highest for TF1 and decreased to TF4. Arterial enhancement between the aorta and fibular trunk was not different in all TF groups, P > 0.05. At the calf and foot strongest arterial enhancement was noted for TF1 and TF2 and decreased to TF4, P < 0.01.

Results indicate that the highest image quality of run-off CTA in patients with an AAA may be obtained using table feeds measuring 30-35 mm/s.

• CTA has become a key investigation for peripheral vascular disease. • Run-off CTA is more complex in patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. • Run-off CTA is feasible with a short bolus of intravenous contrast medium. • A constant 30-35 mm/s table feed provides the highest likelihood of diagnostic images.
