This review is dedicated to a survey on molecular similarity and diversity. Key findings reported in recent investigations are selectively highlighted and summarized. Even if this overview is mainly centered in chemoinformatics, applications in other areas (pharmaceutical and medical chemistry, combinatorial chemistry, chemical databases management, etc.) are also introduced. The approaches used to define and describe the concepts of molecular similarity and diversity in the context of chemoinformatics are discussed in the first part of this review. We introduce, in the second and third parts, the descriptions and analyses of different methods and techniques. Finally, current applications and problems are enumerated and discussed in the last part.
