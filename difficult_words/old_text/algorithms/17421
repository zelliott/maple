In a recent paper we have estimated the total number of protein coding open reading frames (ORFs) in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, based on their properties, at about 4800. This number is much smaller than the 5800-6000 which is widely accepted. In this paper we analyse differences between the set of ORFs with known phenotypes annotated in the Munich Information Centre for Protein Sequences (MIPS) database and ORFs for which the probability of coding, counted by us, is very low. We have found that many of the latter ORFs have properties of antisense sequences of coding ORFs, which suggests that they could have been generated by duplication of coding sequences. Since coding sequences generate ORFs inside themselves, with especially high frequency in the antisense sequences, we have looked for homology between known proteins and hypothetical polypeptides generated by ORFs under consideration in all the six phases. For many ORFs we have found paralogues and orthologues in phases different than the phase which had been assumed in the MIPS database as coding.
