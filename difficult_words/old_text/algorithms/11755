The Minimal Model method of determining Insulin Sensitivity from the Intravenous glucose Tolerance Test is a valuable tool for the Diabetes research community. However the Minimal Model algorithm itself is not readily available in a user-friendly modem windows environment to the clinical researcher in many research departments. In addition use of the model often requires intervention by an experienced "modeller" to interpret the results produced by the method. This paper proposes a more readily available and usable version of the program and discusses the issues which surround the use of the program by clinical researchers without computer mathematical modelling experience.
