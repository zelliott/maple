Despite most children undergoing a successful pull through for Hirschsprung disease, a small portion of children are left with persistent stooling issues. Most of these stooling issues can be addressed by nonoperative approaches. However, in a small group of remaining children, a reoperation may be necessary. Most children who may need a redo pull-through procedure may have a persistent area of aganglionosis, unremitting enterocolitis, or a torsion or stricture of the pull-through segment. Each of these influences the approach the surgeon must take to correct the presenting problem. The chapter details the diagnostic approach as well as the operative techniques, which best deal with each of these complications.
