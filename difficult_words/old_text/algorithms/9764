The response of the vascular endothelium to wall shear stress plays a central role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Current studies have investigated endothelial response using idealized in vitro flow chambers. Such cell culture models are unable to accurately replicate the complex in vivo wall shear stress patterns arising from anatomical geometries. To better understand this implication, we have created both simplified/tubular and anatomically realistic in vitro endothelial flow models of the human right coronary artery. A post-mortem vascular cast of the human left ventricular outflow tract was used to create geometrically accurate silicone elastomer models. Straight, tubular models were created using a custom made mold. Following the culture of human abdominal aortic endothelial cells within the inner lumen, cells were exposed to steady flow (Re = 233) for varying time periods. The resulting cell morphology was analyzed in terms of shape index and angle of orientation relative to the flow direction. In both models a progressive elongation and alignment of the endothelium in the flow direction was observed following 8, 12, and 24 hours. This change, however, was significantly less pronounced in the anatomical model (as observed from morphological variations indicative of localized flow features). Differences were also observed between the inner and outer walls at the disease-prone proximal region. Since morphological adaptation is a visual indication of endothelial shear stress activation, the use of anatomical models in endothelial genetic and biochemical studies may offer better insight into the disease process.
