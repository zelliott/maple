This paper presents the properties of Pneumatic artificial muscles and its application in medical robots. The linear model construction and minimum predictive error control algorithm for artificial muscles are discussed here too. This paper provides the experimental results of linear adaptive control, which show the control algorithm has certain applicable value.
