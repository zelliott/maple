This paper proposes a novel cross-correlation neural network (CNN) model for finding the principal singular subspace of a cross-correlation matrix between two high-dimensional data streams. We introduce a novel nonquadratic criterion (NQC) for searching the optimum weights of two linear neural networks (LNN). The NQC exhibits a single global minimum attained if and only if the weight matrices of the left and right neural networks span the left and right principal singular subspace of a cross-correlation matrix, respectively. The other stationary points of the NQC are (unstable) saddle points. We develop an adaptive algorithm based on the NQC for tracking the principal singular subspace of a cross-correlation matrix between two high-dimensional vector sequences. The NQC algorithm provides a fast online learning of the optimum weights for two LNN. The global asymptotic stability of the NQC algorithm is analyzed. The NQC algorithm has several key advantages such as faster convergence, which is illustrated through simulations.
