Input parameters for the program are the arterial pH, pCO2, and pO2 (measured by a blood gas analyzer), oxygen saturation, carboxy-, met-, and total hemoglobin (measured by a multi-wavelength spectrometer), supplemented by patient age, sex, temperature, inspired oxygen fraction, fraction of fetal hemoglobin, and ambient pressure. Output parameters are the inspired and alveolar oxygen partial pressures, pH,pCO2 and pO2 referring to the actual patient temperature, estimated shunt fraction, half-saturation tension, estimated 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration, oxygen content and oxygen capacity, extracellular base excess, and plasma bicarbonate concentration. Three parameters related to the blood oxygen availability are calculated: the oxygen extraction tension, concentration of extractable oxygen, and oxygen compensation factor. Calculations of the 'reverse' type may also be performed so that the effect of therapeutic measures on the oxygen status or the acid-base status can be predicted. The user may choose among several different units of measurement and two different conventions for symbols. The results are presented in a data display screen comprising all quantities together with age, sex, and temperature adjusted reference values. The program generates a 'laboratory diagnosis' of the oxygen status and the acid-base status and three graphs illustrating the oxygen status and the acid-base status of the patient: the oxygen graph, the acid-base chart and the blood gas map. A printed summary in one A4 page including a graphical display can be produced with an Epson or HP Laser compatible printer. The program is primarily intended for routine laboratories with a blood gas analyzer combined with a multi-wavelength spectrometer. Calculating the derived quantities may enhance the usefulness of the analyzers and improve patient care. The program may also be used as a teaching aid in acid-base and respiratory physiology. The program requires an IBM PC, XT, AT or similar compatible computer running under DOS version 2.11 or later. A VGA color monitor is preferred, but the program also supports EGA, CGA, and Hercules monitors. The program will be freely available at the cost of a discette and mailing expenses by courtesy of Radiometer Medical A/S, Emdrupvej 72, DK-2400 Copenhagen NV, Denmark (valid through 1991). A simplified algorithm for a programmable pocket calculator avoiding iterative calculations is given as an Appendix.
