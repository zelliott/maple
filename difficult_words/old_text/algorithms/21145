Conductive implants are in most cases a strict contraindication for MRI examinations, as RF pulses applied during the MRI measurement can lead to severe heating of the surrounding tissue. Understanding and mapping of these heating effects is therefore crucial for determining the circumstances under which patient examinations are safe. The use of fluoroptic probes is the standard procedure for monitoring these heating effects. However, the observed temperature increase is highly dependent on the positioning of such a probe, as it can only determine the temperature locally. Temperature mapping with MRI after RF heating can be used, but cooling effects during imaging lead to a significant underestimation of the heating effect. In this work, an MRI thermometry method was combined with an MRI heating sequence, allowing for temperature mapping during RF heating. This technique may provide new opportunities for implant safety investigations.
