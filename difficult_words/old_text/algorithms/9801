This article presents the results of two Monte Carlo simulation studies of the recovery of weak factor loadings, in the context of confirmatory factor analysis, for models that do not exactly hold in the population. This issue has not been examined in previous research. Model error was introduced using a procedure that allows for specifying a covariance structure with a specified discrepancy in the population. The effects of sample size, estimation method (maximum likelihood vs. unweighted least squares), and factor correlation were also considered. The first simulation study examined recovery for models correctly specified with the known number of factors, and the second investigated recovery for models incorrectly specified by underfactoring. The results showed that recovery was not affected by model discrepancy for the correctly specified models but was affected for the incorrectly specified models. Recovery improved in both studies when factors were correlated, and unweighted least squares performed better than maximum likelihood in recovering the weak factor loadings.
