The gas-phase acidities of glycine and alanine were determined by using a variety of high level theoretical methods to establish which of these would give the best results with accessible computational efforts. MP2, MP4, QCISD, G2 ab initio procedures, hybrid Becke3-LYP (B3LYP) and gradient corrected Becke-Perdew (BP) and Perdew-Wang and Perdew (PWP) nonlocal density functionals were used for the calculations. A maximum deviation of approximately 13 and 18 kJ/mol from experimental data was observed for the computed delta Hacid and delta Gacid values, respectively. The best result was obtained at G2 level, but comparable reliability was reached when the considerably less time consuming B3LYP, BP, and PWP density functional approaches were employed.
