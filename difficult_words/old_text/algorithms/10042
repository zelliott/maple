Compartmentalization is one of the fundamental principles which underly nuclear function. Numerous studies describe complex and sometimes conflicting relationships between nuclear gene positioning and transcription regulation. Therefore the question is whether topological landmarks and/or organization principles exist to describe the nuclear architecture and, if existing, whether these principles are identical in the animal and plant kingdoms. In the frame of an agroBI-INRA program on nuclear architecture, we set up a multidisciplinary approach combining biological studies, spatial statistics and 3D modeling to investigate spatial organization of a nuclear compartment in both plant and animal cells in their physiological contexts. In this article, we review the questions addressed in this program and the methodology of our work.
