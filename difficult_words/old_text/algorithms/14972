Processing of visual stimuli by the retina changes strongly during light/dark adaptation. These changes are due to both local photoreceptor-based processes and to changes in the retinal network. The feedback pathway from horizontal cells to cones is known to be one of the pathways that is modulated strongly during adaptation. Although this phenomenon is well described, the mechanism for this change is poorly characterized. The aim of this paper is to describe the mechanism for the increase in efficiency of the feedback synapse from horizontal cells to cones. We show that a train of flashes can increase the feedback response from the horizontal cells, as measured in the cones, up to threefold. This process has a time constant of approximately 3 s and can be attributed to processes intrinsic to the cones. It does not require dopamine, is not the result of changes in the kinetics of the cone light response and is not due to changes in horizontal cells themselves. During a flash train, cones adapt to the mean light intensity, resulting in a slight (4 mV) depolarization of the cones. The time constant of this depolarization is approximately 3 s. We will show that at this depolarized membrane potential, a light-induced change of the cone membrane potential induces a larger change in the calcium current than in the unadapted condition. Furthermore, we will show that negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones can modulate the calcium current more efficiently at this depolarized cone membrane potential. The change in horizontal cell response properties during the train of flashes can be fully attributed to these changes in the synaptic efficiency. Since feedback has major consequences for the dynamic, spatial, and spectral processing, the described mechanism might be very important to optimize the retina for ambient light conditions.
