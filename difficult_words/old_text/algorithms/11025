The objective of this study was to investigate alveolar bone remodeling of the mandibular first molar with differing levels of periodontal attachment under mastication loading. Three-dimensional finite element models of the mandibular first molar with differing levels of periodontal attachment were established. The stress distributions and bone density changes were analyzed under mastication loading to simulate the remodeling process of mandibular bone based on the theory of strain energy density. The results showed that the alveolar buccal, lingual ridges and root apex areas experienced higher stresses. The stresses and densities of the alveolar bone increased proportionally to increased mastication loading. Decrease in alveolar bone density under extreme loading indicated bone resorption. The remodeling rate was continual with gradual loading. Periodontal ligament support marginally decreased with an increased remodeling rate under extreme loading. Changes in alveolar bone density can reflect the remodeling process of periodontal tissue under mastication loading. The relationship between the change in density and mastication loading during remodeling can provide useful indicators into clinical treatment and diagnosis of the periodontal disease.
