Whether an allosteric feedback or feedforward modifier actually has an effect on the steady-state properties of a metabolic pathway depends not only on the allosteric modifier effect itself, but also on the control properties of the affected allosteric enzyme in the pathway of which it is part. Different modification mechanisms are analysed: mixed inhibition, allosteric inhibition and activation of the reversible Monod-Wyman-Changeux and reversible Hill models. In conclusion, it is shown that, whereas a modifier effect on substrate and product binding (specific effects) can be an effective negative feedback mechanism, it is much less effective as a positive feedforward mechanism. The prediction is that catalytic effects that change the apparent limiting velocity would be more effective in feedforward activation.
