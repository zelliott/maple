Spike triggered averaging (STA) is a technique to extract an estimate of a recurring motor unit potential from a complex electromyographic (EMG) signal. In conventional STA (C-STA), potentials related to the discharges of single intramuscular motor units are isolated and used to trigger an averager to obtain an individual surface-detected motor unit potential (S-MUP) from an EMG signal. In decomposition-enhanced STA (DE-STA), EMG signal decomposition algorithms determine discharges of a number of different motor units (4 to 10) that can be used to trigger an averager to obtain their corresponding S-MUPs. We tested the accuracy of extracting and averaging S-MUPs using DE-STA compared to C-STA for the same EMG signals.

We compared the intramuscular potentials used for triggering and the resultant averaged S-MUPs that were common in both techniques.

We found no statistically significant differences in the metrics used to describe the triggering potentials and S-MUPs.

We conclude that DE-STA is an accurate and efficient method to obtain a large number of intramuscular motor unit potentials and their corresponding S-MUP in proximal and distal muscles.
