In this paper, we present a texture classification procedure that makes use of a blind deconvolution approach. Specifically, the texture is modeled as the output of a linear system driven by a binary excitation. We show that features computed from one-dimensional slices extracted from the two-dimensional autocorrelation function (ACF) of the binary excitation allows representing the texture for rotation-invariant classification purposes. The two-dimensional classification problem is thus reconduced to a more simple one-dimensional one, which leads to a significant reduction of the classification procedure computational complexity.
