Sorption of the cationic surfactant, hexadecyltrimethylammonium cations (HDTMA), on the solid/liquid interface of the natural mordenite tuff (MT) was studied. The examined tuff originated from Croatia consisting of 30% of mordenite. SEM observations confirmed the crystalline nature of mordenite which can be described in terms of aggregates of many small platelets with diameters in the range of 1 Î¼m. Studying the porosity properties of MT, it was found that the average pore diameter (4.42 nm) between mordenite's platelets allows penetration of HDTMA cations. The measurements of zeta potential indicated that in MT samples with surfactant concentration in the range between 0.013 and 0.25 mmol/g, HDTMA cations fill the mesopores of MT. By further increase in HDTMA concentration, the surfactant sorbs on the external zeolite surface, as revealed by the SEM micrographs. Vibrational (FTIR and FT Raman) spectra showed that in the MT samples with initial HDTMA concentration from 0.013 to 0.25 mmol/g, alkyl chains adopt mainly gauche conformation, whereas in the MT samples with higher initial HDTMA concentrations trans conformers are predominant and form a highly ordered structure on the mordenite surface.
