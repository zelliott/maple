The aim of this work was to measure the disintegrating force concomitantly with tablet disintegration, in order to evaluate the disintegration propensity of tablets. Disintegration and dissolution were measured on tablets containing two poorly soluble drugs (diclofenac sodium or ketoprofen), including different percentages of two disintegrants (Explotab or Ac-Di-Sol). Because of the experimental setup, the disintegrating force measured was the result of the force generated by disintegrant swelling and dissipated by tablet disintegration. The disintegrating force versus time curves had shapes ranging from a skewed distribution curve to a bell-shaped curve, depending on slow or rapid disintegration of tablets, respectively. Interestingly, the shape of the resulting curves was very sensitive to the composition of the tablet. When the disintegrant in the formula was increased, the force-time curve approached the bell-like shape. The disintegration propensity of the tablet can be evaluated by the disintegrating force development during disintegration. The disintegration improvement of the formula can be predicted. The disintegrating force curve allows for the clear identification of the optimal percentage of disintegrant to be used.
