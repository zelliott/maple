Despite their topological complexity almost all functional properties of metabolic networks can be derived from steady-state dynamics. Indeed, many theoretical investigations (like flux-balance analysis) rely on extracting function from steady states. This leads to the interesting question as to how metabolic networks avoid complex dynamics and maintain a steady-state behavior. Here, we expose metabolic network topologies to binary dynamics generated by simple local rules. We find that the networks' response is highly specific: Complex dynamics are systematically reduced on metabolic networks compared to randomized networks with identical degree sequences. Already small topological modifications substantially enhance the capacity of a network to host complex dynamic behavior and thus reduce its regularizing potential. This exceptionally pronounced regularization of dynamics encoded in the topology may explain why steady-state behavior is ubiquitous in metabolism.
