A recently introduced graph-theoretical approach to the study of structure-property-activity relationships is presented. The theoretical approach and the computational strategy for the use of the TOSS-MODE approach are given with details. Several QSPR and QSAR applications are reviewed including the study of physical properties of organic compounds, diamagnetic susceptibilities, and biological properties. The applications of the TOSS-MODE approach to discrimination of active/inactive compounds, the virtual screening of compounds with a desired property from databases of chemical structures, identification of active/inactive fragments and its relationships with 2D/3D pharmacophores, and to the design of novel compounds with desired biological activities are also reviewed.
