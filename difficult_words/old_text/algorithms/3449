Data from the Child Research Council (Denver, CO) were analyzed to model longitudinal growth changes in the humerus, radius, femur, and tibia in 31 boys and 36 girls between 3 and 10 years of age. Multilevel modeling of growth changes allowed efficient estimates of bone size and bone growth variation to be obtained as well as comparisons of growth patterns within and between limbs. The long bones displayed decelerating growth through time, with greater velocities for the larger lower limb (vs. smaller upper limb) bones and the larger proximal (vs. smaller distal) elements within limbs. Coordination for bone size and growth velocity is good both within and between limbs, suggesting a common growth control mechanism that should make growth prediction possible. Adjusted for size, the tibia appears to be the most variable of these four long bones, which may be due to a combination of environmental effects and flexible growth potential.
