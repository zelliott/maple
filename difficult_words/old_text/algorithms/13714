Jaundice is a common feature in full-term and premature newborns. Considering this high incidence it is important to distinguish physiologic and non-physiologic jaundice. This differentiation is complicated by the presence of a large overlap between ranges of normal and pathologic bilirubin levels in serum. A combination of criteria is proposed on the basis of which on one hand the risk of missing any pathology will be minimal and on the other hand a too extensive diagnostic work-up in patients with a physiologic jaundice is prevented. A systemic approach to neonatal jaundice is described.
