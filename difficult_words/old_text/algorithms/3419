pH control and inclusion complex formation are commonly used as solubilization techniques in formulating ionizable drugs. Naringenin is a weakly acid compound with a low water solubility. The role of both ionized and unionized species of naringenin in solution by complexation with beta-cyclodextrin, 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin was investigated. This combined use of ionization and complexation increases not only the solubility of the unionized naringenin, but also that of the ionized one. This study puts on evidence the role of pH, pKa and complexation constants in increasing drug total aqueous solubility, determined by the single components in solution, as ionized and unionized naringenin both in free and complexed forms. Moreover, the presence of non-ionic surfactants in the media of complexation gives a positive contribution to the improvement of the solubility of naringenin, alone or in combination with beta-cyclodextrin.
