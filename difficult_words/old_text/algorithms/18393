The paper contains the results of examinations of hemodynamics of the eye and brain in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) obtained by the authors also by means of rheoophthalmography made to determine the functional status of intraocular vessels. New methods are suggested for diagnostic interpretation, which enhance the importance of rheography in examinations of hemodynamics of the eye and brain in patients with glaucoma. The authors used self-learning artificial neuron networks to process Fourie- and wavelet factors, obtained in novel rheoophthalmograms processing, which made it possible to recommend the described method for an early diagnosis of POAG.
