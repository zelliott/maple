Technical innovations in multislice computed tomography (CT) allow for larger volume coverage in ever shorter scan times. This progress has stimulated the clinical application of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) CT techniques, which offer the possibility to noninvasively characterize tissue microcirculation in terms of well-defined physiological quantities. This educational review imparts to radiologists the essential physiological terms and definitions as well as the basic tracer kinetic concepts required for the analysis of DCE-CT data. In particular, four different approaches are presented and exemplified by the analysis of representative DCE data: the steepest-gradient method, model-free algebraic deconvolution in combination with the indicator-dilution theory, two-compartment modelling and the so-called adiabatic approximation to the homogeneity model. Even though DCE-CT offers substantial methodological and practical advantages as compared to DCE-MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), there are also two serious and interconnected shortcomings: the low contrast enhancement in relation to the noise level and the high exposure of patients to ionizing radiation. These limiting aspects are considered in detail from a radiation hygienic point of view, emphasizing the basic principles of justification and optimization. Clinically established as well as potential future applications of DCE-CT will be presented in a subsequent paper.
