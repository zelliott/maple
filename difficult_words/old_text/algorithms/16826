In this research, a hybrid model is developed by integrating a case-based reasoning approach and a particle swarm optimization model for medical data classification. Two data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository, i.e., Liver Disorders Data Set and Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnosis), are employed for benchmark test. Initially a case-based reasoning method is applied to preprocess the data set thus a weight vector for each feature is derived. A particle swarm optimization model is then applied to construct a decision-making system for diseases identified. The PSO algorithm starts by partitioning the data set into a relatively large number of clusters to reduce the effects of initial conditions and then reducing the number of clusters into two. The average forecasting accuracy for breast cancer of CBRPSO model is 97.4% and for liver disorders is 76.8%. The proposed case-based particle swarm optimization model is able to produce more accurate and comprehensible results for medical experts in medical diagnosis.
