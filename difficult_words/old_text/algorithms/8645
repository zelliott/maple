To improve reconstructive 3D electron microscopy novel methods are discussed to represent and process serial section images in a cuberille environment. This includes the analysis of the transfer characteristics of the image detection system, the use of laser-induced fiducials for deformation correction and alignment, the control of section thickness by EELS and the use of ESI to image thick sections.
