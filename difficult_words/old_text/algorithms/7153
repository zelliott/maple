Prior research indicated that occult blood screening can be used to detect early gastric cancer. Based on capsule endoscopy and occult blood detection theory, an automatic detection capsule system for gastric occult blood (GOB) was proposed. This paper designed the detecting sensor, image acquisition system and wireless transmitter module respectively based on collaurum immune theory, the image sensor and radio frequency chip. In vitro experiments were conducted to testify the system, and the detecting result image information was acquired by the image acquisition (IMAQ) system and transmitted to the outside of the body through the wireless transmitter module. The receiver module received and displayed the information on the computer, from which doctors could diagnose whether there was occult blood (OB) or not. Therefore, this paper provides a new idea for the screening of early-stage gastric cancer with reliability and simplicity.
