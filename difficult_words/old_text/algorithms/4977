Over the last few decades, advancements in ultrasound, electronic and computing technologies have permitted current second generation 3-dimensional (3D) echocardiography to display on-line 3D rendered images of the heart. Since various studies demonstrated its superiority over 2-dimensional echocardiography, there is growing enthusiasm to embrace this new 3D echocardiographic technology. With its increasing widespread clinical availability, 3D echocardiography is getting closer to routine clinical use. However, as with any new emerging technologies, clinical applications of 3D echocardiography should be based on current evidence. This review will focus on the evidence from clinical studies that form the scientific basis for the advanced applications of 3D echocardiography, from cardiac chamber volume assessments, left ventricular dyssynchrony assessments, quantifications of valvular abnormalities, to the role of 3D echocardiography during cardiac interventions.
