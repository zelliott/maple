The entropy method for stacking a series of angiographic images is presented and compared with the maximum opacity method, which is already established. The entropy method comprises calculation of the entropy of the time course for each image pixel. This accentuates image areas where a contrast agent bolus is passing. Quantitative analysis of the contrast-to-noise ratio and qualitative analysis of 11 cases were performed, the latter by eight independent viewers. Results indicate that the entropy images show more vascular detail in small peripheral vessels and increased contrast-to-noise ratio by up to a factor of 1.97 compared with maximum opacity images.
