Functional and topographical differences between two groups, artists and non-artists, during the performances of visual perception and imagery of paintings were presented by means of EEG phase synchrony analysis. In artists as compared with non-artists, significantly higher phase synchrony was found in the high frequency beta and gamma bands during the perception of the paintings; in the low frequency bands (primarily delta), phase synchrony was mostly enhanced during imagery. Strong decreases in phase synchrony of alpha were found primarily in artists for both tasks. The right hemisphere was found to present higher synchrony than the left in artists, whereas hemispheric asymmetry was less significant in non-artists. In the artists, enhanced synchrony in the high frequency band is most likely due to their enhanced binding capabilities of numerous visual attributes, and enhanced synchrony in the low frequency band seems to be due to the higher involvement of long-term visual memory mostly in imagery. Thus, the analysis of phase synchrony from EEG signals yields new information about the dynamical co-operation between neuronal assemblies during the cognition of visual art.
