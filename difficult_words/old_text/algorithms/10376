Computer-based chemogenomics approaches compare macromolecular drug targets based on their amino acid sequences or derived properties, by similarity of their ligands, or according to ligand-target interaction models. Here we present ARTS (Assay Related Target Similarity) as a quantitative index that estimates target similarity directly from measured affinities of a set of probe compounds. This approach reduces the risk of deducing artificial target relationships from mutually inactive compounds. ARTS implements a scoring scheme that matches intertarget similarity based on dose-response measurements. While all experimentally derived target similarities have a tendency to be data set-dependent, we demonstrate that ARTS depends less on the used data set than the commonly used Pearson correlation or Tanimoto index.
