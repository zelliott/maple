The purpose of this article is to introduce the underlying challenges associated with the incorporation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into the new hybrid imaging modality simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET)/MR and their impact on attenuation correction, sequence optimization, and protocol development. Many adjustments to MR sequences are necessary for optimal whole-body and fused image results.
