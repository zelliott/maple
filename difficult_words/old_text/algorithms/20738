We report our experience with 14 consecutive cases of frontal basilar trauma occurring in children and adolescents aged 18 months to 18 years (mean 9.5 years). Brain parenchymal injury resulting in functional deficit occurred in 5 patients (36 percent), 2 patients suffered bilateral blindness, and 1 suffered unilateral loss of vision. A classification system and treatment algorithm based on the clinical fracture pattern seen by computed tomography are introduced. Type I, central, is confined to the upper nasoethmoidal complex, central frontal bone, and medial third of the superior orbital rims. Type II, unilateral, involves the entire supraorbital rim and the upper lateral orbital wall, extending into the squamosa of the temporal bone and ipsilateral frontal bone. Type III, bilateral, involves fractures of the upper nasal ethmoidal complex, bilateral supraorbital and upper lateral orbital wall fractures, and bilateral frontal bone fractures. This classification was utilized to plan elective orbital and cranial osteotomies, similar to those used for frontal orbital advancement at the time of acute fracture repair. Frontal orbital osteotomies were used to access the anterior cranial fossa, orbital apices, and nasofrontal ducts and to obtain an intact bony template for side-table reassembly of the fracture fragments. There was no significant operative morbidity, one late cerebrospinal fluid leak, and no infections. Reoperation was necessary in four patients (29 percent) for aesthetic indications.
