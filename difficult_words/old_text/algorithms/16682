Acute refractory cardiogenic shock with early multisystem organ failure has a poor outcome without mechanical circulatory support. We review our experience with emergent peripheral cardiopulmonary support as a bridge to decision in these patients.

A retrospective review from January 2009 through December 2010 was conducted of 26 consecutive adult patients at a single institution with acute refractory cardiogenic shock who underwent salvage peripheral cardiopulmonary support.

There were 18 men and 8 women with a mean age of 54 years (range 18 to 76). Indications for support: acute myocardial infarction (n = 16), decompensated chronic heart failure (n = 2), refractory arrhythmic arrest (n = 3), acute valvular pathology (n = 4), and unknown (n = 1). Patients with primary postcardiotomy shock were excluded. Median duration of support was 3 days (range 1 to 14). Decisions included: withdraw of support (n = 4), recovery (n = 5), and bridge to a procedure (n = 17). The procedures were percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 4), left ventricular assist device (n = 9), heart transplantation (n = 1), and miscellaneous cardiac surgery (n = 3). Overall survival to discharge was 65%. In the recovery and bridge to a procedure group, 78% were discharged from the hospital and survival at three months was 72%.

Salvage peripheral cardiopulmonary support is a useful tool to rapidly stabilize acute refractory cardiogenic shock permitting an assessment of neurologic and end-organ viability.
