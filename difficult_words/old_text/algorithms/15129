Pulmonary disease has become one of the major health problems.

To investigate the regulation mechanism of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) on gene expression and pathway level.

We mapped the differentially expressed genes to a regulation network and pathways, using transcriptome profiles and regulation data. We constructed a TF-target gene regulation network, TF-pathway regulation network, and pathway crosstalk network.

STAT1, NFKB1, SMAD4, and STAT3 played an important role in COPD through participating in a number of pathways. Although these related pathways all have been demonstrated associated with COPD in previous reports, the detail mechanism may be not very clear.

Our results may help to further understanding the mechanism of COPD. And Identified multiple pathways will also provide novel avenues in the treatment of COPD.
