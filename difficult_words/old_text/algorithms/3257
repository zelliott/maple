The present paper addresses the following question can a simple regulatory bone remodeling model predict effects of viscosity on the trabecular morphology? For that, we propose an extension of a previous bone remodeling model by taking into account the viscosity properties of the tissue. Zener's law is used to describe the mechanical behavior of the bone and a specific law of the apparent bone density rate is proposed. Based on stability analysis, numerical simulations are then performed to investigate the viscosity role on simulations of the bone remodeling process. We show that the viscous contribution affects the evolution of the apparent bone density, by slowing down the adaptation process, which seems to be confirmed by simulations with real data obtained from rat tibia.
