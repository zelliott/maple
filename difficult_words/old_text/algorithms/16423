Error processing in subjects performing actions has been associated with the Event-Related Potential (ERP) components called Error-Related Negativity (ERN) and Error Positivity (Pe). In this paper, features based on statistical measures of the sample of averaged ERP recordings are used for classifying correct from incorrect actions. Three feature selection techniques were used and compared. Classification was done by means of a kNN and a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. The use of a leave-one-out approach in the feature selection provided sensitivity and specificity values concurrently higher than or equal to 87.5%, for both classifiers. The classification results were significantly better for the time window that included only the ERN, as compared to time windows including also Pe.
