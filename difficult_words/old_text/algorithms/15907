We developed a systematic approach to assess the presence, severity, and management of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in patients treated with antipsychotics. Patients were evaluated by the Modified Simpson-Angus scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, and Dyskinesia Identification System: Condensed User Scale. We completed 235 sets of evaluations in 83 patients. A pharmaceutical intervention was proposed in 54% (130) of evaluations, of which 82% (107) were accepted and followed. In 93% (99) evaluations in which a recommendation was followed, clinical outcome was positive. The most common intervention was reducing the dosage or discontinuing the antidyskinetic agent, most often an anticholinergic (55% of cases). Our results show that detailed monitoring of EPS in a clinical pharmacist-operated clinic promotes rational drug therapy, limits unnecessary drugs, and improves clinical outcome of patients with EPS.
