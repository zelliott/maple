One of my patients suffers from a moderate-to-severe form of morning sickness. She responded only partially to doxylamine and pyridoxine (Dicletin), and I wish to try adding another medication. What should my priority be?

An algorithm used by Motherisk to manage thousands of patients takes a hierarchical approach to this condition. This approach is evidence based with regard to fetal safety as well as efficacy.
