We apply the continuous delayed feedback method of Pyragas to control chaos in the enzymatic Peroxidase-Oxidase (PO) reaction, using the electric current as the control parameter. At each data point in the time series, a time delayed feedback function applies a small amplitude perturbation to inert platinum electrodes, which causes redox processes on the surface of the electrodes. These perturbations are calculated as the difference between the previous (time delayed) signal and the actual signal. Unstable periodic P1, 1(1), and 1(2) orbits (UPOs) were stabilized in the CSTR (continuous stirred tank reactor) experiments. The stabilization is demonstrated by at least three conditions: A minimum in the experimental dispersion function, the equality of the delay time with the period of the stabilized attractor and the embedment of the stabilized periodic attractor in the chaotic attractor.
