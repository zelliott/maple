To evaluate the clinical and etiological factors of osteoporosis. We also tested the FRAX algorithm to compare the assessment of fracture risk in patients with primary or secondary osteoporosis.

A prospective study carried out in a large sample of 123 men and 246 women. All subjects had a biochemical, densitometric, and radiological examination of thoracic and lumbar spine.

The prevalence of primary (men 52.9% vs women 50%; p = nonsignificant) and secondary (men 21.1% vs women 17.5%; p = nonsignificant) osteoporosis did not differ between the sexes. In contrast, the prevalence of primary osteoporosis was significantly higher than secondary causes (p < 0.0001) in both men and women. While women came to our attention for prevention of osteoporosis, men sought help because of clinical symptoms or disease-related complications, such as fractures. As evaluated by the FRAX tool, patients with osteopenia do not need treatment, in agreement with Italian guidelines. The estimated risk of major osteoporotic and hip fractures was significantly higher in women with secondary osteoporosis compared to men and also compared to women with primary osteoporosis.

The prevalence of secondary osteoporosis in men is similar to that in women and it is less frequent than commonly reported. In patients with secondary osteoporosis, FRAX calculation may provide an estimate of a particularly high fracture risk in patients whose bone fragility is usually attributed to another disease.
