A very simple strategy is proposed to extract carbon multiplicity information along with the classic knowledge of carbon-carbon connectivities in ADEQUATE experiments without affecting the sensitivity ratios of the original pulse schemes. These new multiplicity-edited ADEQUATE experiments prove to be highly helpful for complete 1H and 13C resonance assignment and also for automated and easy spin system characterization of samples at natural abundance, using a single NMR experiment.
