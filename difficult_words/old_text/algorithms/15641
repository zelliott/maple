Parameters for the zinc ion have been developed in the self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) framework. The approach was tested against B3LYP calculations for a range of systems, including small molecules that contain the typical coordination environment of zinc in biological systems (cysteine, histidine, glutamic/aspartic acids, and water) and active site models for a number of enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase, and aminopeptidase. The SCC-DFTB approach reproduces structural and energetic properties rather reliably (e.g., total and relative ligand binding energies and deprotonation energies of ligands and barriers for zinc-assisted proton transfers), as compared with B3LYP/6-311+G** or MP2/6-311+G** calculations.
