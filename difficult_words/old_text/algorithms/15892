Ceramic hydroxyapatites and non-ceramic hydroxyapatites have been used extensively as alloplastic materials for bone reconstruction. However, different forms of hydroxyapatite induce different types of tissue response.

Human gingival fibroblasts (FMM1 cells) were used to analyze ceramic and non-ceramic hydroxyapatite biocompatibility. The cells were grown on surfaces covered either by collagen (control group), collagen plus ceramic hydroxyapatite, or collagen plus non-ceramic hydroxyapatite. Scanning electron microscopy, growth and cell viability curves, and procollagen immunoprecipitation were obtained. For the growth and viability curves, 10(4) cells were seeded on 60 mm dishes. Cells from each group were counted, in triplicate, at 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days after seeding using the Trypan blue dye exclusion assay.

The cells grew in close contact with both types of hydroxyapatite particles. No differences were found in the amount of procollagen synthesis among any experimental group. The cultures treated with ceramic hydroxyapatite had a growth delay for the first 5 days. There was no difference in cell viability between the control group and the non-ceramic hydroxyapatite group. However, cultures treated with ceramic hydroxyapatite showed significantly lower viability percentages than the other groups.

Hydroxyapatite supports cell growth and fibroblast metabolism including collagen production, and hence is biocompatible. Cell viability and structural studies showed that non-ceramic hydroxyapatite has relevant physical and biological properties as an implant material.
