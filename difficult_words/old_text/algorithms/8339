In 75 men with uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction early symptom-limited submaximum bicycle ergometric test was performed 24-48 hours before discharge from hospital. 32 patients (42.7%) showed a positive test (ST-depression greater than 0.1 mV with duration of greater than or equal to 0.08 s and/or angina pectoris). The prognosis assessed by the number of cases with unstable angina pectoris, recurrent myocardial infarction or sudden death in the patients with positive test is significantly worse (p less than 0.0001). The patients with positive early bicycle ergometric test are indicated for direct examination and are potential candidates for aortocoronary bypass or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. An algorithm for attitude toward patients with uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction is presented.
