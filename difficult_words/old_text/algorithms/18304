Permutation entropy (PE) was recently introduced as a very fast and robust algorithm to detect dynamic complexity changes in time series. It was also suggested as a useful screening algorithm for epileptic events in EEG data. In the present work, we tested its efficacy on scalp EEG data recorded from three epileptic patients. With a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, we evaluated the separability of amplitude distributions of PE resulting from preictal and interictal phases. Moreover, the dependency of PE on vigilance state was tested by correlation coefficients. A good separability of interictal and preictal phase was found, nevertheless PE was shown to be sensitive to changes in vigilance state. The changes of PE during the preictal phase and at seizure onset coincided with changes in vigilance state, restricting its possible use for seizure prediction on scalp EEG; this finding however suggests its possible usefulness for an automated classification of vigilance states.
