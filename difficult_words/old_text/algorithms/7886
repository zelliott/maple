Under molecular crowding conditions, biopolymers have been reported to subdiffuse, (r(2)(t)) approximately = t(alpha), with 0 <alpha < 1. Here we study the exchange dynamics of such a subdiffusing particle with a reactive boundary using a continuous time random walk approach. We derive the generalized boundary condition and consider the unbinding from the boundary. An ensuing weak ergodicity breaking has profound consequences for material exchange between the boundary and bulk. We discuss the effects in biological contexts such as gene regulation or membrane-bulk exchange processes. We also suggest various methods to experimentally probe the subdiffusive behavior.
