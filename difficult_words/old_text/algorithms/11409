Decomposition methods have been applied to in-plane Mueller matrix ellipsometric scattering data of the Spectralon reflectance standard. Data were measured at the wavelengths 532 nm and 1500 nm, using an achromatic optimal Mueller matrix scatterometer applying a photomultiplier tube and a high gain InGaAs detector for the two wavelengths. A parametric model with physical significance was deduced through analysis of the product decomposed matrices. It is found that when the data are analyzed as a function of the scattering angle, similar to particle scattering, the matrix elements are largely independent of incidence angle. To the first order, we propose that a Guassian lineshape is appropriate to describe the polarization index, while the decomposed diagonal elements of the retardance matrix have a form resembling Rayleigh single scattering. New models are proposed for the off diagonal elements of the measured Mueller matrix.
