Fractional renal accumulation of a radiotracer is often used to measure renal function with camera-based methods. We evaluated the effect of deadtime count loss on the calculation of fractional renal accumulation of 99Tcm-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99Tcm-MAG3). In 15 patients, dynamic renal scintigraphy was performed after the injection of 250 MBq of 99Tcm-MAG3. A reference source was placed on the periphery of the field of view of the gamma camera to monitor the loss of counts in dynamic imaging. The activity in the syringe was also counted with the camera to measure the injected dose, and the deadtime count loss in the syringe was computed from the observed count rate and deadtime in imaging a point source. Fractional renal accumulation, the ratio of renal accumulation on dynamic imaging to the injected dose, was assessed with and without correction for deadtime loss. Fractional renal accumulation was over-estimated by 4.1% with no deadtime correction, when the value after correction for loss in both syringe counts and dynamic imaging was used as a standard. It was underestimated by 4.0% with correction for syringe counts only. The results suggest that correction for count loss only in measuring the injected dose does not lead to a significant improvement in the accuracy of estimating renal function with camera-based methods.
