Multiobjective optimization is used in radiotherapy, especially IMRT, to generate treatment plans which meet different objectives to varying extents. Trade-off surfaces can be constructed representing the gains and losses of different objectives when switching from one plan to another, and the planner can interactively explore different treatment possibilities without the need for reoptimization. In this work a method for the multiobjective optimization of rotational therapy is introduced. The proposed method is applied slice per slice and uses the geometry of the slice directly to construct several arcs, each conformally irradiating the tumor and blocking a number (0,1,2,...) of different organs at risk present in the treatment. The blocked arc dose distributions so obtained are quite inhomogeneous in the target. An algorithm, based on the iterative reconstruction of images from projections, has been developed to compensate for this inhomogeneity, leading to compensated blocked arcs which deliver more uniform target doses but still block critical structures. Different treatments can be obtained as linear combinations of these arcs, each involving different trade-offs among the objectives involved. The compensatory algorithm substantially improves the target dose uniformity of blocked arcs at the cost of slightly increasing the dose to the rest of the body, allowing delivery of good uniform dose distributions to the target without significantly irradiating the blocked organ(s). Trade-off surfaces are presented for slices containing a target and one or two critical structures. The method is directly implementable using axial or helical tomotherapy. Implementation for conventional linear accelerators will be more difficult because the number of arcs needed to deliver such treatments can be large, an issue to be explored in future work.
