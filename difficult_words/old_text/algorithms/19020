The aim of this paper is to investigate the acoustic performance of sound absorbing materials through a numerical wave based prediction technique. The final goal of this work is to get insight into the acoustic behavior of a combination of sound absorbing patches. In order to address a wide frequency range, a model based on the Trefftz approach is adopted. In this approach, the dynamic field variables are expressed in terms of global wave function expansions that satisfy the governing dynamic equations exactly. Therefore, approximation errors are associated only with the boundary conditions of the considered problem. This results in a computationally efficient technique. The main advantage of this method is the fact that the sound absorbing patches do not have to be locally reacting. In this article, the wave based method is described and experimentally validated for the case of normal incidence sound absorption identification in a standing wave tube. Afterwards, the method is applied to simulate some interesting setups of absorbing materials.
