Tetrapods are among the most promising building blocks for nanoscale self-assembly, offering various desirable features. Whereas these particles can be fabricated with remarkable precision, comparatively less is known about their aggregation behavior. Employing a novel, powerful simulation method, we demonstrate that charged nanoparticles offer considerable control over the assembly of tip-functionalized tetrapods. Extending these findings to tetrapods confined to a gas/liquid interface, we show that regular structures can be achieved even without functionalization.
