A 13C-detected N-H dipolar coupling technique is introduced for uniaxially mobile membrane proteins for orientation determination using unoriented samples. For proteins undergoing rigid-body uniaxial rotation in the lipid bilayer, the intrinsic equality between the dipolar coupling constants measured in unoriented samples and the anisotropic coupling measured in static oriented samples has been shown recently. Here, we demonstrate that the orientation-sensitive backbone N-H dipolar couplings can be measured with 13C detection using 2D and 3D MAS correlation experiments, so that maximal site resolution can be achieved and multiple orientational constraints can be extracted from each experiment. We demonstrate this technique on the M2 transmembrane peptide of the influenza A virus, where the N-H dipolar couplings of various residues fit to a dipolar wave for a helical tilt angle of 37 degrees , in excellent agreement with data obtained from singly 15N-labeled samples.
