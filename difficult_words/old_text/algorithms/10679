Advances in molecular virology and availability of new antiviral agents have made a positive impact on the treatment of hepatitis B. It is important to know the natural history of hepatitis B virus as high amount of virus may remain in the body for long periods of time without any significant liver disease. Whilst reactivation or mutation of hepatitis B virus and immune clearance may be associated with liver injury leading at times to liver failure. Serological and virological tests are routinely available to systematically evaluate a patient who is detected to have Hepatitis B virus infection. International guidelines have been formulated to suggest appropriate selection of the patient and drug for effective treatment. Therapeutic strategies for total eradication of hepatitis B virus from the liver still remain elusive. However it is now possible to ameliorate liver disease and alter the natural history with effective long-term suppression of the hepatitis B virus. New formulations of existing drugs and newer antiviral agents are constantly being looked into in clinical trials in the pursuit of an ideal therapy.
