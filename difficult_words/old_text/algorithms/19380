In this paper, we propose self-organization algorithm of spiking neural network (SNN) applicable to autonomous robot for generation of adoptive and goal-directed behavior. First, we formulated a SNN model whose inputs and outputs were analog and the hidden unites are interconnected each other. Next, we implemented it into a miniature mobile robot Khepera. In order to see whether or not a solution(s) for the given task(s) exists with the SNN, the robot was evolved with the genetic algorithm in the environment. The robot acquired the obstacle avoidance and navigation task successfully, exhibiting the presence of the solution. After that, a self-organization algorithm based on a use-dependent synaptic potentiation and depotentiation at synapses of input layer to hidden layer and of hidden layer to output layer was formulated and implemented into the robot. In the environment, the robot incrementally organized the network and the given tasks were successfully performed. The time needed to acquire the desired adoptive and goal-directed behavior using the proposed self-organization method was much less than that with the genetic evolution, approximately one fifth.
