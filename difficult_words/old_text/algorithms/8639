The role of information systems and particularly that of expert systems in medicine is analysed in brief. It is pointed out that, unlike other branches of medicine, in mental sciences the role of expert systems has so far been more limited because of certain intrinsic problems of programming on the one hand, and the scientific models of the psychiatrist on the other. An improvement in information technology and programming languages and better empirical classification of mental disturbances could provide useful bases for the realisation of computerised consultancy systems in mental sciences.
