The number of fungal infections is increasing, particularly in patients with cancer, and represent a major problem given the relatively poor response rates, especially for aspergillosis, and the high cost. Empirical therapy has become an accepted practice as delay in instituting therapy is clearly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In terms of efficacy for the management of persistent febrile neutropenic patients, there is no convincing evidence that conventional amphotericin B (ampho B) is inferior to any other agent; the lipid formulations of ampho B provide similar efficacy with lower toxicity but at a much higher cost. Fluconazole is equivalent to ampho B, provided patients at high risk of aspergillus infections are excluded. Itraconazole and voriconazole, as empirical therapies, are equivalent to conventional ampho B and liposomal ampho B, respectively; toxicity is definitely lower and voriconazole is more effective at preventing breakthrough fungal infections.
