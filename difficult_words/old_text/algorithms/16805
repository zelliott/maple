The structure and distribution of the sources underlying the generation of evoked potentials (EPs) is often very complex. In an effort to improve localization accuracy of the auditory N100 (negative response occurring around 100ms poststimulus) component, we analyzed 13 datasets of single-trial EPs obtained from normal subjects using an iterative independent component analysis procedure which allowed us to detect a clear N100 component in each single trial and to study gross changes in component morphology across trials. We found that single-trial N100 amplitude was most often negative in polarity, as expected, but occasionally exhibited a marked reversal to become positive. The average N100, however, showed the typical negative polarity, in all subjects. Based on this observation, we separated the processed single trials in two groups of typical and aberrant responses, and from each group, we computed a partial EP that was used to localize the underlying intracranial sources. Additionally, we localized the classical ensemble average EP. Before processing, the N100 sources were identified correctly in the primary auditory cortex in only four datasets, while after processing, all 13 datasets yielded correct localizations, and the confidence volume of the sources improved by about 80%. Further analysis demonstrated that in nine datasets the improvement was mostly due to the typical responses, while the aberrant responses had an antagonistic effect. Our results suggest that aberrant responses should not be included in source localizations, especially when EEG-based brain mapping is intended as a clinical tool.
