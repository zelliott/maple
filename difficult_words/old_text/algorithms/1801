In this paper, we improve the first step in the arrival time algorithm used for shear wave speed recovery in transient elastography. In transient elastography, a shear wave is initiated at the boundary and the interior displacement of the propagating shear wave is imaged with an ultrasound ultra-fast imaging system. The first step in the arrival time algorithm finds the arrival times of the shear wave by cross correlating displacement time traces (the time history of the displacement at a single point) with a reference time trace located near the shear wave source. The second step finds the shear wave speed from the arrival times. In performing the first step, we observe that the wave pulse decorrelates as it travels through the medium, which leads to inaccurate estimates of the arrival times and ultimately to blurring and artifacts in the shear wave speed image. In particular, wave 'spreading' accounts for much of this decorrelation. Here we remove most of the decorrelation by allowing the reference wave pulse to spread during the cross correlation. This dramatically improves the images obtained from arrival time identification. We illustrate the improvement of this method on phantom and in vivo data obtained from the laboratory of Mathias Fink at ESPCI, Paris.
