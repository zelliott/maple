This review is made up of two parts. The first section describes techniques and methods used in the treatment of malignant brain tumors, stressing the most recent developments. The second part reviews the therapeutic modalities in malignant gliomas, where an attempt is made to consider separately glioblastomas, anaplastic astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, low-grade glioma, medulloblastoma, primary brain lymphoma, and brain metastases. A decision making algorithm is suggested for each tumor type.
