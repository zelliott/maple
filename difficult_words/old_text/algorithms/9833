We have investigated the potential application of elastic light single-scattering spectroscopy (ELSSS) as an adjunctive tool for intraoperative rapid detection of brain tumors and demarcation of the tumor from the surrounding normal tissue. Measurements were performed on 29 excised tumor specimens from 29 patients. There were 21 instances of low-grade tumors and eight instances of high-grade tumors. Normal gray matter and white matter brain tissue specimens of four epilepsy patients were used as a control group. One low-grade and one high-grade tumor were misclassified as normal brain tissue. Of the low- and high-grade tumors, 20 out of 21 and 7 out of 8 were correctly classified by the ELSSS system, respectively. One normal white matter tissue margin was detected in a high-grade tumor, and three normal tissue margins were detected in three low-grade tumors using spectroscopic data analysis and confirmed by histopathology. The spectral slopes were shown to be positive for normal white matter brain tissue and negative for normal gray matter and tumor tissues. Our results indicate that signs of spectral slopes may enable the discrimination of brain tumors from surrounding normal white matter brain tissue with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100%.
