An experimental model which can simulate physical changes that occur during aging was developed in order to evaluate the effects of change of mineral content and microstructure on ultrasonic properties of bovine cancellous bone. Timed immersion in hydrochloric acid was used to selectively alter the mineral content. Scanning electron microscopy and histological staining of the acid-treated trabeculae demonstrated a heterogeneous structure consisting of a mineralized core and a demineralized layer. The presence of organic matrix contributed very little to normalized broadband ultrasound attenuation (nBUA) and speed of sound. All three ultrasonic parameters, speed of sound, nBUA and backscatter coefficient, were sensitive to changes in apparent density of bovine cancellous bone. A two-component model utilizing a combination of two autocorrelation functions (a densely populated model and a spherical distribution) was used to approximate the backscatter coefficient. The predicted attenuation due to scattering constituted a significant part of the measured total attenuation (due to both scattering and absorption mechanisms) for bovine cancellous bone. Linear regression, performed between trabecular thickness values and estimated from the model correlation lengths, showed significant linear correlation, with R(2)=0.81 before and R(2)=0.80 after demineralization. The accuracy of estimation was found to increase with trabecular thickness.
