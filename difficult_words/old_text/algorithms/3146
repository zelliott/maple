Mucoadhesive tablets containing nystatin (10 mg) were evaluated in vivo. The assays were carried out with 12 healthy volunteers and the concentration of nystatin in saliva was determined at different times. Tablets remained attached to the buccal mucosa during 270 min +/- 30 min. No evidence of ulceration or bleeding was observed. Typical appearance of intact human buccal mucosa was seen before and after contact with the tablet. The tablets were well accepted by the volunteers, although most of the volunteers reported a light bitter taste, probably due to nystatin. Concentration of nystatin in saliva was several times higher than MIC over a period of approximately 4.5 h, which was in agreement with the behavior observed in vitro. These results allow us to infer that the administration of these mucoadhesive tablets could be advantageous compared to conventional formulations and mucoadhesive extended-release tablets might produce better therapeutic performance than conventional formulations in the treatment of oral candidosis.
