This paper presents a mathematical model of a system of many coupled nephrons branching from a common cortical radial artery, and accompanying analysis of that system. This modeling effort is a first step in understanding how coupling magnifies the tendency of nephrons to oscillate owing to tubuloglomerular feedback. Central to the present work is the single nephron integral model (as in Pitman et al., The IMA Volumes in Mathematics and Its Applications, vol. 129, pp. 345-364, 2002 and in Zaritski, Ph.D. Dissertation, 1999) which is a simplification of the single nephron PDE model of Layton et al. (Am. J. Physiol. 261, F904-F919, 1991). A second principal idea used in the present model is a coupling of model nephrons, generalizing the work of Pitman et al. (Bull. Math. Biol. 66, 1463-1492, 2004) who proposed a model of two coupled nephrons. In this study, we couple nephrons through a nearest neighbor interaction.Speaking generally, our results suggest that a series of similar nephrons coupled to their nearest neighbors are more prone to be found in an oscillatory mode, relative to a single nephron with the same properties. More specifically, we show analytically that, for N coupled identical nephrons, the region supporting oscillatory solutions in the time delay-gain parameter plane increases with N. Numerical simulations suggest that, if N nephrons have gains and time delays that do not differ by much, the system is, again, more prone to oscillate, relative to a single nephron, and the oscillations tend to be approximately synchronous and in-phase. We examine the effect of parameters on bifurcation. We also examine alternative models of coupling; this analysis allows us to conclude that the increased propensity of coupled nephrons to oscillate is a robust finding, true for several models of nephron interaction.
