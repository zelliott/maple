We consider the problems of interval estimation and hypothesis testing for the intraclass correlation coefficient in an interrater reliability study when both raters and subjects are assumed to be randomly selected from populations of raters and subjects, respectively. We propose a novel approach for the confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing using the concepts of generalized confidence interval (GCI) and generalized P-values. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the coverage probabilities of the GCI approach relative to the modified large sample (MLS) approach. Both methods tend to provide somewhat conservative coverage. Relative to the MLS approach, the GCI approach is closer to the correct (nominal) coverage for a two-sided interval, but farther to the correct coverage for a one-sided lower interval. Unlike the MLS approach, the GCI approach can also easily provide P-values. The fact that the GCI approach is suitable for confidence interval estimation and obtaining P-values makes the GCI approach a suitable candidate for making inference about interrater reliability.
