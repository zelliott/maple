The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) determined by invasive ventriculography (routine cardiac cath; LV-gram) was compared with that determined by echocardiography in 100 patients scheduled for angiography (86% had LV-gram and 2DE during same hospital admission). Seventy percent of patients had at least single-vessel obstructive coronary artery disease, defined as more than 50% stenosis. By all estimates, the LVEF was higher in patients without coronary artery disease (CAD) compared to patients with CAD. There was an excellent correlation between the LVEF by cath and echo, but this correlation was noticeably less strong in patients with CAD, especially with involvement of the left circumflex artery.
