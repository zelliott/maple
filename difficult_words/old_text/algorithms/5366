Intracerebral haemorrhages (ICH) are responsible for 10-17% of all strokes and are associated with a high mortality and morbidity. More than 50% of the primary cases of ICH are associated with an underlying arterial hypertension and up to 30% with a cerebral amyloidosis. In supratentorial ICH, primary treatment generally should be conservative, as clinical studies could not show favourable outcomes after surgical haematoma evacuation. However, in patients with infratentorial haemorrhages and neurologic deterioration, early surgical evacuation should be considered. Modern therapeutic strategies and the focus of current and recent clinical research include early haemostasis, improvement of intensive care, and less invasive neurosurgical interventions, with the aim to reduce secondary brain damage. This review provides an overview of the clinical presentation of ICH and includes up-to-date recommendations concerning diagnostic and therapeutic options.
