The effects of fenbufen on the serum concentrations and penetration into the brain and CSF of sparfloxacin (AT-4140), a new quinolone antibacterial agent, were investigated in rats. At designated times after a bolus iv dose of sparfloxacin 10 mg/kg with or without fenbufen 20 mg/kg, arterial blood, CSF and whole brain were simultaneously collected from each rat. Sparfloxacin concentrations were assayed by HPLC. Serum concentration of sparfloxacin declined bi-exponentially with time and was not changed by coadministered fenbufen. Binding sparfloxacin to serum protein slightly decreased after the coadministration. No elevation of sparfloxacin concentrations was observed in either brain or CSF after coadministration with fenbufen except for only a few time-points. The pharmacokinetic analysis based on the physiological model indicated that fenbufen did not affect the permeability across the blood-brain or blood-CSF barrier. These results suggest that fenbufen may be unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics, involving the entry into the central nervous system, of sparfloxacin.
