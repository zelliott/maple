1,2-Addition of transient W(CO)(5)-complexed phosphinidenes exo to hexamethyl Dewar benzene affords the novel 3-phosphatricyclo[3.2.0.0(2,4)]hept-6-ene complexes. The fused tricyclic phosphiranes are obtained as both the Z and the thermally less stable E isomers, the (31)P NMR chemical shifts of which differ by about 60 ppm. A computational investigation shows that the phosphorus pyramidalization and the presence of the gamma double bond are responsible for this effect. The semiquantitative results contribute to a more systematic understanding of the structural influences on (31)P chemical shieldings. The congested double bond of the Z isomer can be epoxidized with m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) to afford a fused tetracyclic P,O bis-adduct.
