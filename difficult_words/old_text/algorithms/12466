A new method for two-dimensional deconvolution of medical ultrasonic images is presented. The spatial resolution of the deconvolved images is much higher compared to the common images of the fundamental and second harmonic. The deconvolution also results in a more distinct speckle pattern. Unlike the most published deconvolution algorithms for ultrasonic images, the presented technique can be implemented using currently available hardware in real-time imaging, with a rate up to 50 frames per second. This makes it attractive for application in the current ultrasound scanners. The algorithm is based on two-dimensional homomorphic deconvolution with simplified assumptions about the point spread function. Broadband radio frequency image data are deconvolved instead of common fundamental harmonic data. Thus, information of both the first and second harmonics is used. The method was validated on image data recorded from a tissue-mimicking phantom and on clinical image data.
