The introduction of systems for automated reading in mammography has been proposed to improve the sensitivity [computer-aided detection (CADe) systems] and, more recently, the specificity [computer-aided diagnosis (CADi) systems] of the test. Only CADe systems have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are used in current practice. These systems are still under discussion. Several studies have demonstrated that they are beneficial to inexperienced readers and that, through comparison with the computer, radiologists are led to improve their performance. However, there is still considerable variation among different studies in the level of benefit deriving from CAD. Therefore the role of these systems in clinical practice is still debated, and their real contribution to the overall management of the diagnostic process is not yet clear.
