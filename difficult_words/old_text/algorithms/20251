Presented are the results of a diagnostic algorithm for ectopic pregnancy incorporating history, physical examination, quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), serum progesterone, color-flow vaginal Doppler sonography and endometrial curettage as well as a treatment algorithm combining expectant, medical and surgical management. These algorithms resulted in: (1) earlier diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, with fewer ruptured ectopic pregnancies; (2) virtual elimination of diagnostic laparoscopy; (3) elimination of culdocentesis; (4) greater use of methotrexate; and (5) increased use of expectant (i.e., nonsurgical and nonmedical) treatment. These algorithms are potentially applicable in other clinical settings and should be considered for use on at-risk populations or when the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is in question.
