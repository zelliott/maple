We report a novel coherent excitation phenomenon in a heterogeneous network of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo elements. It is demonstrated that dynamical rewiring in the network can play a constructive role to bring on coherent excitations. The coherence factor as the function of rewiring time interval represents a nontrivial phenomenon which is a fingerprint of coherence resonance. We call this resonant behavior caused by dynamical wiring changes the network-rewiring-induced coherence resonance. The mechanism can be understood by the effective noise played by the rewiring process.
