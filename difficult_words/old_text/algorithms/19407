The present review examines the various mainstream treatment options, benefits and risks, and controversies involved in developing a management algorithm for treatment of vestibular schwannoma.

Advances in microsurgery and radiosurgery have made tremendous contributions to management of vestibular schwannoma; however, considerable controversy still exists. The auditory and facial nerve functional outcomes have improved with use of intraoperative monitoring for vestibular schwannoma removal and with lower radiosurgery doses; however, risks to the facial and auditory nerves still exist. Observing vestibular schwannomas for growth with serial magnetic resonance imaging is an increasingly popular option for small vestibular schwannomas that allows patients to enjoy hearing and facial function.

The risks and benefits of each treatment option must be weighed for each patient, and management decisions regarding vestibular schwannomas should be individualized for each patient depending on tumor anatomy, patient preferences, and symptoms.
