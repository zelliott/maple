In this series, the authors present their experience with correction of the traumatic twisted nose in Asians using open rhinoplasty. A standard surgical algorithm was followed to determine treatment strategies for 92 patients with traumatic twisted nose at the Tri-Service General Hospital in Taiwan between 1 August 2001 and 1 June 2004. A retrospective chart review was performed to collect patient data and surgical details. A follow-up self-evaluation survey regarding satisfaction with nasal function and aesthetics was distributed to all the participants. All the patients underwent open rhinoplasties under general anesthesia. The 87 males and 5 females were 15 to 53 years of age (mean, 28 years). Their postoperative periods were uneventful and without complications. Patient self-evaluations were largely positive, reporting improvement in nasal function. The authors propose a simple surgical algorithm using open rhinoplasty for optimal correction of traumatic twisted nose deformities. The algorithm, which is adaptable to a variety of anatomic deformities, guides surgical decision making that yields consistently satisfactory functional and aesthetic results.
