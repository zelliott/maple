A versatile resource program was developed for diffusion tensor image (DTI) computation and fiber tracking. The software can read data formats from a variety of MR scanners. Tensor calculation is performed by solving an over-determined linear equation system using least square fitting. Various types of map data, such as tensor elements, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, diffusion anisotropy, diffusion constants, and color-coded orientations can be calculated. The results are visualized interactively in orthogonal views and in three-dimensional mode. Three-dimensional tract reconstruction is based on the Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking (FACT) algorithm and a brute-force reconstruction approach. To improve the time and memory efficiency, a rapid algorithm to perform the FACT is adopted. An index matrix for the fiber data is introduced to facilitate various types of fiber bundles selection based on approaches employing multiple regions of interest (ROIs). The program is developed using C++ and OpenGL on a Windows platform.
