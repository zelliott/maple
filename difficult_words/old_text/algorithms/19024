Previous studies have suggested that temporal effects in masking may be consistent with a decrease in cochlear gain. One paradigm used to show this is to measure the level of a long-duration masker required to just mask a short-duration tone that occurs near masker onset. The temporal effect is revealed when the signal is detected at a lower signal-to-noise ratio following preceding stimulation (either an extension of the masker or a separate precursor). The present study examined whether this effect depends on precursor level. The signal was a 10-ms, 4-kHz tone. The masker was 200 ms. A fixed-level precursor had the same frequency characteristics as the masker, and was 205 ms. The masker and precursor had either no notch or a wide notch about the signal frequency. For a given precursor level, the growth of masker level with signal level was determined. These data were used to estimate input-output functions. The results are consistent with a graded decrease in gain at the signal frequency when there is no notch in the masker and precursor, and a graded decrease in suppression when there is a large notch. These results could be consistent with the action of the medial olivocochlear reflex.
