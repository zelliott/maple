A network of coupled chaotic oscillators can switch spontaneously to a state of collective synchronization at some critical coupling strength. We show that for a locally coupled network of units with coexisting quiescence and chaotic spiking states, set slightly below the critical coupling value, the collective excitable or bistable states of synchronization arise in response to a stimulus applied to a single node. We provide an explanation of this behavior and show that it is due to a combination of the dynamical properties of a single node and the coupling topology. By the use of entropy as a collective indicator, we present a new method for controlling the transient synchronization.
