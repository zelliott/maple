The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between bone levels observed on dental panoramic tomographs (DPT) and the WHO/FDI recommended periodontal screening technique: the community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN). Computer enhancement and digital analysis were used to improve accuracy and reliability. A total of 199 posterior sextants on DPT radiographs from 50 patients (29 female and 21 male) with a mean age of 42 were examined. A statistically significant relationship was found between CPITN and radiographic measurement from the cemento-enamel junction to the alveolar crestal bone margin (A). The relationship between A and CPITN was found to fit the following equation: square root of A = beta 1 + F, where, F is constant and beta 1 is the coefficient corresponding to the i the codes of CPITN. It was concluded that there was a close correlation between the CPITN screening codes and bone loss as measured on the DPT radiograph.
