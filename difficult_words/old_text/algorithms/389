In this paper, we propose a new method for collision handling between 3-D deformable (organs) and rigid (surgical tools) objects valid for nonstructured interaction scenes and, specifically, for laparoscopic surgery simulators. During the simulation step, vertices of the organ detected as collided must be accurately shifted out of the tool to elude a visual interpenetration. The proposed approach obtains the new position of each collided vertex of the organ taking into account both kinematic information of the surgical tool and geometric information of the organ surface that surrounds the vertex under analysis. Three parameters inferred from a fuzzy feedback system weigh the nature of the tool motion with respect to the organ. Experimental results show that the solution proposed in this paper is able to avoid the interpenetration among the multiple colliding points efficiently with physically and spatially coherent results.
