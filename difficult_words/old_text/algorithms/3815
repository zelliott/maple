Optimization of submerged culture conditions for the production of mycelial growth and exopolysaccharides (EPSs) by Collybia maculata was investigated. The optimum temperature and the initial pH for EPS production in a shake-flask culture of C. maculata were found to be 20 degrees C and 5.5, respectively. Among the various medium's constituents examined, glucose, Martone A-1, K(2)HPO(4), and CaCl(2) were the most suitable carbon, nitrogen, and mineral sources for EPS production, respectively. The optimum concentration of the medium's ingredients determined using the orthogonal matrix method was as follows: 30 g/L of glucose, 20 g/L of Martone A-1, 1 g/L of K(2)HPO(4), and 1 g/L of CaCl(2). Under the optimized culture conditions, the maximum concentration of EPSs in a 5-L stirred-tank reactor was 2.4 g/L, which was approximately five times higher than that in the basal medium. A comparative fermentation result showed that the EPS productivity in an airlift reactor was higher than that in the stirred-tank reactor despite the lower mycelial growth rate. The specific productivities and the yield coefficients in the airlift reactor were higher than those in the stirred-tank reactor even though the volumetric productivities were higher in the stirred-tank reactor than in the airlift reactor.
