The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of prenatal screening for congenital heart disease (CHD) based on a combination of the 4-chamber view and 3-vessel view in an unselected population.

A prospective study on 8025 scanned fetuses was performed. All singleton pregnancies scheduled for routine prenatal sonographic screening at 20 to 24 weeks' gestation and subsequently delivered in our unit were included. Data were recorded regarding visualization of the 4-chamber view, outflow tracts, and 3-vessel view. Suspected CHD was confirmed by postmortem or postnatal echocardiography. We obtained follow-up data for the neonates and calculated the diagnostic accuracy of the examinations.

Major CHD was identified in 32 cases (4.0%), of which 26 (81.3%) were diagnosed antenatally and 6 (18.7%) postnatally. Four cases (0.5%) had false-positive findings. Twenty-one cases were identified by the 4-chamber view and 5 by an abnormal 3-vessel view. The sensitivity of the 4-chamber view alone was 65.6%, and the specificity was 99.9%. The sensitivity of the combination of the 4-chamber view and 3-vessel view was 81.3%, and the specificity was 99.9%.

The 3-vessel view is a reliable and easy method to be used in a routine antenatal clinic along with the 4-chamber view.
