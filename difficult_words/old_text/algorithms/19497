It is often difficult for radiologists to identify small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) due to insufficient contrast enhancement. Therefore, we have developed a new computer-aided temporal and dynamic subtraction technique to enhance small HCCs, after automatically selecting images set at the same anatomical position from the present (non-enhanced and arterial-phase CT images) and previous images. The present study was performed with CT images from 14 subjects. First, we used template-matching based on similarities in liver shape between the present (non-enhanced and arterial-phase CT images) and previous arterial-phase CT images at the same position. Temporal subtraction images were then obtained by subtraction of the previous image from the present image taken at the same position of the liver. Dynamic subtraction images were also obtained by subtraction of non-enhanced CT images from arterial-phase CT images taken at the same position of the liver. Twenty-one of 22 nodules (95.5%) with contrast enhancement were visualized in temporal and dynamic subtraction images. Compared with present arterial-phase CT images, increases of 150% and 140% in nodule-to-liver contrast were observed on dynamic and temporal subtraction images, respectively. These subtraction images may be useful as reference images in the detection of small moderately differentiated HCCs.
