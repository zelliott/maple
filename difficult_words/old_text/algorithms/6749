By exploiting the rapid increase in available sequence data, the definition of medically relevant protein targets has been improved by a combination of: (i) differential genome analysis (target list): and (ii) analysis of individual proteins (target analysis). Fast sequence comparisons, data mining, and genetic algorithms further promote these procedures. Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins were chosen as applied examples.
