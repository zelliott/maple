Multidetector-row CT is promising for prosthetic heart valve (PHV) assessment but retrospectively ECG-gated scanning has a considerable radiation dose. Recently introduced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms may enable radiation dose reduction with retained image quality. Furthermore, PHV image quality on the CT scan mainly depends on extent of PHV artifacts. IR may decrease streak artifacts. We compared image noise and artifact volumes in scans of mechanical PHVs reconstructed with conventional filtered back projection (FBP) to lower dose scans reconstructed with IR. Four different PHVs (St. Jude, Carbomedics, ON-X and Medtronic Hall) were scanned in a pulsatile in vitro model. Ten retrospectively ECG-gated CT scans were performed of each PHV at 120 kV, 600 mAs (high-dose CTDI(vol) 35.3 mGy) and 120 kV, 300 mAs (low-dose CTDI(vol) 17.7 mGy) on a 64 detector-row scanner. Diastolic and systolic images were reconstructed with FBP (high and low-dose) and the IR algorithm (low-dose only). Hypo- and hyperdense artifact volumes were determined using two threshold filters. Image noise was measured. Mean hypo- and hyperdense artifact volumes (mm(3)) were 1,235/5,346 (high-dose FBP); 2,405/6,877 (low-dose FBP) and 1,218/5,333 (low-dose IR). Low-dose IR reconstructions had similar image noise compared to high-dose FBP (16.5 ± 1.7 vs. 16.3 ± 1.6, mean ± SD, respectively, P = 1.0). IR allows ECG-gated PHV imaging with similar image noise and PHV artifacts at 50% less dose compared to conventional FBP in an pulsatile in vitro model.
