We measured the external moments and digit-tip force directions acting on a freely moveable object while it was grasped and manipulated by old (OA) and young (YA) adults. Participants performed a grasp and lift task and a precision orientation (key-slot) task with a precision (thumb-finger) grip. During the grasp-lift task the OA group misaligned their thumb and finger contacts and produced greater grip force, greater external moments on the object around its roll axis, and oriented force vectors differently compared with the YA group. During the key-slot task, the OA group was more variable in digit-tip force directions and performed the key-slot task more slowly. With practice the OA group aligned their digits, reduced their grip force, and minimized external moments on the object, clearly demonstrating that the nervous system monitored and actively manipulated one or more variables related to object tilt. This was true even for the grip-lift task, a task for which no instructions regarding object orientation were given and which could tolerate modest amounts of object tilt without interfering with task goals. Although the OA group performed the key-slot task faster with experience, they remained slower than the YA group. We conclude that with old age comes a reduced ability to control the forces and moments applied to objects during precision grasp and manipulation. This may contribute to the ubiquitous slowing and deteriorating manual dexterity in healthy aging.
