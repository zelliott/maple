There's no question that our partnership is a natural, given the technological emphasis in modern medicine. My comments are not intended as criticism, but offered in the spirit of broadening our mutual understanding. I believe that open communication will enhance our continued collaboration in this interdisciplinary effort and yield significant advances in medical science.
