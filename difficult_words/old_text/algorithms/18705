An estimation procedure to efficiently find approximate values of internal parameters in ultrasonic transducers intended for broadband operation would be a valuable tool to discover internal construction data. This information is necessary in the modelling and simulation of acoustic and electrical behaviour related to ultrasonic systems containing commercial transducers. There is not a general solution for this generic problem of parameter estimation in the case of broadband piezoelectric probes. In this paper, this general problem is briefly analysed for broadband conditions. The viability of application in this field of an artificial intelligence technique supported on the modelling of the transducer internal components is studied. A genetic algorithm (GA) procedure is presented and applied to the estimation of different parameters, related to two transducers which are working as pulsed transmitters. The efficiency of this GA technique is studied, considering the influence of the number and variation range of the estimated parameters. Estimation results are experimentally ratified.
