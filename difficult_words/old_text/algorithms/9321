The application of Taylor's concept about body angiosomes, referred to tissue transfers, has meant that the development of the perforator flaps and muscles is no longer needed as a carrier of skin flap vascularity. In this paper, we revise 59 lower limb reconstructions with local and free perforator flaps performed in the last 5 years, and a basic reconstructive algorithm is also suggested to help with the management of the lower limb soft tissue reconstruction with perforator flaps. The advantages of the perforator flaps are (1) muscles and their function are preserved; (2) the main vascular trunks are spared; (3) it is possible to make a more specific reconstruction, replacing "like with like" (even performing compound or chimeric flaps); (4) the donor site can often be closed primarily; (5) the general morbidity is reduced; (6) a better cosmetic result can be achieved.
