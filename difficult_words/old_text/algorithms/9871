Molecular modeling techniques have made significant advances in recent years and are becoming essential components of many chemical, physical and biological studies. Here we present three widely used techniques used in the simulation of biomolecular systems: structural and homology modeling, molecular dynamics and molecular docking. For each of these topics we present a brief discussion of the underlying scientific basis of the technique, some simple examples of how the method is commonly applied, and some discussion of the limitations and caveats of which the user should be aware. References for further reading as well as an extensive list of software resources are provided.
