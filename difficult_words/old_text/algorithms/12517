To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tissue plasminogen activator in management of postoperative fibrinous uveitis.

Prospective study, interventional case series including 13 patients who developed fibrinous membrane in anterior chamber; patients were operated for cataract (4 cases), for cataract and glaucoma (7 cases) and for corneoscleral lacerations (2 cases). Initial treatment consisted of corticosteroid administration (topically, subconjunctival +/- systemic) and mydriatic-cycloplegic drugs. Inadequate response imposed intracavitary administration of tissue plasminogen activator (25 microg/ml, 0.2 ml). The main outcomes were: complete resolution of fibrinous membrane, presence of adverse events and visual rehabilitation.

Fibrinous membrane resorption starts in the next hours and complete resolution was proved in all cases after a mean time 53.55 +/- 37.65 (24-146) hours. In 12 patients we used only one administration of tissue plasminogen activator, but in one case we repeated it. It was not signaled any adverse event drug related. It was an important increase of visual acuity in all cases.

Intracavitary administration of tissue plasminogen activator is a safe and efficient alternative in the management of postoperative fibrinous membrane.
