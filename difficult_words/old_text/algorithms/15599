This paper examines the effectiveness of a promising cognitive enhancement technique called node-link mapping. Maps provide a concrete, visual, and computationally efficient means for exploring personal issues, and have received substantial empirical support. We introduce two models to provide a framework for understanding how node-link mapping improves substance abuse counseling. The TCU Process Model reviews the general process of substance abuse treatment. The second model reflects an effective treatment session. Implications of the models and node-link mapping findings are discussed, as well as future research directions.
