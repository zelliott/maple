Acute ischemic stroke is a neurological emergency that can be treated with time-sensitive interventions, including intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular approaches. Extensive study has demonstrated that rapid assessment and treatment are essential to improving neurological outcome. For this reason, acute ischemic stroke was chosen as an Emergency Neurological Life Support protocol. The protocol focuses on the first hour following the onset of neurological deficit.
