Intermittent auscultation (IA) has been reported as equivalent to electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) as a fetal surveillance method in terms of neonatal outcomes based on randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. Despite recommendations to include IA as a primary method for fetal evaluation, EFM use predominates. Understanding the equipment, method, benefits and limitations, and strategies for implementing IA may assist nurses in providing informed choices for low-risk pregnant women.
