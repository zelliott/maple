An algorithm for generating calibration curves that reflects the peculiarities of the dynamic mode of operating of the amperometric biosensor, created on the base of numerical simulations of the sensor behaviour, is proposed. The most important steps are: selection of the informative quantity about the sensor current versus time relationship and the calibration curve processing. Five different informative quantities are tested as well as two ways of representation of calibration curves. The object of study is enzyme catalyzed selective reaction. The values of the kinetic constants used reflect the conversion of glucose to gluconolacton catalyzed by glucose oxidase (GOD) and catalase (CAT). The results show that sensors with different metrological characteristics can be created by means of a selection of informative quantity of the signal of one biosensor transducer. In addition there appears to be a possibility of facilitating the calibration procedure and prolonging the life of the biosensor.
