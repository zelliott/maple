It has been said that the essence of medicine is the reduction of uncertainty for patients and physicians (Ludo Baghius). Confronting patients who have some symptoms suggesting lupus but who do not meet criteria for classic SLE is challenging. Evaluating and caring for these patients, when not making a diagnosis of SLE, demands clinical acumen, confidence, and effective communication skills.
