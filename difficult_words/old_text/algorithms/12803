Anemia is a common disorder in the elderly and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In elderly subjects, in whom anemia is highly prevalent, there are several aspects, such as a hemoglobin at a level which should concern us limit, or identifying its causes, that are not easy to establish. This review focuses on knowing what is considered to be normal hemoglobin levels in adults and the common causes and potential consequences of anemia in elderly patients. It provides a diagnostic algorithm and an approach to treatment that addresses new treatments such as parenteral iron drugs and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.
