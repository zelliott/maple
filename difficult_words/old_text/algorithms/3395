Various alternative spectral estimation methods are examined and compared in order to assess their possible application for real-time analysis of Doppler ultrasound arterial signals. Specifically, five general frequency domain models are examined, including the periodogram, the general autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model which has the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models as special cases, and Capon's maximum likelihood spectral model. A stimulated stationary Doppler signal with a known theoretical spectrum was used as the reference test sequence, and white noise was added to enable various signal/noise conditions to be created. The performance of each method representative of each spectral model was assessed using both qualitative and quantitative schemes that convey information related to the bias and variance of the spectral estimates. Three integrated performance indices were implemented for quantitative analysis. The relative computational complexity for each algorithm was also investigated. Our results indicate that both the AR(Yule-Walker) and ARMA(singular value decomposition) models of orders (8) and (4,4), respectively, show good agreement with the theoretical spectrum, and yield estimates with variances considerably less than the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Preliminary results obtained with these methods using a clinical, non-stationary Doppler signal supports these observations.
