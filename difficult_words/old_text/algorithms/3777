Recent studies of the quantum-mechanical processes in the DNA molecule have seriously challenged the principle that mutations occur randomly. The proton tunneling mechanism causes tautomeric transitions in base pairs resulting in mutations during DNA replication. The meticulous study of the quantum-mechanical phenomena in DNA may reveal that the process of mutagenesis is not completely random. We are still far away from a complete quantum-mechanical model of DNA sequence mutagenesis because of the complexity of the processes and the complex three-dimensional structure of the molecule. In this paper we have developed a quantum-mechanical description of DNA evolution and, following its outline, we have constructed a classical model for DNA evolution assuming that some aspects of the quantum-mechanical processes have influenced the determination of the genetic code. Conversely, our model assumes that the genetic code provides information about the quantum-mechanical mechanisms of mutagenesis, as the current code is the product of an evolutionary process that tries to minimize the spurious consequences of mutagenesis. Based on this model we develop an algorithm that can be used to study the accumulation of mutations in a DNA sequence. The algorithm has a user-friendly interface and the user can change key parameters in order to study relevant hypotheses.
