In this work we analyzed proteomic maps obtained from hepatocytes, which were treated with 14 halocarbons. A similarity index was introduced as a robust measure of similarity between two maps or between two selections of spots within the maps. A searching algorithm was used to identify the spots that may play an important role in toxicity mechanism. The highest correlation coefficients obtained between the similarity index and biological parameter were larger than 0.9.
