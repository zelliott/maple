Contrastfilters for NMR imaging of residual 1H dipolar couplings of elastomers are introduced based on dipolar-encoded longitudinal magnetization, as well as double- and triple-quantum coherences. The spin response is discussed in the initial excitation time regime for methylene, methyl, and methine protons applicable to poly(isoprene) and other elastomers, taking into account the hierarchy of dipolar couplings and the associated editing features of multiple-quantum experiments. The efficiency of these filters is investigated for a series of cross-linked poly(isoprene) samples. Spatially resolved dipolar-encoded longitudinal magnetization decays and double-quantum and triple-quantum buildup curves are presented for a phantom made of poly(isoprene) with different cross-link densities. Two-dimensional images representing residual dipolar couplings are presented using dipolar-encoded longitudinal magnetization, double-quantum, and triple-quantum contrast filters. Images from dipolar-encoded longitudinal magnetization and triple-quantum coherences show the highest resolution and contrast, respectively.
