Erythrodermic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (E-CTCL) is the cause of less than 5% of all cases of generalized erythroderma. A methodical evaluation of skin, blood, and lymph node samples using standard histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry (FC), and molecular analysis for evidence of a dominant T-cell clone has been recommended in a recently published diagnostic algorithm. In this commentary, the author discusses available information regarding the role of these diagnostic methods for the diagnosis of E-CTCL with emphasis on personal observations regarding skin IHC and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular studies as adjunct diagnostic studies on a series of 55 patients with erythrodermic mycosis fungoides and 50 patients with SÃ©zary syndrome compared to 50 patients with extensive benign inflammatory skin disease. The conclusions are (1) IHC of the skin does not reliably differentiate E-CTCL from benign simulants, (2) presence of phenotypically abnormal T cells in the blood or expanded subsets of CD4+CD7- or CD4+CD26- cells by FC is particularly helpful as a diagnostic study, (3) the presence of an identical T-cell clone in the skin and blood also is a specific diagnostic criterion for E-CTCL, but exceptions may occur, and (4) the PCRgamma-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique appears to be more reliable than PCRgamma-single-stranded conformational polymorphism for diagnostic purposes.
