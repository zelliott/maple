Chemical permeation enhancers (CPEs) are known to increase skin permeability to therapeutic drugs. Single chemicals, however, offer limited enhancements of skin permeability. Mixtures of chemicals can overcome this limitation owing to their synergistic interactions. However, identification of potent mixtures of chemicals requires screening of a large number of formulations. Discovery of CPE mixtures can be significantly accelerated by identifying patterns that occur in the existing data on CPEs. In this study, we systematically mine through a huge database on skin permeabilizing effect of over 4000 binary formulations generated by high throughput screening and extract general principles that govern the effect of binary combinations of chemicals on skin's barrier properties. Potencies and synergies of these formulations are analyzed to identify the role played by the formulation composition and chemistry. The analysis reveals several intuitive but some largely non-intuitive trends. For example, formulations made from enhancer mixtures are most potent when participating moieties are present in nearly equal fractions. Methyl pyrrolidone, a small molecule, is particularly effective in forming potent and synergistic enhancer formulations, and zwitterionic surfactants are more likely to feature in potent enhancers. Simple but invaluable rules like these will provide guiding principles for designing libraries to further speed up the formulation discovery process.
