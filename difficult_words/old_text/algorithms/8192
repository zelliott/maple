To investigate the feasibility of multiecho balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP)-based fast chemical shift mapping hyperpolarized (13)C metabolites. The overall goal was to reduce total imaging time and to increase spatial resolution compared to common chemical shift imaging (CSI).

A multiecho bSSFP sequence in combination with an iterative reconstruction algorithm was implemented. (1)H experiments were performed on phantoms and on a human volunteer in order to investigate the feasibility of the method on a system with metabolite maps that are known beforehand. (13)C experiments were performed in vivo on pigs, where CSI images were acquired also for comparison.

Chemical shift images of three and four distinct (1)H resonance frequencies as well as chemical shift images of up to five hyperpolarized (13)C metabolites were successfully obtained.

Fast metabolite mapping based on multiecho balanced SSFP in combination with an iterative reconstruction approach could successfully separate several (1)H resonances and hyperpolarized (13)C metabolites.
