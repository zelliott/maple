Techniques and methods of clinical (1)H-MR spectroscopy are described in this manuscript. The role of (1)H-MRS in the multimodal focus analysis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is illustrated with special respect to focus lateralization and differentiation between mesial and lateral (neocortical) TLE. Additionally the application of (1)H-MRS for evaluating postoperative outcome and monitoring conservative antiepileptic treatment schedules is summarized.
