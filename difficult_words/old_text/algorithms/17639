An alternative methodology based on artificial neural networks is proposed to be a complementary tool to other conventional methods to study controlled drug release. Two systems are used to test the approach; namely, hydrocortisone in a biodegradable matrix and rhodium (II) butyrate complexes in a bioceramic matrix. Two well-established mathematical models are used to simulate different release profiles as a function of fundamental properties; namely, diffusion coefficient (D), saturation solubility (C(s)), drug loading (A), and the height of the device (h). The models were tested, and the results show that these fundamental properties can be predicted after learning the experimental or model data for controlled drug release systems. The neural network results obtained after the learning stage can be considered to quantitatively predict ideal experimental conditions. Overall, the proposed methodology was shown to be efficient for ideal experiments, with a relative average error of <1% in both tests. This approach can be useful for the experimental analysis to simulate and design efficient controlled drug-release systems.
