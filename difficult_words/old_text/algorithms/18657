This article presents treatment priorities for open pelvic fracture and the results of 12 patients. In a retrospective study we analyzed 12 patients treated at a level 1 trauma center between 1994 and 1998 of whom eight were male and four female with an average age of 29.6 years. Six type C (6 x III degrees open) and six type B (4 x II degrees and 2 x III degrees open) were identified. On average, 15 EKs were necessary within the first 12 h of treatment (type C=17, type B=13). All type C fractures underwent emergency stabilization with the pelvic C-clamp. Early laparotomy was performed in 60%. Perineal laceration was identified in 58%, followed by nerve and plexus lesions in 42%, injuries of the genitourinary tract in 33%, and lesions of the fecal stream in 25%. Altogether, there were more peripelvic injuries associated with type C fracture than with type B (12 vs 8). On average, there were 27 second-look operations necessary with 3-.2 operations per patient. The average stay in the ICU was 82 days (80-360); 25% died. Control of hemorrhage is fundamental; therefore, emergency stabilization of the pelvis is essential followed by surgical procedures. Early surgical definitive stabilization of the fracture decreases septic complications. Such complex injuries should be treated at specialized trauma centers.
