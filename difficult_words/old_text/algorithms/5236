An electric drill coupled with a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber or a PDMS thin film was used for rapid sampling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in aqueous samples. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the sampling rates of SPME fiber and thin film can be predicted theoretically. Compared with the SPME fiber, the PDMS thin film active sampler exhibited a higher sampling rate and much better sensitivity due to its higher surface-to-volume ratio and its larger extraction phase volume. The amount of the analytes extracted by the thin film was around 100 times higher than those obtained by fiber, for both 5 min rapid sampling and equilibrium extraction. A new thin film active sampler was then developed for rapid on-site water sampling. The sampling kit included a portable electric drill, a copper mesh pocket, a piece of thin film, and a liner. Laboratory experiments indicated that the sampling remained in the linear uptake phase with this sampler to 8 min for the PAHs. Field test illustrated that this novel sampler was excellent for rapid on-site water sampling due to its short sampling period, high sampling efficiency and durability The thin film sampling kit facilitates on-site sampling, sample preparation, storage and transport. This new sampler is more user-friendly and easier to commercialize than previous samplers.
