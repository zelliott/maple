Although subwavelength dielectric gratings can be employed to achieve a high sensitivity of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor, the plasmonic interpretation verifying the resulting sensitivity improvement remains unclear. The aim of this study is to elucidate the effects of the grating's geometric parameters on the amplification of SPR responses and to understand the physical mechanisms associated with the enhancement. Our numerical results show that the proposed SPR substrate with a dielectric grating can provide a better sensitivity due to the combined effects of surface reaction area and field distribution at the binding region. An influence of adhesion layer on the sensor performance is also discussed. The obtained results will be promising in high-sensitivity plasmonic biosensing applications.
