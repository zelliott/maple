Auditory evoked potentials were recorded in 360 homogeneously spaced sites, in a volume encapsulating the lateral lemniscus-inferior colliculus transition of anaesthetized rats, in order to calculate the electric field vector distribution with each moment in time referenced to the onset of sound presentation. Software, to conduct calculations and graphical representation, and hardware, to minimize neural damage upon recording, were developed in our laboratory. Our results indicate a smooth transition of both amplitude and direction of vectors, suggestive of sequentially activated sites with outward and inward ionic currents coherent with what is known of this part of the primary auditory pathway. That is, anatomical sites (neural generators) and latency for activation matches previous research of the auditory pathway, while adding a real time perspective to the anatomical substrates recruited during the auditory evoked response. An algorithm for calculating the divergent of the vector field, an estimate of the current source density inside the three-dimensional control volume, was used to infer the possible current sinks and sources generating the field potentials. This technique allowed a clear visualization of two distinct discharges arising from the lateral lemniscus towards the inferior colliculus, thus recording signal propagation, as a movie file, with 0.06 ms time resolution.
