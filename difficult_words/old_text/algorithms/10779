Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff is a relatively frequent pathology and at times, in some phases, it is a disabling one: for this reason, numerous therapeutic options have been proposed. The authors propose an algorithm for the classification and treatment of calcific tendinitis and report their experience with arthroscopic treatment over a three-year period from 2001 to 2004. Based on the algorithm proposed, out of a total of 126 shoulders affected with calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff for which debridement was indicated, 106 us-guided percutaneous surgeries (EPT), and only 20 arthroscopies were performed. Arthroscopy is indicated, on the basis of the algorithm that we followed, in patients affected by chronic and persistent calcific tendinitis who did not benefit from the execution of previous types of non-surgical treatment for a period of at least 6 to 12 months. Shoulder instability was found to be present in 8 patients out of 20 treated arthroscopically. After arthroscopy, short- and medium-term results were always positive with the exception of one case that evolved into adhesive capsulitis. Based on an analysis of this series, we were able to confirm the usefulness and clinical applicability of an algorithm to classify and treat calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff; we also confirmed the role of arthroscopic treatment that in cases which did not respond to conservative procedures proved to be effective in resolving symptoms.
