Once-daily tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is a more convenient dosing regimen than thrice daily dosing. There are limited data on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile for once-daily tobramycin in patients with CF. The aim of this study was to define the PK parameters for once-daily tobramycin in children with CF and develop an algorithm for therapeutic drug monitoring dosing.

CF patients admitted to hospital were commenced on once-daily intravenous tobramycin (12 mg/kg/day) and ticarcillin/clavulinic acid. Serum tobramycin levels were taken at 30 min, 2-4 h and 12 h post dose. Data points for the PK model included: age, sex, weight, tobramycin dose, time of tobramycin doses and levels, tobramycin levels. WinNonMix was used to obtain the PK parameters.

Forty-four children with 86 admissions who were aged 9 months-20 years were included. A one-compartment intravenous infusion model with first order elimination kinetics produced the best model. Population parameters were: volume of distribution (V(d)) = 0.267 L/kg (95% confidence interval (CL) 0.260-0.272), clearance (CL) 0.103 L/kg/h (95% CI 0.098-0.107) and half-life (t(1/2)) 1.82 (95% CI 1.77-1.88) h. Once the population model was established post hoc analysis was used to calculate individual subject predictions. Plots of individual prediction curves agreed well with observed values.

This study has established an algorithm for routine monitoring of once-daily tobramycin in children with CF. Satisfactory serum levels of tobramycin were obtained with a dose of 12 mg/kg/day and a regimen algorithm that uses only one measurement to monitor the plasma concentration is suggested.
