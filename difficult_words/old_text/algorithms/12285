Because of rapid progress in genotyping techniques, many large-scale, genomewide disease-association studies are now under way. Typically, the disorders examined are multifactorial, and, therefore, researchers seeking association must consider interactions among loci and between loci and other factors. One of the challenges of large disease-association studies is obtaining accurate estimates of the significance of discovered associations. The linkage disequilibrium between SNPs makes the tests highly dependent, and dependency worsens when interactions are tested. The standard way of assigning significance (P value) is by a permutation test. Unfortunately, in large studies, it is prohibitively slow to compute low P values by this method. We present here a faster algorithm for accurately calculating low P values in case-control association studies. Unlike with several previous methods, we do not assume a specific distribution of the traits, given the genotypes. Our method is based on importance sampling and on accounting for the decay in linkage disequilibrium along the chromosome. The algorithm is dramatically faster than the standard permutation test. On data sets mimicking medium-to-large association studies, it speeds up computation by a factor of 5,000-100,000, sometimes reducing running times from years to minutes. Thus, our method significantly increases the problem-size range for which accurate, meaningful association results are attainable.
