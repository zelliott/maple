The onset and offset of sensory stimuli evoke transient changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that can be detected by linear and/or nonlinear analysis. However, there is presently no systematic procedure to quantify the brain-electrical-activity correlate of the presence of a stimulus (as opposed to its onset evoked potential). We describe a method for detecting a stimulus-related change in brain electrical activity that persists while the stimulus is present (presence effect). The method, which is based on phase-space embedding of the EEG time series followed by quantitative analysis of the recurrence plot of the embedded signal, was used to demonstrate the occurrence of a presence effect in separate groups of human subjects exposed to sound, a magnetic field, and light. Any form of law-governed dynamical activity induced in the EEG can be detected, particularly activity that is nonlinearly related to the stimulus. Salient mathematical features of the method were reproduced in a model EEG system containing known nonlinear determinism.
