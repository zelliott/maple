This paper deals with methods of reducing the total time required to acquire the projection data for a set of contiguous computed tomography (CT) images. Normally during the acquisition of a set of slices, the patient is held stationary during data collection and translated to the next axial location during an interscan delay. We demonstrate using computer simulations and scans of volunteers on a modified scanner how acceptable image quality is achieved if the patient translation time is overlapped with data acquisition. If the concurrent patient translation is ignored, structured artifacts significantly degrade resulting reconstructions. We present a number of weighting schemes for use with the conventional convolution/backprojection algorithm to reduce the structured artifacts through the use of projection modulation using the data from individual and multiple slices. We compare the methods with respect to structured artifacts, noise, resolution and to patient motion. Review of preliminary results by a panel of radiologists indicates that the residual image degradation is tolerable for selected applications when it is critical to acquire more slices in a patient breathing cycle than is possible with conventional scanning.
