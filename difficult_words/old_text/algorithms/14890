Despite the growing volume of data on primary nucleotide sequences, the regulatory regions remain a major puzzle with regard to their function. Numerous recognising programs considering a diversity of properties of regulatory regions have been developed. The system proposed here allows the specific contextual, conformational and physico-chemical properties to be revealed based on analysis of extended DNA regions.

The Internet-accessible computer system RegScan, designed to analyse the extended regulatory regions of eukaryotic genes, has been developed. The computer system comprises the following software: (i) programs for classification dividing a set of promoters into TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters and promoters with and without CpG islands; (ii) programs for constructing (a) nucleotide frequency profiles, (b) sequence complexity profiles and (c) profiles of conformational and physico-chemical properties; (iii) the program for constructing the sets of degenerate oligonucleotide motifs of a specified length; and (iv) the program searching for and visualising repeats in nucleotide sequences. The system has allowed us to demonstrate the following characteristic patterns of vertebrate promoter regions: the TATA box region is flanked by regions with an increased G+C content and increased bending stiffness, the TATA box content is asymmetric and promoter regions are saturated with both direct and inverted repeats.
