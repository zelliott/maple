Electrodiagnostic studies have a major role in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The parameters used in this regard include nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and compound nerve action potential (CNAP). In some individuals, recording sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and as a result NCV is impossible. This study aims at determining the numerical correlation between CNAP and NCV calculated through SNAP METHODS: NCV and CNAP in 100 hands of 50 electrophysiologically and clinically asymptomatic individuals and 100 hands of 70 patients with CTS were surveyed. The correlation between NCV and CNAP was determined using independent t-test and regression model.

The results indicated that there is a significant correlation between sex, group, CNAP and NCV statistically (P(value) < 0.05). Pearson correlation coefficient was -0.95. Agreement between NCV and CNAP was proved based on Bland Altman plot.

There is numerical correlation between NCV and CNAP that we can use it when we are not able to calculate NCV through SNAP.
