We propose a contour map segmentation method for laser scanning confocal microscopic (LSCM) biomedical images. In this method, an image is first segmented into sub-regions by contour map. Then the sub-regions are merged from top to bottom or from bottom to top, according to a segmentation criterion of intensity homogeneity. The merging procedures continue until no region needs to be merged. The advantage of this method is that the objects with wide intensity ranges and different intensity homogeneity can be segmented properly. In this paper, the region segmentation by contour map is first addressed. Next a region merging according to a segmentation criterion of intensity homogeneity is presented, and then the design of a linear intensity homogeneity segmentation criterion is introduced. Two examples of image segmentation by this method are given at the end of this paper.
