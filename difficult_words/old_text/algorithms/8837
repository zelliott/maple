Advances in organelle interactomics have led to new insights into organelle functions. In this study, we considered the common mitochondrial PIN of four evolutionarily distant eukaryotic species, namely Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. By comparative interactomics analysis of mitochondrial PINs in these organisms, five conserved modules were identified. Modules comprise the main mitochondrial tasks, including proteins involved in translation process, mitochondrial import inner membrane proteins, TCA cycle enzymes, mitochondrial electron transport chain, and metabolic enzymes. Furthermore, we reemphasize that subgraphs of network, i.e., motifs and themes, may represent evolutionarily conserved topological units which are biologically significant.
