This is the first reported study of ventricular activation patterns after cardiac transplantation, using electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI), a noninvasive method for electrophysiologic mapping. This study of ten patients reveals that transplanted hearts have unique ventricular activation patterns in sinus rhythm, activating early in the epicardial aspect of the anterior or inferior septum, with intact right and left bundle branch conduction. They have late activation with slowing of conduction near the right ventricular (RV) basal free wall, causing a mild QRS prolongation and an rSr' pattern in lead V1 of the ECG. PVCs arise from both endocardial and epicardial locations in both ventricles.
