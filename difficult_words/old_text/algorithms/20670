The authors wanted to determine whether contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) with colonic opacification is an accurate tool to triage hemodynamically stable victims of stab wounds to the flank and back.

One hundred forty-five consecutive patients were categorized as low-risk ( penetration superficial to the deep fascia) or high-risk (penetration beyond the deep fascia) based on CE-CT findings.

There were no significant differences in admission vital signs, Glasgow Coma Scale, or complete blood counts between low- and high-risk groups. None of the 92 low-risk patients required surgery or had sequelae. Six of the 53 high-risk patients underwent surgery, 2 based on initial CE-CT, 4 due to evolving clinical signs. The CE-CT correctly predicted surgical findings in all cases.

Hemodynamically stable patients with stab wounds to the back and/or flank can be successfully triaged based on CE-CT findings. Low-risk patients may be discharged immediately. High-risk patients may have a discharge decision implemented at 24 hours.
