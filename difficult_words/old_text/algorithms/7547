Quality of service (QoS) and, in particular, reliability and a bounded low latency are essential attributes of safety-critical wireless systems for medical applications. However, wireless links are typically prone to bursts of errors, with characteristics which vary over time.We propose a wireless system suitable for real-time remote patient monitoring in which the necessary reliability and guaranteed latency are both achieved by an efficient error control scheme. We have paired an example remote electrocardiography application to this wireless system. We also developed a tool chain that uses a formal description of the proposed wireless medical system architecture in the architecture analysis and design language to assess various combinations of system parameters: we can determine the QoS in terms of packet-delivery ratio and the service latency, and also the size of jitter buffer required for seamless ECG monitoring. A realistic assessment, based on data from the MIT-BIT arrhythmia database, shows that the proposed wireless system can achieve an appropriate level of QoS for real-time ECG monitoring if link-level error control is correctly implemented. Additionally, we present guidelines for the design of energy-efficient link-level error control, derived from energy data, obtained from simulations.
