We demonstrate the feasibility of using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to detect and image an electro-kinetic response: electric-field induced optical changes (EIOC) in soft biological tissues. A low-frequency electric field was applied to ex vivo samples of porcine heart tissues, while OCT signals were acquired continuously. Experimental results show that the amplitude of the OCT signal change is proportional to the amplitude and inversely proportional to the frequency of the applied electric field. We show that the nonconductive component of the sample was eliminated in the normalized EIOC image. To the best our knowledge, this is the first time a two-dimensional image related to the electro-kinetic response of soft tissues is obtained with depth resolution. Since electro-kinetic properties can change during cancerogenesis, EIOC imaging can potentially be used for cancer detection.
