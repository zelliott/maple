The proteins structure can be mainly classified into four classes: all-alpha, all-beta, alpha/beta, and alpha + beta protein according to their chain fold topologies. For the purpose of predicting the protein structural class, a new predicting algorithm, in which the increment of diversity combines with Quadratic Discriminant analysis, is presented to study and predict protein structural class. On the basis of the concept of the pseudo amino acid composition (Chou, Proteins: Struct Funct Genet 2001, 43, 246; Erratum: Proteins Struct Funct Genet 2001, 44, 60), 400 dipeptide components and 20 amino acid composition are, respectively, selected as parameters of diversity source. Total of 204 nonhomologous proteins constructed by Chou (Chou, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1999, 264, 216) are used for training and testing the predictive model. The predicted results by using the pseudo amino acids approach as proposed in this paper can remarkably improve the success rates, and hence the current method may play a complementary role to other existing methods for predicting protein structural classification.
