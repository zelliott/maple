Baseline wandering in electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the biggest interferences in visualization and computerized detection of waveforms (especially ST-segment) based on threshold decision. A new method based on wavelet transform, QRS barycenter fitting and regional method was proposed in this paper. Firstly, wavelet transform as a coarse correction was used to remove the baseline wandering, whose frequency bands were non-overlapping with that of ST-segment. Secondly, QRS barycenter fitting was applied as a detailed correction. The third, the regional method was used to transfer baseline to zero. Finally, the method in this paper was proved to perform better than filtering and function fitting methods in baseline wandering correction after the long-term ST database (LTST) verification. In addition, the proposed method is simple and easy to carry out, and in current use.
