In acute myocardial infarction, it is of great value to identify the infarct-related artery and the site of occlusion in a coronary artery (proximal versus distal). This study assessed the diagnostic value of two previously published electrocardiographic algorithms to identify the infarct-related artery and the site of occlusion in anterior and inferior acute myocardial infarction.

We studied retrospectively a group of 88 patients with a first myocardial infarction. We determined the infarct-related artery using the electrocardiographic algorithms on the electrocardiogram at the time of admission and compared these results with the angiographically determined infarct-related artery. The best electrocardiographic algorithm could determine the infarct-related artery in an inferior myocardial infarction as the left circumflex coronary artery and as the proximal and distal right coronary artery with a sensitivity of 63%, 67% and 80%, respectively, and a specificity of 100%, 82% and 69%, respectively. One algorithm was unable to diagnose a left circumflex coronary artery occlusion. In an anterior myocardial infarction the best electrocardiographic algorithm could determine the infarct-related artery as the proximal and distal left anterior descending coronary artery with a sensitivity of 85% and 80%, respectively, and with a specificity of 77% and 82%, respectively.

In acute myocardial infarction the use of electrocardiographic algorithms is helpful to predict the site of occlusion and can play a crucial role in the care of patients.
