Advances in peritoneal dialysis (PD) technology and better understanding of peritoneal solute transport have expanded the application of this therapy to a larger segment of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) community. However, adequate patient selection remains an important issue in assuring success of this therapy. Many of the causes for high technique failure with PD can be traced back to poor initial patient selection. The success of PD depends on: (1) the patient's general health and preexisting comorbid conditions, (2) the patient's ability to provide self-dialysis or to procure an adequate partner, and (3) matching therapy to the patient's individual needs.
