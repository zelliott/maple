During one year syphilis serology was systematically studied, using the TPHA and VDRL tests, in each of the 1,279 patients hospitalized in an Internal Medicine department. In all cases diagnosis and treatment were analyzed by means of a decision algorithm. Only 37 patients were found to have one or both serological tests positive. No evolutive syphilis was observed, and none of these positive tests was contributive to the diagnosis of another disease. Only 14 patients received a specific antibiotic treatment on the grounds that their positive test confirmed a late asymptomatic syphilis. We conclude that systematic syphilis serological tests are not useful in an Internal Medicine department, except in some patients epidemiologically at high risk of syphilis.
