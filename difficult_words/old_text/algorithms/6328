Frequency-domain photon migration measurements across the surface of a tissue-mimicking, semi-infinite phantom are acquired via an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) detection system and used in conjunction with the diffusion approximation to determine the optical properties. The absorption and reduced scattering coefficients are determined least accurately when relative measurements of average light intensity I(rel)dc are employed either alone or in a combination with relative modulation amplitude data I(rel)ac and/or relative phase shift data theta(rel). The absorption and reduced scattering coefficients are found accurate to within 15 and 11%, respectively, of the values obtained from standard single-pixel measurements when theta(rel) measurements are employed alone or in combination with I(rel)ac data.
