We created a prediction model to be used in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts as a decision tool to omit futile CPR attempts and to save resources.

In this post hoc analysis, we assessed predictive parameters for neurological recovery after successful CPR. The original study was designed as a blinded, randomized, prospective, controlled, multicenter clinical trial.

We identified 1166 prehospital cardiac arrest patients being treated with advanced cardiac life support. Seven hundred eighty-six of 1166 patients (67.4%) died at the scene and 380 of 1166 (32.6%) were brought to the hospital. Two hundred sixty-five of 1166 patients (22.7%) died in the hospital. One hundred fifteen of 1166 (9.8%) were discharged from the hospital and 92 of the 115 patients (80%) could be followed-up. Good cerebral performance was regained by 54% of discharged patients (50 of 92 patients). In 46% of patients (42/92), unconsciousness or severe disability remained. Ventricular fibrillation was more likely to have occurred in patients with good neurological recovery (42/50 = 84.0%), whereas asystole was more likely in patients with poor neurological recovery (9/42 = 21.4%). A score was developed to predict the probability of death using logistic regression analysis. Predicting death in the hospital revealed a sensitivity of 99.8% (953/955), but only a specificity of 2.9% (3/104; threshold 0.5). Predicting survival until discharge from the hospital revealed a sensitivity of 99% (103/104), but only a specificity of 8% (72/955; threshold 0.99). A receiver operating characteristic curve yielded an area under the curve of 0.795 (0.751-0.839) at a confidence interval of 95%.

For out-of-hospital patients with cardiac arrest, parameters documented in the field did not allow accurate prediction of hospital survival.
