Cyclical electrical field flow fractionation (CyElFFF) is a variation on electrical field flow fractionation (ElFFF) where cyclical electrical fields are used instead of steady DC fields to increase the effective field experienced by particles in the flow channel. Even though the effective field increases more than 20-fold compared to normal ElFFF, the retention and resolution in CyElFFF has not been shown to be better than in ElFFF. In this paper we report how one can optimize operational parameters in CyElFFF to obtain good retention and resolution in CyElFFF. The effects of offset voltage, frequency, flowrate, concentration of particles and sample size on retention, resolution and retained peak/void peak ratio have been observed. The results obtained from these experiments were analyzed and suggestions have been made to improve both retention and resolution. A 4-fold improvement in retention without a significant increase in band broadening is reported.
