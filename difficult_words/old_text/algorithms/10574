We present an analytical expression for the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of a wet granular gas. The influence of the liquid is modeled by a hysteretic interaction force. For the dilute limit (two-particle collisions only), we find a simple expression accounting for the contribution of both the scattering states and the bound states in arbitrary dimensions. It is shown that the system is significantly more chaotic than a gas of (dry) hard spheres, as reflected by a pronounced increase of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.
