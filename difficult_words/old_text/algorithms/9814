Adhesion can be quantified by measuring the distance between the interacting surfaces. Reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM), with its ability to measure inter-surface distances under water with nanometric precision and milliseconds time resolution, is ideally suited to studying the dynamics of adhesion in soft systems. Recent technical developments, which include innovative image analysis and the use of multi-coloured illumination, have led to renewed interest in this technique. Unambiguous quantitative measurements have been achieved for colloidal beads and model membranes, thus revealing new insights and applications. Quantification of data from cells shows exciting prospects. Herein, we review the basic principles and recent developments of RICM applied to studies of dynamical adhesion processes in soft matter and cell biology and provide practical hints to potential users.
