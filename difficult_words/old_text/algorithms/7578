The cascade classifier is a usual approach in object detection based on vision, since it successively rejects negative occurrences, e.g., background images, in a cascade structure, keeping the processing time suitable for on-the-fly applications. On the other hand, similar to other classifier ensembles, cascade classifiers are likely to have high Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension, which may lead to overfitting the training data. Therefore, this work aims at improving the generalization capacity of the cascade classifier by controlling its complexity, which depends on the model of their classifier stages, the number of stages, and the feature space dimension of each stage, which can be controlled by integrating the parameter setting of the feature extractor (in our case an image descriptor) into the maximum-margin framework of support vector machine training, as will be shown in this paper. Moreover, to set the number of cascade stages, bounds on the false positive rate (FP) and on the true positive rate (TP) of cascade classifiers are derived based on a VC-style analysis. These bounds are applied to compose an enveloping receiver operating curve (EROC), i.e., a new curve in the TPâ€“FP space in which each point is an ordered pair of upper bound on the FP and lower bound on the TP. The optimal number of cascade stages is forecasted by comparing EROCs of cascades with different numbers of stages.
