We describe how implicit surface representations can be used to solve fundamental problems in brain imaging. This kind of representation is not only natural following the state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms reported in the literature to extract the different brain tissues, but it is also, as shown in this paper, the most appropriate one from the computational point of view. Examples are provided for finding constrained special curves on the cortex, such as sulcal beds, regularizing surface-based measures, such as cortical thickness, and for computing warping fields between surfaces such as the brain cortex. All these result from efficiently solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and variational problems on surfaces represented in implicit form. The implicit framework avoids the need to construct intermediate mappings between 3-D anatomical surfaces and parametric objects such planes or spheres, a complex step that introduces errors and is required by many other cortical processing approaches.
