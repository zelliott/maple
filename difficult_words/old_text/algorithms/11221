Patients with seizures can present a common and challenging problem for medical providers in the deployed environment. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of controlled clinical trial data that can be used to formulate evidence-based guidelines for management. In an attempt to aid the non-neurologist deployed provider in the care of patients presenting with seizures, the authors describe two cases illustrative of common presentations. Thereafter, the authors address many facets of the management questions commonly raised by such cases and offer suggestions regarding such issues as initial pharmacologic management, the need for admission and evacuation, seizure precautions, differentiation from syncope and nonepileptic seizures, addressing patient and command concerns regarding evaluation and duty restrictions, and obtaining online management assistance.
