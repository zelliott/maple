In speckle-tracking-based myocardial strain imaging, large interframe/volume peak-systolic strains cause peak hopping artifacts separating the highest correlation coefficient peak from the true peak. A correlation coefficient filter was previously designed to minimize peak hopping artifacts. For large strains, however, the correlation coefficient filter must follow the strain distribution to remove peak hopping effectively. This processing usually means interpolation and high computational load. To reduce the computational burden, a narrow band approximation using phase rotation is developed in this paper to facilitate correlation coefficient filtering. Correlation coefficients are first phase rotated to increase coherence, then filtered. Rotated phase angles are determined by the local strain and spatial position. This form of correlation coefficient filtering enhances true correlation coefficient peaks in large strain applications if decorrelation due to deformation does not completely destroy the coherence among neighboring correlation coefficients. The assumed strain used in the filter can also deviate from the true strain and still be effective. Further improvement in displacement estimation can be expected by combining correlation coefficient filtering with a new Viterbi-based displacement estimator.
