A method based on the infrared hollow waveguide sampler was developed for sensing chlorophenols in aqueous solutions. This sampler was constructed by coating a suitable hydrophobic film onto the inner surface of an infrared hollow waveguide. By passing the aqueous solution through the hollow waveguide sampler, analytes can be absorbed into the hydrophobic layer. The adsorbed analytes can be sensed later by using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. Six hydrophobic polymers were investigated for their performance in conjunction with the infrared hollow waveguide sampler for the detection of chlorophenols. Results indicated that poly(acrylonitrile-co-butadiene) was a most suitable hydrophobic material for absorption of chlorophenols in aqueous solutions. To further increase the detection sensitivity, factors such as sampling flow rate, sampling time, and thickness of the hydrophobic film were also investigated. Results indicated that the infrared signals were similar in the examined flow rates (2-30 mL/min), but that a higher flow rate tended to produce a higher analytical signal. Fast detection speed was an advantage of this method for the detection of chlorophenols, and the sampling/detection time can be <10 min. In addition, analytical signals were nearly proportional to the thickness of the hydrophobic film coating the inside of the hollow waveguide. With the optimal conditions found in this work, detection limits based on 3 times the peak-to-peak noise level were around 300 ppb for the chlorophenols examined. A high degree of linearity in the standard curves was also observed for this method in the concentration range of 10-100 ppm. The typical regression coefficients were >0.994 for the chlorophenols examined.
