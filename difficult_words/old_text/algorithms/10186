Irrigation and debridement (I&D) is an attractive treatment alternative for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Irrigation and debridement failure rates average 64% (range, 10.5%-84%) and may be associated with causative organism type and virulence. The study objective was to compare revision rates for PJI caused by streptococcal organisms to other organisms treated with I&D. A multicenter retrospective cohort study of 200 consecutive PJIs treated with I&D was performed. Failure was defined as reoperation for PJI. Failure rate for streptococcal infections was 65% (20/31) compared with 71% (84/119) for other organisms. Failure rate for sensitive Staphylococcus was 72% (48/67) compared with a 76% (22/29) failure rate for resistant Staphylococcus. These results indicate that eradication rates of I&D for a streptococcal PJI are comparable with other causative organisms. Irrigation and debridement should play a limited role in the PJI treatment algorithm regardless of organism type.
