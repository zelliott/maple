Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children includes a spectrum of respiratory disorders with significant morbidities. Diagnosis of OSAS is based on clinical suspicion, history, and physical findings, and confirmation is made by polysomnography. There has been significant progress in recent years in technologies available for diagnosis of OSAS since the consensus statement of the American Thoracic Society in 1996. The current review describes methodologies that are available today for assessment and diagnosis of OSAS in children and summarizes the most recent recommendations of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force regarding scoring sleep-related respiratory events in children.
