The recent contributions to the mechanisms of regulation of IgE by cytokines has produced development of kits that are usable in IFN gamma in atopic dermatitis where we have fixed a significant basal level in contrast to a reference group, though there is no possibility of making a modification in asthma. However, this seems to us to be logical since this change of IFN gamma was studied in peripheral blood when the study should be made of broncho-alveolar lavage in asthma. The assay kits for IL4 lack performance and "realism" in their threshold level of detection. This study has also given comparison of the variation of the two cytokines in comparison with total and specific IgE.
