In this paper we propose a framework for detecting health patterns based on non-wearable sensor sequence similarity and natural language processing (NLP). In TigerPlace, an aging in place facility from Columbia, MO, we deployed 47 sensor networks together with a nursing electronic health record (EHR) system to provide early illness recognition. The proposed framework utilizes sensor sequence similarity and NLP on EHR nursing comments to automatically notify the physician when health problems are detected. The reported methodology is inspired by genomic sequence annotation using similarity algorithms such as Smith Waterman (SW). Similarly, for each sensor sequence, we associate health concepts extracted from the nursing notes using Metamap, a NLP tool provided by Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Since sensor sequences, unlike genomics ones, have an associated time dimension we propose a temporal variant of SW (TSW) to account for time. The main challenges presented by our framework are finding the most suitable time sequence similarity and aggregation of the retrieved UMLS concepts. On a pilot dataset from three Tiger Place residents, with a total of 1685 sensor days and 626 nursing records, we obtained an average precision of 0.64 and a recall of 0.37.
