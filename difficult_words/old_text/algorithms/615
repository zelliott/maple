In this paper, we study two recent theoretical models--a population-sizing model and a convergence model--and examine their assumptions to gain insights into the conditions under which selecto-recombinative GAs work well. We use these insights to formulate several design rules to develop competent GAs for practical problems. To test the usefulness of the design rules, we consider as a case study the map-labeling problem, an NP-hard problem from cartography. We compare the predictions of the theoretical models with the actual performance of the GA for the map-labeling problem. Experiments show that the predictions match the observed scale-up behavior of the GA, thereby strengthening our claim that the design rules can guide the design of competent selecto-recombinative GAs for realistic problems.
