The QT pacemaker is a rate modulated pacemaker that uses the evoked QT interval as an indicator to determine its optimal pacing rate. Despite the generally favorable clinical results with this form of pacing, some flaws in the system have been reported, such as the frequently observed rather slow initial response of the pacing rate to physical exercise, and the phenomenon of oscillation of the heart rate. These problems can be attributed to the rate adaptive algorithm used in the current QT pacemaker. Recently, in a reexamination of the relationship between evoked QT interval and pacing rate, a curvilinear relationship between these parameters has been demonstrated. As a result, a new algorithm has been developed for the next generation of the QT pacemaker. Before this new algorithm was implemented in new implantable devices, it was evaluated in a multicenter clinical investigation, with emphasis on the initial response of the pacing rate to exercise. This study was carried out by means of special software in the programmer of the QT pacemaker. By employing real-time bidirectional telemetry, it was possible to submit the study population, consisting of 37 patients with implanted QT pacemakers of the current generation, to identical exercise tests. Comparing these exercise tests, it appears that a considerable gain in speed of response to exercise can be achieved by using the same sensor with a faster reacting, nonlinear rate adaptive algorithm.
