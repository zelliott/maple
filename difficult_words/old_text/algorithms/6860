Black-blood magnetic resonance angiography (black-blood MRA) could be considered an alternative to time-of-flight (TOF) MRA. In the cases of irregular flow conditions, it could be more advantageous than time-of-flight (TOF) MRA in providing vessel definition and delineation. Proton-density weighted (PDW) multi-slab three-dimensional fast spin-echo (3DFSE) sequences have been used to generate black-blood MRA. Unfortunately, multi-planar reformatted 3DFSE images often exhibit slab boundary artifacts (intensity variation in the slice direction) which create dark bands interfering with the identification of dark blood vessels. Furthermore, PDW measurements fail to darken slow flowing or re-circulating blood in some circumstances. In this work, a dual-contrast multi-slab 3DFSE acquisition is used to approach black-blood MRA. This sequence simultaneously provides proton-density weighted (PDW) and T(2)-weighted (T2W) images which can be further integrated together to produce black-blood angiograms gained by utilizing complementary contrast and supplementary vascular information. Additionally, a technique of suppressing slab boundary artifact has been incorporated into this sequence. This approach provides: i) good SNR measurement of anatomy for the PDW image and optimal black-blood angiograms from the T2W image; ii) scan time efficiency (dual-contrast image sets plus black-blood angiograms within one acquisition); and iii) suppressed slab boundary artifacts as well as minimized mis-registration error.
