In this study, a direct, fast image reconstruction algorithm, based on the fact that equipotential lines are perpendicular to current lines in a volume conductor, is proposed for magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MR-EIT). The proposed technique is evaluated both on simulated and measured data for conductor and insulator objects.
