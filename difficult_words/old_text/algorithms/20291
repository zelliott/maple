Successful repair of bilateral cleft lip requires attention to the soft-tissue anomalies of the lip and nose and the hard-tissue defects of the maxilla. An algorithm for the management of the infant with bilateral cleft lip is presented. A multidisciplinary approach that uses lip adhesion and passive alveolar molding plates to set the stage for subsequent definitive lip and columellar reconstruction is discussed. This approach differs from most others because of reliance on the mucosal circulation of the prolabium.
