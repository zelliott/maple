We sought to analyze the predictive value of anthropometric, clinical and epidemiological parameters in the identification of patients with suspected OSA, and their relationship with apnoea/hypopnoea respiratory events during sleep. We studied retrospectively 433 patients with OSA, 361 men (83.37%) and 72 women (16.63%), with an average age of +/-47, standard deviation +/-11.10 years (range 18-75 years). The study variables for all of the patients were age, sex, spirometry, neck circumference, body mass index (BMI), Epworth sleepiness scale, nasal examination, pharyngeal examination, collapsibility of the pharynx (MÃ¼ller Manoeuvre), and apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI). Age, neck circumference, BMI, Epworth sleepiness scale, pharyngeal examination and pharyngeal collapse were the significant variables. Of the patients, 78% were correctly classified, with a sensitivity of 74.6% and a specificity of 66.3%. We found a direct relationship between the variables analysed and AHI. Based on these results, we obtained the following algorithm to calculate the prediction of AHI for a new patient: AHI = -12.04 + 0.36 neck circumference +2.2286 pharyngeal collapses (MM) + 0.1761 Epworth + 0.0017 BMI x age + 1.1949 pharyngeal examinations. The ratio variance in the number of respiratory events explained by the model was 33% (r2 = 0.33). The variables given in the algorithm are the best ones for predicting the number of respiratory events during sleep in patients studied for suspected OSA. The algorithm proposed may be a good screening method to the identification of patients with OSA.
