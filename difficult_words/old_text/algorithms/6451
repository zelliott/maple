This report presents the Apertureless Scanning Optical Near-Field Microscope as a powerful tool for the characterization of modern optoelectronic and photonic components with sub-wavelength resolution. We present an overview of the results we obtained in our laboratory over the past few years. By significant examples, it is shown that this specific probe microscopy allows for in situ local quantitative study of semiconductor lasers in operation, integrated optical waveguides produced by ion exchange (single channel or Y junction), and photonic structures.
