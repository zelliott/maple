The low dose rate CDC-type miniature cylindrical 137Cs sources are available, with one or three active beads, for use in source trains in automatic and manual afterloading systems for gynecological brachytherapy. Absolute dose rate distributions in water have been calculated around these sources using the Monte Carlo GEANT3 code and they are presented as conventional two-dimensional Cartesian lookup tables. The AAPM Task Group 43 formalism for dose calculation has been also applied. The dose rate constant obtained for the one bead source is lambda = 1.113 +/- 0.003cGyh(-1) U(-1), and the value for the three bead source is A= 1.103 +/- 0.003cGyh(-1) U(-1). Finally, for the treatment planning systems based on Sievert-type algorithms, the attenuation coefficients that best reproduce Monte Carlo dose rate distribution are given.
