We have presented dynamic phase transition features and stationary-state behavior of a ferrimagnetic small nanoparticle system with a core-shell structure. By means of detailed Monte Carlo simulations, a complete picture of the phase diagrams and magnetization profiles has been presented and the conditions for the occurrence of a compensation point T(comp) in the system have been investigated. According to NÃ©el nomenclature, the magnetization curves of the particle have been found to obey P-type, N-type and Q-type classification schemes under certain conditions. Much effort has been devoted to investigating the hysteretic response of the particle, and we observed the existence of triple hysteresis loop behavior, which originates from the existence of a weak ferromagnetic core coupling J(c)/J(sh), as well as a strong antiferromagnetic interface exchange interaction J(int)/J(sh). Most of the calculations have been performed for a particle in the presence of oscillating fields of very high frequencies and high amplitudes in comparison with exchange interactions, which resembles a magnetic system under the influence of ultrafast switching fields. Particular attention has also been paid to the influence of the particle size on the thermal and magnetic properties, as well as magnetic features such as coercivity, remanence and the compensation temperature of the particle. We have found that, in the presence of ultrafast switching fields, the particle may exhibit a dynamic phase transition from paramagnetic to a dynamically ordered phase with increasing ferromagnetic shell thickness.
