Faster periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER) diffusion-weighted imaging acquisitions, such as Turboprop and X-prop, remain subject to phase errors inherent to a gradient echo readout, which ultimately limits the applied turbo factor (number of gradient echoes between each pair of radiofrequency refocusing pulses) and, thus, scan time reductions. This study introduces a new phase correction to Turboprop, called Turboprop+. This technique employs calibration blades, which generate 2-D phase error maps and are rotated in accordance with the data blades, to correct phase errors arising from off-resonance and system imperfections. The results demonstrate that with a small increase in scan time for collecting calibration blades, Turboprop+ had a superior immunity to the off-resonance-related artifacts when compared to standard Turboprop and recently proposed X-prop with the high turbo factor (turbo factor = 7). Thus, low specific absorption rate and short scan time can be achieved in Turboprop+ using a high turbo factor, whereas off-resonance related artifacts are minimized.
