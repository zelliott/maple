Methotrexate (MTX) use is associated with hepatic fibrosis in psoriasis patients. To monitor this serial liver biopsies were performed. The Fibroscan and the Fibrotest are two novel, non-invasive methods that might be able to assess MTX-induced hepatic fibrosis.

Evaluating the accuracy and feasibility of the Fibroscan and Fibrotest to detect significant MTX-induced liver fibrosis in psoriasis patients.

We assessed 24 psoriasis patients who had a recent liver biopsy during MTX use. The results from the Fibroscan and Fibrotest were compared with liver histology.

Fibroscan values (n=20) ranged between 3.3 and 18.4 kPa (median value 6.4 kPa) and correctly identified 88% of the patients without significant liver fibrosis (Metavir score <F2, Fibroscan</=7.1 kPa). The Fibrotest identified 83% of the patients with significant liver fibrosis (Metavir score >/=F2, Fibrotest >0.31).

In this population, Fibrotest accurately predicted the presence of significant liver fibrosis while the Fibroscan accurately predicted the absence of significant liver fibrosis in MTX users. This suggests that a combination of Fibrotest and Fibroscan should prospectively be evaluated in monitoring and detecting significant MTX-induced liver fibrosis in psoriasis patients.
