Manganas et al. (Reports, 9 November 2007, p. 980) reported the discovery of a biomarker specific for neural progenitor cells detectable using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A new algorithm was developed to extract the biomarker from noisy in vivo data. We question how this algorithm was validated, because the biomarker overlaps with peaks from nonspecific lipid signals.
