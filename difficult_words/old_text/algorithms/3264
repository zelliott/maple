In this paper, synchronization between two discrete-time networks, called "outer synchronization" for brevity, is theoretically and numerically studied. First, a sufficient criterion for this outer synchronization between two coupled discrete-time networks which have the same connection topologies is derived analytically. Numerical examples are also given and they are in line with the theoretical analysis. Additionally, numerical investigations of two coupled networks which have different connection topologies are analyzed as well. The involved numerical results show that these coupled networks with different connection matrices can reach synchronization.
