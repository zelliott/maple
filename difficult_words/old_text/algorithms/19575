The thermoluminescence (TL) intensity in different materials is usually a monotonic increasing function of the dose, which quite often reaches a saturation value. In several materials, however, non-monotonic dose dependence has been observed. The TL intensity reached a maximum at a certain dose and decreased at higher ones. Some authors refer to this effect as 'radiation damage'. In the present work, we show that the non-monotonic dependence can easily be demonstrated to result from competition between transitions model with two trapping states and two kinds of recombination centres. Two kinds of competition are considered. One in which competition during excitation dominates, the filling of the active luminescence centre is non-monotonic, and the resulting TL is non-monotonic. In the other, the filling of traps and centres is monotonically increasing, but the competition during heating causes TL intensity to reach a maximum and decline at higher doses.
