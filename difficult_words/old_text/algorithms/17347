Pressure ulceration and bacterial superinfection are main risk factors for the diabetic foot. Surgical interventions for prophylaxis and treatment of infection are demanded. The aim of emergency surgery to treat infection is conservation of as much foot as possible. Therapeutic strategies and an algorithm are established for definite treatment of the infected diabetic foot: primary treatment of infection--arterial revascularization--amputation--orthopedic shoesupply.
