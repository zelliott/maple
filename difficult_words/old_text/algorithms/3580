Phase contrast x-ray imaging of small animal lungs reveals a speckled intensity pattern not seen in other tissues, making the lungs highly visible in comparison to other organs. Although bearing a superficial resemblance to alveoli, the cause of this speckle has not been established. With a view to determining the mechanism for the formation of speckle, this paper details the results of propagation-based phase contrast experiments performed on mice lungs, together with packed glass microspheres used to emulate lung tissue. These experimental studies are compared to numerical simulations, based on wave propagation techniques. We find that speckle arises from focusing effects, with multiple alveoli acting as aberrated compound refractive lenses. Both experiments and modelling suggest that this speckle-formation phenomenon may lead to better screening methods for human lungs than conventional radiography.
