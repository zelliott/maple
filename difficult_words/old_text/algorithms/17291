This paper addresses the problem of detecting and estimating latency changes in evoked potentials (EP's). EP's have been widely used to quantify neurological system properties. Transient and time-varying changes in latency may indicate impending neurological injury. Traditional time averaging and correlation methods for EP latency estimation are inefficient under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and/or strong periodic interference conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive phase spectral time delay estimation method to detect and estimate the time-varying latency changes when both the SNR and the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) are low. A theoretical analysis and computer simulation demonstrate that the proposed method can track the time-varying latency changes effectively and accurately when both the SNR and the SIR are as low as -5 dB. The method is also suitable for real time detection and estimation of the latency changes.
