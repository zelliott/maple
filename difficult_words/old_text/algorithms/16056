As an aid to the interpretation of functional images, cross-modality coregistration of functional and anatomical images has grown rapidly. Various ways of easily interpreting and visualising coregistered images have previously been investigated; for their display, an intensity-weighted temporally alternating method is used. For brain images, geometric registration involves the automatic alignment method, using the head scalp boundary extracted from the sinogram of a PET emission scan and a surface-matching algorithm; images of the chest or abdomen are registered semi-automatically using a paired point matching algorithm. For the simultaneous display of geometrically registered images, rapid image switching is applied; both images are written with independent colour scales. The rapidly alternating display of two images, synchronised with monitor scanning, induces the fusion of images in the human visual perception system. The accuracy of registration of PET and MRI images is within 2 mm for two point sets. A resulting image is intensified by weighting the display time and/or controlling the intensity map of each image with the degree of interest. This method may be useful for the interpretation and visualisation of coregistered images.
