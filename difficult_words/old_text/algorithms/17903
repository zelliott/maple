The naked eye observation of cream cheese confocal scanning laser microscopy images only provides qualitative information about its microstructure. Because those products are dense dairy gels, confocal scanning laser microscopy images of 2 different cream cheeses may appear close. Quantitative image analysis is then necessary to compensate for human eye deficiency (e.g., lack of precision, subjectivity). Two kinds of quantitative image analysis were performed in this study: high-order statistical methods and grayscale mathematical morphology. They were applied to study the microstructure of 3 different cream cheeses (same manufacturing process, same dry matter content, but different fat and protein contents). Advantages and drawbacks of both methods are reviewed. The way they may be used to describe cream cheese microstructure is also presented.
