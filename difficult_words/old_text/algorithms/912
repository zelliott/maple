Pulmonary artery (PA) catheter pressure measurements are a primary means of assessing the cardiac output status of critically ill patients. Critical care nurses are responsible for obtaining these measurements accurately; yet preliminary studies demonstrate that critical care nurses have difficulty making reliable and valid PA catheter measurements. Nurses in critical care need to insure the accuracy of the PA measurements they obtain through the use of a systematic measurement process.
