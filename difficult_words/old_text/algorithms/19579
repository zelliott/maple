We have developed a system to irradiate samples and record radioluminescence (RL), optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), and thermoluminescence (TL) at temperatures ranging from -150 degrees C to 200 degrees C. The system consists of a cryostat, an irradiation/stimulation unit fitted with an X-ray tube (40 kV Moxtek) and a quartz window for optical stimulation, and a detection unit that utilises a photomultiplier tube and an interchangeable filter pack. Experiments have been conducted with quartz and albite (a feldspar). TL and OSL experiments show that several optically sensitive trapping states are stable below -50 degrees C. In addition, an increase in OSL is seen as the OSL stimulation temperature is lowered below -50 degrees C, and an increase in RL is apparent as the temperature is lowered during irradiation. This indicates that not only are optically sensitive low temperature traps present but that luminescence becomes more efficient at low temperatures.
