To evaluate the clinical outcome and patency rates after iliac artery angioplasty and primary stenting using a noninvasive surveillance protocol that includes duplex ultrasonography.

Sixty-seven patients (64 men; mean age 61 +/- 9 years, range 45-83) underwent stenting of 84 iliac systems for claudication (63%), rest pain (9%), tissue loss (20%), or failing lower limb bypass graft (8%). The surveillance algorithm included aortoiliac duplex scanning within 1 month and serial limb pressure measurements and femoral artery waveform analyses during follow-up. Iliac systems with a peak systolic velocity >300 cm/s and velocity ratio >2.0 by duplex and/or symptomatic or hemodynamic deterioration were considered failing and an indication for angiography.

During intermediate-term follow-up ranging to 36 months (mean 12), life table primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates for the treated iliac systems were 78%, 90%, and 98%, respectively, at 18 months. Assisted primary iliac system patency at 18 months was significantly worse in the 20 (24%) limbs having an outflow bypass done with or prior to iliac stenting (83% versus 100% without bypass, p = 0.01). Indirect clinical indicators found 17 (20%) suspected failing iliac systems, in which duplex imaging correctly identified 5 of 6 recurrent iliac stenoses and facilitated secondary endovascular intervention. Three (4%) stent occlusions occurred in the treated iliac systems despite surveillance.

Duplex surveillance after iliac stenting localizes failing inflow segments, optimizes assisted patency of the treated iliac system, and possesses greatest utility in patients with multilevel occlusive disease and outflow reconstructions.
