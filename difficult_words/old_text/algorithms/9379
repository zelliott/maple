T-cell recognition of peptide/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a prerequisite for cellular immunity. Recently, there has been an influx of bioinformatics tools to facilitate the identification of T-cell epitopes to specific MHC alleles. This article examines existing computational strategies for the study of peptide/MHC interactions. The most important bioinformatics tools and methods with relevance to the study of peptide/MHC interactions have been reviewed. We have also provided guidelines for predicting antigenic peptides based on the availability of existing experimental data.
