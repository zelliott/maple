Identifying the genes that change their expressions between two conditions (such as normal versus cancer) is a crucial task that can help in understanding the causes of diseases. Differential networking has emerged as a powerful approach to detect the changes in network structures and to identify the differentially connected genes among two networks. However, existing differential network-based methods primarily depend on pairwise comparisons of the genes based on their connectivity. Therefore, these methods cannot capture the essential topological changes in the network structures. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, DiffRank, which ranks the genes based on their contribution to the differences between the two networks. To achieve this goal, we define two novel structural scoring measures: a local structure measure (differential connectivity) and a global structure measure (differential betweenness centrality). These measures are optimized by propagating the scores through the network structure and then ranking the genes based on these propagated scores. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffRank on synthetic and real datasets. For the synthetic datasets, we developed a simulator for generating synthetic differential scale-free networks, and we compared our method with existing methods. The comparisons show that our algorithm outperforms these existing methods. For the real datasets, we apply the proposed algorithm on several gene expression datasets and demonstrate that the proposed method provides biologically interesting results.
