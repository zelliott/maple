Precise channel-to-channel registration is a prerequisite for effective exploitation of passive polarimetric imagery. In this paper, the Cramer-Rao bound is employed to determine the limits of registration precision in the presence of scene polarization diversity, channel noise, and random translational registration errors between channels. The effects of misregistration on Stokes image estimation are also explored in depth. The derived bound is then used to determine when joint estimation is preferable to externally provided registration correction. Finally, case studies are presented for polarization insensitive imagery (a special case) and linear polarization imaging systems with three and four channels. An optimum polarization channel arrangement is also proposed in the context of the bound.
