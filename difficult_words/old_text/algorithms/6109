The transmission of JPEG2000 images over wireless channels is examined using reorganization of the compressed images into error-resilient, product-coded streams. The product-code consists of Turbo-codes and Reed-Solomon codes which are optimized using an iterative process. The generation of the stream to be transmitted is performed directly using compressed JPEG2000 streams. The resulting scheme is tested for the transmission of compressed JPEG2000 images over wireless channels and is shown to outperform other algorithms which were recently proposed for the wireless transmission of images.
