An unknown protein structure can be predicted with fair accuracy once an evolutionary connection at the sequence level has been made to a protein of known 3-D structure. In model building by homology, one typically starts with a backbone framework, rebuilds new loop regions, and replaces nonconserved side chains. Here, we use an extremely efficient Monte Carlo algorithm in rotamer space with simulated annealing and simple potential energy functions to optimize the packing of side chains on given backbone models. Optimized models are generated within minutes on a workstation, with reasonable accuracy (average of 81% side chain chi 1 dihedral angles correct in the cores of proteins determined at better than 2.5 A resolution). As expected, the quality of the models decreases with decreasing accuracy of backbone coordinates. If the back-bone was taken from a homologous rather than the same protein, about 70% side chain chi 1 angles were modeled correctly in the core in a case of strong homology and about 60% in a case of medium homology. The algorithm can be used in automated, fast, and reproducible model building by homology.
