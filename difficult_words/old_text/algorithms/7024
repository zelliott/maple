Altogether 345 patients with pleural effusion were investigated; 22 nosological entities were diagnosed. Of them four diseases (tuberculosis, metastatic cancer, pneumonia, and pleural mesothelioma) accounted for 79.7%. Failures of outpatient clinical investigation and late referral of patients to special diagnostic departments were noted. Possibilities to diagnose the type of disease on the basis of x-ray symptoms, clinical and laboratory tests and their combinations were analyzed. A necessity of the use of various types of biopsy with respect to an x-ray picture was recommended. Early thoracoscopic biopsy was indicated for progressive or stable pleural effusion of obscure etiology.
