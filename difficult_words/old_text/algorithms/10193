Arsenic trioxide (ATO) and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) could induce apoptosis and differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, respectively, thus the possibility of synergism between them was raised. This meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness and safety of ATO combined with ATRA in the treatment of APL. Compared with ATO alone, induction therapy with ATO/ATRA significantly increased the complete remission (CR) rate (RR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00-1.17, P=0.04), shortened the time to achieve CR (WMD: -6.51, 95% CI: -11.32 to -1.70, P=0.008), and improved the molecular remission rate after consolidation therapy (RR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.14-2.66, P=0.01) and the 1-year disease-free survival rate (RR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.00-1.50, P=0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between two treatments in terms of early death and main adverse events. These results suggested that ATO/ATRA could synergistically improve the overall outcome of newly diagnosed and relapsed APL patients, supporting the use of ATO/ATRA as an effective treatment for all APL patients previously untreated with ATO.
