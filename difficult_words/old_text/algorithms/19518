An approach for analysis of biological networks is proposed. In this approach, named the connectivity matrix (CM) method, all the connectivities of interest are expressed in a matrix. Then, a variety of analyses are performed on GNU Octave or Matlab. Each node in the network is expressed as a row vector or numeral that carries information defining or characterising the node itself. Information about connectivity itself is also expressed as a row vector or numeral. Thus, connection of node n1 to node n2 through edge e is expressed as [n1, n2, e], a row vector formed by the combination of three row vectors or numerals, where n1, n2 and e indicate two different nodes and one connectivity, respectively. All the connectivities in any given network are expressed as a matrix, CM, each row of which corresponds to one connectivity. Using this CM method, intermetabolite atom-level connectivity is investigated in a model metabolic network composed of the reactions for glycolysis, oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, citric acid cycle, pentose phosphate pathway and gluconeogenesis.
