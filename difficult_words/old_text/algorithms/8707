After more than 12 years of development, the ninth edition of the Present State Examination (PSE-9) was published, together with associated instruments and computer algorithm, in 1974. The system has now been expanded, in the framework of the World Health Organization/Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration Joint Project on Standardization of Diagnosis and Classification, and is being tested with the aim of developing a comprehensive procedure for clinical examination that is also capable of generating many of the categories of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised third edition. The new system is known as SCAN (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry). It includes the 10th edition of the PSE as one of its core schedules, preliminary tests of which have suggested that reliability is similar to that of PSE-9. SCAN is being field tested in 20 centers in 11 countries. A final version is expected to be available in January 1990.
