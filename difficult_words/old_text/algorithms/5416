This article reported the distribution of skinfold thickness (SFT) and blood pressure (BP) among children and adolescents in Shandong, China. A total of 8568 students (4333 boys and 4235 girls) aged 7-18 years participated in this study. Triceps and subscapular SFT and BP of all subjects were measured, the sum of Triceps and subscapular SFT (SSFT) was used as an indicator of the overall SFT. The overall prevalence of relative high BP was 24.07% for boys and 22.36% for girls. The prevalence of relative high BP was increasing with SSFT percentiles, this trend was obvious especially in upper percentiles of SSFT. The prevalence of relative high BP increased from 13.27% (boys) and 13.33% (girls) in <5th SSFT percentile group to 55.50% (boys) and 48.17% (girls) in â‰¥95th SSFT percentile group, which increased by 3.2 and 2.6 times. There is a higher level of SSFT and higher prevalence of relative high BP among children and adolescents in Shandong, China.
