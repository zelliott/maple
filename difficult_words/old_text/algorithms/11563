EEG classification using Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) is introduced on the basis of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) built in Graz, where a subject controlled a cursor in one dimension on a monitor using potentials recorded from the intact scalp. The method of classification with LVQ is described in detail along with first results on a subject who participated in four on-line cursor control sessions. Using this data, extensive off-line experiments were performed to show the influence of the various parameters of the classifier and the extracted features of the EEG on the classification results.
