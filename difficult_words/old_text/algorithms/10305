This paper reports on a state agency's training activities undertaken to totally redesign a long-term-care (LTC) delivery system as part of the national Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) initiative.

Through the development of an ADRC algorithm and the implementation of a corresponding client pathway, NJ DACS, a division of aging, aligned 14 separate core functions necessary for lifespan services. A Training Academy facilitated the adoption of five new health service delivery products and processes by state and county health and human services personnel.

Intensive training activities resulted in the algorithm and client pathway framework being successfully disseminated in all 21 counties within a short timeframe. Barriers to training were reduced and acceptance of new protocols and processes were facilitated leading to rapid adoption. Implications for training of health and human service personnel are presented. Full adoption of the complete ADRC model across the state was directly linked to agency software integration.

Promoting standardized service delivery for the aging population through the use of an algorithm and parallel client pathway is feasible as a training model for health care service delivery.
