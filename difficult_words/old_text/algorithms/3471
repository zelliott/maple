A study has been made of the effects of sandblasting on the strength of Y-TZP and alumina ceramic layers joined to polymeric substrates and loaded at the top surfaces by a spherical indenter, in simulation of occlusal contact in ceramic crowns on tooth dentin. The sandblast treatment is applied to the ceramic bottom surface before bonding to the substrate, as in common dental practice. Specimens with polished surfaces are used as a control. Tests are conducted with monotonically increasing (dynamic) and sinusoidal (cyclic) loading on the spherical indenter, up to the point of initiation of a radial fracture at the ceramic bottom surface immediately below the contact. For the polished specimens, data from the dynamic and cyclic tests overlap, consistent with a dominant slow crack growth mode of fatigue. Strengths of sandblasted specimens show significant reductions in both dynamic and cyclic tests, indicative of larger starting flaws. However, the shift is considerably greater in the cyclic data, suggesting some mechanically assisted growth of the sandblast flaws. These results have implications in the context of lifetimes of dental crowns.
