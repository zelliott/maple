An x-ray computed microtomography system for specimen and small animal imaging was built and tested. The system used seventeen 48-microm-wide detector arrays (a charge coupled device camera) and helical acquisition techniques. Images were acquired using 540 rays/view and 400 views/2pi. The modulation transfer function (MTF) of the computed tomography images demonstrated 50 microm limiting resolution, with MTF > 10% for objects larger than 60 microm (approximately 8.3 cycles/mm). While soft tissue discrimination was compromised by a low signal-to-noise ratio, equine medullary bone core samples and the murine skeleton were well visualized. The incorporation of multiple detector arrays provided a 17-fold improvement in x-ray efficiency, which is a very important step toward improving the potential of microtomography as a scientific tool.
