The change in configuration from circular convergent arcs to shaped static fields for stereotactic radiosurgery raises questions regarding comparability of dose distributions between the techniques. This study aims to quantify the optimization of planning parameters to achieve dose distributions minimizing dose to healthy tissue. Dose volume histograms were calculated and averaged from several patient treatments to measure dose homogeneity and healthy tissue irradiation inherent in variable PTV margins, the effect of increasing numbers of static shaped fields, the dose fall-off outside the PTV and of field placement. Our results show that adding a 2 mm margin around the target volume when defining field shapes maximizes dose coverage and homogeneity without substantially increasing the volume of healthy tissue irradiated to high dose levels. We demonstrate that 5-6 static fields may be optimal for typical lesions and that placement of these fields may not always play a major role in healthy tissue sparing. This work illustrates a systematic approach to conformal static field treatment plan optimization which relies on the prior determination of parameters such as optimum margin width to account for field penumbra. Complex irregularly shaped lesions still require careful patient-specific assessment of healthy tissue irradiation.
