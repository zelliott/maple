The leading cause of amputation in patients with diabetes is the nonhealing foot wound and its complications. The effects of peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and infection often combine to facilitate ulcer development that can lead to gangrene and amputation. In many instances, foot ulcers and amputation can be prevented. The literature over the past 5 years has included information on the infrared thermometry in the diagnosis of infection and acute Charcot change. Pressure downloading has been facilitated by computerized foot scanning systems and the use of prefabricated pneumatic walkers as an alternative to the contact cast. Local wound care is enforced by repeated sharp debridement. Nonhealing ulcers can benefit from biologicals: platelet-derived growth factors and a human dermal replacement containing viable fibroblasts. The most successful outcomes are achieved when interdisciplinary teams are formed to provide coordinated care. The goal of this article is to provide healthcare professionals with an overview of the risks of neuropathic foot injury and to offer strategies for prevention, protection, and reduction of recurrences of the diabetic foot ulcer.
