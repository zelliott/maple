To determine the effect of drusen and geographic atrophy (GA) in dry age-related macular degeneration on retinal sensitivity using an eye tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope microperimetry.

A total of 44 eyes from 22 patients with dry age-related macular degeneration and drusen and 11 patients with GA were imaged with scanning laser ophthalmoscope microperimetry (OPKO Health, Miami, FL). A custom microperimetry pattern was used to evaluate retinal sensitivity to a Goldmann III size target (108 Î¼m on the retina). The perimetry used a 4-2 stepladder algorithm to determine maximal sensitivity. Microperimetry and optical coherence tomography were performed using a standardized protocol. Twenty-eight eyes with drusen and 16 eyes with GA were analyzed.

Retinal sensitivity overlying drusen was significantly reduced compared with the adjacent uninvolved retina. There was a significant correlation between retinal sensitivity and drusen volume, as well as the grading of the photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment junction score. In patients with GA, an absolute scotoma was confirmed. Retinal sensitivity at the margin of GA was significantly decreased compared with the adjacent uninvolved retina.

Scanning laser ophthalmoscope microperimetry is able to detect changes in retinal sensitivity in AMD patients overlying drusen and at the margin of GA. It is a useful device to grade focal retinal sensitivity in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration.
