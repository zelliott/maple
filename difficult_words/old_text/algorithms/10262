One major objective of total body irradiation (TBI) treatments is to deliver a uniform dose in the entire body of the patient. Looking at 3D dose distributions for constant speed (CstSpeed) and variable speed (VarSpeed) translating couch TBI treatments, dose uniformity and the effect of body heterogeneities were evaluated. This study was based on retrospective dose calculations of 10 patients treated with a translating couch TBI technique. Dose distributions for CstSpeed and VarSpeed TBI treatments have been computed with Pinnacle3 treatment planning system in homogeneous (Homo) and heterogeneous (Hetero) dose calculation modes. A specific beam model was implemented in Pinnacle3 to allow an accurate dose calculation adapted for TBI special aspects. Better dose coverages were obtained with Homo/VarSpeed treatments compared to Homo/CstSpeed cases including smaller overdosage areas. Large differences between CstSpeed and VarSpeed dose calculations were observed in the brain, spleen, arms, legs, and lateral parts of the abdomen (differences between V100% mean values up to 57.5%). Results also showed that dose distributions for patients treated with CstSpeed TBI greatly depend on the patient morphology, especially for pediatric and overweight cases. Looking at heterogeneous dose calculations, underdosages (2%-5%) were found in high-density regions (e.g., bones), while overdosages (5%-15%) were found in low-density regions (e.g., lungs). Overall, Homo/CstSpeed and Hetero/VarSpeed dose distributions showed more hot spots than Homo/VarSpeed and were greatly dependent on patient anatomy. CstSpeed TBI treatments allow a simple optimization process but lead to less dose uniformity due to the patient anatomy. VarSpeed TBI treatments require more complex dose optimization, but lead to a better dose uniformity independent of the patient morphology. Finally, this study showed that heterogeneities should be considered in dose calculations in order to obtain a better optimization and, therefore, to improve dose uniformity.
