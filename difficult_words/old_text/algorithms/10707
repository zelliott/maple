Current approaches for mining association rules usually assume that the mining is performed in a static database, where the problem of missing attribute values does not practically exist. However, these assumptions are not preserved in some medical databases, like in a home care system. In this paper, a novel uncertainty rule algorithm is illustrated, namely URG-2 (Uncertainty Rule Generator), which addresses the problem of mining dynamic databases containing missing values. This algorithm requires only one pass from the initial dataset in order to generate the item set, while new metrics corresponding to the notion of Support and Confidence are used. URG-2 was evaluated over two medical databases, introducing randomly multiple missing values for each record's attribute (rate: 5-20% by 5% increments) in the initial dataset. Compared with the classical approach (records with missing values are ignored), the proposed algorithm was more robust in mining rules from datasets containing missing values. In all cases, the difference in preserving the initial rules ranged between 30% and 60% in favour of URG-2. Moreover, due to its incremental nature, URG-2 saved over 90% of the time required for thorough re-mining. Thus, the proposed algorithm can offer a preferable solution for mining in dynamic relational databases.
