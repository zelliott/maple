The aim of this study was to evaluate for the interest of realistic mannequin-based simulations as a tool to assess the knowledge of emergency medicine physicians in the field of difficult tracheal intubation.

Prospective.

Emergency physicians.

Twenty-four emergency physicians were invited entering the study. The first step of the study consisted of an initial assessment of their knowledge in the field of difficult tracheal intubation. Then theoretical lectures on the tools and techniques of difficult tracheal intubation were given, followed by standard mannequin-based driven workshops. The second step was conducted six weeks later. Each physician's knowledge was re-evaluated and their ability to manage two difficult airway scenarios simulated on the AirMan simulator (Laerdal was assessed.

Only one physician could not complete the program. Half of them worked at the University Hospital (UH) with half of them for less than three years. Lectures and standard mannequin-based driven workshops significantly improved physician's theoretical knowledge. Practical performance during difficult airway management scenarios was poor.

We have demonstrated that theoretical lectures and standard mannequin-based driven workshops improved overall theoretical knowledge but did not translated to practical skill during of realistic mannequin-based simulations. Realistic mannequin-based simulations teaching programs in the field of difficult tracheal intubation should be considered.
