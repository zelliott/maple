We examined the temporal invariance hypothesis in handwriting, using dynamic programming (DP) matching algorithm. The DP matching algorithm was originally developed for the speech recognition to eliminate fluctuations of time axis caused by different speech rates. This algorithm can determine the optimal point-to-point correspondences (warping function) between the standard velocity pattern and different patterns. We found that this algorithm worked well for various velocity patterns, even when their total writing time was different from the standard pattern. Only 30 to 50 percent of handwriting movements showed temporal invariance. The writing movements which didn't show temporal invariance consisted of several sub-motor units. The borders between the units were not limited near the end of each letter. The results suggest that handwriting of a word does not show the temporal invariance and that it is executed by some discrete sub-motor units.
