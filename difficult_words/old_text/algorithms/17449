Although current literature supports the use of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) by physicians, there is limited research concerning operational issues that may be inhibiting effective CPG implementation. The objective of our research was to increase understanding of clinical practice patterns by identifying physician preferences for CPG accessibility, format, content and learning strategies. Semistructured interviews were conducted with resident and faculty physicians in an academic medical center after they were presented with a CPG during treatment of a patient with acute pancreatitis. The results of our study revealed that physicians prefer CPGs in the form of evidence-based algorithms with treatment-specific information that is placed on the front of the patient chart during treatment. In addition, they felt that discussion of the guideline with colleagues, reminder notes/stickers on front of the patient chart, and verbal reminders from a nurse were the most effective means of encouraging utilization.
