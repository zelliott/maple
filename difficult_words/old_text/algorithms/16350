Regional myocardial function assessment is essential for diagnosis and evaluation of heart disease. The purpose of this study was to enhance the spatial resolution of a speckle tracking echocardiography approach and enable layer-specific analysis of the myocardium. Following validation with software-implemented and mechanical phantoms versus imposed values, short-axis cines were obtained from 50 rats. The cines were post-processed by a speckle tracking commercial program, and the myocardial velocities were processed by a three-dimensional wavelet de-noising program, instead of the built-in smoothing process of the commercial program. Software-implemented phantom measurements yielded rotation errors of 7.5%, 2.9%, and 3.4%, for inner, middle, and outer layers, respectively. Analysis of a shrinking/expanding mechanical phantom yielded strain errors of 3%, 5%, and 7% for the three layers. Bland-Altman analysis showed agreement between the commercial and enhanced programs. Thus, layer-specific analysis is feasible while using echocardiography even on small animals such as rats.
