Patients with suspected illness due to mercury in dental amalgam were classified as tolerant or intolerant depending on their psychosomatic responses following in vivo epicutaneous provocation with low doses (patch test doses) of metallic mercury and phenylmercuric acetate. Ten intolerant patients and nine tolerant patients plus seven healthy amalgam-free and metal non-allergic controls were recruited to the study. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were exposed in vitro to three concentration of mercuric chloride (0.92, 1.83 and 3.68 microM) with and without 10 microg phytohaemagglutinine (PHA)/ml and the release of serotonin into the supernatant was measured. Lymphocytes exposed only to HgCl(2) showed no significant dose-dependent increase of serotonin, but the response of the tolerant patients was significantly higher compared with the controls. No other differences were found. Co-culture with mercuric chloride and PHA showed a statistically significant dose-dependant release of serotonin, but no differences between the three clinical groups could be detected. Thus, our results could not validate the concept of mercury tolerance and intolerance.
