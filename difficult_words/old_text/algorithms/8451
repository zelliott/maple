A double-pulse stereo photogrammetry technique has been developed for the dynamic assessment of the leaflet deformation of bioprosthetic heart valves under simulated physiological conditions. By using a specially designed triggering technique, which takes the advantage of the field transfer mechanisms of the charge coupled device camera, two consecutive images separated by a time interval as short as 5 ms were captured. This made it possible to investigate the realistic leaflet deformation during the valve opening and closing processes which typically last 25-45 ms. This technique was applied to assess a newly developed pericardial valve leaflet in a physiological pulse flow loop. Quantitative leaflet deformations of the valve opening and closing were generated from sequences of digital images. The results can later be applied to finite element analysis of bioprosthetic heart valve leaflet stress and strain during a complete cardiac cycle.
