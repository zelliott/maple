This paper presents a control strategy, which is based on sliding mode control, adaptive control, and fuzzy logic system for controlling the chaotic dynamics. We consider this control paradigm in chaotic systems where the equations of motion are not known. The proposed control strategy is robust against the external noise disturbance and system parameter variations and can be used to convert the chaotic orbits not only to the desired periodic ones but also to any desired chaotic motions. Simulation results of controlling some typical higher order chaotic systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.
