Two optical fibre-based probes for spectroscopic measurements on human tissues were designed and developed. The two probes combine fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy in a multimodal approach. The fluorescence excitation was provided by two laser diodes emitting in the UV (378 nm) and in the visible (445 nm) range, while a third source in the NIR (785 nm) was used for Raman. The device was tested on freshly excised human skin biopsies clinically diagnosed as malignant melanoma, melanocytic nevus, or healthy skin. Discrimination of lesions based on their fluorescence and Raman spectra showed good correlation with the subsequent histological examination.
