Polarization interferometry (PI) techniques, which are able to improve surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing performance and reduce restrictions on allowable parameters of SPR-supporting metal films, have been experimentally realized only in SPR sensors using monochromatic light as a source. Wavelength-interrogation SPR sensors modulated by PI techniques have not been reported due to the wavelength-sensitive characterization of PI phase compensators. In this work we develop a specially designed rhombic prism for phase compensating which is totally insensitive to wavelength. For the first time we successfully apply PI technique to a wavelength-interrogation SPR imager. This imager is able to offer two-dimensional imaging of the whole array plane. As a result of PI modulation, resolutions of 1.3×10(-6) refractive index unit (RIU) under the normal condition and 3.9×10(-7) RIU under a more time-consuming condition are acquired. The application of this imager was demonstrated by reading microarrays for identification of bacteria, and SPR results were confirmed by means of fluorescence imaging.
