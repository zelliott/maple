The absorbed fractions (AF) of electrons in sensitive layers of human respiratory tract were calculated in this paper. For that purpose the source code for simulation package PENELOPE, based on Monte Carlo method, was developed. The human respiratory tract was modeled according to ICRP66 publication, where AF of electrons was calculated using EGS4 simulation software. Some approximations used in ICRP66 were corrected in this work, and new values of AF for radon progeny are given. Minimal energy (EABS) that electron can have during transport through material is 1 keV in ICRP66, while it is set as low as 100 eV in the presented work. Lowering value of EABS gives more accurate results for AF when initial energy of electrons is below 50 keV. To represent tissue, water is used in ICRP66, while in this work epithelia tissue is used.
