The rationale for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the elderly is less clear than in middle-aged patients because of several conceptual, epidemiological, economical facts, a higher prevalence of polypathology and a weaker relation between hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular risk when age increases.

However, cardiovascular events-stroke and myocardial infarction occur mainly in people aged more than 65 years. The data of recent randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that the use of statins in the elderly remained associated to a reduced all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and stroke. Statins were effective in elderly with average LDL-cholesterol in primary and secondary prevention trials. The drug tolerance was as good as in middle-aged patients. However, convincing data concerning subjects over 80 are lacking.

On the basis of disponible data it may be considered that statins are useful in older persons with a serum LDL cholesterol level above 1.3 g/l and or a high cardiovascular risk, with or without cardiovascular disease, when their life expectancy is consequent.
