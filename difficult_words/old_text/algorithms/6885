Most diagnostic ultrasonic imaging systems perform fixed focusing on transmit and dynamic focusing on receive. Such systems suffer from image quality degradation at depths away from the transmit focal zone. Several dynamic transmit focusing techniques have been previously investigated. Among them, a filter-based, retrospective focusing technique was proposed to increase the length of the transmit focal zone. In this paper, the filter-based technique is extended from dynamic receive focusing to fixed receive focusing. It is shown that the filtering technique with fixed receive focusing can achieve an image quality similar to that of dynamic receive focusing with filtering. The performance of the proposed approach is verified using real ultrasound data. It is shown that the proposed approach with fixed receive focusing requires a longer filter than that with dynamic receive focusing. Nonetheless, system complexity is greatly reduced with synthetic transmit and receive focusing because the dynamic receive focusing circuit is no longer needed.
