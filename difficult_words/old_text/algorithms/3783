Despite advances in the treatment of heart failure (HF) over the past decade, the prognosis remains poor. Anemia is a well-recognized comorbidity in many chronic conditions, but its role in HF has only recently been recognized. Anemia is significantly related to symptoms, exercise capacity, and prognosis in HF; it has been identified as an independent risk factor for mortality in those with left ventricular dysfunction. When HF patients have concomitant renal disease, they invariably become anemic owing to erythropoietin deficiency. In chronic HF patients without renal disease, erythropoietin levels may be elevated in response to anemia, but not adequately increased to overcome it. Some degree of erythropoietin resistance may also be present because of elevated plasma levels of cytokines. Several studies in anemic HF patients have shown positive outcomes using erythropoietin and iron supplementation therapy to increase hemoglobin concentrations to more normal levels. This article reviews the current information available regarding anemia in HF and discusses the clinical implications and treatment of this syndrome.
