Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke on guinea-pigs induced a muscularization of pulmonary arterioles and endothelial dysfunction might be an early trigger of this vascular remodelling. Accordingly, the present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of a 12 weeks exposure to passive smoking on the pulmonary endothelial vasomotor function.

Vasodilator response of pulmonary arteries rings isolated in organ bath, precontracted with phenylephrine, was compared in the presence of cumulative doses (10(-9) to 10(-4) M) of endothelial-dependent (acetylcholine, ACh and adenosine-diphosphate, ADP) and independent vasodilators (sodium nitroprusside, SNP), respectively.

Our results suggest that chronic exposure of guinea-pigs to cigarette smoke induces the impairment only of NO-mediated endothelial response (vasodilation was 9.83 +/- 4.36 % for ACh 10(-5)M vs. 39.72 +/- 16.61 % in control, p = 0.005, respectively 36.64 +/- 7.21 % for ADP 10(-5)M vs. 55.53 +/- 13.51 %, p = 0.02).

The in vitro study of pulmonary arteries vasomotor function in guinea pigs chronically exposed to cigarette smoke may represent a reliable and relevant experimental model for the assessment of pulmonary endothelial dysfunction in early stages of COPD.
