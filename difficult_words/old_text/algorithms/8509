Sedimentation velocity is one of the best-suited physical methods for determining the size and shape of macromolecular substances or their complexes in the range from 1 to several thousand kDa. The moving boundary in sedimentation velocity runs can be described by the Lamm differential equation. Fitting of suitable model functions or solutions of the Lamm equation to the moving boundary is used to obtain directly sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, thus allowing quick determination of size, shape and other parameters of macromolecules. Here we present a new approximate whole boundary solution of the Lamm equation that simultaneously allows the specification of sedimentation and diffusion coefficients with deviations smaller than 1% from the expected values.
