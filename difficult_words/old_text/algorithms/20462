The authors' goal was to develop a computer graphics model to simulate the displacement and morphological changes that are caused by the retraction of fine intracranial structures. The authors developed an application program to interpolate the contour of models of an artery and a retractor. The center of the displacement was determined by spatial coordinates, and the shape of the displacement of the arterial model was calculated using a cosine-based formula with representation of a brain retractor. This computer graphics model was applied to the simulation of the displacement and morphological changes that occur when retraction is performed in the optic nerve. An illustrative case is presented, in which the optic nerve was displaced by a retractor to simulate the surgery performed in a carotid cave aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. The authors have named this methodological tool a "virtual retractor." This new navigational system for open microneurosurgery would be useful in teaching surgical microanatomy and in presurgical operative planning.
