Newer antiarrhythmic agents can control atrial flutter and fibrillation in many patients, although individual episodes may require cardioversion. Catheter ablation is often curative for refractory flutter. Ablation of atrial fibrillation is more difficult, because of its different mechanism. Surgical and catheter-based ablation procedures have been pioneered for fibrillation but remain experimental.
