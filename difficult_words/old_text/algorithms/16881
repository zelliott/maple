Stroke is the leading cause of disability in adulthood, and the principal aim of care in cerebrovascular disease is the reduction of this negative outcome and mortality. Several studies demonstrated the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy in ischemic stroke, but up to 80% of cases could not be treated because the diagnostic workup exceeds the time limit. In this article, we described the design of a study conducted in the northern Lombardy, within the district of Sondrio, Lecco, Como, and Varese. The awaited results of this study are reduction of avoidable delay, organization of an operative stroke emergency network, and identification of highly specialized structures. The study schedules education and data registration with implementation and training of acute stroke management algorithms. The use of standardized protocols during prehospital and in-hospital phase can optimize acute stroke pathways. The results of this study could contribute to the assessment of an effective and homogeneous health system to manage acute stroke.
