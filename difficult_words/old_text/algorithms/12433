Orientational fluorophores have been a useful tool in physical chemistry, biochemistry, and more recently structural biology due to the polarized nature of the light they emit and that fact that energy can be transferred between them. We present a practical scheme in which measurements of the intensity of emitted fluorescence can be used to determine limits on the mean and distribution of orientation of the absorption transition moment of membrane-bound fluorophores. We demonstrate how information about the orientation of fluorophores can be used to calculate the orientation factor kappa(2) required for use in FRET spectroscopy. We illustrate the method using images of AlexaFluor probes bound to MscL mechanosensitive transmembrane channel proteins in spherical liposomes.
