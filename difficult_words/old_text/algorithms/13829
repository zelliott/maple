A rapid screening technique for the presentation of uterine cavity anatomy obtained with MR is described. MR hysterographic (MRHG) images were generated and evaluated for uterine cavity abnormalities. Six patients referred for MRI evaluation of the uterus for infertility had an MRI using a pelvic phased array coil with axial 3 mm interleaved fast spin echo images (TR 9000 ms, TE 288 ms with fat saturation) processed using maximum intensity projection algorithms to construct MRHG images. Using the conventional MR sequence as the gold standard the MRHG images were evaluated by two reviewers and accuracy calculated. MRHG took less than 3 min, demonstrated the correct diagnosis in all with a quality score of diagnostic to optimal, and with excellent interobserver agreement (kappa 0.9).
