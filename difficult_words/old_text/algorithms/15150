To estimate the contribution of dual-energy computed tomographic (CT angiopulmonography t o a diagnostic algorithm in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and its role in the evaluation of postoperative changes.

CT angiopulmonography was performed on the 64-slice Discovery HD 750 system (GE Healthcare) using the dual-energy scanning mode (140 and 80 kV). The examination results in patients with CTEPH were analyzed.

All the patients were found to have typical CT signs of CTEPH: abnormal contrast enhancement of the pulmonary arteries, their dilatation and tortuosity; signs of right cardiac overload: right ventricular dilatation and/or hypertrophy, bronchial artery dilatation, decreased peripheral vascular pattern, mosaic pulmonary perfusion, and wedge-shaped perfusion defects on the iodine maps. Mosaic pulmonary perfusion areas were also found in all the patients. Perfusion defects were more clearly visualized when dual-energy CT by constructing iodine perfusion maps was used. Analyzing the perfusion maps in 6 patients operated on revealed a 20-50% reduction in perfusion deficit.

Information on the vascular bed and pulmonary perfusion may be obtained in patients with CTEPH within one investigation, which is important to plan surgical treatment. Construction of iodine pulmonary perfusion maps allows evaluation of perfusion recovery after artery thromboendarterectomy.
