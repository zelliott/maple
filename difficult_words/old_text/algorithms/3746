The problem of testing for congruence between phylogenetic data has long been debated among phylogeneticists, but reaches a critical point with the availability of large amount of biological sequences. Notably in prokaryotes, where the amount of lateral transfers is believed to be important, the inference of phylogenies using multiple genes requires testing for incongruence before concatenating the genes. On another scale, incongruence tests can be used to detect recombination points within single gene alignments. The incongruence length difference test (ILD), based on parsimony, has been proved to be useful for finding incongruent data sets, but its application remains limited to small data sets for computational time reasons. Here, we have adapted the principle of ILD to the BIONJ algorithm. This algorithm is based on a tree length minimisation criterion and is suitable to replace parsimony in this test when used with uncorrected distance (model-free approach). We show that this new test, ILD-BIONJ, while being much faster, is often more accurate than the ILD test, especially when the alignments compared are simulated under different evolutionary models.
