This paper is concerned with the problem of mean-square exponential stability of uncertain neural networks with time-varying delay and stochastic perturbation. Both linear and nonlinear stochastic perturbations are considered. The main features of this paper are twofold: 1) Based on generalized Finsler lemma, some improved delay-dependent stability criteria are established, which are more efficient than the existing ones in terms of less conservatism and lower computational complexity; and 2) when the nonlinear stochastic perturbation acting on the system satisfies a class of Lipschitz linear growth conditions, the restrictive condition P < Î´I (or the similar ones) in the existing results can be relaxed under some assumptions. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by illustrative examples.
