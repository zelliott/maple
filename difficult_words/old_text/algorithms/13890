A comparison was made between volume measurements of spleen and liver by ultrasonography and by computed tomography, the two most common modes of assessment of organ size in patients with Gaucher disease, who require frequent follow-up measurements. The two measurements showed a high degree of correlation within a broad range for both spleen and liver volumes. An algorithm for conversion of one measurement to the other was derived for both spleen and liver.
