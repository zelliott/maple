This article aims to expose a new global strategy for the validation of analytical methods and the estimation of measurement uncertainty. Our purpose is to allow to researchers in the field of analytical chemistry get access to a powerful tool for the evaluation of quantitative analytical procedures. Indeed, the proposed strategy facilitates analytical validation by providing a decision tool based on the uncertainty profile and the Î²-content tolerance interval. Equally important, this approach allows a good estimate of measurement uncertainty by using data validation and without recourse to other additional experiments. In the example below, we confirmed the applicability of this new strategy for the validation of a chromatographic bioanalytical method and the good estimate of the measurement uncertainty without referring to any extra effort and additional experiments. A comparative study with the SFSTP approach showed that both strategies have selected the same calibration functions. The holistic character of the measurement uncertainty compared to the total error was influenced by our choice of profile uncertainty. Nevertheless, we think that the adoption of the uncertainty in the validation stage controls the risk of using the analytical method in routine phase.
