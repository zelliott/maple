The application of the Multivariate Curve Resolution by Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) method to model and control blend processes of pharmaceutical formulations is assessed. Within the MCR-ALS framework, different data analysis approaches have been tested depending on the objective of the study, i.e., knowing the effect of different factors in the evolution of the blending process (modeling) or detecting the blend end-point and monitoring the concentration of the different species during and at the end of the process (control). Data analysis has been carried out studying multiple blending runs simultaneously taking advantage of the multiset mode of the MCR-ALS method. During the ALS optimization, natural constraints, such as non-negativity (spectral and concentration directions) have been applied for blend modeling. When blending control is the main purpose, a variant of the MCR-ALS algorithm with correlation constraint in the concentration direction has been additionally used. This constraint incorporates an internal calibration procedure, which relates resolved concentration values (in arbitrary units) with the real reference concentration values in the calibration samples (known references) providing values in real concentration scale in the final MCR-ALS results. Two systems consisting of pharmaceutical mixtures of an active principle (acetaminophen) with two or four excipients have been investigated. In the first case, MCR results allowed the description of the evolution of the individual compounds and the assessment of some physical effects in the blending process. In the second case, MCR analysis allowed the detection of the end-point of the process and the assessment of the effects linked to variations in the concentration level of the compounds.
