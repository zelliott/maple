DNA microarray experiments have provided vast amounts of data which can be used for inferring gene function. However, most methods for predicting functional associations between genes from expression data are not suited to simultaneous analysis of multiple datasets, and a comprehensive resource of coexpression-based predictions is currently lacking. Here, we present an interactive web resource of gene associations predicted by applying a novel algorithm to all expression data in the Stanford Microarray Database. The underlying pre-computed database currently contains more than 200 000 high-confidence gene associations in 12 different species sampled from a broad taxonomic range. The resource allows every association to be inspected visually and can be accessed at http://www.bork.embl.de/ArrayProspector.
