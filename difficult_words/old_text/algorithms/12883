Superresolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging (SOFI) as initially demonstrated allows for a resolution enhancement in imaging by a factor of square-root of two. Here, we demonstrate how to increase the resolution of SOFI images by re-weighting the Optical Transfer Function (OTF). Furthermore, we demonstrate how cross-cumulants can be exploited to obtain a fair approximation of the underlying Point-Spread Function. We show a two-fold increase of resolution (over the diffraction limit) of near-infrared quantum dot labeled tubulin-network of 3T3 fibroblasts.
