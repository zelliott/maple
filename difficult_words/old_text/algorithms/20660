An integrated method was constructed for the study of in situ clinical reasoning. A meta-analysis of existing theories and an exploratory case study were performed. Twelve physicians at the department of otorhinolaryngology, and three physicians and three biomedical technologists at the clinical microbiological laboratory of an 800-bed university hospital were involved in the evaluation of the method. The meta-analysis identified situations where practitioners face assignments for which they follow no routine strategy as suitable starting points for the development of the method, in which organizational processes are presented as workflow graphs. Using the critical incident technique, problem situations in the processes are identified, and stimulated recall interviews are employed to construct a model of the situation-dependent logic used in decision-making. The case study showed that the first levels of the method could easily be used by physicians without training in organizational development or cognitive psychology. It is concluded that the method can be a means for case construction in problem-oriented learning programs that have an empirical background. It can also be used in the development of clinical organization, where training is combined with the establishment of critical paths and computer support.
