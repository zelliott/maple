This paper presents a new reconstruction algorithm for both single- and dual-energy computed tomography (CT) imaging. By incorporating the polychromatic characteristics of the X-ray beam into the reconstruction process, the algorithm is capable of eliminating beam hardening artifacts. The single energy version of the algorithm assumes that each voxel in the scan field can be expressed as a mixture of two known substances, for example, a mixture of trabecular bone and marrow, or a mixture of fat and flesh. These assumptions are easily satisfied in a quantitative computed tomography (QCT) setting. We have compared our algorithm to three commonly used single-energy correction techniques. Experimental results show that our algorithm is much more robust and accurate. We have also shown that QCT measurements obtained using our algorithm are five times more accurate than that from current QCT systems (using calibration). The dual-energy mode does not require any prior knowledge of the object in the scan field, and can be used to estimate the attenuation coefficient function of unknown materials. We have tested the dual-energy setup to obtain an accurate estimate for the attenuation coefficient function of K2 HPO4 solution.
