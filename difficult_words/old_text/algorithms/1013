This paper presents a test strategy to detect interactive effects between several mycotoxins using a DNA synthesis inhibition assay in L929 cells. The joint action of the Fusarium mycotoxins T-2 toxin (T2), deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisin (FB1) was studied in a tiered approach. In the first stage, the mycotoxins were tested either jointly in a five-compound mixture, or individually. At the highest dose level, the mixture showed a clear less than additive action of the mycotoxins, as compared to the effects of the five individual compounds, whereas at lower dose levels the mycotoxins behaved additive. In the second stage, the non-additivity as established in the first experiment was further analyzed with a central composite design to detect interactions between specific mycotoxins in the mixture. This experiment confirmed less than additivity for five of the mixes tested. However, it also revealed four significant synergistic interactions between mycotoxins. Finally, two interactions that were established in stage 2 were further studied in full factorial designs involving two mycotoxins. One of the interactions observed in the central composite design was retrieved whereas the other two-factor interaction was not. It was concluded that several classes of mycotoxins when present simultaneously in a mixture might show interaction. The effect of the mixture cannot be predicted solely on the basis of the effect of the individual compounds.
