The present study investigated the control of manual prehension movements in humans. Subjects grasped luminous virtual discs with the thumb and index finger, and we recorded the instantaneous grip aperture, defined as the 3-D distance between the thumb and index finger. Target size could remain constant (single-step trials) or unexpectedly change shortly after target appearance (double-step trials). In single-step responses, grip aperture varied throughout the movement in a consistent fashion. Double-step responses exhibited distinct corrective modifications, which followed the target change with a latency similar to the normal reaction time. This suggests that visual size information has a fast and continuous access to the processes involved in grip formation. The grip-aperture profiles of single-step responses had a different shape when the target called for an increase than when it called for a decrease in the initial finger distance. The same asymmetry was observed for aperture corrections in double-step trials. These findings indicate that increases and decreases of grip aperture are controlled through separate processes, engaged equally by the appearance and by the size change of a target. Corrections of grip aperture in double-step trials had a higher peak velocity and reached their maximum as well as their final value earlier than the aperture profiles of single-step trials. Nevertheless, the total duration of double-step trials was prolonged. These response characteristics did not fit with either of the three corrective strategies previously proposed for double-step pointing movements, which could indicate that grasping and pointing movements are controlled by different mechanisms. However, more data are needed to substantiate this view.
