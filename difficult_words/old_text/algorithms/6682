Backscattered rf signals used to construct conventional ultrasound B-mode images contain frequency-dependent information that can be examined through the backscattered power spectrum. The backscattered power spectrum is found by taking the magnitude squared of the Fourier transform of a gated time segment corresponding to a region in the scattering volume. When a time segment is gated, the edges of the gated regions change the frequency content of the backscattered power spectrum due to truncating of the waveform. Tapered windows, like the Hanning window, and longer gate lengths reduce the relative contribution of the gate-edge effects. A new gate-edge correction factor was developed that partially accounted for the edge effects. The gate-edge correction factor gave more accurate estimates of scatterer properties at small gate lengths compared to conventional windowing functions. The gate-edge correction factor gave estimates of scatterer properties within 5% of actual values at very small gate lengths (less than 5 spatial pulse lengths) in both simulations and from measurements on glass-bead phantoms. While the gate-edge correction factor gave higher accuracy of estimates at smaller gate lengths, the precision of estimates was not improved at small gate lengths over conventional windowing functions.
