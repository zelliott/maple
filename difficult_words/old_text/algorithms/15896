The present study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a specific algorithm with continuous atrial dynamic overdrive pacing to prevent atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Atrial fibrillation occurs in 30% to 40% of patients after cardiac surgery with a peak incidence on the second day. It still represents a challenge for postoperative prevention and treatment and may have medical and cost implications.

Ninety-six consecutive patients undergoing CABG for severe coronary artery disease and in sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmic therapy on the second postoperative day were randomized to have or not 24 h of atrial pacing through temporary epicardial wires using a permanent dynamic overdrive algorithm. Holter ECGs recorded the same day in both groups were analyzed to detect AF occurrence.

No difference was observed in baseline data between the two study groups, particularly for age, male gender, history of AF, ventricular function, severity of coronary artery disease, preoperative beta-adrenergic blocking agent therapy or P-wave duration. The incidence of AF was significantly lower (p = 0.036) in the paced group (10%) compared with control subjects (27%). Multivariate analysis showed AF incidence to increase with age (p = 0.051) but not in patients with pacing (p = 0.078). It decreased with a better left ventricular ejection fraction only in conjunction with atrial pacing (p = 0.018).

We conclude that continuous atrial pacing with an algorithm for dynamic overdrive reduces significantly incidence of AF the second day after CABG surgery, particularly in patients with preserved left ventricular function.
