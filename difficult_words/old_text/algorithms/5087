The stochastic resonance algorithm is applied to the trace analysis of alkyl halides and alkyl benzenes in water samples. Compared to encountering a single signal when applying the algorithm, the optimization of system parameters for a multicomponent is more complex. In this article, the resolution of adjacent chromatographic peaks is first involved in the optimization of parameters. With the optimized parameters, the algorithm gave an ideal output with good resolution as well as enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Applying the enhanced signals, the method extended the limit of detection and exhibited good linearity, which ensures accurate determination of the multicomponent.
