Recently, we introduced a sensor for the detection of local contrast gloss (or luster) of products. This is a new development step in contrast gloss measurement, since contrast gloss has been measured previously from a macroscopic area. Therefore, yet there do not exist statistical parameters for the classification of the contrast gloss as there exist parameters, e.g., for the classification of the surface roughness. In this study, we define novel statistical parameters for the diffuse component and contrast gloss obtained by the sensor for the detection of local contrast gloss. As an example, we utilize these statistical parameters and measured specular gloss, diffuse-component, and contrast gloss maps in the characterization of prints.
