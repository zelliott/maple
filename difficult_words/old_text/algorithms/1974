In cell signaling systems, the abundances of signaling molecules are generally thought to determine the response to stimulation. However, the kinetics of molecular processes, for example receptor trafficking and protein turnover, may also play an important role. Few studies have systematically examined this relationship between the resting state and stimulus-responsiveness. Fewer still have investigated the relative contribution of steady-state concentrations and reaction kinetics. Here we describe a mathematical framework for modeling the resting state of signaling systems. Among other things, this framework allows steady-state concentration measurements to be used in parameterizing kinetic models, and enables comprehensive characterization of the relationship between the resting state and the cellular response to stimulation.
