Impulse oscillometry (IOS) is a computer supported method for the measurement of complex mechanical airway characteristics. Bronchial obstructions can reliably be diagnosed by IOS when more complex parameters such as frequency dependence of resistance (FDR) and lung reactance (X5) are evaluated in cases with more severe obstruction. Parameters of conventional methods like pneumotachography, spirometry, and bodyplethysmography show relatively low correlations due to the different measurement principles, not only in comparison to IOS, but also in between one another. The IOS is a convenient method for patients with a low dependency on cooperation for the evaluation of obstructive airway diseases complementary to the established standard methods. Furthermore, IOS may provide a sensitive screening tool for the early detection of bronchial obstructions not only in paediatrics but also in occupational medicine.
