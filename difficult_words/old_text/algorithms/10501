The authors have developed a ground-adaptive standing controller for a powered knee and ankle prosthesis which is intended to enhance the standing stability of transfemoral amputees. The finite-state-based controller includes a ground-searching phase, a slope estimation phase, and a joint impedance modulation phase, which together enable the prosthesis to quickly conform to the ground and provide stabilizing assistance to the user. In order to assess the efficacy of the ground-adaptive standing controller, the control approach was implemented on a powered knee and ankle prosthesis, and experimental data were collected on an amputee subject for a variety of standing conditions. Results indicate that the controller can estimate the ground slope within ±1° over a range of ±15°, and that it can provide appropriate joint impedances for standing on slopes within this range.
