The accuracy of the Monte Carlo algorithm for fast electron dose calculation, VMC, is demonstrated by comparing calculations with measurements performed by a working group of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the USA. For both energies investigated, 9 and 20 MeV, the measurements in water are taken to determine the energy spectra of the Varian Clinac 1800 accelerator. For the majority of the experiments a good agreement is found between measurements and VMC calculations. However, in some cases deviations have been observed, which could be explained by the incompletely known geometry on the one hand and by inconsistent data on the other hand. As a reference, dose distributions calculated by the MDAH pencil-beam algorithm are also presented. It is shown that, especially near low- or high-density inhomogeneities, large dose overestimations and underestimations are calculated by using a pencil-beam approach, whereas VMC is able to reproduce the correct doses for these cases also.
