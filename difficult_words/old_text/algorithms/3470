Aseptic loosening is a major complication of joint replacements and is thought to be associated with a heavy macrophage infiltrate in response to wear particles. Bisphosphonates are compounds known to inhibit osteoclastic activity and are used to reduce osteolysis in Paget's disease, osteoporosis, and metastatic bone disease. Oral bisphosphonates have also been used to decrease osteolysis and therefore prevent aseptic loosening of joint replacements. It has been suggested that bisphosphonates mixed in bone cement can reduce bone resorption in joint replacement surgery. This would be an excellent therapeutic option to prevent or control osteolysis. The present aim was to study the mechanical properties of a commercially available acrylic bone cement, Palacos R, mixed with the bisphosphonate pamidronate. The liquid monomer of Palacos R was mixed with liquid pamidronate. Two groups of bone-cement strips were produced, one with added pamidronate and one without. The flexural properties of the cement strips were examined. A significant reduction in both the bending modulus and bending strength of the specimens with added pamidronate was found. In conclusion, the use of liquid pamidronate mixed with the acrylic bone cement Palacos R in order to reduce osteolysis is not recommended because of its effect on the mechanical properties of Palacos R.
