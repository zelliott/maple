Speckle in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images originates in the high spatial coherence of incident light that enables interference of light backscattered from spatially heterogenous tissue specimens. We report results of a numerical simulation and an experiment to test speckle reduction using a partially spatially coherent source. A Gaussian-Schell model for a partially spatially coherent source is used in the OCT simulation. For the experiment, such a source was generated by a spatially coherent boardband light source and a multimode fiber. The advantage of using a multimode fiber in combination with a broadband source is the large number of photons per coherence volume. To illustrate speckle reduction with a partially spatially coherent source, we record low-coherence interferograms of a scattering surface using single-mode and multimode source fibers. Interferograms recorded using a single-mode source fiber are indicative of those observed using conventional OCT. Speckle in OCT images recorded using a multimode source fiber is substantially reduced.
