A spectrophotometric method for simultaneous analysis of glycine and lysine is proposed by application of neural networks on the spectral kinetic data. The method is based on the reaction of glycine and lysine with 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate (NQS) in slightly basic medium. On the basis of the difference in the rate between the two reactions, these two amino acids can be determined simultaneously in binary mixtures. Feed-forward neural networks have been trained to quantify considered amino acids in mixtures under optimum conditions. In this way, a one-layer network was trained. Sigmoidal and linear transfer functions were used in the hidden and output layers, respectively. Linear calibration graphs were obtained in the concentration range of 1 to 25microgml(-1) for glycine and 1 to 19microgml(-1) for lysine. The analytical performance of this method was characterized by the relative standard error. The proposed method was applied to the determination of considered amino acids in synthetic samples.
