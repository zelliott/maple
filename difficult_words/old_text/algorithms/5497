The metabolic syndrome (MS), a predisposing condition for cardiovascular disease, presents disturbances in hemodynamics; impedance cardiography (ICG) can assess these alterations. In subjects with MS, the morphology of the pulses present in the ICG time series is more irregular/complex than in normal subjects. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to quantitatively assess the complexity of ICG times series in 53 patients, with or without MS, through a nonlinear analysis algorithm, the approximate entropy, a method employed in recent years for the study of several biological signals, which provides a scalar index, ApEn. We correlated ApEn computed from ICG times series data during fasting and postprandial phase with the presence of alterations in the parameters defining MS [Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III (Grundy SM, Brewer HB Jr, Cleeman JI, Smith SC Jr, Lenfant C; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association. Circulation 109: 433-438, 2004) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definition]. Results show that ApEn was significantly higher in subjects with MS compared with those without (1.81 ± 0.09 vs. 1.65 ± 0.13; means ± SD; P = 0.0013, with ATP III definition; 1.82 ± 0.09 vs. 1.67 ± 0.12; P = 0.00006, with the IDF definition). We also demonstrated that ApEn increase parallels the number of components of MS. ApEn was then correlated to each MS component: mean ApEn values of subjects belonging to the first and fourth quartiles of the distribution of MS parameters were statistically different for all parameters but HDL cholesterol. No difference was observed between ApEn values evaluated in fasting and postprandial states. In conclusion, we identified that MS is characterized by an increased complexity of ICG signals: this may have a prognostic relevance in subjects with this condition.
