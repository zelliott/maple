This self-directed learning module provides a practical overview of the general rehabilitative management of work disability. It is the fourth of four articles on the topic of industrial rehabilitation medicine for the Self-Directed Physiatric Education Program for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. This section includes an algorithm to highlight strategies for early involvement of the physiatrist in the comprehensive management of injured workers. It also examines the broader role of the physiatrist as independent medical examiner. Finally, it explores the complexities surrounding case closure for the chronically disabled injured worker.
