Recently developed analytic approximation for the equation of state of fully ionized nonideal electron-ion plasma mixtures [A. Y. Potekhin, G. Chabrier, and F. J. Rogers, Phys. Rev. E 79, 016411 (2009)], which covers the transition between the weak and strong Coulomb coupling regimes and reproduces numerical results obtained in the hypernetted-chain (HNC) approximation, is modified in order to fit the small deviations from the linear mixing in the strong-coupling regime, revealed by recent Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, a mixing rule is proposed for the regime of weak coupling, which generalizes post-Debye density corrections to the case of mixtures and numerically agrees with the HNC approximation in that regime.
