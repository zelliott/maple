This paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation of a monomodal B-spline-based non-rigid registration algorithm allowing topology preservation in 3-D. This article is to be considered as the companion of [Noblet, V., Heinrich, C., Heitz, F., Armspach, J.-P., 2005. 3-D deformable image registration: a topology preservation scheme based on hierarchical deformation models and interval analysis optimization. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 14 (5), 553-566] where this algorithm, based on the minimization of an objective function, was introduced and detailed. Overall assessment is based on the estimation of synthetic deformation fields, on average brain construction, on atlas-based segmentation and on landmark mapping. The influence of the model parameters is characterized. Comparison between several objective functions is carried out and impact of their symmetrization is pointed out. An original intensity normalization scheme is also introduced, leading to significant improvements of the registration quality. The comparison benchmark is the popular demons algorithm [Thirion, J.-P., 1998. Image matching as a diffusion process: an analogy with Maxwell's demons. Medical Image Analysis, 2 (3), 243-260], that exhibited best results in a recent comparison between several non-rigid 3-D registration methods [Hellier, P., Barillot, C., Corouge, I., Gibaud, B., Le Goualher, G., Collins, D.L., Evans, A., Malandain, G., Ayache, N., Christensen, G.E., Johnson, H.J., 2003. Retrospective evaluation of intersubject brain registration. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 22 (9), 1120-1130]. The topology preserving B-spline-based method proved to outperform the commonly available ITK implementation of the demons algorithms on many points. Some limits of intensity-based registration methods are also highlighted through this work.
