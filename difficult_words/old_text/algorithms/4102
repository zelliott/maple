This study is a 10-year follow-up to our previous publication reviewing the complication rates of tissue expansion in the pediatric burn population. The purpose of this study was to determine if our institutional experience with tissue expanders had remained stable during the subsequent 10 years.

There were 240 patients who were identified at a major pediatric burn center who underwent reconstruction with a tissue expander (256 tissue expanders) from 1996 to 2006. Data were obtained retrospectively by reviewing patient medical records. Complications were categorized into absolute and relative complications.

Absolute complications occurred in 36 (14.1%) of 256 expanders placed and relative complications occurred in 26 (10.2%) of 256 expanders placed. There was no statistical difference between this study and our previous study for overall complication rates and complications for all sites. The highest complication rate occurred when the scalp was a surgical site. Betadine skin preparation was associated with a 10% reduction in infection-related complications compared to other skin preparations. The operating surgeon or age of patient was not found to be associated with increased complication rates.

After changing our tissue expander protocol, the complication rates at our institution have remained stable during the 10-year follow-up period. Tissue expansion in the pediatric burn population continues to be a safe and effective reconstructive option with acceptable complication rates.
