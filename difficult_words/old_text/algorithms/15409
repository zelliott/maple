Although ritodrine (RD)-hydrochloride (HCl), named RD-HCl, is widely used in the treatment of premature labor by intravenous prolonged infusion or frequent oral dosing of tablets, those administrations often lower patients' quality of life (QOL) or cause undesirable side effects, such as tachycardia; therefore, in this study, the potential usefulness of buccal administration as a novel administration method was examined in vivo.

First, the HPLC method was assessed for the determination of plasma RD concentration. Then, after RD-HCl solution in saline was administered intravenously (1 mg/kg), intragastrically (10 mg/kg) or buccally (10 mg/kg) in rats, the plasma concentration-time profiles were investigated, and the absorption extent and rate compared.

The present modified determination method by HPLC with fluorescence detection (Ex. 278 nm, Em. 306 nm) was suitable to analyze the plasma level at 8-200 ng/mL. Buccal administration gave the best plasma concentration-time profile for maintenance of an effective plasma level and fewer side effects. Absorption rates calculated by deconvolution also supported better sustained absorption in buccal dosing.

Buccal application of RD-HCl was demonstrated to be a potentially useful dosing method in the treatment of premature labor with RD-HCl.
