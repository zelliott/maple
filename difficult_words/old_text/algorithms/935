The economic consequences of an Occupational Work Evaluation designed to identify low risk patients recovering from uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and hasten their return to work was evaluated in a randomized trial. Two hundred one employed, clinically low risk men recovering from AMI were randomized to undergo an intervention (intervention group, 99 patients) consisting of an Occupational Work Evaluation or to receive usual care (usual care group, 102 patients). The time to return to work was reduced from 75 days in usual care patients to 51 days in intervention patients (p less than 0.002). Significant differences were found between groups for medical costs and occupational income during follow-up. Total medical costs per patient were lower in the intervention patients than in the usual care patients in the 6 months after AMI ($2,970 vs $3,472). Occupational income per patient was higher in intervention patients than in the usual care group in the 6 months after AMI ($9,655 vs $7,553). The per capita benefit accounting for medical costs and occupational income was $6,685 for intervention patients and $4,081 for usual care patients. Projected to the greater than 300,000 low risk, employed survivors of AMI annually in this country, the savings generated by the Occupational Work Evaluation could yield an annual economic benefit greater than 800 million dollars.
