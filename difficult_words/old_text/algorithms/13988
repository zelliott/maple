We propose novel indices of ventricular repolarization intervals, the JTp/JT, Tpe/JTp and Tpe/JT ratios. These indices have been compared with the duration of the ventricular repolarization intervals and other ratios in 17 normal subjects and 17 patients with old myocardial infarction. In the intervals and other ratios, the best separation between groups is obtained with the Tpe/QTp and Tpe/QT ratios with 94% sensitivity and 82% specificity, the proposed ratios increased sensitivity to 100% and specificity to 94%. These indices should be further tested to determine their usefulness in discriminating between OMI patients with and without susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias.
