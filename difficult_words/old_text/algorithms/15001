The recent introduction of sildenafil has revolutionized the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). The availability of sildenafil, the first effective oral agent for ED, has also expanded the field of sexual healthcare to include general and primary care practitioners and other nonurology specialists. A new process-of-care algorithm has been developed to facilitate the evaluation and treatment of ED in these nonurology settings. Sildenafil has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving >3,000 men ages 19-87 years. Sildenafil is effective across a broad range of etiologies including diabetes. For patients in whom first-line treatment with sildenafil fails or ceases to be effective, second-line interventions with intracavernosal self-injection therapy or transurethral alprostadil may be indicated. In addition to sildenafil, other oral agents such as oral phentolamine and sublingual apomorphine are now in clinical trials. Drugs under development include second-generation phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, endothelin antagonists, and agents that offer specific molecular targeting. Clinical studies are also being planned to examine the efficacy of combination oral drug regimens for ED.
