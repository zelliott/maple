Differences of two ways of training were shown in two monkeys. Random order of alteration of two conditioned signals was extremely ineffective. The use of a special algorithm of signals' administration dependent on the behaviour of a monkey made the learning of complicated tasks possible. Probable mechanisms of the effect described are discussed.
