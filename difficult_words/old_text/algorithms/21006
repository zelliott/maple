A method to remove undesired diffraction orders of computer-generated binary phase holograms is demonstrated. Normally, the reconstruction of binary Fourier holograms, made from just two phase levels, results in an undesired inverted image from the minus first diffraction order, which is superposed with the desired one. This can be avoided by reconstructing the hologram with a diffuse light field with a pseudorandom, but known, phase distribution, which is taken into account for the hologram computation. As a consequence, only the desired image is reconstructed, whereas all residual light is dispersed, propagating as a diffuse background wave. The method may be advantageous to employ ferroelectric spatial light modulators as holographic display devices, which can display only binary phase holograms, but which have the advantage of fast switching rates.
