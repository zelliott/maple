Mechanical characterization of cartilage, other soft tissues and gels has become a ubiquitous and essential aspect of biomechanics and biomaterials research. Current progress in theoretical modeling and tools for data analysis often exceed what is required for routine mechanical characterization assays in experimental studies, making selection of methodologies difficult for the nonspecialist. We have therefore developed an approach for measurement of confined compression modulus and hydraulic permeability based on simple poroelasticity theory and requiring only linear regression tools for data analysis. This technique involves a new application of an early-time solution for creep combined with stress relaxation measurements to characterize soft tissue mechanical parameters as a function of compressive strain or water content. This combined methodology allows measurement of hydraulic permeability by two different techniques with only a modest increase in experimental duration, providing a more precise assessment of permeability and associated measurement error.
