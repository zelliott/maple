One of the major theories of psychosomatic medicine is that pervasive dissociations between physiological reactivity and simultaneous emotion awareness may be an important marker for the long-term development of cardiac problems. Subjective autonomic discrepancy (SAD) scores are proposed as a method of capturing the dissociation between physiological and emotional reactivity and increasing the explanatory power of predictive models of cardiac health outcomes. It was found that SAD scores for blood pressure indices show trait-like stability over a period of 3 years. Although linear 3-year prediction of systolic blood pressure came close to traditional definitions of significance, neither a linear nor a quadratic model was found to show significant prospective validity in predicting ambulatory blood pressure change over a 10-year period. Dissociation between physiological arousal and emotional awareness does not appear to be an important variable in the identification of individuals at risk for later cardiovascular health problems.
