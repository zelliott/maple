Relationship between post-shift boron concentration and daily boron exposure was analyzed with the workers from boron mining and processing plants in Liaoning Province and population from sanitary background area far from boron industry as subjects. The results demonstrate that there was significant logarithm linearity correlativity between post-shift urine boron concentration and daily boron exposure, and the fittingness of the regression equation was up to 85.9% by considering of the effect of the different group of population, and the equation predicting daily boron exposure by post-shift urine boron concentration was determined. Daily boron exposures of the subjects in 2004 were predicted using this equation. Comparing of the daily boron exposure observed, the average of deviation between the boron exposures predicted and observed was 13.4%, and there was no significant difference between the exposure value predicted and observed. Therefore, it is feasible to predict daily boron exposure by boron concentration of post-shift urine. The analyzing of predicted daily boron exposure of all subjects in 2004 show that the daily boron exposure of peoples from occupational exposure group, community group and background control group were respectively 36.1, 4.13 and 1.31mg/d.
