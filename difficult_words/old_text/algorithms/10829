The Rainfall Runoff Library (RRL) provides a convenient platform for implementing environment modelling components such as rainfall runoff models, calibration tools, and objective functions. A rainfall-runoff model widely known and used in South Korea, TANK, is added to the RRL, and used along with the models AWBM and SIMHYD to reproduce the historical time series of daily and monthly runoff at the Soyanggang Dam and Youngcheon Dam catchments located in South Korea. The features of the RRL allow for an easy comparison of different models in a standardised and common framework. Three optimisation methods (Genetic algorithm, Rosenbrock method and Shuffled Complex Evolution algorithm) were applied to calibrate the model parameters using three different objective functions. The applicability of each model to these catchments is discussed based on the resulting statistics.
