A new approach is represented in the article to assess individual variability of heart rhythm in healthy subjects. The approach has been maintained based on the theory of adaptation and homeostasis. Homeostatic range of circulatory system reactions has been determined using ortho- and clinostatic functional exertions. Averaged duration of 5-minute cardio-intervals of ECG recording was determined using statistical analysis. The homeostatic range limits of averaged cardio-intervals may be considered as the limits of individual variability of heart rhythm. Assessment of individual variability of heart rhythm may be used to assess whether psychophysical state of a person is ready to professional activity.
