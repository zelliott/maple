The viscosity of blood obtained by using a rotational viscometer decreases with the time elapsed from the beginning of measurement until it reaches a constant value determined by the magnitude of shear rate. It is not possible to obtain an initial value of viscosity at time t = 0 that is considered to exhibit an intrinsic property of the fluid by this method. Therefore, we devised a new method by which one can obtain the viscosity of various fluids that are not affected by both the time elapsed from the beginning of measurement and the magnitude of shear rate by considering the balance of the forces acting on a solid spherical particle freely falling in a quiescent viscous fluid. By using the new method, we studied the rheologic behavior of corn syrups, carboxy-methyl cellulose, and human blood; and compared the results with those obtained with a cone-and-plate viscometer. It was found that in the case of corn syrups and washed red cell suspensions in which no red cell aggregate (rouleau) was formed, the viscosity obtained with the two different methods were almost the same. In contrast to this, in the case of the whole blood in which massive aggregates were formed, the viscosity obtained with a falling-ball viscometer was much larger than that obtained with a cone-plate viscometer.
