During labor, ephedrine is widely used to prevent or to treat maternal arterial hypotension and restore uterine perfusion pressure to avoid intrapartum fetal asphyxia. However, the effects of ephedrine on uterine blood flow have not been studied during uterine contractions. The purpose of the study was to assess the effects of ephedrine on uterine artery velocities and resistance index using the Doppler technique during the active phase of labor.

Ten normotensive, healthy parturients with uncomplicated pregnancies at term received intravenous ephedrine during labor to increase mean arterial pressure up to a maximum of 20% above their baseline pressure. Peak systolic and end-diastolic Doppler flow velocities and resistance indices were measured in the uterine artery before and immediately after administration of bolus intravenous ephedrine and after ephedrine washout. Umbilical and fetal middle cerebral arterial resistance indices and fetal heart rate were also calculated.

After ephedrine administration, mean arterial pressure increased by 17 +/- 4%. End-diastolic flow velocity in the uterine artery at peak amplitude of uterine contraction was restored to 74% of the value observed in the absence of contraction. The systolic velocity was totally restored, and the uterine resistance index was significantly decreased, compared with the values in the absence of contraction. Between uterine contractions, ephedrine induced similar but less marked effects. Fetal hemodynamic parameters were not altered by ephedrine administration.

Bolus administration of intravenous ephedrine reversed the dramatic decrease in diastolic uteroplacental blood flow velocity and the increase in resistance index during uterine contraction, without altering fetal hemodynamic parameters. This suggests that the increase in uterine perfusion pressure during labor could in part restore uterine blood flow to the placenta during uterine contraction.
