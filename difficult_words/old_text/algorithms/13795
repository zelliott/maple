We present a review of four cases of hypoglycemia caused by hyperinsulinemia that were diagnosed at our hospital during the last few years. In all of the cases the disease appeared with neurological symptoms (seizures) for the first months of life, followed by hypoglycemia. We propose a diagnostic algorithm which could be used with hypoglycemia cases. In addition, the diagnostic tests are discussed, as well as the treatment applied and the later evolution of each patient.
