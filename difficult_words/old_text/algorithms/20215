Three patients with occult severe hyperflexion sprain of the lower cervical spine are described. Because the spine radiographs obtained at the time of trauma were physiologically normal, the complete instability was initially overlooked. The authors recommend an algorithm for adequate diagnosis of this condition. Posterior cervical fusion is the treatment of choice.
