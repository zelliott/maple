Osteoarthrosis of the hip may be treated by osteotomy, but surgeons report variable results, and there is no consensus regarding which method to use in choosing the type of osteotomy. The authors defined three biomechanical measures of hip incongruence (characteristic point locus, joint space, and contact region) and developed a two-dimensional frontal plane model to compute joint incongruence over the joint range of motion during normal activities of daily living. The preoperative measures were calculated for 38 patients who had undergone osteotomy at least 5 years earlier. The authors calculated the measures throughout a functional range of motion after 13 stimulated varus or valgus osteotomies. A logistic regression analysis determined which, if any, of the three measures, in conjunction with other clinical variables, correctly predicted outcome. The average values for the characteristic point locus, joint space, and contact region measures ranged from 0.260 cm to 2.127 cm, 0.963 cm2 to 9.327 cm2, and 0.063 cm to 4.230 cm, respectively. Unimodal behavior between two of the three measures (joint space and contact region) and osteotomy angle were observed, suggesting these two would be the most useful in predicting an optimal osteotomy. The most significant independent variable predicting clinical outcome was the joint space measure. This supports the potential of an optimization approach for determining the best angle for a hip osteotomy.
