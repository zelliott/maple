We report the development of a high-speed wide-field fluorescence-lifetime imaging (FLIM) system that provides fluorescence-lifetime images at rates of as many as 29 frames/s. A FLIM multiwell plate reader and a potentially portable FLIM endoscopic system operating at 355-nm excitation have been demonstrated.
