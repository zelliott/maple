A delayed diagnosis of injury to cervicothoracic vessels from blunt trauma may cause significant adverse sequelae. The association of a cervicothoracic seat belt sign with such an injury is unknown.

Algorithms were prospectively studied for the detection of occult vascular injury in patients with cervicothoracic seat belt signs. Patients with neck seat belt signs underwent arteriography or computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Those with thoracic seat belt signs underwent aortography/arteriography if a ruptured thoracic aorta or injury to a great vessel was suspected or a neurovascular abnormality was present.

During a 17-month period, 797 patients were admitted to the trauma service secondary to motor vehicle crashes. One hundred thirty-one (16.4%) had cervical or thoracic seat belt signs. Four (3%) of the patients had carotid artery injuries, the presence of which was strongly associated with a Glasgow Coma Scale score < 14, an Injury Severity Score > 16 (p < 0.0001), and the presence of a clavicle and/or first rib fracture (p < 0.0037). Of the remaining patients, 17 had thoracic trauma. There were no vascular injuries in the children and only one had thoracic trauma.

The algorithms are safe and accurate for the detection of cervicothoracic vascular injury in adult and pediatric patients with seat belt signs. The cervicothoracic seat belt mark and an abnormal physical examination are an effective combination in screening for cervicothoracic vascular injury.
