We present an iterative camera aperture design procedure, which determines an optimal mask pattern based on a sparse set of desired intensity distributions at different focal depths. This iterative method uses the ambiguity function as a tool to shape the camera's response to defocus, and shares conceptual similarities with phase retrieval procedures. An analysis of algorithm convergence is presented, and experimental examples are shown to demonstrate the flexibility of the design process. This algorithm potentially ties together previous disjointed PSF design approaches under a common framework, and offers new insights for the creation of future application-specific imaging systems.
