An experimental design involving sequences of m distinct events can be conceptualized as an nth-order transition probability matrix specifying the probabilities with which each of the m distinct events is to follow certain n-grams. This paper describes a general method for constructing sequences of shortest possible length that satisfy any such matrix and presents a computer program that randomly generates such sequences.
