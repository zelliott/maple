A random-walk simulation of microdialysis is used to examine how a reaction that consumes analyte in the medium external to the probe affects the extraction and recovery processes. The simulations suggest that such a reaction can promote the extraction process while simultaneously inhibiting the recovery process, which appears to be consistent with recent experimental evidence of asymmetry in the extraction and recovery of the neurotransmitter, dopamine, during brain microdialysis. This suggests that quantitative microdialysis strategies that rely on the extraction fraction as a measure of the probe recovery value, such as the no-net-flux method, will produce an underestimate of the analyte concentration in the external medium when that analyte is consumed by a reaction in the external medium. Furthermore, if experimental conditions arise under which the kinetics of the reaction are changed, then changes in the extraction and recovery processes are likely to occur as well. The implications of these theoretical findings for the quantitative interpretation of in vivo microdialysis results obtained for the neurotransmitter dopamine are examined.
