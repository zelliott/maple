To use Chlamydia trachomatis immunoglobulin-gamma (IgG) titers to investigate the possibility of their association with ovarian cancer, and to evaluate the effectiveness of this titer in algorithmic protocols in infertility.

Prospective, age-matched, pilot study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).

University and university-affiliated office practice.

The original 30 patients were seen for follow-up of ovarian cancer (19) and at yearly examination for nonmalignant disease (10). An additional group of 21 women seen for pelvic pain and infertility was added to clarify questions that arose during the study.

None.

Chlamydia trachomatis IgG titers were positive in 15 (79%) of 19 of women with ovarian cancer, 9 (90%) of 10 age-matched controls, and 14 (67%) of 21 patients with infertility and pain. When analyzed by age, 4 (40%) of 10 patients under 30 years and 34 (85%) of 40 patients 30 years of age or older had positive titers (p = 0.007). Of 21 women with positive Chlamydia pneumoniae titers, 17 (81 %) had positive C. trachomatis titers, and 17 (85%) of 20 with positive C. trachomatis titers had positive C. pneumoniae titers.

The test kit used in this study may not be adequate in older patients due to cross-reaction with C. pneumoniae titers. Further evaluation of C. trachomatis IgG titers as a marker in the study of ovarian cancer will require titers that are more specific than those we used. Although these titers may be useful as an immunologic screening marker in infertile patients, results should be interpreted with caution. A positive test may not be evidence of C. trachomatis infection and is not an indication for specific therapy. Successful use of some currently available C. trachomatis IgG titers in algorithms for infertility may be related to a patient's age.
