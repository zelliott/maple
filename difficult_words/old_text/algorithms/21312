New systematic methods developed for equilibrium isotope exchange kinetics have been used to analyze the effects of activator ATP and inhibitor CTP with Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase. This indepth approach requires (a) variation of [modifier] with fixed subsaturating levels of substrates, and (b) variation of at least three combinations of reactant-product pairs in constant ratio at equilibrium: [A,B,P,Q], [A,P], and [B,Q] with the co-substrates held constant, in the presence and absence of added modifier. Both ATP and CTP had much stronger effects on the [14C]Asp in equilibrium C-Asp exchange rate than on [32P]C-P in equilibrium Pi. The bisubstrate analog N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate activated, then inhibited, Asp in equilibrium C-Asp more strongly than C-P in equilibrium Pi. N-Phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate gave complete (100%) inhibition, whereas CTP inhibition of either exchange was only partial. Substrate saturation curves in the presence and absence of effectors indicate that ATP and CTP perturb the observed values of Rmax and S0.5 in different fashions without appreciably changing the observed Hill number. Computer simulations indicate that the primary site of ATP and CTP action is the association rate for Asp, not the allosteric T-R transition. This finding is substantiated by previous studies in which modified aspartate transcarbamoylase had lost cooperative Asp binding without loss of sensitivity to effectors, or in which sensitivity to one effector could be deleted selectively. The present results, with newly devised computer simulation and analysis methods, illustrate the usefulness of equilibrium isotope exchange kinetic probes for providing unique insights to enzyme regulatory mechanisms, to define exactly which steps are altered in a given kinetic mechanism.
