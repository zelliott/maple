In this study, the optimal viscoelastic material parameters of axon and extracellular matrix (ECM) in porcine brain white matter were identified using a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization procedure. The procedure was combined with micromechanical finite element analysis (FEA) of brain tissue and experimental stress relaxation tests on brainstem specimens to find the optimal material coefficients of axon and ECM. The stress relaxation tests were performed in tension on 10 brainstem specimens at 3% strain level. The axonal volume fraction in brainstem was measured from the Scanning Electron Microscopy images of the brain tissue. A square periodic volume element was selected to represent the microscale homogenized brainstem tissue. Periodic boundary conditions were applied on the square volume element to mimics the repetitive nature of the volume element. Linear viscoelastic material properties were assumed for the brain tissue constituents under small deformation. The constitutive behavior was expressed in terms of Prony series. The GA procedure searched for the optimal material parameters by fitting the time-dependent tissue stresses of brain tissue FEA to the stresses of relaxation tests under the same loading conditions. The optimization procedure converged after 60 iterations. The initial elastic modulus of axon was found to be 12.86kPa, three times larger than that of ECM. The long-term elastic modulus of axon was 3.7kPa, while for ECM this value was 1.03kPa. The concordance correlation coefficient between FEA estimated elastic modulus of brainstem tissue using the optimal material properties and the experimental elastic modulus of brainstem specimens was 0.952, showing a strong agreement. The optimal material properties of brain tissue constituents can find applications in micromechanical analysis of brain tissue to gain insight into diffuse axonal injures (DAIs).
