Two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods for the investigation of correlation and exchange have been introduced in recent years and have been applied to a range of different systems. Here, we report on the use of 2D NMR diffusion-diffusion correlation spectroscopy for the investigation of diffusion anisotropy in cellular plant tissues and of diffusion-diffusion exchange spectroscopy for the study of the diffusive exchange of dextran in a dispersion of polyelectrolyte multilayer hollow capsules. Furthermore, diffusion-relaxation correlation spectroscopy was applied to both systems.
