More than 10 years experience in implementing the Tanaka Johnston and Moyers methods has shown that  they overestimate the sizes of unerupted canines and premolars when used in populations other than the Caucasian. This  study was designed to assess the applicability of the two most commonly used methods of mixed dentition analysis and to  attempt to derive a more accurate and precise formula to predict the sizes of the unerupted premolars and canines in a  sample of Indian population.

The sample included 200 study models (100 male, 100 female).  Tanaka Johnston's and Moyer's equations were applied to this sample and the mean differences between the actual and  estimated tooth widths were determined. New regression equations were derived using lower first molars and incisors as the  predictors.

The mean difference between the actual and estimated values of canines and premolars using Tanaka  Johnston's and Moyers methods were clinically and statistically significant. Therefore new regression equations were  derived taking lower first molars and incisors as the predictors for both sexes. On validation, these equations were found to  be accurate and precise for this population.

It is recommended to use these equations as a method of mixed  dentition analysis for the Indian population.
