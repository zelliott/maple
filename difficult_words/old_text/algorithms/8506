Exact closed-form expressions are presented for the properties of the McGhee-von Hippel model of non-specific binding of large ligands to one-dimensional homogeneous lattices. These properties include the midpoint location and the slope at the middle point of the binding isotherms (v varies with ln L plots), the location and magnitude of the maximum, as well as the location of the inflection point, in the Scatchard plots (v/L varies with v plots).
