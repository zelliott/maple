Diagnosis of AS and periaqueductal abnormalities by routine MR imaging sequences is challenging for neuroradiologists. The aim of our study was to evaluate the utility of the 3D-SPACE sequence with VFAM in patients with suspected AS.

PC-MRI and 3D-SPACE images were obtained in 21 patients who had hydrocephalus on routine MR imaging scans and had clinical suspicion of AS, as well as in 12 control subjects. Aqueductal patency was visually scored (grade 0, normal; grade 1, partial obstruction; grade 2, complete stenosis) by 2 experienced radiologists on PC-MRI (plus routine T1-weighted and T2-weighted images) and 3D-SPACE images. Two separate scores were statistically compared with each other as well as with the consensus scores obtained from general agreement of both radiologists.

There was an excellent correlation between 3D-SPACE and PC-MRI scores (Îº = 0.828). The correlation between 3D-SPACE scorings and consensus-based scorings was higher compared with the correlation between PC-MRI and consensus-based scorings (r = 1, P < .001 and r = 0.966, P < .001, respectively).

3D-SPACE sequence with VFAM alone can be used for adequate and successful evaluation of the aqueductal patency without the need for additional sequences and examinations. Noninvasive evaluation of the whole cranium is possible in a short time with high resolution by using 3D-SPACE.
