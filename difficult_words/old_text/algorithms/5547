A second-order multivariate calibration method based on a combination of unfolded partial least-squares (U-PLS) with residual bilinearization (RBL) has been applied to second-order data obtained from excitation-emission fluorescence matrices for determining atenolol in human urine, even in the presence of background interactions and fluorescence inner filter effects, which are both sample dependent. Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, which is considered a doping agent in shoot practice, so that its determination in urine can be required for monitoring the drug. Loss of trilinearity due to analyte-background interactions which may vary between samples, as well as inner filter effects, precludes the use of methods like parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) that cannot handle trilinearity deviations, and justifies the employment of U-PLS. Successful analysis required to include the background in the calibration set. Unexpected components appear in new urine samples, different from those used in calibration set, requiring the second-order advantage which is obtained from a separate procedure known as residual bilinearization (RBL). Satisfactory results were obtained for artificially spiked urines, and also for real urine samples. They were statistically compared with those obtained applying a reference method based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
