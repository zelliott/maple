Since the beginning of the millennium, the development of wireless capsule endoscopy has represented a major technological advance. The capsule is ingested by the patient and images are transmitted via several sensors positioned on the skin of the patient and downloaded in a computer system. The first applications were focused on the exploration of the small bowel which was previously considered as an obscure area for conventional endoscopy. Wireless capsule endoscopy of the small bowel is now an established technique with many acknowledged indications for the diagnosis of obscure bleeding, anemia of presumed digestive origin, Crohn's disease and small bowel tumors. Recently, thanks to technological progresses, novel capsules have been developed for specific segments of the gut namely the oesophagus and the colon. Recent data suggest that these new capsules could have potential applications for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices, Barrett's oesophagus and for the screening and/or surveillance of polyps of the colon. However, further studies are required before such strategies could be approved for clinical use or even replace conventional endoscopic modalities. In the long-term, progresses in signal processing as well as in the miniaturisation of sensors or markers may lead to a new generation of endoscopic robots. This technological breakthrough may ultimately result in new concepts and change current practice of digestive endoscopy.
