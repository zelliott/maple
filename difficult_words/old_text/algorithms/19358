We determined the value of attenuation correction (AC) of myocardial perfusion estimation with (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT in overweight patients by comparison of uncorrected (filtered back-projection (FBP) and corrected (an iterative algorithm with a measured attenuation coefficients map (FL-AC)) (99m)Tc-MIBI relative uptake to perfusion data obtained in the same patients with NH3 PET. In addition, the impact of attenuation correction for the assessment of myocardial viability with (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT was determined using FDG PET as the reference method.

Thirty consecutive overweight patients (BMI=28+/-4) with left ventricular dysfunction underwent a resting (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT and a PET study (NH3 and FDG). (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT scans were reconstructed without attenuation correction (FBP) and with attenuation correction (FL-AC). The left ventricle was divided into 16 segments, in which the relative uptake was quantified using circumferential profiles. A relative uptake > or = 60% was considered consistent with viable myocardium for FDG and MIBI.

The absolute difference between (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT and NH3 PET uptakes was less pronounced in the inferior (12+/-10% vs. 17+/-12%, P<0.001), anteroseptal (12+/-11% vs. 16+/-12%, P=0.009) and septal (15+/-12% vs. 18+/-14%, P=0.003) regions (FL-AC vs. FBP, respectively). The sensitivity of MIBI for diagnosing myocardial viability increased from 83 to 100% (P=0.034), without loss in specificity.

Attenuation correction improves myocardial perfusion estimation by (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT in the inferior, anteroseptal and septal regions and increases its sensitivity for the diagnosis of myocardial viability.
