Determining the optimal conditions for surface regeneration is fundamental for performance of efficient and robust protein-protein interaction kinetic studies. We devised a systematic methodology comprised of an automated seven-cycle analyte and buffer injection Biacore scheme and data interpretation algorithm. The efficiency and utility is illustrated using an antigen/monoclonal antibody interaction that required ultimately six pulses of acid for regeneration. This technique has broad applicability to any biosensor assay that requires regeneration of a surface.
