The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) recommended that a display be provided on the operating console of medical computed tomography (CT) scanners when the geometric efficiency (GE) in the z-axis is 70% or less. Taking into account the increase in the number of detector rows and the changes in the scanning method, the present study was conducted to review the GE and to evaluate the exposure dose in the z-axis direction. The GE for a single-rotation scan was calculated in accordance with IEC-606024 Ed. 2. The findings of the present study suggest that 320-row area detector computed tomography volume scan (single axial scan with no table movement in which it just happened to use a very large beam width) extends 18.8 mm beyond the nominal beam collimation, even when the GE is >70%. However, compared with the helical scan, which is the present mainstream of CT examinations, the dose beyond the scan length is narrower in volume scan for a limited scan length of 160 mm or less.
