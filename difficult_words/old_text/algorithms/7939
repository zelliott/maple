Total hip arthroplasty (THA) significantly improves the quality of life in majority of patients with severe osteoarthritis. However, long-term outcomes of THAs are compromised by aseptic loosening and periprosthetic osteolysis which needs revision surgery. Both of these are causally linked to a prosthetic wear deliberated from the prosthetic articulating surfaces. As a result, there is a need to measure the mode and magnitude of wear. The paper evaluates three optical methods proposed for construction of a device for the non-contact prosthetic wear measurement. Of them, the scanning profilometry achieved promising combination of accuracy and repeatability. Simultaneously, it is time efficient to enable the development of a sensor for wear measurement.
