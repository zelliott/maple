To investigate the maternal hemodynamic changes that occurs during pregnancy. To find out the difference that lie in healthy pregnancy and women with gestational hypertension. To introduce a method that is applied to shift high-risk women of gestational hypertension in pregnancy women.

Serial hemodynamic investigations (total 8 times) were performed throughout pregnancy period by radioulnar pulse wave electrical monitoring in 182 women (130 with healthy pregnancies, 52 with gestational hypertension). Analysis of variance with repeated measurements was used to evaluate the course of a number of hemodynamic indices. To identify the correlation between these changes and gestational hypertension by using above method.

A significant difference in mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), total Peripheral Resistance (TPR) and heart rat (HR) was observed different between normal pregnancy and women with gestational hypertension. The changes of parameters in normal woman and gestational hypertension were recorded and the mechanism of gestational hypertension was heterogenous.

These results provide sensitive parameters for use in early risk assessment and as a guide to preventive intervention during pregnancy.
