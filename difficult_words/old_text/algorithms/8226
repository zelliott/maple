In circular cone-beam CT the Feldkamp [Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK)] algorithm is the most prominent image reconstruction algorithm. For example, in radiation oncology images reconstructed with the Feldkamp algorithm are used for accurate patient positioning. The scan and reconstruction volumes are limited by the size of the flat panel detector. Flat panel detectors, however, are expensive and difficult to manufacture in large size. For numerous treatment techniques, extending this scan volume would be very beneficial. In most applications, data from 360 degrees or more are available. However, usually only those slices are reconstructed where each pixel is seen under the full 360 degree range. Yet for a 360 degree scan there are regions that are seen by less than 360 degrees, namely, those that lie further off the plane of the circular source trajectory. Performing a reconstruction also for those slices where all voxels are seen at least by 180 degrees will extend the z range and therefore increase the dose usage. In this work a new method is presented that reconstructs also those slices where some or all pixels receive less than 360 degrees but at least 180 degrees of the data. The procedure significantly increases the longitudinal range of the reconstructed volume. As opposed to the existing techniques, the proposed method does not necessitate any multiple convolutions or multiple backprojections, lending itself therefore for a very efficient implementation. To validate the abilities of the extended reconstruction, the authors performed an evaluation of the image quality by using simulated and measured CT data. The method shows good image quality on simulated phantom data as well as on clinical patient scans. Image noise and spatial resolution behave as expected. This means that the noise equals FDK values in the normal region and increases in the extended region due to reduced data redundancies. The extended Feldkamp demonstrates its ability to extend the reconstructable z range and appears to be useful in clinical practice.
