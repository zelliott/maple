Modern hospital nursing management requires timely and accurate information to allow nurse managers to adjust resources to patient requirements. We report an experience using production theory to provide the framework for the development of Decision Support Objects: graphic displays of nursing hours budgeted, scheduled, and worked within institution-specific control limits. Every month, nurse managers follow an analytic algorithm to understand nursing resources and trends on their units. Exception reporting closes the accountability loop. The essentials of education for nurse managers include skill training in the use of the decision-support tools and supportive lecture/seminars for understanding the managerial implications of using them.
