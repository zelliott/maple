We report an unsupervised structural motif discovery algorithm, FoldMiner, which is able to detect global and local motifs in a database of proteins without the need for multiple structure or sequence alignments and without relying on prior classification of proteins into families. Motifs, which are discovered from pairwise superpositions of a query structure to a database of targets, are described probabilistically in terms of the conservation of each secondary structure element's position and are used to improve detection of distant structural relationships. During each iteration of the algorithm, the motif is defined from the current set of homologs and is used both to recruit additional homologous structures and to discard false positives. FoldMiner thus achieves high specificity and sensitivity by distinguishing between homologous and nonhomologous structures by the regions of the query to which they align. We find that when two proteins of the same fold are aligned, highly conserved secondary structure elements in one protein tend to align to highly conserved elements in the second protein, suggesting that FoldMiner consistently identifies the same motif in members of a fold. Structural alignments are performed by an improved superposition algorithm, LOCK 2, which detects distant structural relationships by placing increased emphasis on the alignment of secondary structure elements. LOCK 2 obeys several properties essential in automated analysis of protein structure: It is symmetric, its alignments of secondary structure elements are transitive, its alignments of residues display a high degree of transitivity, and its scoring system is empirically found to behave as a metric.
