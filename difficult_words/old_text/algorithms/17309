To determine the role of total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) and the prognosis of patients with mycosis fungoides.

From 1978 to 1996, 66 consecutive patients with mycosis fungoides received 30 Gy TSEBT delivered in 12 fractions over 40 days as treatment of their relapsed after topical or/and systemic therapy. All patients were staged as follows: stage A, superficial lesions covering less than 50% of the body surface; stage B, superficial lesions covering more than 50% of the body surface; Stage C. tumors involving the skin, lymph nodes and/or visceral organs.

The median age was 50 years (ranging from 13-78 years). There were 39 males and 27 females. The minimum follow-up was 12 months (range 12-192 months). There were 24 (36%) stage A patients, 22 (33%) stage B patients, and 20 (30%) stage C patients. The overall survival at 5 years for our series was as follows: 93% for stage A; 79% for stage B, and 44% for stage C disease (P = 0.002). For the entire cohort, the complete remission rate was 65%, the progression-free survival (PFS) at 5 years and 10 years was 30 and 18% respectively. For the group A, PFS was 62% at 5 years and 46% at 10 years; for group B, PFS was 19% at 5 years.

This study suggests that TSEBT gives good results for relapsed stage A disease. Total skin electron beam therapy combined with local fields irradiation or other local treatment (puvatherapy or topical nitrogen mustard) might further improve permanent complete response for stage B patients. The most advanced stages of mycosis fungoides are not controlled by TSEBT, but the radiation therapy offers good palliation results.
