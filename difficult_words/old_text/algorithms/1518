The first integrated map of chromosome 1 was published in 1992. We present an updated summary map of 371 loci constructed from a location database that includes physical and genetic data. The summary map subsumes a composite physical location, sex-specific genetic location, cytogenetic assignment, mouse homology, rank and references to physical maps. The genetic length is 208 cM for the male map, in close agreement with the chiasma map, and 371 cM for the female map. There is evidence for a high level of interference on chromosome 1. The location database comprising both data and analytical software is discussed in relation to alternative approaches and possible enhancements.
