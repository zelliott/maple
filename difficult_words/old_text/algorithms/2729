A series of novel benzophenone derivatives were prepared and their inhibitory activities were evaluated on hPin1. Of all the synthesized compounds, the most active compound displayed inhibitory activities with an IC(50) value of 5.99 Î¼mol/L. Preliminary structure-activity relationships were analyzed in details and the binding mode of the titled compounds was predicted using FlexX algorithm. The results of this research will shed light on further design and optimization of novel small molecule Pin1 inhibitors.
