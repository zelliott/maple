The short-time dynamic properties of colloidal particles in quasi-two-dimensional geometries are studied by digital video microscopy. We demonstrate experimentally that the effective-two-dimensional physical quantities such as the dynamic structure factor, the hydrodynamic function, and the hydrodynamic diffusion coefficients are related in exactly the same manner as their three-dimensional counterparts.
