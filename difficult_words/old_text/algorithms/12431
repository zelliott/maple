A linear quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model is presented for modeling and predicting induction of apoptosis by 4-aryl-4H-chromenes. The model was produced by using the multiple linear regression (MLR) technique on a database that consists of 43 recently discovered 4-aryl-4H-chromenes. Among the 61 different physicochemical, topological, and structural descriptors that were considered as inputs to the model, seven variables were selected using the elimination selection-stepwise regression method (ES-SWR). The physical meaning of each descriptor is discussed. The accuracy of the proposed MLR model is illustrated using the following evaluation techniques: cross-validation, validation through an external test set, and Y-randomization. Furthermore, the domain of applicability which indicates the area of reliable predictions is defined.
