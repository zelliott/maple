The effects of a diet based on Mediterranean patterns on iron bioavailability and iron status in adolescents were studied. The study was divided into two periods: basal period, in which 21 male adolescents consumed their habitual diet (basal diet); and nutritional intervention period, during which an experimental diet based on the Mediterranean model was consumed. Dietary iron utilization was studied by means of iron intake and iron output in faeces and urine, and iron status was analysed in fasting blood samples collected at the end of each period. No differences in total iron intake were found between diets, but consumption of the experimental diet increased iron absorption and retention compared with the basal diet. Biochemical parameters related to iron metabolism did not vary after the intervention period, although serum ferritin tended to increase. Therefore, a diet based on Mediterranean dietary patterns may improve dietary iron utilization during adolescence and may prevent iron deficiency.
