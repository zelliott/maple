We present a method based on spatially resolved fluorescence measurement for the simultaneous estimation of optical transport parameters, namely, the reduced scattering coefficient (micro s'), the absorption coefficient (micro a), and the intrinsic fluorescence spectra from turbid media. The accuracy of this approach was tested by conducting studies on a series of tissue-simulating phantoms with known optical transport properties. The estimated relative error in the values for micro s' and micro a using this technique was found to be < or =10%. Furthermore, the line shape and intensity of the intrinsic fluorescence recovered by using this approach were observed to be free from the distorting effects of the wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering properties of the medium, and they were in excellent agreement with the directly measured intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the fluorophores.
