A solid phase fluorescence spectroscopic batch procedure for (acetyl) salicylic acid in drug formulations have been developed. The procedure is based on the sorption of salicylic acid (SA) on Sephadex DEAE A-25 anion exchanger gel (100 mg) by equilibration from an aqueous solution (10 or 25 ml) for 5 min; the equilibrated gel is transferred into an 1 mm quartz cell and the native fluorescence of SA sorbed on it is directly measured (lambda(ex)=297 nm; lambda(em)=405 nm). Good linearity was found in the 10-200 and 5-100 microg l(-1) ranges (for 10 and 25 ml sample volume, respectively) with R.S.D. (%) of 2.8 and 1.1. The procedure was successfully applied to the determination of acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) in drug formulations after alkaline hydrolysis to yield SA.
