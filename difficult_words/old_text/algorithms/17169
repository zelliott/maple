We have developed an objective, quantitative, and general algorithm to improve the fidelity of three-dimensional reconstructions made from electron micrographs while at the same time filtering much of the noise present in the recorded data. The new technique is called constrained maximum entropy tomography (COMET). The essence of the method is that it will produce the most featureless reconstruction that fits the projection data within their observational accuracy. In particular, the COMET procedure will minimise the detrimental effects of errors in the measured data and deconvolute the effects of the contrast transfer function. An objective test has been performed using COMET on a conventional image reconstruction obtained from cryo-electron micrographs of adenovirus. The density for hexon, the major coat protein of the virus, which is known to high resolution from X-ray crystallography, provided a known high-resolution control. The COMET reconstruction is in considerably better agreement with the crystallographic electron density than the original reconstruction, throughout the entire resolution range.
