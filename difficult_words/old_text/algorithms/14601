Aiming to detect the stage of gestation where dynamical changes of the RR fluctuations may occur, we assessed short-term fluctuations of low risk pregnant women. Ninety six, 10min ECG recordings were collected along gestation (7 to 39 weeks). Corresponding RR fluctuations series were analysed to obtain the RMSSD, α(1), α(1(mag)) and α(1(sign)) parameters. Four groups covering first, second and last trimesters of gestation were conformed. No significant changes in α(1), which was close to unit, and α(1(sign)) among gestational groups were identified. But, in accordance with previous findings, we did find a significant reduction of RMSSD along gestation, and significant short-term changes that indicate a higher degree of nonlinearity after about 26 weeks of gestation (α(1(mag))>0.5)). These results suggest that the short-term heart rate dynamics of low risk pregnant women do not become compromised during gestation, despite the increased haemodynamic demands and other ongoing adaptations. Yet the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the cardiac regulation of pregnant women does seem to increase from mid-pregnancy, possibly owing to new short-term control influences or to modifications regardless the strength of the regulatory interactions.
