A series of nanocomposite materials were synthesized using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and NiO nanoparticles by varying the concentration of NiO in the MWCNT host matrix. Such an increment in the NiO particle density actually tunes the degree of isolation among the magnetic nanoparticles. Careful investigation by transmission electron microscopy shows that particle agglomeration increases substantially with NiO particle density. Field dependence of magnetization measurements depict a gradual enhancement of coercivity with increasing NiO concentration, signifying the enhancement of magnetic anisotropy in this nanocomposite system. Furthermore, field cooled and zero field cooled memory effect as well as magnetization relaxation measurements show that a glassy magnetic state gradually develops when the concentration increases. Analysis based on the result of high resolution transmission electron microscopy along with the magnetization data reveals that interparticle magnetic exchange interaction in the presence of interfacial disorders plays the major role in the emergence of the glassy magnetic state in this nanocomposite system.
