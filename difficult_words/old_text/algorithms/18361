To validate the test duration in frequency doubling perimetry as an independent criterion to screen for glaucomatous field defects.

Prospective cross-sectional study

Group I included 85 eyes (85 patients) with established field defects on automated perimetry. Group II comprised 41 normal eyes (41 subjects). Both groups underwent Swedish interactive testing algorithm standard tests as well as frequency doubling perimetry (C20-1). A cutoff level of 90 seconds was used to calculate test duration sensitivity and specificity. We also categorized patients into those who took <=90 seconds or less and those who took >90 seconds to complete the test and compared frequency doubling perimetry (any two abnormal points) with Swedish interactive testing algorithm in these groups.

Duration of the test >90 seconds had 97.5% specificity with 62.3% sensitivity. Eleven subjects with glaucoma completed test in <91 seconds).

Test duration alone has a limited value in screening for glaucoma.
