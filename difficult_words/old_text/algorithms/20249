A multi-signal-processor set-up is introduced that is used for real-time implementation of digital hearing aid algorithms that operate on stereophonic (i.e., binaural) input signals and perform signal processing in the frequency domain. A multiband dynamic compression algorithm was implemented which operates in 24 critical band filter channels, allows for interaction between frequency bands and stereo channels, and is fitted to the hearing of the individual patient by a loudness scaling method. In addition, a binaural noise reduction algorithm was implemented that amplifies sound emanating from the front and suppresses lateral noise sources as well as reverberation. These algorithms were optimized with respect to their processing parameters and by minimizing the processing artifacts. Different versions of the algorithms were tested in six listeners with sensorineural hearing impairment using both subjective quality assessment methods and speech intelligibility measurements in different acoustical situations. For most subjects, linear frequency shaping was subjectively assessed to be negative, although it improved speech intelligibility in noise. Additional compression was assessed to be positive and did not deteriorate speech intelligibility as long as the processing parameters were fitted carefully. All noise reduction strategies employed here were subjectively assessed to be positive. Although the suppression of reverberation only slightly improved speech intelligibility, a combination of directional filtering and dereverberation provided a substantial improvement in speech intelligibility for most subjects and for a certain range of signal-to-noise ratios. The real-time implementation was very helpful in optimizing and testing the algorithms, and the overall results indicate that carefully designed and fitted binaural hearing aids might be very beneficial for a large number of patients.
