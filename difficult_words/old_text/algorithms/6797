The process of delivering an IMRT treatment may involve various beam-modifying techniques such as multileaf collimators (MLCs), the NOMOS MIMiC, blocks, wedges, etc. In the case of the MLC, the spatial/temporal variation of the position of the leaves and diaphragms in the beam allows the delivery of modulated beam profiles either by the multiple-static-field (MSF) method or by the dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) method. The constraints associated with the IMRT delivery technique are usually neglected in the process of obtaining the 'optimal' inverse treatment plan. Consequently, dose optimization may be significantly reduced when the 'optimal' beam profiles are converted to leaf/diaphragm positions via a leaf-sequencing interpreter. The paper presented here assesses the effects on the optimum treatment plan of the following leaf-sequencing algorithms: MSF, DMLC and NOMOS MIMiC. The results obtained suggest that the delivery of an 'optimum' plan produces an overdosage of the PTV region due to various factors such as leaf/diaphragm transmission effects, head-scatter and phantom-scatter contributions. The overdosage observed for a cohort of ten patients was 2.5, 3.7 and 5.7%, respectively, for the DMLC, MSF and NOMOS MIMiC, after normalizing the delivered fluence to account for IMRT effects (using the method of Convery et al (Convery D J, Cogrove V P and Webb S 2000 Proc. 13th Int. Conf. on Computers in Radiotherapy (Heidelberg, 2000)) such as to obtain 70 Gy at the isocentre. The IMRT techniques DMLC, MIMiC and MSF were compared for the organs at risk: rectum, bladder, and left and right femoral heads.
