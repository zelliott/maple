A theoretical model is proposed to calculate the equivalent model the electromechanical properties of (1-3-2) piezocomposite. Piezoelectric equations of state were derived in terms of equivalent parameters based on linear electromechanical response and uniform field theories. Equivalent parameters (g31, g33, beta33, d31, d33, epsilon33) of 1-3-2 piezocomposite were obtained. The computed g31 is -19.9 x 10(-3) V x m/N(-1), g33 is 68.4 x 10(-3) V x m/N(-1), d31 is -98 x 10(-12) C/N, d33 is 336 x 10(-12) C/N, and epsilonT33/epsilon0 is 555, while the volume fraction of piezoelectric phase nu1 is 0.4 and nu2 is 0.1. The variation of composite properties with volume fraction of piezoelectric phase have been modeled and experimentally verified. The computed d31, d33, and epsilon33 are within 12.5, 6.7, and 8.4% of experimental values, respectively.
