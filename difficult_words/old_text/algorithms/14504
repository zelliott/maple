The adsorption of 1-naphthylamine on multiwall carbon nanotubes/iron oxides/β-cyclodextrin composite (denoted by MWCNTs/iron oxides/CD) prepared by using plasma-induced grafting technique was investigated by batch technique under ambient conditions. The effect of contact time, pH, adsorbent content, temperature and initial 1-naphthylamine concentration, on 1-naphthylamine adsorption to MWCNTs/iron oxides/CD was examined. The adsorption of 1-naphthylamine on MWCNTs/iron oxides/CD was dependent on pH, adsorbent content, and temperature. The 1-napthylamien was adsorbed rapidly at the first 50h, and thereafter attained the adsorption saturation at 80h. The adsorption kinetic data were well described by the pseuso-second-order rate model. The adsorption isotherms were fitted by the Langmuir model better than by the Freundlich model. The maximum adsorption capacity of 1-naphthylamine was 200.0mg/g. The adsorption thermodynamic parameters of standard enthalpy (ΔH(0)), standard entropy changes (ΔS(0)), and standard free energy (ΔG(0)) were calculated from temperature dependent adsorption isotherms. The values of ΔH(0) and ΔG(0) suggested that the adsorption of 1-naphthylamine on MWCNTs/iron oxides/CD was endothermic and spontaneous. The electron-donor-acceptor interaction, Hydrophobic interaction, and Lewis acid-base interaction may play an important role in 1-naphthylamine adsorption. The results show that MWCNTs/iron oxides/CD is a promising magnetic nanomaterial for the preconcentration and separation of organic pollutants from aqueous solutions in environmental pollution cleanup.
