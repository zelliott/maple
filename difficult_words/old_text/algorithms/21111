In the last 10 years many advances have been achieved in the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease, particularly in the field of biological agents. Infliximab, a tumour necrosis factor alpha antagonist, has been recently added to the therapeutic armamentarium for Crohn's disease and has greatly improved our treatment options. Infliximab has demonstrated efficacy in the induction and maintenance of remission in luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease both in adults and children. However, the potential development of autoantibodies and the risk of serious adverse events limit the possibility of a wider use of infliximab. Searching for less immunogenicity and higher effectiveness in the last years a number of biological agents have been developed. Adalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody anti tumour necrosis factor alpha, has resulted effective and safe in patients with Crohn's disease, both naive and refractory to infliximab, presenting also the advantage of subcutaneous way of administration. Natalizumab also showed promising results in terms of efficacy but its safety is still under investigation. To date no particular advances have been recently appeared in the literature concerning conventional immunosuppressive drugs. Surgery remains a valid resort for refractory patients. Autologous stem cell transplantation represents a new hope as rescue treatment for patients with severe refractory Crohn's disease.
