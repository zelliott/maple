Laminar vortical flow around a fully opened Bj√∂rk-Shiley valve in an aorta is obtained by solving the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Used is a noniterative implicit finite-element Navier-Stokes code developed by the authors, which makes use of the well-known finite difference algorithm PISO. The code utilizes segregated formulation and efficient iterative matrix solvers such as PCGS and ICCG. Computational results show that the three-dimensional vortical flow is recirculating with large shear in the sinus region of the valve chamber. Passing through the valve, the flow is split into major upper and lower jet flows. The spiral vortices generated by the disk are advected in the wake and attenuated rapidly downstream by diffusion. It is shown also that the shear stress becomes maximum near the leading edge of the disk valve.
