A set of clinically relevant measurements of percentage depth dose and inhomogeneity correction factors for electron beam irradiation of the chest wall and underlying lung is given. Electron beam nominal energies of 9, 12, 15, and 18 MeV and lung densities of 0.22 g/cm3 and 0.404 g/cm3 are considered. This data can serve in treatment planning to indicate the penetration of the beam into the lung and serve as a comparison for calculation algorithms which are used to calculate electron dose absorption in heterogeneous phantoms.
