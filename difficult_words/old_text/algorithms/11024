Nowadays, the production of biodegradable starch-based films is of great interest because of the growing environmental concerns regarding pollution and the need to reduce dependence on the plastics industry. A broad view of the role of different components, added to starch-based films to improve their properties, is required to guide the future development. The self-organizing maps (SOMs) provide comparisons that initially were complicated due to the large volume of the data. Furthermore, the construction of a model capable of predicting the mechanical and barrier properties of these films will accelerate the development of films with improved characteristics. The water vapor permeability (WVP) analysis using the SOM algorithm showed that the presence of glycerol is very important for films with low amounts of poly (butylene adipate co-terephthalate) and confirms the role of the equilibrium relative humidity in the determination of WVP. Considering the mechanical properties, the SOM analysis emphasizes the important role of poly (butylene adipate co-terephthalate) in thermoplastic starch based films. The properties of biodegradable films were predicted and optimized by using a multilayer perceptron coupled with a genetic algorithm, presenting a great correlation between the experimental and theoretical values with a maximum error of 24%. To improve the response of the model and to ensure the compatibility of the components more information will be necessary.
