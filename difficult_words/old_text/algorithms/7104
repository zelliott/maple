The cross-section eigenmodes of micrometric cylinders were measured in the range of several tens of MHz to about 0.5 GHz. The vibrations were excited using subnanosecond laser pulses. The cross-section eigenmodes were simulated using finite element modeling in a 2D geometry. Using the method of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, the vibration spectrum of an aluminum wire of diameter 33 Î¼m served to determine Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio with a precision of 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. The calculated and measured frequencies of cross-section eigenmodes were fitted with a precision better than 0.5% in the 50-500 MHz range.
