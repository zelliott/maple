In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging there are two main image formation approaches, the direct Fourier imaging method proposed by Kumar et al. [J. Mag. Res. 88, 69 (1975)] and the projection reconstruction technique commonly used in conventional computed tomography. In this paper these two approaches are reviewed with particular reference to Fourier-transform NMR imaging or tomography. Although Fourier imaging is the most conventional imaging method, useful applications for projection reconstruction techniques have often been found in NMR imaging. Therefore, in this paper, the emphasis is placed more on the projection reconstruction techniques that may not be readily available in NMR imaging.
