Length-based dosing systems reduce errors associated with resuscitation drug dosing. Obese and thin children of the same length are dosed the same despite their different weights.

Length (height) and weight were measured in children after a body habitus icon assignment. Within each body habitus group, regression analysis was performed to generate a weight-estimation formula using body habitus and length (BHL). This BHL method was compared to the Broselow tape (BT).

Height and weight data were plotted to obtain visual scattergrams. Logarithmic regression yielded higher correlation coefficients than standard linear regression. Within body habitus groups, BHL epinephrine dose estimates were more accurate than BT dose estimates using 0.01 mg/kg as a dosing standard.

Adding body habitus information to the patient's length results in a more accurate weight estimate than length alone in children. The accuracy improvement is greater in children 3 years and older as compared to younger children.
