Hydrophilic controlled release matrix tablets of rifampicin, a poorly soluble drug, have been formulated using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) polymer (low, medium, and high viscosity) by direct compression method. Influence of formulation variables and process parameters such as drug:HPMC ratio, viscosity grade of HPMC, drug particle size, and compression force on the formulation characters and drug release has been studied. Our results indicated that the release rate of the drug and the mechanism of release from the HPMC matrices are mainly controlled by the drug:HPMC ratio and viscosity grade of the HPMC. In general, decrease in the drug particle size decreased the drug release. Lower viscosity HPMC polymer was found to be more sensitive to the effect of compression force than the higher viscosity. The formulations were found to be stable and reproducible.
