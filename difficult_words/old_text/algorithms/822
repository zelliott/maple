One hundred and sixty patients (170 eyes) with central serous chorioretinopathy (main group--CSC) and 83 patients (90 eyes) with other exudative retinal processes in the macula (controls) were examined. In order to optimize the early diagnosis of CSC, we suggest the below algorithm of actions: 1) detection of defects of the visual functions: diopter symptom, transitory scotoma, micropsia, metamorphopsia of the concave-phenomenon types and delayed time of recovering the visual acuity at the photostress-test; 2) detection of changes in the eye fundus, e.g. arch marginal reflex encircling the retinal opacification zone and symptoms of the luminous disk (intra-illumination); and fluorescence angiography made to verify the final diagnosis and for the purpose of defining the indication for laser treatment.
