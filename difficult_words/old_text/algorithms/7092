Microcirculation imaging is a key parameter for studying the pathophysiological processes of various disease conditions, in both clinical and fundamental research. A full-range spectral-domain correlation mapping optical coherence tomography (cm-OCT) method to obtain a complex-conjugate-free, full-range depth-resolved microcirculation map is presented. The proposed system is based on a high-speed spectrometer at 91 kHz with a modified scanning protocol to achieve higher acquisition speed to render cm-OCT images with high-speed and wide scan range. The mirror image elimination is based on linear phase modulation of B-frames by introducing a slight off-set of the probe beam with respect to the lateral scanning fast mirror's pivot axis. An algorithm that exploits the Hilbert transform to obtain a complex-conjugate-free image in conjunction with the cm-OCT algorithm is used to obtain full-range imaging of microcirculation within tissue beds in vivo. The estimated sensitivity of the system was around 105 dB near the zero-delay line with ∼20  dB roll-off from ±0.5 to ±3  mm imaging-depth position. The estimated axial and lateral resolutions are ∼12 and ∼30   μm, respectively. A direct consequence of this complex conjugate artifact elimination is the enhanced flow imaging sensitivity for deep tissue imaging application by imaging through the most sensitive zero-delay line and doubling the imaging range.
