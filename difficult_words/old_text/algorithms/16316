Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been widely used to explore conformational states of large biomolecular assemblies. The detailed interpretation of cryo-EM data requires the flexible fitting of a known high-resolution protein structure into a low-resolution cryo-EM map. To this end, we have developed what we believe is a new method based on a two-bead-per-residue protein representation, and a modified form of the elastic network model that allows large-scale conformational changes while maintaining pseudobonds and secondary structures. Our method minimizes a pseudo-energy which linearly combines various terms of the modified elastic network model energy with a cryo-EM-fitting score and a collision energy that penalizes steric collisions. Unlike previous flexible fitting efforts using the lowest few normal modes, our method effectively utilizes all normal modes so that both global and local structural changes can be fully modeled. We have validated our method for a diverse set of 10 pairs of protein structures using simulated cryo-EM maps with a range of resolutions and in the absence/presence of random noise. We have shown that our method is both accurate and efficient compared with alternative techniques, and its performance is robust to the addition of random noise. Our method is also shown to be useful for the flexible fitting of three experimental cryo-EM maps.
