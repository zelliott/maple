The effect of glottal aerodynamics in producing the nonlinear characteristics of voice is investigated by comparing the outputs of the asymmetric composite model and the two-mass model. The two-mass model assumes the glottal airflow to be laminar, nonviscous, and incompressible. In this model, when the asymmetric factor is decreased from 0.65 to 0.35, only 1:1 and 1:2 modes are detectable. However, with the same parameters, four vibratory modes (1:1, 1:2, 2:4, 2:6) are found in the asymmetric composite model using the Navier-Stokes equations to describe the complex aerodynamics in the glottis. Moreover, the amplitude of the waveform is modulated by a small-amplitude noiselike series. The nonlinear detection method reveals that this noiselike modulation is not random, but rather it is deterministic chaos. This result agrees with the phenomenon often seen in voice, in which the voice signal is strongly periodic but modulated by a small-amplitude chaotic component. The only difference between the two-mass model and the composite model is in their descriptions of glottal airflow. Therefore, the complex aerodynamic characteristics of glottal airflow could be important in generating the nonlinear dynamic behavior of voice production, including bifurcation and a small-amplitude chaotic component obscured by strong periodicity.
