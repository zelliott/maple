Total intravenous propofol anesthesia with target control (TCI) infusion was used in 61 surgical patients (43 women, 18 men, ASAI-II). Propofol concentration in the central compartment at awakening was in high correlation with the effective concentration (Ce) at the moment of falling asleep (r = 0.64). A model investigation demonstrated the advantages of longer induction for minimization of the hemodynamic disorders. Propofol TCI in a dose of 2 micrograms/ml led to an increase in the EEG spectral potency in the 1-12 Hz range, appearance of biomodality, and a decrease in the right-side frequency. The studies helped determine the policy of intravenous propofol TCI anesthesia using the Ce values at the moment when the patient lost consciousness and the right-side frequency of EEG spectrum.
