A mathematical model of infantile mortality is proposed. The model is based on the probability principle of organism-environment interactions assuming that the organism is able to remember the diseases encountered previously and resist them. The adequacy of the model was assessed using the demographic database for two countries. The dynamics of the model parameters during the last century is presented.
