Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) image reconstruction is an ill-posed problem requiring maximum measurement precision. Recent EIT systems claim 60 to 80 dB precision. Achieving higher values is hard in practice since measurements must be performed at relatively high frequency, on a living subject, while using components whose tolerance is usually higher than 0.1%. To circumvent this difficulty, a method for modelling the electronic circuits of an EIT system was developed in order to optimize the circuits and incorporate the model in the reconstruction algorithms. The proposed approach is based on a matrix method for solving electrical circuits and has been applied to the scan-head which contains the front-end electronic circuits of our system. The method is used to simulate the system characteristic curves which are then optimized with the Levenberg-Marquardt method to find optimal component values. A scan-head was built with the new component values and its simulated performance curves were compared with network analyser measurements. As a result of the optimization, the impedance at the operating frequency was increased to minimize the effects of variations in skin/electrode contact impedance. The transconductance and gain frequency responses were also reshaped to reduce noise sensitivity and unintended signal modulation. Integrating the model in the reconstruction algorithms should further improve overall performance of an EIT system.
