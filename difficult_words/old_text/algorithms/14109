To study the method for dose calculation and beam weight optimization of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).

The IMRT dose calculation model based on two-dimensional convolution was constructed, the program of dose calculation and beam weight optimization with genetic algorithm was written with Visual c#.Net, and the optimization results were analyzed.

Genetic algorithm optimization of beam weights can produce highly conformal dose distributions within a clinically acceptable computation time.

Genetic algorithm is valid and efficient in IMRT beam weight optimization, which may facilitate IMRT treatment planning.
