Sinonasal CT must be studied with both soft tissue and bone algorithms. Sinonasal findings in Wegener's granulomatosis are mucosal thickening, subtotal opacification, air-fluid level, bony destruction (mainly of the nasal septum), and sclerosing osteitis. Orbital MRI helps to define the extent of the disease. Contiguous granulomatous infiltration of the orbit appears dark (hypointense signals) on both T2-weighted-and T1-weighted images, but is enhanced after gadolinium administration. Cerebral MRI findings include diffuse linear dural thickening, enhanced by injection, and local dural thickening contiguous with orbital, nasal and paranasal disease. The remote granulomatous lesions in brain parenchyma are the least common form of central nervous system lesion. The pituitary gland and infundibulum can also be involved in Wegener's granulomatosis. These imaging findings of Wegener's granulomatosis are nonspecific. They should be combined with clinical examination and c-ANCA tests to confirm the diagnosis.
