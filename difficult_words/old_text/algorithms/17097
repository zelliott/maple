To determine the usefulness of a complete neuroandrologic evaluation and SPACE (Single Potential Analysis Cavernous Electromyography) in the study of impotence.

We performed a clinical study, erection test with papaverine-phentolamine and neuroandrologic evaluation (bulbocavernous EMG, S2-S4 evoked potentials, evoked somatosensorial potentials, SPACE, D10-L2 skin sympathetic potentials, cystometrogram, and filling videocystography) in 180 patients consulting for impotence.

We observed a relationship between the clinical diagnosis of impotence and the data from the neuroandrogenic study. The results of the study were classified as normal [in the clinical diagnosis of psychogenic impotence (100%), hormonal (80%) and vascular (60%)], abnormal [prevalent in the clinical diagnosis of structural impotence (87%)]. The erection test was mainly negative in all clinical diagnoses of impotence, except in psychogenic and vascular impotence (60% positive tests).

The clinical data are useful in the diagnosis of impotence. The pharmacological erection test was not found to be very reliable. Complete neuroandrologic evaluation is indicated in non typified and mixed impotence, and can be performed in neurogenic impotence to identify the level of the lesion. Alone, SPACE does not appear to be useful as a screening test for neurologic lesions, but can be useful as a screening test for neuromuscular cavernous lesions. SPACE is indicated in structural, vascular and hormonal impotence. If SPACE is abnormal, the differential diagnosis between neurogenic and myogenic lesion can be made through a complete neuroandrologic evaluation.
