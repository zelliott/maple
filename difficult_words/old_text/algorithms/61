Hypertension may complicate treatment with antiangiogenic agents, leading to dose reductions and treatment delays. To prospectively evaluate the frequency and management of hypertension in 10 patients with advanced kidney cancer receiving sunitinib, we used 24-h blood pressure monitoring (BPM) and home BPM and homogenously treated hypertension according to guidelines of the european Society of Hypertension. Normal BP was ensured prior to sunitinib initiation with the successive use of hydrochlorothiazide + irbesartan, nebivolol, amlodipine. During treatment, additional antihypertensive therapy was introduced, if necessary. Sunitinib dose was modified only if BP was not controlled with four anti-hypertensive agents. four patients had baseline hypertension, while 5 of 6 normotensive patients required antihypertensive treatment during sunitinib administration. One patient permanently discontinued sunitinib due to hypertensive crisis but 9 patients received full dose. Sunitinib-associated hypertension is more frequent than previously reported. Aggressive BP monitoring and treatment of hypertension may achieve uninterrupted, full-dose therapy in most patients treated with sunitinib. The application of such protocols instead of commonly used toxicity criteria should be further validated.
