The hydration energetics of natural DNA with various AT/GC-composition and model double-helix polyribonucleotides was studied using a new approach which is based on calorimetric measurements of the dehydration energy of nucleic acid-water systems at various levels of relative humidity. A linear correlation between the dehydration energy and the nucleotide composition of natural DNA was found.
