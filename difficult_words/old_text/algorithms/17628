A 3D spin-echo (3D SE) pulse sequence was used on a 4.7 T research MRI system to produce images of extracted human first molar tooth placed in CuSO4 water solution. The maximal resolution achieved was 35 x 63 x 300 microm3 in read and two phase directions, respectively. The high-intensity signal from water in solution together with the lack of signal from mineralized tooth tissue produce very good contrast allowing to visualize topography of outer and inner surfaces of the tooth. The 3D MR data were median filtered, binarized and then divided into separate segments corresponding to the inner tooth cavities and the hard tooth tissue. The topography of the root canals was visualized and the canals volume was calculated. The presented technique may be used for quantitative analysis of the root canal cavities shape and volume. The results of such an analysis may be applied for estimation of the quality of the impressional mapping methods in restorative dentistry or as an alternative non-impressional 3D mapping method.
