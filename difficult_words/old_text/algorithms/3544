The potential for interactions between caspofungin and nelfinavir or rifampin was evaluated in two parallel-panel studies. In study A, healthy subjects received a 14-day course of caspofungin alone (50 mg administered intravenously [IV] once daily) (n = 10) or with nelfinavir (1,250 mg administered orally twice daily) (n = 9) or rifampin (600 mg administered orally once daily) (n = 10). In study B, 14 subjects received a 28-day course of rifampin (600 mg administered orally once daily), with caspofungin (50 mg administered IV once daily) coadministered on the last 14 days, and 12 subjects received a 14-day course of caspofungin alone (50 mg administered IV once daily). The coadministration/administration alone geometric mean ratio for the caspofungin area under the time-concentration profile calculated for the 24-h period following dosing [AUC(0-24)] was as follows (values in parentheses are 90% confidence intervals [CIs]): 1.08 (0.93-1.26) for nelfinavir, 1.12 (0.97-1.30) for rifampin (study A), and 1.01 (0.91-1.11) for rifampin (study B). The shape of the caspofungin plasma profile was altered by rifampin, resulting in a 14 to 31% reduction in the trough concentration at 24 h after dosing (C(24h)), consistent with a net induction effect at steady state. Both the AUC and the C(24h) were elevated in the initial days of rifampin coadministration in study A (61 and 170% elevations, respectively, on day 1) but not in study B, consistent with transient net inhibition prior to full induction. The coadministration/administration alone geometric mean ratio for the rifampin AUC(0-24) on day 14 was 1.07 (90% CI, 0.83-1.38). Nelfinavir does not meaningfully alter caspofungin pharmacokinetics. Rifampin both inhibits and induces caspofungin disposition, resulting in a reduced C(24h) at steady state. An increase in the caspofungin dose to 70 mg, administered daily, should be considered when the drug is coadministered with rifampin.
