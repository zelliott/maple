A digital tongue image analysis instrument (TIAI) based on computer for Traditional Chinese Medicine is introduced. Some of the key techniques, including the image acquiring condition and method, the evaluation of tongue characters, and the management of tongue image data, are discussed as well. TIAI can provide a non-invasive, quantitative, and objective analysis approach and enhance the theory level and practical ability of the Traditional Chinese tongue diagnosis.
