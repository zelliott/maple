Cryotherapy, microwave hyperthermia, laser therapy, and high-intensity focused ultrasound have all been introduced in recent years. Each of these techniques is based on a different principle, yet they all attempt to kill prostate cancer cells in a minimally invasive manner. Insufficient follow-up data are available to allow strong recommendations regarding these treatments.
