Time-resolved cardiac imaging is particularly interesting in the interventional setting since it would provide both image guidance for accurate procedural planning and cardiac functional evaluations directly in the operating room. Imaging the heart in vivo using a slowly rotating C-arm system is extremely challenging due to the limitations of the data acquisition system and the high temporal resolution required to avoid motion artifacts. In this paper, a data acquisition scheme and an image reconstruction method are proposed to achieve time-resolved cardiac cone-beam computed tomography imaging with isotropic spatial resolution and high temporal resolution using a slowly rotating C-arm system. The data are acquired within 14 s using a single gantry rotation with a short scan angular range. The enabling image reconstruction method is the prior image constrained compressed sensing (PICCS) algorithm. The prior image is reconstructed from data acquired over all cardiac phases. Each cardiac phase is then reconstructed from the retrospectively gated cardiac data using the PICCS algorithm. To validate the method, several studies were performed. Both numerical simulations using a hybrid motion phantom with static background anatomy as well as physical phantom studies have been used to demonstrate that the proposed method enables accurate reconstruction of image objects with a high isotropic spatial resolution. A canine animal model scanned in vivo was used to further validate the method.
