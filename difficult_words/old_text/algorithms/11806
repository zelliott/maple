This paper describes a type of blood pressure monitor we have developed using 8031 chip microprocessor based on oscillometric method and the designs of hardware and software. Comparing the measurement results of oscillometric method with that of direct invasive measurement method, we find that the monitor is very useful in clinical applications. Finally in the paper, some improvements that can be made in the monitor are proposed.
