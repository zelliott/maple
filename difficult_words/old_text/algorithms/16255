The haplotype assembly problem seeks the haplotypes of an individual from which a set of aligned SNP fragments are available. The problem is important as the haplotypes contain all the SNP information, which is essential to such studies as the analysis of the association between specific diseases and their potential genetic causes. Using Minimum Error Correction as the objective function, the problem is NP-hard, which raises the demand for effective yet affordable solutions. In this paper, we propose a new method to solve the problem by providing a novel Max-2-SAT formulation for the problem. The proposed method is compared with several well-known algorithms proposed for the problem in the literature on a recent extensive benchmark, outperforming them all by achieving solutions of higher average quality.
