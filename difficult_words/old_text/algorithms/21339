Algorithms for digital pattern recognition optimized for the demands of the physician are urgently needed. They have to provide high levels of recognition, accuracy, reliability, artefact rejection and flexibility in detecting different types of signal time-course. The microcomputer algorithm presented here works on the principle of Walsh-transformation of signal sections and in-image judging. The algorithm efficiently solves simple tasks, and also recognizes, for instance, ECG P-waves using the same algorithm. A test with 1054 randomly selected outpatient's ECG and with an additional 72 ECGs of inpatients with clinically proved myocardial infarcts produced the following results: The recognition ratio for the R-wave amounted to 98.8% with a failure ratio of 2.3%, while an initial common P-T-pattern was correctly recognized in 80.3% of cases, with a failure ratio of 4.9%. The algorithm was implemented on a Z80 microprocessor and on a single-chip computer Z8.
