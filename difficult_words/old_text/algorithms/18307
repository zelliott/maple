Presented is an algorithm for the approximate calculation of the membrane stress distribution and the internal pressure of a steadily tank-treading red cell. The algorithm is based on an idealized ellipsoidal model of the tank-treading cell (Keller, S.R., and R. Skalak, 1982, J. Fluid Mech., 120:27-47) joined with experimental observations of projected length, width, and tank-treading frequency. The results are inexact because the membrane shape and velocity are assumed a priori, rather than being determined via appropriate material constitutive relations for the membrane; these results are, nevertheless, believed to be approximately correct, and show that internal pressure builds up slowly as cell elongation increases, rising more rapidly as the deformed cell approaches the limiting geometry of a prolate ellipsoid. The maximum shear stress resultant in the membrane was found to be below but approaching the yield point range at the highest shear rate applied.
