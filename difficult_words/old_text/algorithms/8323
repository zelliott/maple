This manuscript describes the RUSTIC model and presents the results of an example application. RUSTIC links three subordinate models in order to predict pesticide fate and transport through the crop root zone, unsaturated zone, and saturated zone to drinking water wells: PRZM, VADOFT, and SAFTMOD. PRZM is a one-dimensional finite-difference model which accounts for pesticide fate and transport in the crop root zone. This release of PRZM incorporates several features in addition to those simulated in the original PRZM code: specifically, soil temperature simulation, volatilization and vapor phase transport in soils, irrigation simulation and a method of characteristics (MOC) algorithm to eliminate numerical dispersion. PRZM is now capable of simulating fate and transport of the parent compound and up to two daughter species. VADOFT is a one-dimensional finite-element code which solves the Richard's equation for flows in the unsaturated zone. The user may make use of constitutive relationships between pressure, water content, and hydraulic conductivity to solve the flow equations. VADOFT may also simulate the fate and transport of two parent and two daughter products. SAFTMOD is a two-dimensional finite-element model which simulates saturated solute flow and transport in either an X-Y or X-Z configuration. The codes are linked together with the aid of a flexible execution supervisor which allows the user to build models which are tailored to site-specific situations. In order to perform exposure assessments, the code is equipped with a Monte Carlo pre- and post-processor. The application of the model is to a potato field on Long Island, New York. The results indicate that RUSTIC is capable of realistically matching data observed in downgradient monitoring wells following 3 years of aldicarb application.
