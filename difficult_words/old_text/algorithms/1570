The aim of this study was to develop and validate a simple anthropometric model that estimates the fat mass of white postmenopausal women and compare it to other models available in the literature.

Anthropometric data such as height, weight, waist and gluteal circumferences, biceps, triceps, suprailiac, and subscapular skinfolds, which were incorporated for the development and validation of this model, were derived from 276 white postmenopausal women. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used as the reference method. Furthermore, a comparison with other models was made using Bland-Altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficient.

The model developed in the current study was: fat mass = 0.069 × biceps + 0.553 × weight - 14.655 × height + 0.218 × gluteal circumference - 9.830 (r = 0.934, P < 0.001). The Bland-Altman reliability analysis on the validation cohort showed a non-statistically significant bias of 0.158 kg and limits of agreement of ±4.21 kg; the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.983. Furthermore, the validity of the current model also remained significant in different levels of BMI, ranging from 20.5-42 kg/m. When other models available in the literature were tested in the current cohort, bias ranged from -1.239 to -6.996 kg, while the limits of agreement from ±5.25 to ±8.05 kg.

The model developed in the current work was found to be valid for the assessment of postmenopausal women's fat mass at normal, overweight and obese BMI ranges, and can be easily applied in clinical practice and research.
