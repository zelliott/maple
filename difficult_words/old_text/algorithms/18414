Variance component models form a powerful and flexible tool for multipoint linkage analysis of quantitative traits. Estimates of genetic similarity are needed for the variance component model to detect linkage and to locate genes, and two methods are commonly used to calculate multipoint identity-by-descent (IBD) estimates for autosomes. Fulker et al. ([1995] Am. J. Hum. Genet. 56: 1229-1233) and Almasy and Blangero ([1998] Am. J. Hum. Genet. 62: 119-121) used multiple regression to estimate the IBD sharing along a chromosome, while the approach of Kruglyak and Lander ([1995] Am. J. Hum. Genet. 57: 439-454) is based on a hidden Markov model. In this paper, we modify the variance component model to accommodate sex-chromosomes, and we extend both multipoint IBD estimation methods to accommodate sex-linked loci. Simulation studies demonstrate the power and precision of the variance component model to detect QTLs located on the sex-chromosome. The two multipoint IBD estimation methods have the same accuracy to identify QTL position, but the hidden Markov model yields a larger average maximum LOD score to detect linkage than the regression model. The extension of the multipoint IBD estimation methods and the variance component model to the X chromosome shows that the variance component model is a powerful and flexible tool for linkage analysis of quantitative traits on both autosomes and sex-chromosomes.
