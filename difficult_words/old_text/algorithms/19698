Traditional DNA sequence analysis is based on sequence alignment, while a new DNA visual sequence analysis is proposed in this paper. Based on S. Wolfram's cellular automation theory, the method transfers one-dimensional DNA sequence into two-demensional visual image. Applying this method to SARS DNA sequence analysis, a characteristic of SARS-CoV differing from non-SARS is discovered. Compared with all known coronaviruses' images, It is found that this is a unique characteristic of SARS virus, and it is helpful to clinical identification of SARS.
