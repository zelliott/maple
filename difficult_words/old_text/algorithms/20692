Fold recognition force fields based on statistics from native structures have become commonplace. New, nonphysical force fields based on optimizing parameters rather than reflecting Boltzmann statistics may offer improvement in force-field performance for threading and other applications. Improvements in sequence-to-structure alignments will also be essential for improved fold recognition.
