This paper proposes a novel technique which provides energy efficient circuit design for sensors networks. The overall system presented requires a minimum number of independently communicating sensors and sub-circuits which enable it to reduce the power consumption by setting unused sensors to idle. This technique reduces hardware requirements, time and interconnection problems with a supervisory control. Our proposed algorithm, which hands over the controls to two software mangers for the sensing and moving subsystems can greatly improve the overall system performance. Based on the experimental results, we observed that our system, which is using sensing and moving managers, the four sensors required only 3.4 mW power consumption when a robot arm is moved a total distance of 17 cm. This system is designed for robot applications but could be implemented to many other human environments such as "ubiquitous cities", "smart homes", etc.
