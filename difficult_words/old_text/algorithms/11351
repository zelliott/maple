Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has the potential for skin tissue characterization due to its high axial and transverse resolution and its acceptable depth penetration. In practice, OCT cannot reach the theoretical resolutions due to imperfections of some of the components used. One way to improve the quality of the images is to estimate the point spread function (PSF) of the OCT system and deconvolve it from the output images. In this paper, we investigate the use of solid phantoms to estimate the PSF of the imaging system. We then utilize iterative Lucy-Richardson deconvolution algorithm to improve the quality of the images. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on OCT images acquired from a variety of samples, such as epoxy-resin phantoms, fingertip skin and basaloid larynx and eyelid tissues.
