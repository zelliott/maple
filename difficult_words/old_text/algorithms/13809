The novel method for classification of P450s has been proposed basing on consecutive multiple alignments of consensus sequences. A code can be assigned to each P450 amino acid sequence reflecting its relative distance from the corresponding consensus sequences at three hierarchical levels. Thus, only the principle of sequence similarity is chosen for classification without involving such criteria as enzymatic properties, phylogenetic assignment or chronology.
