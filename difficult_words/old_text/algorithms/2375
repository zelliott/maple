The costly treatment of peptic acid diseases at a Veterans Affairs ambulatory care clinic prompted the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the disorders. A committee consisting of a clinical pharmacist, the chiefs of ambulatory care and medicine, and a gastroenterologist guided the process. A consensus-style conference format involving medical staff and residents, pharmacists, and other health providers was chosen to develop the CPGs. Before the conference each participant received a list of key issues and literature on practice guidelines, and on peptic acid diseases and their treatment. At the conference the participants were divided into four groups; each group discussed specific key issues using a modified nominal group process. Recommendations from each group were made to the entire conference. Final recommendations were compiled into what was adopted and readily received as the CPGs for the institution.
