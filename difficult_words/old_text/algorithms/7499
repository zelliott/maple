We present a registration framework that combines both tissue Doppler and B-mode echocardiographic sequences. The estimated spatiotemporal transform is diffeomorphic, and calculated by modeling its corresponding velocity field using continuous B-splines. A new cost function using both B-mode image voxel intensities and Doppler velocities is also proposed. Registration accuracy was evaluated on synthetic data with known ground truth. Results showed that our method allows quantifying wall motion with higher accuracy than when using a single modality. On patient data, both displacement and velocity curves were compared with the ones obtained from widely used commercial software using either B-mode images or TDI. Our method demonstrated to be more robust to image noise while being independent from the beam angle.
