Recently, Ultra-wide band signals have become attractive for their particular advantage of having high spatial resolution and good penetration ability which makes them suitable in medical applications. One of these applications is wireless detection of heart rate and respiration rate. Two hypothesis of static environment and fixed patient are considered in the method presented in previous literatures which are not valid for long term monitoring of ambulant patients. In this article, a new method to detect the respiration rate of a moving target is presented. The first algorithm is applied to the simulated and experimental data for detecting respiration rate of a fixed target. Then, the second algorithm is developed to detect respiration rate of a moving target. The proposed algorithm uses correlation for body movement cancellation, and then detects the respiration rate based on energy in frequency domain. The results of algorithm prove an accuracy of 98.4 and 97% in simulated and experimental data, respectively.
