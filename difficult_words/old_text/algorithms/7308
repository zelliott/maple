We demonstrate the application of a complex constraint in the reconstruction of images from phase-diverse Fresnel coherent diffraction data for heterogeneous biological objects. The application of this constraint is shown to improve the quality of the reconstruction of both the phase and the magnitude of the complex object transmission function.
