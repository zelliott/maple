We seek in this paper to differentiate driven nonlinear systems using only a single output signal from the driven system. We do not have access to the driving signal. We demonstrate the phase space identification techniques with an experimental model of a radio transmitter. We restrict the driving signals to nearly periodic signals, because these types of signals are the most common signals used in real transmitters. We find that by studying our transmitter as a driven nonlinear system, we are able to distinguish one transmitter from another. This work may have consequences for real transmitters.
