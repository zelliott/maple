We exhibit a remarkable equivalence between the dynamics of an intermittent nonlinear map and the electronic transport properties (obtained via the scattering matrix) of a crystal defined on a double Cayley tree. This strict analogy reveals in detail the nature of the mobility edge normally studied near (not at) the metal-insulator transition in electronic systems. We provide an analytical expression for the conductance as a function of the system size that at the transition obeys a q-exponential form. This manifests as power-law decay or few and far between large spike oscillations according to different kinds of boundary conditions.
