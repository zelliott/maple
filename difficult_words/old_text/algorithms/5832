A database of 1,736 patients and 2,511 gait analyses was reviewed to identify for trials where the first rocker was absent. A fuzzy c-means algorithm was used to identify sagittal ankle kinematic patterns and three groups were identified. The first showed a progressive dorsiflexion during the stance phase, while the second had a short-lived dorsiflexion, followed by a progressive plantarflexion. The third group exhibited a double bump pattern, moving successively from a short-lived dorsiflexion to a short-lived plantarflexion and then returning to a further short-lived dorsiflexion before ending with plantarflexion until toe-off. The three patterns were linked to different neurological conditions. Myopathy, neuropathy and arthogryposis essentially revealed group 1 patterns, whereas idiopathic toe-walkers mainly displayed group 2 patterns. Cerebral palsy patients, however, were relatively homogeneously distributed amongst the three groups. Able-bodied subjects walking on their toes showed a high proportion of unclassifiable ankle patterns, due to a variable gait whilst toe walking. Despite the variety of neurological conditions included in this meta-analysis repeatable biomechanical patterns appeared that could influence therapeutic management.
