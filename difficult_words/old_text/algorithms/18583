Imaging studies and quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) have often, but not consistently, implicated the left hemisphere and the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia. To help clarify this picture, a spatial filter shown to be effective for enhancing differences between EEG populations was combined with low-resolution electromagnetic tomography and used to compare the source-current densities from a group of 57 male subjects with schizophrenia and a group of 65 matched controls. To elicit differences, comparisons were made during resting conditions and during verbal and spatial cognitive challenges to the subjects. Estimates of the source-current density were derived from 43-electrode recordings of the EEG reduced to the delta, alpha and beta frequency bands. The patients were unmedicated and were selected according to DSM-IV criteria. As a group, they were severe, chronic states with both deficit negative and superimposed florid psychotic symptomatology. The results confirm that schizophrenia is a left-hemispheric disorder centered in the temporal and frontal lobes. They also suggest that, in schizophrenia, functions normally performed by these regions in controls are assumed by homologous regions in the opposite hemispheres.
