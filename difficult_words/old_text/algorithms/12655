Depression is one of the highest ranking causes of disease burden worldwide but remains underrecognized and undertreated in clinical settings. Measurement-based care is the standard of care strived for by leading psychiatric researchers and is considered treatment as usual in other areas of medicine. However, routine measurement has yet to be implemented in all clinical practices for the detection and treatment of mental disorders such as depression. Physicians may help to improve illness outcomes and reduce illness burdens of patients with depression by using measurement-based care, including standardized measurement instruments and treatment algorithms in all phases of the treatment process.
