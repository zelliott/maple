We measured hyperpolarized 3He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) and quantified ADC gradients in each three-by-three voxel region of interest (ROI). Such local ADC gradients can be represented in vector maps showing the magnitude (|G3x3|) and direction of ADC gradients, providing a qualitative visualization tool and quantitative measurement of airway and air space heterogeneity. Twenty-four subjects (15 male, mean age=67+/-7 yr) with global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) stage II (n=9, mean age 68+/-6 yr), GOLD stage III chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n=7, mean age 67+/-8 yr), and age-matched healthy volunteers (n=8, mean age 67+/-6 yr) were enrolled based on their age and spirometry results. Hyperpolarized 3He MRI was performed on a whole body 3.0 Tesla system. Mean 3He ADC and ADC standard deviation were calculated for the center coronal slice, and the mean magnitude and direction of the ADC gradient vectors were calculated for each three-by-three voxel matrix (|G3x3|). While the 3He ADC standard deviation was not significantly different, mean |G3x3| was significantly different between subjects with stage II (0.14+/-0.03 cm/s) and stage III COPD (0.19+/-0.03 cm/s; P<0.005) and between healthy subjects (0.12+/-0.03 cm/s) and those with stage II COPD (P<0.02). The second order statistic |G3x3| may provide a sensitive measure of ADC heterogeneity for ROI representing 9.4x9.4x30 mm or 2.6 cm3 of lung tissue.
