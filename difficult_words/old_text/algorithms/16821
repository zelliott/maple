To retrospectively validate the WINROP (weight, insulin-like growth factor I, neonatal, retinopathy of prematurity [ROP]) algorithm in identification of type 1 ROP in a Mexican population of preterm infants.

In infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Hospital Civil de Guadalajara from 2005 to 2010, weight measurements had been recorded once weekly for 192 very preterm infants (gestational age [GA] <32 weeks) and for 160 moderately preterm infants (GA â‰¥32 weeks). Repeated eye examinations had been performed and maximal ROP stage had been recorded. Data are part of a case-control database for severe ROP risk factors.

Type 1 ROP was found in 51.0% of very preterm and 35.6% of moderately preterm infants. The WINROP algorithm correctly identified type 1 ROP in 84.7% of very preterm infants but in only 5.3% of moderately preterm infants. For infants with GA less than 32 weeks, the specificity was 26.6%, and for those with GA 32 weeks or more, it was 88.3%.

In this Mexican population of preterm infants, WINROP detected type 1 ROP early in 84.7% of very preterm infants and correctly identified 26.6% of infants who did not develop type 1 ROP. Uncertainties in dating of pregnancies and differences in postnatal conditions may be factors explaining the different outcomes of WINROP in this population.
