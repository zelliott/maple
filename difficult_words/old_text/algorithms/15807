Quantitative layer-by-layer perimetry is a psychophysical technique believed to assess response characteristics of individual retinal layers. This paper presents a new design of this technique, implemented into the existing hardware environment of the computerized perimeter Humphrey Field Analyzer. The technique was optimized for a more simple, fast and reproducible testing of larger visual field point patterns. The paper deals with the design of instrumentation and with methodological aspects of this adaptation of the technique.
