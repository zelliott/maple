Many different phylogenetic clustering techniques are used currently. One approach is to first determine the topology with a common clustering method and then calculate the branch lengths of the tree. If the resulting tree is not optimal exchanging tree branches can make some local changes in the tree topology. The whole process can be iterated until a satisfactory result has been obtained. The efficiency of this method fully depends on the initially generated tree. Although local changes are made, the optimal tree will never be found if the initial tree is poorly chosen. In this article, genetic algorithms are applied such that the optimal tree can be found even with a bad initial tree topology. This tree generating method is tested by comparing its results with the results of the FITCH program in the PHYLIP software package. Two simulated data sets and a real data set are used.
