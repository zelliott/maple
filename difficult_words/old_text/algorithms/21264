The present paper describes an algorithm for estimating the translation vector and the rotation matrix of a moving body from noisy measurements on the spatial co-ordinates of at least three non-collinear markers. A sensitivity analysis of the estimated parameters and of the helical axis is presented in terms of characteristics of the marker distribution. The implementation of the proposed algorithm in a FORTRAN-subroutine is appended.
