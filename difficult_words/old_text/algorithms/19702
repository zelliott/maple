In present, the most basically used parameters for speaker identification are linear predictive coding (LPC) parameter, Mel frequency cepstrum coefficient(MFCC), etc. First in this paper only MFCC was used as the parameter and then Lempel-Ziv Complexity was combined with MFCC as parameters. The text-dependent recognition rate of 50 speakers increased from 42% to 80% and the text-independent recognition rate of 50 speakers increased from 60% to 72%. This test shows that Lempel-Ziv complexity, as a new parameter, can be applied to speaker identification.
