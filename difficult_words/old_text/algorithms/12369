Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) can be used to study cochlear function in an objective and non-invasive manner. One practical and essential aspect of any investigating measure is the consistency of its results upon repeated testing of the same individual/animal (i.e., its test/retest repeatability). The goal of the present work is to propose two indices to quantitatively assess the repeatability of DPOAE in laboratory animals. The methodology is here illustrated using two data sets which consist of DPOAE subsequently collected from Sprague-Dawley rats. The results of these experiments showed that the proposed indices are capable of estimating both the repeatability of the true emission level and the inconsistencies associated with measurement error. These indices could be a significantly useful tool to identify real and even small changes in the cochlear function exerted by potential ototoxic agents.
