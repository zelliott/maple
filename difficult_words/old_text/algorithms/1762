The management of invasive fungal infections in critically ill patients, from diagnosis to selection of the therapeutic protocol, is often a challenge. Early diagnosis and treatment are associated with a better prognosis, but apart from cases with positive cultures from blood or fluid/tissue biopsy, diagnosis is neither sensitive nor specific, and there is a need for specific markers in these diseases. Serodiagnostic assays such as mannan antigen, mannan antibodies, Candida albicans germ-tube antibodies or (1→3)-β-D-glucan detection, and molecular techniques for the detection of fungal-specific DNA have been developed with promising results in critical care settings. One of the main features in diagnosis is the evaluation of risk factors for infection, which will identify patients in need of preemptive or empirical treatment. Clinical scores were built from those risk factors. The combination of prediction rules and non-culture microbiological tools could be currently be the key to improving the diagnosis and prognosis of invasive fungal infections in critically ill patients.
