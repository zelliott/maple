Fifty-seven IgG monoclonal anti-D antibodies were evaluated in the Rh flow cytometry section, in which 12 laboratories participated. Staining protocols and a fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated Fab fragment goat anti-human IgG (H + L) as a secondary antibody were recommended but not mandatory. A CcDEe red blood cell (RBC) sample that was shown to be homozygous for RHD by molecular methods was supplied and used as internal 'standard RBC' throughout all experiments. An RBC panel comprising two partial D and four weak D types was supplied as well. The use of standard RBC reduced the variability of the data among the laboratories and allowed the conversion of fluorescence data into epitope densities, which were compounded in an antigen density (antigen D per RBC). The highest antigen density was determined for DVI type III, followed by DVII and weak D type 3; the lowest antigen density were determined for weak D type 1 and type 2. Nine of the 12 participating laboratories discriminated three groups of aberrant RhD that had similar Rhesus indices (RI): D category VI with RI = 0; weak D type 2 and type 3 with an high RI; and D category VII and weak D type 1 with an intermediate RI. The antigen densities and the Rhesus indices obtained correlated well among the laboratories of this Workshop section despite different staining protocols, secondary antibodies and instrumentation.
