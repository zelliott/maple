We present a methodology for correcting color images taken in practical indoor environments, such as laboratories, factories, and studios, that explicitly models illuminant location, surface reflectance and geometry, and camera responsivity. We explicitly model surfaces by taking our color images with corresponding registered three-dimensional (3-D) range images, which provide surface orientation and location information for every point in the scene. We automatically detect regions where color correction should not be applied, such as specularities, coarse texture regions, and jump edges. This correction results in objective color measures of the imaged surfaces. This kind of integrated, comprehensive system of color correction has not existed until now. i.e., it is the first of its kind in computer vision. We demonstrate results of applying this methodology to real images for applications in photorealistic rerendering, skin lesion detection, burn scar color measurement, and general color image enhancement. We also have tested the method under different lighting configurations and with three different range scanners.
