We introduce depth-filtered digital holography (DFDH) as a method for quantitative tomographic phase imaging of buried layers in multilayer samples. The procedure is based on the acquisition of multiple holograms for different wavelengths. Analyzing the intensity over wavelength pixel wise and using an inverse Fourier transform leads to a depth-profile of the multilayered sample. Applying a windowed Fourier transform with a narrow window, we choose a depth-of interest (DOI) which is used to synthesize filtered interference patterns that just contain information of this limited depth. We use the angular spectrum method to introduce an additional spatial filtering and to reconstruct the corresponding holograms. After a short theoretical framework we show experimental proof-of-principle results for the method.
