With improved life expectancy, the incidence of aortic stenosis is rising. However, up to one-third of patients who require lifesaving surgical aortic valve replacement are denied surgery due to a high operative mortality rate. Such patients can only be treated with medical therapy or percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty, neither of which has been shown to improve mortality. With advances in interventional cardiology, transcatheter methods have been developed for aortic valve replacement. Clinical trials are investigating these devices in patients with severe aortic stenosis that have been denied surgery. Preliminary results from these trials suggest that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is not only feasible, but an effective way to improve symptoms. In this review, we describe the current technology and display available outcome data. Though technical challenges and operator learning curve limit optimal use of the current technology, continued experience and advancements in technology may one day make TAVR a viable alternative to traditional surgical aortic valve replacement.
