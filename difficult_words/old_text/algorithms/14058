We have developed a new method (BioHMM) for segmenting array comparative genomic hybridization data into states with the same underlying copy number. By utilizing a heterogeneous hidden Markov model, BioHMM incorporates relevant biological factors (e.g. the distance between adjacent clones) in the segmentation process.
