The next generation of contraceptives will be based on the identification of novel molecules essential for reproductive processes and will rely on the refinement of older as well as newer technologies. Functional analysis of naturally occurring reproductive genetic disorders and creation of mice null for specific genes would greatly assist in the choice of genetic targets for contraceptive development. Structure-based design of drugs as exemplified by the preparation of an orally active non-peptide gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) would revolutionize drug formulation and delivery for a peptide analogue. This review examines some of the molecular targets that may change contraceptive choices in the future.
