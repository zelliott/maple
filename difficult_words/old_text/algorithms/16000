Acute sinusitis is commonly encountered in clinical practice and treated in the primary care setting. The clinician should recognize the subtle clinical presentation of acute bacterial sinusitis and initiate appropriate, aggressive treatment. Other upper respiratory tract disorders can confound the accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of sinusitis. Variable patterns of microbial resistance and antibiotic susceptibility and the dissociation between in vitro findings and clinical efficacy are a treatment challenge. This report is a comprehensive review of the pathophysiology and diagnosis of acute sinusitis, infectious agents, treatment methods, antibiotic resistance patterns, and costs associated with the management of sinusitis. Treatment algorithms are presented for adult and pediatric sinusitis.
