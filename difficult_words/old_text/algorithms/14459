Probe defects are a major source of noise in gene expression studies. While existing approaches detect noisy probes based on external information such as genomic alignments, we introduce and validate a targeted probabilistic method for analyzing probe reliability directly from expression data and independently of the noise source. This provides insights into the various sources of probe-level noise and gives tools to guide probe design.
