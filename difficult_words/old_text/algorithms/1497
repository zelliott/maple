In the field of Augmented Reality in Surgery, building a hybrid patient's model, i.e. merging all the data and systems available for a given application, is a difficult but crucial technical problem. The purpose is to merge all the data that constitute the patient model with the reality of the surgery, i.e. the surgical tools and feedback devices. In this paper, we first develop this concept, we show that this construction comes to a problem of registration between various sensor data, and we detail a general framework of registration. The state of the art in this domain is presented. Finally, we show results that we have obtained using a method which is based on the use of anatomical reference surfaces. We show that in many clinical cases, registration is only possible through the use of internal patient structures.
