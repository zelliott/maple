Sensitization of the defensive shortening reflex in the leech has been linked to a segmentally repeated tri-synaptic positive feedback loop. Serotonin from the R-cell enhances S-cell excitability, S-cell impulses cross an electrical synapse into the C-interneuron, and the C-interneuron excites the R-cell via a glutamatergic synapse. The C-interneuron has two unusual characteristics. First, impulses take longer to propagate from the S soma to the C soma than in the reverse direction. Second, impulses recorded from the electrically unexcitable C soma vary in amplitude when extracellular divalent cation concentrations are elevated, with smaller impulses failing to induce synaptic potentials in the R-cell. A compartmental, computational model was developed to test the sufficiency of multiple, independent spike initiation zones in the C-interneuron to explain these observations. The model displays asymmetric delays in impulse propagation across the S-C electrical synapse and graded impulse amplitudes in the C-interneuron in simulated high divalent cation concentrations.
