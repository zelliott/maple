Molecular modeling is used to study the sequence dependence of conformation and stability within helically regular duplex Z-DNA. The variations of conformation that are found are sufficiently important to be classified as a new type of polymorphism within the Z family. It is also demonstrated that certain sequences can adopt more than one of these polymorphic forms. Comparison with experimental studies of chemical reactivity within a natural DNA fragment, forced into a left-handed conformation, suggests that the results of our modeling may be used to explain the chemical reactivity observed. Comparison of the Z results with similar studies of the B form allow enthalpies of transition to be calculated as a function of base sequence.
