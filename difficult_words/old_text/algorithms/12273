The acceptance of atrial arrhythmia features in implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) will depend on their ability to appropriately discriminate atrial tachyarrhythmias/atrial fibrillation (AT/AF). This study tested the effectiveness of an atrial/ventricular ICD with advanced atrial detection and new algorithms designed to prevent atrial arrhythmias.

Ninety-five patients were implanted with a dual chamber ICD (Model 1900, Guidant Corporation, MN, USA) at 25 US centers. Ten patients received a coronary sinus (CS) lead allowing a defibrillation vector for AT/AF cardioversion. Follow-up was 12.2 months. The addition of new atrial features designed for detection, discrimination, and prevention of AT/AF had no adverse effect upon detection of induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) (mean detection time with new features ON was 2.22 seconds vs 2.19 seconds with features OFF). A total of 100% of the induced and spontaneous ventricular and atrial arrhythmias receiving shock therapy were reviewed as appropriate detection. Atrial shock conversion efficacy for spontaneous and induced AT/AF episodes was 83% and 96%, respectively (144 spontaneous, 162 induced episodes). A 3-month randomized crossover trial of atrial preventative pacing features did not result in adverse effects, but there was no clinical efficacy for prevention of AT/AF.

Enhanced atrial detection and discrimination features combined with tiered atrial therapies did not adversely impact the ability of the ICD (Model 1900) to appropriately detect and treat ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
