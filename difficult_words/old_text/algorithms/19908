The adjustment of multiple criteria in hit-to-lead identification and lead optimization is a major advance in drug discovery. Thus, the development of approaches able to handle additional criteria for the early simultaneous treatment of the most important properties determining the pharmaceutical profile of a drug candidate is an emergent issue in this area. In this paper, we review a desirability-based multi-objective QSAR method allowing the joint handling of multiple properties of interest in drug discovery: the MOOP-DESIRE methodology. This methodology adapts desirability theory concepts allowing the holistic modeling of the many and conflicting biological properties determining the therapeutic utility of a drug candidate. Here we survey their suitability for key tasks involving the use of chemoinformatics methods in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery.
