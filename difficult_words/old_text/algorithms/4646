We develop reconstruction algorithms for local cone-beam tomography for use with generalized scanning trajectories. The algorithms are grounded theoretically in a recently developed chord-based theory for exact image reconstruction and principles of lambda tomography. Being chord based, they are distinct mathematically and conceptually from conventional local tomography reconstruction algorithms. The salient feature of our algorithms is that they permit reconstruction of discontinuities in the profiles of the object function along chords. By consideration of all possible chords, a 3D image that describes the locations of object discontinuities can be reconstructed. Results from microlocal analysis are applied for understanding the object features that can be reconstructed stably by use of the algorithms. A computer-simulation study is conducted to demonstrate the algorithms and compare their performance with an existing algorithm.
