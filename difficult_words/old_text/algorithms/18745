Prostacyclin is the major arachidonic acid metabolite of the vascular endothelium and is produced mainly via the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway. By acting on the prostacyclin (IP) receptor on platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells, prostacyclin exerts vasodilatory and antiaggregative/antiadhesive effects. Previous studies have shown that prostacyclin production increases after brain trauma, but the importance of prostacyclin for posttraumatic hemodynamic alterations and neuron survival has not been investigated. This study evaluated if endogenous prostacyclin plays a role in the pathophysiologic process in the brain after brain trauma. This was performed by comparing prostacyclin (IP) receptor-deficient (IP(-/-)) mice and mice with functional IP receptor (IP(+/+)) after a controlled cortical injury regarding contusion volume, cerebral blood flow ([(14)C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography), number of perfused capillaries (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran fluorescence technique), the transfer constant (K(i)) for [(51)Cr]EDTA, and brain water content (wet vs dry weight) in the injured and contralateral cortex. Contusion volume was increased in IP(-/-) mice compared with IP(+/+) mice. Three hours after trauma, cortical blood flow was decreased in the injured cortex of both groups and the reduction in blood flow in the cortex of the IP(-/-) mice persisted from 3 to 24 h, whereas blood flow approached normal values in the IP(+/+) mice after 24 h. No differences could be detected between the two genotypes regarding other hemodynamic parameters. We conclude that the prostacyclin IP receptor is beneficial for neuron survival after brain trauma in mice, an effect that may be mediated by improved cortical perfusion.
