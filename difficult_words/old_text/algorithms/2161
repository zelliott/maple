Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) was used to treat three patients with near-fatal status asthmaticus who did not respond to aggressive medical therapies and mechanical ventilation under controlled permissive hypercapnia. ECLS was instituted in patient 1 because PaCO2 was excessively high and pH was excessively low, in patient 2 because hypoxemia and shock were not responsive to treatment, and in patient 3 because of sustained severe hypotension. ECLS supported adequate gas exchange until pulmonary function improved, diminishing the need for mechanical ventilation and preventing pulmonary complications. Pulmonary dysfunction improved markedly after only 21 to 86 hours of ECLS. Aggressive medical treatments were continued during ECLS. Our findings indicate that ECLS is a useful method for preventing death in patients with near-fatal status asthmaticus.
