The use of psychotropic medication for foster children is in itself not unique; however, these children are of particular interest because of the stress associated with their life situations. A thorough assessment of the child and family should occur before beginning these medications, and in general, they should only be used in the presence of a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition, diagnosis of a mental disorder. Parents and caregivers need to be aware of principles of use, potential side effects, and monitoring parameters.
