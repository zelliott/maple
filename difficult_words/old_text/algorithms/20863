Nitrogen-14 (spin I=1) has always been a nucleus difficult to observe in solid-state NMR and until recently its observation was restricted to one-dimensional (1D) spectra. We present here the first 3D 1H-13C-14N NMR correlation spectrum. This spectrum was acquired on a test sample L-histidine.HCl.H2O using a recently developed technique, which consists in indirectly observing 14N nuclei via dipolar recoupling with an HMQC-type experiment.
