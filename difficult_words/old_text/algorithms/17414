Approximate entropy (ApEn) is a statistic that quantifies regularity in time series data, and this parameter has several features that make it attractive for analyzing physiological systems. In this study, ApEn was used to detect nonlinearities in the heart rate (HR) patterns of 12 low-risk human fetuses between 38 and 40 wk of gestation. The fetal cardiac electrical signal was sampled at a rate of 1,024 Hz by using Ag-AgCl electrodes positioned across the mother's abdomen, and fetal R waves were extracted by using adaptive signal processing techniques. To test for nonlinearity, ApEn for the original HR time series was compared with ApEn for three dynamic models: temporally uncorrelated noise, linearly correlated noise, and linearly correlated noise with nonlinear distortion. Each model had the same mean and SD in HR as the original time series, and one model also preserved the Fourier power spectrum. We estimated that noise accounted for 17.2-44.5% of the total between-fetus variance in ApEn. Nevertheless, ApEn for the original time series data still differed significantly from ApEn for the three dynamic models for both group comparisons and individual fetuses. We concluded that the HR time series, in low-risk human fetuses, could not be modeled as temporally uncorrelated noise, linearly correlated noise, or static filtering of linearly correlated noise.
