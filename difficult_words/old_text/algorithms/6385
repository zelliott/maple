To elaborate the algorithm for evaluation of quality of life (QL) in patients with psychosomatic diseases.

AMPI, Spilberger-Khanin anxiety test, the procedures 'general state, activity, mood" and "personality differential".

The algorithm of QL evaluation comprises a questionnaire consisting of 48 questions divided into 3 blocks.

A psychological component of QL was determined by the presence of depression, anxiety, emotional effects on everyday and professional activity; the social component--by relations in office, family, medical personal. The procedure was standardized, so QL should be considered as high at 97-144 points, good 87-96, satisfactory 44-86, unsatisfactory results were at 26-43 points, poor--at 0-25 points.

The proposed technique of QL of psychosomatic patients proved its validity and reliability. Therefore, it can be recommended for design of psychosocial and medical rehabilitative measures as well as for assessment of efficacy of these measures.
