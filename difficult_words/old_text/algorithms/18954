A measure of the sharpness of vessel wall interfaces in carotid artery MRI may be useful for assessing the conspicuity of the wall's features. An edge detection technique was used to measure the signal intensity gradients in 2D time-of-flight (2D-TOF) and double-inversion recovery black-blood (DIR-BB) carotid artery images of normal subjects that were acquired at 1.5 T with 0.55 x 0.55 x 2.0-mm (0.6 mm3) acquisition voxels and zero filled to reduce the in-plane reconstructed voxel size by one half in each dimension as well as with 0.27 x 0.27 x 2.0-mm (0.15 mm3) acquisition voxels and at 3.0 T with 0.27 x 0.27 x 2.0-mm (0.15 mm3) acquisition voxels using surface coils. The gradient intensities of the lumen-to-background interface varied closely with the contrast-to-noise ratio of the 2D-TOF imaging. For the DIR-BB imaging, in which higher spatial frequency artery structures are visible, the gradient intensities at the interfaces were higher than theoretically predicted at both field strengths with smaller acquisition voxels. The use of acquisition voxels smaller than those previously used at 1.5 T can improve the visualization of carotid artery structures at 1.5 and 3.0 T with surface coil reception.
