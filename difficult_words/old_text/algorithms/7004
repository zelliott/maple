A bi-exponential mathematical computer model was used to develop a guidance graph for atracurium infusions. The model permitted variation in infusion rates, in pharmacokinetic parameters and in "effect" thresholds. Systematic experiments revealed a relationship between the rate of recovery from a fixed bolus loading dose and the most appropriate initial infusion rate. This relationship was expressed as a guidance graph or "ready reckoner". The quality of guidance was assessed in 50 anaesthetics, given consecutively. In 39 patients optimal myoneural block for surgery was maintained for the duration of the infusion without adjustments or supplementary bolus doses. The mean operating time was 92 min and the mean duration of infusion was 59 min.
