The MCMC procedure in SAS (called PROC MCMC) is particularly designed for Bayesian analysis using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The program is sufficiently general to handle very complicated statistical models and arbitrary prior distributions. This study introduces the SAS/MCMC procedure and demonstrates the application of the program to quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. A real life QTL mapping experiment in wheat female fertility trait was used as an example for the demonstration. The fertility trait phenotypes were described under three different models: (1) the Poisson model, (2) the Bernoulli model and (3) the zero-truncated Poisson model. One QTL was identified on the second chromosome. This QTL appears to control the switch of seed-producing ability of female plants but does not affect the number of seeds produced once the switch is turned on.
