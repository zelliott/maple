The applicability of the equilibrium partition theory (EPT) for PCB accumulation in submerged macrophyte shoots was investigated using field data. The equilibrium state of PCBs between macrophyte shoots and sediments was verified by testing the direct proportionality (slope = 1 in a log-log relationship) between congener concentrations in the lipids of macrophyte shoots (Cli) and in the organic fraction of sediments (Cso), using the slope-range method. A significant proportionality was found between Cli and Cso (slope of the log-log relationship: 0.978 +/- 0.041; R2 = 0.847; P < 0.001). The biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) predicted from this relationship (3.74, SE: 1.14) was in the 1-4 range that is suggested in the literature. These results indicate that, in our study sites, EPT is applicable to PCBs in macrophyte shoots. This opens interesting perspectives in environmental monitoring.
