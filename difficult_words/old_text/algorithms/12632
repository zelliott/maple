Many women experience psychological and physical symptoms associated with menstrual cycle. In 3% to 5% of women that meet the criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder, the symptoms are severe and impair their social and occupational functioning. Although the etiology of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is unknown, the symptoms of dysphoria, including depression and anxiety, have been associated with serotonergic dysregulation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, taken only during the symptomatic luteal phase, are considered as first-line therapy for premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
