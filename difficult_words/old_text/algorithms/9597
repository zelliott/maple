The objective of this study was to determine functional characteristics of the cardiovascular system and skin temperature believed to adequately reflect its response to the action of an alternating magnetic field (AMF). The estimated parameters included index of cardiovascular regulation and average temperature of the body surface. The time and the skin temperature were determined for each value of regulation index at which AMF action should be terminated. Algorithm for the choice of the AMF treatment regime and its correction depending on body surface temperature and its correlation with the index of cardiovascular regulation.
