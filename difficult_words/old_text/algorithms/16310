Poststernotomy mediastinitis following median sternotomy procedures such as open heart surgery is a rare complication which nevertheless has a mortality rate of up to 50 %. Several treatment options are currently available; however, none of them are standardized. Based on the experience gained from open heart surgery performed at the MediClin Heart Institute Lahr/Baden, a therapeutic algorithm was developed. The treatment steps consist of repeated radical surgical debridement, sternal restabilization, vacuum-assisted closure therapy (VAC) as well as a surgical reconstruction via M. pectoralis plasty (MPP). This approach had a 30-day mortality of 0 % and a hospital mortality of 10.4 %. The approach proved to be safe and advantageous for specific patient groups operated on at the MediClin Heart Institute Lahr/Baden.
