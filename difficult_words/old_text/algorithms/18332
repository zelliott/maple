A quantity termed the "threshold" has been used to describe the results of electrical ventricular defibrillation studies, with the implication of a clear distinction between ineffective and effective shock intensities. Although several definitions of the threshold have been suggested, and various methods have been used to quantify it, no comparison of the accuracies of the various methods could be found in the literature. This article, after presenting a method of applying basic probability theory to an assumed distribution relating probability of successful defibrillation to current amplitude, uses the method to examine several popular algorithms for defibrillation-threshold determination. The results show that where a sharp transition exists from ineffective to effective current amplitudes, most algorithms yield fairly good results. Where that transition is gradual (as it appears to be in all of the published reports examined), the algorithms are shown to be inadequate.
