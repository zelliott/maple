Failed treatment for chronic or refractory lateral epicondylitis can successfully be avoided strictly respecting guidelines in diagnosis, treatment and patient selection. Co-existing or simply other pathologic conditions as radial nerve compression neuropathy or instability of the elbow are evident reasons for failure and have to be treated accordingly to the condition. Inadequate patient selection, lack of compliance in performing therapy as well as ongoing cumulative trauma exposure are further factors compromising correct treatment and have to be ruled out prior to surgical therapy.
