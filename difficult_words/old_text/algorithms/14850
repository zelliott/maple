In an effort towards standardization, this paper evaluates the performance of five eye movement classification algorithms in terms of their assessment of oculomotor fixation and saccadic behavior. The results indicate that performance of these five commonly used algorithms vary dramatically even in the case of a simple stimulus evoked task using a single, common threshold value. The important contributions of this paper are: 1) evaluation and comparison of performance of five algorithms to classify specific oculomotor behavior 2) introduction and comparison of new standardized scores to provide more reliable classification performance 3) logic for a reasonable threshold value selection for any eye movement classification algorithm based on the standardized scores and 4) logic for establishing a criterion-based baseline for performance comparison between any eye movement classification algorithms. Proposed techniques enable efficient and objective clinical applications providing means to assure meaningful automated eye movement classification.
