A variation of simulated annealing optimization called 'constrained simulated annealing' is used with a simple annealing schedule to automatically optimize beam weights and beam angles in radiation therapy treatment planning. This optimization technique permits the straightforward utilization of any objective function and any set of dose constraints, even those described by non-analytic functions. Constrained simulated annealing is demonstrated using an objective function which minimizes the probability of normal tissue complications subject to the constraint that the entire target volume receive a tumoricidal dose within specified maximum and minimum limits. Target volume dose constraints are determined by points located on the perimeter of the target volume. Probabilities of normal tissue complications are based on published normal tissue complication probability functions and computed from dose-volume histograms calculated on points spread throughout the normal anatomy.
