A handheld device based on fluorescence of 3,6-bis(1-methyl-4-vinylpyridinium)carbazole diiodide (BMVC) staining was established for the rapid, point-of-care screening of cancer cells (see Chang and co-workers, Analyst, 2007, 132, 745). Offering instant screening of cancer at low cost, here we apply this simple assay in clinical tests on fine needle aspirates of neck masses from 114 outpatients (115 specimens). The diagnostic accuracy of this simple method alone is ca. 80% (80/99). The combination of the BMVC test and the fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology reduced the non-diagnosis from 17 cases in FNA cytology to 6 cases in the combined method. Moreover, an algorithm is proposed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of malignant neck lumps up to nearly 100%.
