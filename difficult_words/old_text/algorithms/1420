This work investigates the influence of environmental inducers on the organization of cell regulation networks, using a connectionist approach. Protein interactions are modeled by an asymmetrical recurrent network, the units of which take continuous values. In contrast to classical models, we explicitly introduce a genome to encode the architecture of the system. This feature enables us to introduce an evolution model, in which a genetic algorithm that mimics the effects of evolution on proteins mutual interactions is used. We assume an efficient system to respond to persistent environmental stimuli, independently of their amplitude. Results are presented that show a structuration of the network with the emergence of specialized hierarchal structures. These structures seem to drive the system at the edge of chaos, so that it can present adapted responses to significant environmental changes.
