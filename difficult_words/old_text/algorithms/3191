Three noncontrast-enhanced MR venography techniques are presented for assessing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at 0.5 T in patients with metallic implants. Two cardiac-gated 3D half-Fourier FSE fresh blood imaging sequences with flow-refocusing pulses (FR-FBI) in the read-out (RO) direction and without FR pulses (non-FR-FBI) were developed for slower-flowing blood. For faster flowing blood, a swap phase-encode arterial double-subtraction elimination (SPADE) technique was developed. The three techniques were assessed both quantitatively using signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-noise-ratio (CNR) measurements and qualitatively by subjective image analysis in 15 volunteers. SPADE was compared to FR-FBI in the pelvic veins and FR-FBI was compared to non-FR-FBI in the thigh and calf veins. Both SPADE and FR-FBI techniques produced significantly higher SNRs, CNRs, and image quality in each comparative study (P<0.001). Five patients with metallic implants and confirmed DVT underwent SPADE (pelvic veins) and FR-FBI (thigh and calf veins) examinations and the results were compared to conventional venography. The SPADE and FR-FBI images showed all DVTs from all five patients without interference from implant susceptibility artifacts. The excellent image quality produced by both SPADE and FR-FBI throughout peripheral vasculature demonstrates their promise for detecting DVT in postsurgery patients.
