A nine-month infant, weighing 9.8 kg, presented with hypotonia secondary to acute hypokalaemia (1.0 mmol/l). Muscle strength improved as the serum potassium was increased. Muscle strength was assessed by the pressure generated inside a saline-filled endotracheal tube cuff during a grasp reflex. Potassium concentration and hand grip strength were related using a sigmoidal Emax model. Zero effect was assumed when the potassium concentration was zero. The Emax, EC50 and Hill coefficient values were determined by non-linear regression using the MKMODEL program. Parameter estimates (SE) were EC50 1.79 (0.15) mmol/l, Hill coefficient 3.79 (0.92), Emax 114.4 (8.9) mmHg.
