A selection of recent results illustrating the application of off-axis electron holography to the study of magnetic microstructure in closely-spaced nanoparticles and nanowires is reviewed. Examples are taken from the characterization of FeNi nanoparticle chains, Co nanoparticle rings, two-dimensional arrays of naturally occurring magnetite crystals in minerals, and single crystalline Co nanowires. Approaches that can be used to separate the magnetic signal of interest from the mean inner potential contribution to the measured holographic phase shift are described, and the spatial and phase resolution that can be achieved are discussed.
