We describe the application of 1H NMR spectroscopy and chemometrics to the analysis of extracts of Artemisia annua. This approach allowed the discrimination of samples from different sources, and to classify them according to anti-plasmodial activity without prior knowledge of this activity. The use of partial least squares analysis allowed the prediction of actual values for anti-plasmodial activities for independent samples not used in producing the models. The models were constructed using approximately 70% of the samples, with 30% used as a validation set for which predictions were made. Models generally explained >90% of the variance, R(2) in the model, and had a predictive ability, Q(2) of >0.8. This approach was also able to correlate 1H NMR spectra with cytotoxicity (R2=0.9, Q2=0.8). This work demonstrates the potential of NMR spectroscopy and chemometrics for the development of predictive models of anti-plasmodial activity.
