Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of cancer with a very poor prognosis.             Although α-fetoprotein (AFP) is the most effective marker available to detect             HCC, the sensitivity and specificity are not optimal. Therefore, there is a need             for the development of more sensitive and specific methods that can supplement             AFP in the early detection of this cancer. In this study, autoantibody responses             to glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent             assay (ELISA), western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence assay in sera             from patients with HCC, liver cirrhosis (LC) and chronic hepatitis (CH), as well             as from normal human individuals. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with tissue array             slides was also preformed to analyze protein expression profiles of GRP78 in HCC             and control tissues. The prevalence of autoantibodies against GRP78 was 35.5%             (27/76) in HCC, which was significantly higher than that in LC, CH and normal             human sera (NHS;  p<0.01). The average titer of autoantibodies against GRP78             in HCC sera was higher compared to that in LC, CH and NHS( p<0.01). When both             autoantibodies against GRP78 and AFP were used simultaneously as diagnostic markers,             sensitivity reached 71.4%. Our data indicate that anti-GRP78 autoantibodies may             be potential diagnostic markers for HCC, especially in conjunction with AFP.
