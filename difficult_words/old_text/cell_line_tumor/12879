Cancer cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as a program of increased invasion and metastasis during cancer progression. Here, we report that a novel regulator of EMT in cancer cells is protein kinase D1 (PKD1), which is downregulated in advanced prostate, breast, and gastric cancers. Ectopic reexpression of PKD1 in metastatic prostate cancer cells reversibly suppressed expression of mesenchyme-specific genes and increased epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PKD1 increased expression of mesenchyme markers. Further, PKD1 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in a tumor xenograft model. PKD1 phosphorylates Ser(11) (S11) on transcription factor Snail, a master EMT regulator and repressor of E-cadherin expression, triggering nuclear export of Snail via 14-3-3Ïƒ binding. Snail S11 mutation causes acquisition of mesenchymal traits and expression of stem cell markers. Together, our results suggest that PKD1 functions as a tumor and metastasis suppressor, at least partly by regulating Snail-mediated EMT, and that loss of PKD1 may contribute to acquisition of an aggressive malignant phenotype.
