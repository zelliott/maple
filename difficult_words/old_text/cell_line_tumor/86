Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) expressed on the tumor cell surface activates pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-13 to exacerbate the malignancy, suggesting its suitability as a target molecule for diagnosis by in vivo molecular imaging. Thus, we prepared radiolabeled anti-MT1-MMP monoclonal antibody (mAb) as a novel radiolabeled probe for detecting MT1-MMP in vivo and evaluated its usefulness in breast tumor-bearing rodents. (99m)Tc-anti-MT1-MMP mAb was prepared using HYNIC as a bifunctional chelating agent and immunoreactivity was evaluated by flow cytometry. MT1-MMP expression in breast carcinoma cells (rat: Walker-256 and MRMT-1, mouse: FM3A) was measured by Western blotting. In vivo biodistribution was examined for 48 h using tumor-implanted rodents followed by estimation of radiation absorbed by a standard quantitation platform Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment (OLINDA). (99m)Tc-anti-MT1-MMP mAb was obtained with 84% immunoreactivity to MT1-MMP and more than 92% radiochemical purity. MT1-MMP was highly expressed in all malignant cells. Tumor radioactivity increased with time after administration and reached 3 to 5 times higher values at 24 h post-injection than those at 1 h. Other organs, including the stomach, showed decreasing values over time. Tumor to blood ratios increased with time and reached more than 1.3 at 48 h. The effective dose was <5.0 muSv/MBq. The results suggest that (99m)Tc-anti-MT1-MMP mAb is a promising probe for future diagnosis of breast tumors by in vivo nuclear medical imaging.
