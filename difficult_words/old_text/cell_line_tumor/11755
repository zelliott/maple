To investigate the change of gastric cancer cell proliferation and the expression of gastric cancer related gene 213 (GCRG213), a long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) endonuclease variant, during hypoxia.

Normal gastric mucosa cell GES-1 and gastric cancer cell BGC-823 were cultured in 20% or 3% oxygen concentrations, respectively. MTT test was used to analyze the proliferation of the GES-1 and BGC-823 cells. The change of GCRG213 mRNA and protein expression in GES-1 and BGC-823 cells was detected by using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Blast was used at the NCBI Blast server to identify GCRG213 sequence to any alignment in the GeneBank databases.

Compared with 20% oxygen condition, 3% oxygen concentration could promote cell growth. Mean-while, the expression of GCRG213 at mRNA and protein levels was increased. GCRG213 sequence shared high homology with LINE-1 endonuclease sequence.

GCRG213 is a variant of LINE-1 endonuclease. Hypoxia as in 3% oxygen condition can promote cell proliferation and lead to GCRG213 overexpression.
