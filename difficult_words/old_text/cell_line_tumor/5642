BoNT/B light chain is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase. After entering its target, the neuronal cell, BoNT/B is responsible for synaptobrevin-2 (VAMP-2) cleavage. This results in reduced neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) release from synaptic vesicles, yielding muscular paralysis. Since the toxin persists in neuronal cells for an extended period, regeneration of VAMP-2 is prevented. We evaluated therapeutic targets to overcome botulinum persistence because early removal would rescue the neuronal cell. The ubiquitination/proteasome cellular pathway is responsible for removing "old" or undesirable proteins. Therefore, we assessed ubiquitination of BoNT/B light chain in vitro, and characterized the effects of ubiquitination modulating drugs, PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) and expoxomicin, on ubiquitination of BoNT/B light chain in neuronal cells. Both drugs altered BoNT/B light chain ubiquitination. Ubiquitination in vitro and in cells decreased the biological activity of BoNT/B light chain. These results further elucidate BoNT protein degradation pathways in intoxicated neuronal cells and mechanisms to enhance toxin removal.
