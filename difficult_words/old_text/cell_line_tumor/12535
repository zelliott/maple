The objective of this study was to develop a novel folate receptor-targeted drug delivery system for retinoblastoma cells using doxorubicin (DOX) as a model drug.

Biodegradable DOX-loaded poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)-poly(ethylene glycol)-folate (PLGA-PEG-FOL) micelles (DOXM) were prepared with various solvents (dimethylsulfoxide, acetone, and dimethylformamide). The effects of solvents on entrapment efficiency, particle size, and polydispersity were examined. The effects of thermosensitive gel structure on the release of DOX from the DOXM were also studied. Qualitative and quantitative uptake studies of DOX and DOXM were carried out in Y-79 cell line. Cytotoxicity studies of DOXM were performed on Y-79 cells.

Based on size, polydispersity, and entrapment efficiency, dimethylformamide was found to be the most suitable solvent for the preparation of DOXM. Dispersion of DOXM in PLGA-PEG-PLGA gel sustained drug release for a period of 2 weeks. Uptake of DOX was âˆ¼4 times higher with DOXM than DOX in Y-79 cells overexpressing folate receptors. This was further confirmed from the quantitative uptake studies. DOXM exhibited higher cytotoxicity in Y-79 cells when compared with pure DOX.

These polymeric micellar systems suspended in thermosensitive gels may provide sustained and targeted delivery of anticancer agents to retinoblastoma cells following intravitreal administration.
