Aurora-A/STK15/BTAK, a centrosome-associated serine/threonine kinase, has been shown to induce chromosomal instability, leading to aneuploidy and cell transformation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and amplification of Aurora-A in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Aurora-A mRNA levels were measured in 224 HCCs and 199 paired nontumorous liver tissues by reverse transcription-PCR. Aurora-A mRNA and protein levels of 8 were also measured by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot hybridization in 8 liver cancer cell lines. Amplification of Aurora-A was determined by Southern blot hybridization in 99 cases.

Aurora-A was overexpressed in 137 of 224 (61%) HCCs and all 8 of the cell lines. Overexpression of Aurora-A was associated with high-grade (grade II-IV), and high-stage (stage IIIB-IV) tumors, p53 mutation, infrequent beta-catenin mutation, and poor outcome. Aurora-A overexpression and p53 mutation acted synergistically toward poor prognosis. Amplification of Aurora-A was detected only in 3 HCCs.

The results show that Aurora-A is overexpressed frequently in HCC, and correlated with high grade and high stage, indicating that overexpression of Aurora-A plays a role in the development and progression of HCC.
