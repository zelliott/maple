In order to find a suppressor(s) of tumor progression in vivo for oral carcinoma (OC), we searched for molecules down-regulated in OC cells when the cells were treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF), whose receptor is frequently over-activated in OC. The expression of BRAK, which is also known as CXC chemokine ligand14 (CXCL14), was down-regulated significantly by the treatment of OC cells with EGF as observed by cDNA microarray analysis followed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. The EGF effect was attenuated by the co-presence of a MEK inhibitor. The rate of tumor formation in vivo of BRAK-expressing vector-transfected tumor cells in athymic nude mice was significantly lower than that of mock vector-transfected ones. In addition tumors formed in vivo by the BRAK-expressing cells were significantly smaller than those of the mock-transfected ones. These results indicate that BRAK/CXCL14 is a chemokine, having suppressive activity toward tumor progression of OC in vivo.
