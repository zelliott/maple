The antisense oligonucleotide 2'-O-methyl-RNA is a selective telomerase inhibitor targeting the telomerase RNA component and represents a potential candidate for anticancer therapy. The poor cellular uptake of 2'-O-methyl-RNA is a limiting factor that may contribute to the lack of functional efficacy. To improve delivery of 2'-O-methyl-RNA and consequently antitumoral efficiency in human lung cancer cells, we have investigated several transfection reagents. The transfection reagents DOTAP, MegaFectin 60, SuperFect, FuGENE 6 and MATra-A were tested for intracellular delivery. A FAM-labeled 2'-O-methyl-RNA was used to assess the intracellular distribution by confocal laser scanning microscopy in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells. Telomerase activity was measured using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol. Cell viability after transfection was quantified by the MTT assay. All transfection reagents enhanced 2'-O-methyl-RNA uptake in A549 cells but the cationic lipid reagents DOTAP and MegaFectin 60 were most efficient in the delivery of 2'-O-methyl-RNA resulting in telomerase inhibition. Among both DOTAP exhibited the lowest cytotoxicity. Our experiments show that DOTAP is the most suitable transfection reagent for the delivery of 2'-O-methyl-RNA in human lung cancer cells according to its relatively low cytotoxicity and its ability to promote efficient uptake leading to the inhibition of telomerase.
