The anticancer agent, taxol, stabilizes tubulin polymerization, resulting             in arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and apoptotic cell death. However,             the molecular mechanism of this growth inhibition and apoptosis is poorly understood.             In this study, we used MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells which             have different estrogen receptor (ER) and tumor suppressor p53 statuses to examine             the mechanisms of taxol-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Treatment of             the cells with taxol resulted in a time-dependent inhibition of cell viability,             which was accompanied by an accumulation of cells at G2/M and the sub-G1 apoptotic             region, determined by flow cytometric analysis. Furthermore, chromatin condensation,             DNA ladder formation and proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)             in both cell lines were observed following treatment with taxol, indicating the             occurrence of apoptotic cell death. Western blot analysis using whole cell lysates             from MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with taxol demonstrated that taxol treatment             inhibited expression of cyclin A and cyclin B1 proteins in a time-dependent manner.             The inhibitory effects of taxol on cell growth and apoptosis induced by taxol             were also associated with the downregulation of Wee1 kinase expression and a marked             induction in the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21WAF/CIP1.             Furthermore, taxol elevated p21 promoter activity in both cell lines. These findings             suggest that taxol-induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis in human breast carcinoma             cells is mediated through the ER- and p53-independent upregulation of p21.
