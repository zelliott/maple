Bacteriophages in eukaryotic hosts may behave as particulate antigens able to activate the innate immune system and generate adaptive immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the initiation of the immune response, mainly by priming T cell-mediated immunity. For this reason, they are increasingly applied as an adjuvant for effective anti-tumor therapies in animal models as well as in a few clinical trials. The presented study focused on the application of mouse DCs which were activated with T4 bacteriophages (T4 phages, T4) and further loaded with tumor antigens (TAg) in inducing an anti-tumor response. The activation of bone marrow-derived DCs with T4 phages and TAg resulted in augmentation of their differentiation marker expression accompanied by an enhanced ability to prime T cells for IFN-gamma production. These activated DCs (BM-DC/T4+TAg) were used in experimental immunotherapy of C57BL/6 mice bearing advanced MC38 colon carcinoma tumors. As a result of their triple application, a significant tumor growth delay, up to 19 days, was observed compared with the controls - treated with BM-DCs activated only with T4 phages, TAg, or lipopolysaccharide solution ["solvent"], where the tumor growth delay did not exceed 7 days. The percentage of tumor growth inhibition estimated 10 days after the third cell injection ranged from 32% (for animals treated with BM-DC/TAg cells) to 76% (for animals treated with BM-DC/T4+TAg cells) over the tumor-bearing untreated control mice. The obtained data indicate that in vitro interactions between T4 phages and BM-DCs followed by TAg activation caused augmentation of the anti-tumor effect when DCs were used as a vaccine for tumor-bearing mice treatment. Therefore, pretreatment of DCs with the phages may be considered as a beneficial element of a novel strategy in anti-tumor immunotherapy.
