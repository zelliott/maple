In the course of our search for new anti-breast cancer agents, substituted phenanthrenes with basic amino side chains were synthesized and some of them showed remarkable antiproliferative activity against ER +ve MCF-7 cell line with IC(50) in the range of 3.53-22.25 microM. One of the compounds 15 ca showed anti-breast cancer activity in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) induced hormone-dependent mammary tumor in rat and the activity was comparable to that shown by tamoxifen.
