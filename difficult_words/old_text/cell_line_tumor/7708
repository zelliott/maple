To determine the sensitivity of cetuximab induced apoptosis in laryngeal squamous carcinoma cells Hep-2, and to evaluate the synergistic killing effects and regulation mechanism of cetuximab alone or cetuximab in combination with chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin) or radiation means on Hep-2 cells.

To investigate the cytotoxicities of cetuximab, cisplatin and radiation, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used for the detection of cell growth inhibition ratio, and fluorescence activated cell sorter FACS for the apoptotic rate and cell cycle distribution.

Cetuximab had inhibitive effect on Hep-2 cells within a certain range of concentration in a time- and dose-dependence manner. The inhibition concentration 50% (IC50) of cetuximab on Hep-2 cells for 24 h was 1 036.84 microg/ml. For application of cisplatin and radiation, the apoptotic rate of Hep-2 cell was higher by combining with cetuximab than their single or combined administration. Moreover, the cell cycle arrested at G0/G1 phase.

Laryngeal cancer Hep-2 cells was sensitive to the cetuximab induced apoptosis. Cetuximab combined with cisplatin and/or radiation can increase the antiproliferative effects on Hep-2 cells. These findings suggest the synergistic combination of cetuximab and cytotoxic agents was sequence depended.
