To determine the changes in phenotype, proliferation activity and cytotoxicity of cytokine induced killer (CIK) cells after in vitro co-culturing with dendritic cells (DC), and then to investigate the auxiliary therapeutical effect of CIK cells after chemotherapy.

DC and CIK cells were generated by culturing prepheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy blood donors. Then the changes in the proliferation activity and phenotype of the cells were determined after DC and CIK cell co-culture. MTT assays were used to determine the cytotoxicity in vitro. The antitumor activity of DC and CIK cells were evaluated after chemotherapy in BALB/c nude mice bearing A549 lung cancer and BEL-7404 liver cancer respectively.

DC and CIK cells promoted the antitumor effect of chemotherapy. Co-culture of DC with CIK cells produced a new cell population, whose cytotoxicity and proliferation activity were much higher than those of CIK cells.

CIK cells co-cultured with DC are more potent than CIK cells alone in the anti-tumor effect.
