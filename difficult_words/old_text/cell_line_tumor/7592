Glioblastoma multiforme is the most lethal and aggressive astrocytoma among primary brain tumors in adults. However, most glioblastoma cells have been reported to be resistant to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. Here, we have shown that digitoxin (DT), a clinically approved cardiac glycoside for heart failure, can induce TRAIL-mediated apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. DT in noncytotoxic doses (20 nmol/l) can increase TRAIL-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant U87MG glioblastoma cells. Treatment with DT led to apoptosis and a robust reduction in the levels of the antiapoptotic protein survivin by inducing its proteasomal degradation; however, it did not affect the levels of many other apoptosis regulators. Moreover, silencing survivin with small interfering RNAs sensitized glioma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, underscoring the functional role of survivin depletion in the TRAIL-sensitizing actions of DT. We demonstrate that inactivation of survivin and death receptor 5 expression by DT is sufficient to restore TRAIL sensitivity in resistant glioma cells. Our results suggest that combining DT with TRAIL treatments may be useful in the treatment of TRAIL-resistant glioma cells.
