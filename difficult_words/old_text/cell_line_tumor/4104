Three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) modeling, comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA), and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) of polyhydroxylated N-benzylbenzamide derivatives containing an adamantyl moiety were performed to understand the mechanism of action and structure-activity relationship of these compounds. Contour map analysis indicated that steric contributions of the adamantyl moiety and electrostatic contributions of the hydroxyl group at the 3-position are important in the activity. Activities of the training set and test sets predicted by CoMFA fit well with actual activities, demonstrating that CoMFA, along with the best calculated q(2) value, has the best predictive ability.
