Aberrant nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NRF2) expression correlates with tumor             development. We investigated NRF2 expression in ovarian epithelial carcinoma (OEC),             aiming to identify associations with clinicopathological factors, hormones and             induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Immunohistochemical staining for NRF2 expression             was performed on 10 benign cystadenomas, 4 boderline tumors and 64 OECs. Western             blotting was used to determine the effects of hormones on NRF2 expression in OEC.             NRF2 protein was found to be overexpressed in OEC. Gonadotrophins and estrogen             induced ROS production in OEC; these hormones also enhanced NRF2 expression. Therefore,             aberrant expression may be induced by hormones through ROS signaling. Increased             NRF2 expression may be a molecular event in OEC carcinogenesis.
