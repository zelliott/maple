To investigate the inhibitory effects of recombinant human interleukin-24 (rhIL-24) on ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and cisplatin (DDP)-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3/DDP in vitro, and to observe the changes in apoptosis and cell cycle of SKOV3 and SKOV3/DDP.

Cell proliferation was detected by CCK8 assay, and the changes in apoptosis and cell cycle of SKOV3 and SKOV3/DDP were detected by flow cytometry after the treatment with rhIL-24 alone, DDP alone and rhIL-24 combined with DDP, respectively.

The treatment with rhIL-24 significantly inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and SKOV3/DDP in vitro. RhIL-24 combined with DDP resulted in a 30.7% growth inhibition, which showed a significant difference compared with the 6.5% growth inhibition in DDP alone group. The apoptosis rates detected by flow cytometry in rhIL-24 alone group, DDP alone group and combination group were 14.95%, 12.99% and 16.32%, respectively, which showed a significant difference compared with the apoptosis rate (1.32%) in negative control group. Furthermore, cell cycle detection indicated that the percentage of SKOV3 in G2 and S phases increased in rhIL-24 alone group, as well as in S phase in combination group. The percentage of SKOV3/DDP in G2 phase increased in rhIL-24 alone group, as well as in G1 phase in combination group.

The treatment with rhIL-24 led to the growth inhibition of ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and SKOV3/DDP, which was caused by apoptosis. And the inhibition effects of DDP could be enhanced after the treatment with combination therapy. rhIL-24 and combination therapy induced cell cycle arrest in G2 phase and G1 phase, respectively.
