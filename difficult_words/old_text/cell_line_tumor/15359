Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle for the effective treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. The mechanism of chemoresistance is still poorly understood. Recently, more and more evidence showed microRNAs (miRNAs) modulated many key molecules and pathways involved in chemotherapy. microRNA-106a (miR-106a) has been implicated in many cancers, but its role in ovarian cancer and drug resistance still remains unexplored. This study was to investigate whether miR-106a mediated resistance of the ovarian cancer cell line A2780 to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin (DDP). The different levels of miR-106a in A2780 cells and their resistant variant A2780/DDP cells were identified by using real-time PCR. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to analyze the effect of miR-106a on cisplatin resistance of these paired cells. Real-time PCR, Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay were applied to explore whether Mcl-1 was a target of miR-106a. As compared to A2780 cells, the expression of miR-106a was down-regulated in the cisplatin resistant cell line A2780/DDP. Moreover, knockdown of miR-106a dramatically decreased antiproliferative effects and apoptosis induced by cisplatin in A2780 cells, while overexpression of miR-106a significantly increased antiproliferative effects and apoptosis induced by cisplatin in A2780/DDP cells. Furthermore, miR-106a inhibited cell survival and cisplatin resistance through downregulating the expression of Mcl-1. Mcl-1 was a direct target of miR-106a. These results suggest that miR-106a may provide a novel mechanism for understanding cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer by modulating Mcl-1.
