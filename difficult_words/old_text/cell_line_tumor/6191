Inhalation is an attractive delivery route for systemic and local therapy. High local drug concentrations may permit non-invasive delivery, lower therapeutic doses, reduced systemic side-effects, and reduced metabolic degradation of the drug in the liver. In our earlier study, carrier-based microcomposites were prepared and investigated. The present study introduces studies of the cytotoxicity of meloxicam-containing microcomposites on monolayers of Calu-3 cells, in order to acquire information on its availability in pulmonary formulations. By relating cytotoxicity and drug dissolution, the appropriate amount of meloxicam for dry powder inhalation could be determined.
