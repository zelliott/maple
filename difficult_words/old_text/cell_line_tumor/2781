Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins are ubiquitous environmental pollutants and activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor. It has been reported that testosterone represses 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced transcription of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 gene in LNCaP cells. In this study, we investigated the mechanism for the repression of 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC)-induced transcription of AhR-regulated genes, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, and AhR repressor (AhRR), by 5alpha-dihydroteststerone (DHT) in LNCaP and T47D cells, which are androgen receptor (AR)- and AhR-positive. Real-time PCR analysis showed that DHT repressed 3MC-induced mRNA expression of the CYP1 family and AhRR genes. DHT repressed 3MC-induced luciferase activity in an AhR response element-driven luciferase reporter assay in LNCaP and T47D cells. The inhibitory effect of DHT was abolished by knockdown of AR protein with siRNA. The protein levels of AhR and AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt), the AhR-dimerizing partner, were not affected by DHT. Co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that DHT significantly facilitated the complex formation between AR and AhR in 3MC-treated cells. These results suggest that complex formation between activated AR and AhR plays an important role in the suppression of 3MC-induced transcription of CYP1 family genes by DHT.
