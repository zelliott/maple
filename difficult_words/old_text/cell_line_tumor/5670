Two amides, heitziamide A and heitziamide B and two phenylethanoids, heitziethanoid A and heitziethanoid B together with thirteen known compounds were isolated from F. heitzii (Letouzey). The structures of all compounds were established by spectroscopic analysis. Nine compounds were evaluated for oxidative burst inhibitory activity in a chemoluminescence assay and for cytotoxicity against PC-3 prostate cancer cells. All compounds exhibited a clear suppressive effect on phagocytosis response upon activation with serum opsonized zymosan at the range of IC(50)=2.0-6.5 microM, but no cytotoxic effect was observed (IC(50)>100 microM).
