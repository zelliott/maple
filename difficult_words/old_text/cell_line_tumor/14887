Filamentous phage as a bacteria-specific virus can be conjugated with an anticancer drug and has been proposed to serve as a carrier to deliver drugs to cancer cells for targeted therapy. However, how cell-targeting filamentous phage alone affects cancer cell biology is unclear. Phage libraries provide an inexhaustible reservoir of new ligands against tumor cells and tissues that have potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications in cancer treatment. Some of these identified ligands might stimulate various cell responses. Here we identified new cell internalizing peptides (and the phages with such peptides fused to each of ~3900 copies of their major coat protein) using landscape phage libraries and for the first time investigated the actin dynamics when selected phages are internalized into the SKBR-3 breast cancer cells. Our results show that phages harboring VSSTQDFP and DGSIPWST peptides could selectively internalize into the SKBR-3 breast cancer cells with high affinity, and also show rapid involvement of membrane ruffling and rearrangements of actin cytoskeleton during the phage entry. The actin dynamics was studied by using live cell and fluorescence imaging. The cell-targeting phages were found to enter breast cancer cells through energy dependent mechanism and phage entry interferes with actin dynamics, resulting in reorganization of actin filaments and increased membrane rufflings in SKBR-3 cells. These results suggest that, when phage enters epithelial cells, it triggers transient changes in the host cell actin cytoskeleton. This study also shows that using multivalent phage libraries considerably increases the repertoire of available cell-internalizing ligands with potential applications in targeted drug delivery, imaging, molecular monitoring and profiling of breast cancer cells.
