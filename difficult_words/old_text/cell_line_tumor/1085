We investigated the membrane localization of CD95 in type I and type II cells, which differ in their ability to recruit and activate caspase-8. We found that CD95 was preferentially located in lipid rafts of type I cells, while it was present both in raft and non-raft plasma membrane sub-domains of type II cells. After stimulation, CD95 located in phospholipid-rich plasma membrane was recruited to lipid rafts in both types of cells. Similarly, CD95 cross-linking resulted in caspase-independent translocation of FADD/MORT1 and caspase-8 to the lipid rafts, which was prevented by a death domain-defective receptor. CD95 internalization was then rapid in type I and delayed in type II cells and showed a substantial correlation with the kinetics of Fas-associated death domain (FADD)and caspase-8 recruitment to lipid rafts. Finally, electron microscopy analysis showed that after CD95 stimulation lipid rafts aggregated in large clusters that were internalized in endosomal vesicles, where caspase-8 underwent massive processing. Taken together, our data demonstrate that CD95 death-inducing signaling complex formation and internalization in type I and type II cells occur in lipid rafts, which are a major site of caspase-8 activation.
