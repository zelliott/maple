To study the expression and significance of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors in human prostate cancer.

SP immunohistochemical method was employed to investigate the expression of alpha subunit of GM-CSF receptors in 48 cases of primary prostate cancer, 20 benign prostate hyperplasia samples and four kinds of cancer cell lines K562, PC-3M, HL-60 and MCF-7.

The total positive percentage of GM-CSF expression in prostate cancer was 79.2%. The positive percentages in the groups with Gleason score 2-4, 5-8, and 9-10 were 75%, 82.3% and 81.2% respectively. The four kinds of cancer cell lines had prominent GM-CSF receptor alpha subunit expression.

It suggests that both hyperplastic and neoplastic prostate tissues are responsive to GM-CSF and the extensive expression of GM-CSF receptors is an important characteristic of prostate cancer.
