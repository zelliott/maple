Two new series of inhibitors of tubulin polymerization based on the 2-amino-3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)benzo[b]thiophene molecular skeleton and its 3-amino positional isomer were synthesized and evaluated for antiproliferative activity, inhibition of tubulin polymerization, and cell cycle effects. Although many more 3-amino derivatives have been synthesized so far, the most promising compound in this series was 2-amino-6-methyl-3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)benzo[b]thiophene, which inhibits cancer cell growth at subnanomolar concentrations and interacts strongly with tubulin by binding to the colchicine site.
