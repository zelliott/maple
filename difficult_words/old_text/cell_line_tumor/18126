We have previously demonstrated that bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract (bDLE) induces death through an apoptosis mechanism in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Depending on the cell type and stimulus, activating protein-1 (AP-1) has been shown to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, the stress response, apoptosis and survival. It remains unknown whether AP-1 and other transcription factors are mechanisms by which bDLE induces cell death.

To determine whether bDLE modulates the AP-1 DNA binding and gene expression, MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with bDLE (0, 1, 5, 10 U) for 72 h and evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays.

bDLE induced inhibition of cell growth, suppressed the AP-1 DNA-binding activity, decreased c-Jun protein expression and modulated NFATx, NFATc, NFkappaB, c-Jun and c-Fos transcription factor gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

The present data indicate that bDLE can block the AP-1 DNA-binding activity and expression of several transcriptions factors in breast cancer cells, which will have great potential in improving cancer therapy.
