The transcription factors Pea3, Erm, and Er81 can promote cancer initiation and progression in various types of solid tumors. However, their role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been elucidated. In this study, we found that the expression levels of Pea3 and Erm, but not that of Er81, were significantly higher in ESCC compared with nontumor esophageal epithelium. A high level of Pea3 expression was significantly correlated with a shorter overall survival in a cohort of 81 patients with ESCC and the subgroup with N1 stage tumor (Wilcoxon-Gehan test, P = 0.016 and P = 0.001, respectively). Pea3 was overexpressed in seven ESCC cell lines compared with two immortalized esophageal cell lines. Pea3 knockdown reduced cell proliferation and suppressed nonadherent growth, migration, and invasion in ESCC cells in vitro. In addition, Pea3 knockdown in ESCC cells resulted in a down-regulation of phospho-Akt and matrix metalloproteinase 13, whereas a significant positive correlation in the expression levels was observed between Pea3 and phospho-Akt (r = 0.281, P < 0.013) and between Pea3 and matrix metalloproteinase 13 in the human specimens (r = 0.462, P < 0.001). Moreover, Pea3 modulated the sensitivity of EC109 cells to doxorubicin, probably via reduced activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of Rapamycin complex 1 pathway on Pea3 knockdown. In conclusion, our results suggest that Pea3 plays an important role in the progression of ESCC.
