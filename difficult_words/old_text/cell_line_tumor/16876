Comparison between organic and conventional kiwifruit cultivars 'Hayward' and 'Bidan', which was done by four radical scavenging assays, ESI-MS, and DSC measurements, showed significant differences between the cultivars. Such results were not estimated in kiwifruit growing under organic and conventional conditions. The extraction of bioactive compounds was done by two different methods: sequential extraction with ethyl acetate followed by methanol and maceration with methanol and ethyl acetate. The highest yield of polyphenols was found in the new cultivar 'Bidan' in comparison with the classic 'Hayward', by direct extraction with methanol. This is the first investigation of 'Bidan' kiwifruit cultivar, grown under organic conditions and compared with 'Hayward' organic. High contents of bioactive compounds and antioxidant and antiproliferative properties of the two kiwifruit cultivars justify their use as sources of valuable antioxidants. It is necessary to continue this study as a long-term experiment to eliminate the influence of seasonality.
