To combat threats posed by DNA damage, cells have evolved mechanisms, collectively termed DNA damage response (DDR). These mechanisms detect DNA lesions, signal their presence, and promote their repair. Centrosomes integrate G2/M checkpoint control and repair signals in response to genotoxic stress, acting as an efficient control mechanism when G2/M checkpoint function fails and mitosis begins in the presence of damaged DNA. Che-1 is an RNA polymerase II-binding protein involved in the regulation of gene transcription, induction of cell proliferation, and DDR. Here we provide evidence that in addition to its nuclear localization, Che-1 localizes at interphase centrosomes, where it accumulates following DNA damage or spindle poisons. We show that Che-1 depletion generates supernumerary centrosomes, multinucleated cells, and multipolar spindle formation. Notably, Che-1 depletion abolishes the ability of Chk1 to bind pericentrin and to localize at centrosomes, which, in its turn, deregulates the activation of centrosomal cyclin B-Cdk1 and advances entry into mitosis. Our results reinforce the notion that Che-1 plays an important role in DDR and that its contribution seems to be relevant for the spindle assembly checkpoint.
