Heparanase has been previously associated with the metastatic potential, inflammation, and angiogenesis of tumor cells. Heparanase activity has been detected by means of UV absorption, radiolabeled substrates, electrophoretic migration, and heparan sulfate affinity assays. However, those methods have proven to be somewhat problematic with regards to application to actual biological samples, the accessibility of the immobilized substrates, experimental sensitivity, and the separation of degraded products. Rather than focusing on heparanase activity, then, we have developed a rapid, alternative colorimetric heparinase assay, on the basis of the recent finding that sulfated disaccharides generated from heparin by bacterial heparinase exhibit biological properties comparable to those from heparan sulfate by mammalian heparanase. In this study, the concentrations of porcine heparin and bacterial heparinase I were determined using a Sigma Diagnostics Kit. Morus alba was selected as a candidate through this assay system, and an inhibitor, resveratrol, was purified from its methanol extract. Its anti-metastatic effects on the pulmonary metastasis of murine B16 melanoma cells were also evaluated. Our findings suggest that this assay may prove useful as a diagnostic tool for heparinase inhibition, as an alternative anti-metastatic target.
