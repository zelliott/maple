The effects were examined of selected extracellular medium (ECM) components on the proliferation of medullary thyroid carcinoma cells and on the production of calcitonin and CGRP. Human TT cells and rat rMTC cells were cultured for 24, 48 and 72 hours on glass coated with type I collagen, fibronectin or poly-D-lysine. More pronounced proliferation was demonstrated by TT cells grown on poly-Dlysine or collagen in comparison with the control and less pronounced proliferation was typical of cells grown on fibronectin. On the other hand, rMTC cells were more markedly manifest on any ECM substrates than that on glass. Alterations in the proliferation were paralleled by changes in the expression of CT and CGRP.
