Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) I and II expression in endometrial cancer cells correlates with the malignant potential of this tumor, and CaMKI and II are potential therapeutic targets in endometrial cancer. CaMKI and II expression was significantly associated with PCNA-labeling index, clinical stage, histological grade, the presence of invasion to greater than one-half the myometrium, and clinical outcome. All endometrial cancer cell lines examined were sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effect of KN-93, a membrane-permeant CaMKs-selective inhibitor that is competitive with calmodulin. KN-93 induced the G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis, rising hopes that KN-93 may become a useful treatment for endometrial cancers.
