Crossostephium chinensis (L.) (CC) Makino is a common traditional Chinese medicinal plant used to dehumidify and cure rheumatism and arthralgia. The water and methanol extracts of C. chinensis (CCW and CCM) were evaluated for their antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. The antioxidant activities of CC were evaluated by using ABTS radical scavenging, DPPH radical scavenging, nitric oxide scavenging and superoxide scavenging methods. Iron chelating activity, lipid peroxidation, total polyphenol contents, total flavonoid contents and total flavonol contents were also detected. In all the tested models, both CCW and CCM showed their ability to scavenge the free radicals in a does-dependent manner. CCW had higher antioxidant and antiproliferative activities than CCM. In LC-MS-MS analysis, the chromatograms of CCW with good antioxidant activities were established. Rutin might be an important bioactive compound in CCW. The antiproliferative activities of CCW and CCM were also studied in vitro by using human hepatoma HepG2 cells. CCW exhibited good antiproliferative activity. These results indicated that CCW might be used as a potential source of natural antioxidants and as an anti-tumor agent.
