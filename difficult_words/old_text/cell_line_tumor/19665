A mannose-rich polysaccharide biological response modifier (BRM), derived from Aloe vera L. var. chinensis (Haw.) Berg., was demonstrated to be a potent murine B- and T-cell stimulator in our previous study. We here report the stimulatory activity of PAC-I on murine peritoneal macrophage. The polysaccharide when injected into mice enhanced the migration of macrophages to the peritoneal cavity. Peritoneal macrophage when treated by PAC-I in vitro had increased expression of MHC-II and FcgammaR, and enhanced endocytosis, phagocytosis, nitric oxide production, TNF-alpha secretion and tumor cell cytotoxicity. The administration of PAC-I into allogeneic ICR mice stimulated systemic TNF-alpha production in a dose-dependent manner and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. PAC-I is thus a potent stimulator of murine macrophage and the in vitro observed tumoricidal properties of activated macrophage might account for the in vivo antitumor properties of PAC-I. Our research findings may have therapeutic implications in tumor immunotherapy.
