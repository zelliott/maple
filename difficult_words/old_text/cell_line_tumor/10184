Increasing evidences suggest that oxidative stress may play a significant role in microcystins (MCs) toxicity not only in mammals, but also in fish. In this regard, many in vivo studies have been performed but little is still known about the alteration of oxidative stress biomarkers on fish cell lines so far. In this study, the toxic effects of MC-LR were investigated in the fish cell line PLHC-1, derived from a hepatocellular carninoma of the topminnow Poeciliosis lucida, after 48 h of exposure. The different response of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), as well as lipid peroxidation (LPO) as a biomarker of oxygen-mediated toxicity, were assessed in PLHC-1 cells. The increases in the antioxidant enzymatic activities (SOD, GPx, and GST) as well as in LPO values observed evidenced the oxidative stress induced by MC-LR exposure. Moreover, the enhancements of these enzymes could suggest an adaptative response to combat oxidative injure induced by MC-LR, confirming that this mechanism is involved in the damage induced by MCs on fish cells.
