A series of cobalt complexes of the potent DNA minor groove alkylator 1-(chloromethyl)-3-(5,6,7-trimethoxyindol-2-ylcarbonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,2-f]quinolin-5-ol (seco-6-azaCBI-TMI) were prepared from a series of N-substituted cyclen ligands. The final N-substituted complexes carried formal overall charges ranging from +2 to -2 and showed limited improvements in solubility. They showed similar stabilities to that of the complex with the unsubstituted cyclen ligand, and large but variable attenuation of the cytotoxicity of the free alkylator (2-30-fold), compared to 150-fold for the unsubstituted ligand. However, they had oxic/hypoxic ratios (2-22-fold) comparable to that of the unsubstituted cyclen complex (5).
