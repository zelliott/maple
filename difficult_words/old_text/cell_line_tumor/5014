In an effort to develop novel antitumor or chemopreventive agents, a series of 2',5'-dimethoxychalcone derivatives were prepared by Claisen-Schmidt condensation of appropriate acetophenones with suitable aromatic aldehyde. In vitro screening revealed low micromolar activity (IC(50)) against several human cancer lines. Activity in MCF-7 cells correlated with the ability to induce G(2)/M arrest-mediated apoptosis following drug treatment by the most potent agent, 8, an observation further reinforced by fluorescence microscopy. Compounds 3, 8, and 10 showed potent inhibitory effect on NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells. The present results demonstrated that 3, 8, and 10 are potential anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive agents.
