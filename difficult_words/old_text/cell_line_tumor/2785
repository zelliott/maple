To investigate the effect of the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib on prostaglandin E(2) (PGE2) release and vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and COX-2 mRNA expression in Tca8113 cell lines.

MTT assay was used to analyze the proliferation of Tca8113 cells. The PGE2 level was detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the expressions of COX-2 and VEGF-C mRNA were examined with RT-PCR.

Celecoxib could induce inhibitory effects on the growth and PGE2 release in Tca8113 cells. The RT-PCR results showed that celecoxib significantly down-regulated the expression of VEGF-C mRNA, but produced a weak effect on COX-2 mRNA expression.

The inhibitory effect of celecoxib on Tca8113 cell growth and the expressions of VEGF-C and COX-2 may be related to the release of PGE2.
