The interest in microbial biosurfactants has steadily increased during the past decade. In addition to the classical application as emulsifiers of hydrocarbons, they can be used in environmental protection, crude-oil recovery, food-processing industries and in various fields of biomedicine. Biosurfactants have several advantages over chemical surfactants including lower toxicity and higher biodegradability, and are likely to become molecules of the future in areas such as biomedicine and therapeutics. Here, we discuss the role and applications of biosurfactants (mainly glycolipids and lipopeptides) focusing on medicinal and therapeutic perspectives.
