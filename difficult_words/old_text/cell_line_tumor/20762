The underlying premise of these investigations was that the lipophilic hormone progesterone, which partitions into and (at relatively high concentrations) impedes the fluid mechanics of the plasmalemma, would perturb integral associations between membrane lipids and exporter pumps that otherwise confer drug resistance. That progesterone can affect susceptibility of ovarian adenocarcinoma cells and xenografts to cisplatin was tested.

The cisplatin-resistant human cell lines SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 were treated for 24 hours with cisplatin (0.1 microg/ml)+/-progesterone (0.01, 0.1 microg/ml). Cytotoxicity and platinum were measured by MTT assay and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, respectively. Athymic mice were inoculated intraperitoneal (ip) with SKOV-3 cells. Cisplatin (2 mg/kg/week)+/-progesterone (25 mg sustained-release pellet) regimens were initiated ip at one week (when micrometastases were present) and continued to six weeks post-xenograft. Tumor burdens, histopathology, and platinum concentrations were assessed upon necropsy at 24 hours after the final injection of cisplatin.

There were no significant in vitro/vivo anticancer effects of cisplatin alone. High-dose progesterone enhanced platinum accretion and induced drug toxicity in both cell lines. Tumorigenesis was suppressed by cisplatin+progesterone. The treatment synergy was related to elevated tumor platinum and morphological evidence of apoptosis.

It appears that the addition of progesterone to ovarian cancer therapeutic modalities represents a step in improving responses.
