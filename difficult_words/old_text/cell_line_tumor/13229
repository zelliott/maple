A series of macrobicyclic dizinc(II) complexes [Zn(2)L(1-2)B](ClO(4))(4) (1-6) have been synthesized and characterized (L(1-2) are polyaza macrobicyclic binucleating ligands, and B is the N,N-donor heterocyclic base (viz. 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy) and 1,10-phenanthroline (phen)). The DNA and protein binding, DNA hydrolysis and anticancer activity of these complexes were investigated. The interactions of complexes 1-6 with calf thymus DNA were studied by spectroscopic techniques, including absorption, fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. The DNA binding constant values of the complexes were found to range from 2.80 × 10(5) to 5.25 × 10(5) M(-1), and the binding affinities are in the following order: 3 > 6 > 2 > 5 > 1 > 4. All the dizinc(II) complexes 1-6 are found to effectively promote the hydrolytic cleavage of plasmid pBR322 DNA under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Kinetic data for DNA hydrolysis promoted by 3 and 6 under physiological conditions give observed rate constants (k(obs)) of 5.56 ± 0.1 and 5.12 ± 0.2 h(-1), respectively, showing a 10(7)-fold rate acceleration over the uncatalyzed reaction of dsDNA. Remarkably, the macrobicyclic dizinc(II) complexes 1-6 bind and cleave bovine serum albumin (BSA), and effectively promote the caspase-3 and caspase-9 dependent deaths of HeLa and BeWo cancer cells. The cytotoxicity of the complexes was further confirmed by lactate dehydrogenase enzyme levels in cancer cell lysate and content media.
