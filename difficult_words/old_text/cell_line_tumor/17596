Mouse insulinoma (MIN6) cells were encapsulated into aminopropyl-silicate membrane deposited on calcium alginate gel beads via the sol-gel synthesis. Two alginates with different guluronic acid (G) contents, high and intermediate, but with the same molecular weights were used. Viability of the cells in the membrane templated by the alginate with an intermediate content of guluronic acid (intermediate-G) was approximately 10% higher than those in the membrane templated by the alginate with a high content of guluronic acid immediately after encapsulation. Growth of cells in vitro was hindered in case of encapsulation in the aminopropyl-silicate membrane deposited on the high-G alginate gel. The MIN6 cells in the microcapsule made from high-G alginate needed a longer period to establish a normoglycemic in recipients than those in the microcapsule made from intermediate-G alginate despite the same number of viable cells implantation. Recipients of the microcapsule with the core made from the intermediate-G alginate maintained their blood glucose values less than 300 mg/dl for a longer period.
