A new contrast agent, LipImage™ 815, has been designed and compared to previously described indocyanine green (ICG)-loaded lipid nanoparticles (ICG-lipidots®). Both contrast agents display similar size (50-nm diameter), zeta potential, high IC50 in cellular studies, near-infrared absorption and emission wavelengths in the "imaging window," long-term shelf colloidal and optical stabilities with high brightness (>106  L mol-1 cm-1) in ready-to-use storage conditions in aqueous buffer (4°C in dark), therefore being promising fluorescence contrast agents for in vivo imaging. However, while ICG-lipidots® display a relatively short plasma lifetime, LipImage™ 815 circulates in blood for longer times, allowing the efficient uptake of fluorescence signal in human prostate cancer cells implanted in mice. Prolonged tumor labeling is observed for more than 21 days.
