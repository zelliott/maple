To study the biochemistry of lanthanides, the cooperative action of inorganic and organic anti-tumor drugs.

A series of rare earth complexes were synthesized with Ln(NO3) 6H2O, Phen and 5-Fu. Their anti-tumor activity was measured by the improved MTT, SRB methods.

The formula of complex Ln[(Phen)2(5-Fu)3(NO3)](NO3)2(Ln = Y, La, Ce, Sm, Gd, Dy, Er; Phen = 1, 10-phenanthroline; 5-Fu = fluorouracil) was characterized by elemental analyses, molar conductivity, IR, TGA, and 13C NMR spectra. The preliminary biological activity studies indicated that Lanthanide complex has strong anti-tumor activity in vitro.

The complex might have anti-tumor cooperation action.
