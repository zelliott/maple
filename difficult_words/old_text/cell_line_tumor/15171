The hydrophobicity of some photosensitizers can induce aggregation in biological systems, which consequently reduces photodynamic activity. The conjugation of photosensitizers with nanocarrier systems can potentially be used to overcome this problem. The objective of this study was to prepare and characterise hypericin-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (Hy-SLN) for use in photodynamic therapy (PDT). SLN were prepared using the ultrasonication technique, and their physicochemical properties were characterised. The mean particle size was found to be 153 nm, with a low polydispersity index of 0.28. One of the major advantages of the SLN formulation is its high entrapment efficiency (EE%). Hy-SLN showed greater than 80% EE and a drug loading capacity of 5.22% (w/w). To determine the photodynamic efficiency of Hy before and after encapsulation in SLN, the rate constants for the photodecomposition of two (1)O2 trapping reagents, DPBF and AU, were determined. These rate constants exhibited an increase of 60% and 50% for each method, respectively, which is most likely due to an increase in the lifetime of the triplet state caused by the increase in solubility. Hy-SLN presented a 30% increase in cell uptake and a correlated improvement of 26% in cytotoxicity. Thus, all these advantages suggest that Hy-loaded SLN has potential for use in PDT.
