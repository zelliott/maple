Luteolin, 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone, has been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammation and anti-cancer properties. However, its role in lung cancer remains poorly understood. Here we examined the anti-tumorigenic role of luteolin in a commonly used lung cancer cell line. Luteolin inhibited the growth of A549 cells by inducing G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, stress fiber assembly and cell migration in A549 cells was markedly suppressed by luteolin.
