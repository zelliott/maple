The mechanisms by which secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2) exerts cellular effects are not fully understood. To elucidate these mechanisms, we systematically and quantitatively assessed the activities of human group IIA, V, and X PLA2s on originating and neighboring cells using orthogonal fluorogenic substrates in various mixed cell systems. When HEK293 cells stably expressing each of these PLA2s were mixed with non-transfected HEK293 cells, group V and X PLA2s showed strong transcellular lipolytic activity, whereas group IIA PLA2 exhibited much lower transcellular activity. The transcellular activity of group V PLA2 was highly dependent on the presence of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans of acceptor cells. Activation of RBL-2H3 and DLD-1 cells that express endogenous group V PLA2 led to the secretion of group V PLA2 and its transcellular action on neighboring human neutrophils and eosinophils, respectively. Similarly, activation of human bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, caused large increases in arachidonic acid and leukotriene C4 release from neighboring human eosinophils. Collectively, these studies show that group V and X PLA2s can act transcellularly on mammalian cells and suggest that group V PLA2 released from neighboring cells may function in triggering the activation of inflammatory cells under physiological conditions.
