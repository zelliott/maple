A disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMs) comprise a multifunctional family of membrane-anchored proteins. ADAM 9 and ADAM 15 are involved in cell migration and invasion. Expression of ADAM 9 and ADAM 15 was reported to be altered in several types of cancer.

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to measure the expression of ADAM 9 mRNA in bulk pancreatic tissues. Results showed no significant difference in the expression of ADAM 9 mRNA between pancreatic cancer and non-neoplastic pancreas. Primary cultured pancreatic fibroblasts also expressed ADAM 9 mRNA. Therefore, a laser microdissection and pressure catapulting technique was employed to isolate cancer cells from tumor tissues. The expression of ADAM 9 and ADAM 15 mRNA was measured in microdissected samples (cancer cells, n = 11; normal epithelial cells, n = 13 for ADAM 9; cancer cells, n = 9; normal epithelial cells, n = 9 for ADAM 15).

Pancreatic cancer cells expressed significantly higher levels of ADAM 9 and ADAM 15 mRNA than did normal pancreatic epithelial cells (p = 0.016 for ADAM 9; p = 0.004 for ADAM 15).

ADAM 9 and ADAM 15 are involved in pancreatic cancer. Microdissection-based analysis appears to be indispensable for the accurate analysis of the expression of certain ADAM family members in pancreatic cancer.
