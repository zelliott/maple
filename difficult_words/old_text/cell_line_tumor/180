The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize a human antibody in a single-chain antibody fragment format (scFv) that is directed specifically against claudin-3 (CLDN3).

The synthetic ETH-2 Gold human antibody phage display library was used to select scFv specific against CLDN3. scFv binding properties were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance; specificity was confirmed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry on a panel of ovarian and uterine serous carcinoma cell lines.

Surface plasmon resonance studies indicated scFv H6 to be the clone with the highest affinity against CLDN3 (K(D) of 23.60 nmol/L). scFv H6 efficiently stained CLDN3-expressing cells and recognized its epitope in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that was performed with uterine serous papillary carcinoma native protein extract, which suggested that a conformational epitope is recognized by this antibody. Cell surface immunofluorescence with laser scanning confocal microscopy confirmed the specific binding to the native membrane CLDN3.

scFv H6 may represent a novel antitumor agent against chemotherapy-resistant ovarian and serous papillary carcinomas and other human malignancies that overexpress CLDN3.
