Intravenous administration of indocyanine green (ICG) dye can effectively convert near-infrared (NIR) laser light into heat and enhance thermal injury of blood vessels; however, there is no selective uptake of ICG by the tumour compared to the other tissues, which impacts the therapeutic ratio of this strategy unless uptake can be selectively increased in tumour tissue. Here we investigated the use of local hyperthermia prior to intravenous ICG administration to enhance ICG uptake in tumour tissue, thereby enhancing laser thermal ablation of solid tumours.

Murine SCK breast or SCCVII head and neck tumours were treated with a 755-nm laser light either alone or with prior intravenous administration of 4 mg/kg ICG and/or local tumour hyperthermia at 42.5 °C for 60 min. Retention of ICG was quantified using a NIR animal imaging system. Treatment effects were assessed by growth delay and histology.

ICG accumulation in the heated tumours was 1.23-fold greater on average compared to non-heated tumours, in both models. In SCK tumours, animals receiving either laser irradiation alone or in conjunction with ICG had a 1.86- or 3.91-fold increase in tumour growth delay, respectively. The addition of local hyperthermia before ICG injection resulted in complete regression of SCK tumours. Uptake of ICG increased in SCCVII tumours; however, little change in tumour growth delay was observed.

Using local hyperthermia may improve the delivery of ICG to the tumour and thereby increase the extent of laser thermal ablation of smaller superficial malignancies that can be effectively exposed to laser therapy.
