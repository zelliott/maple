In this study, EDDA (ethylenediamine- N, N'-diacetic acid) was used as the coligand for 99mTc-labeling of cyclic RGDfK conjugates: HYNIC-dimer (HYNIC = 6-hydrazinonicotinamide; dimer = E[c(RGDfK)]2) and HYNIC-tetramer (tetramer = E{E[c(RGDfK)]2}2). First, HYNIC-dimer was allowed to react with 99mTcO4 (-) in the presence of excess tricine and stannous chloride to form the intermediate complex [99mTc(HYNIC-dimer)(tricine)2], which was then allowed to react with EDDA to afford [99mTc(HYNIC-dimer)(EDDA)] with high yield (>90%) and high specific activity ( approximately 8.0 Ci/micromol). Under the same radiolabeling conditions, the yield for [99mTc(HYNIC-tetramer)(EDDA)] was always <65%. The results from a mixed-ligand experiment show that there is only one EDDA bonding to the 99mTc-HYNIC core in [99mTc(HYNIC-dimer)(EDDA)]. The athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous U87MG human glioma xenografts were used to evaluate the impact of EDDA coligand on the biodistribution characteristics and excretion kinetics of the 99mTc-labeled HYNIC-dimer and HYNIC-tetramer. Surprisingly, [99mTc(HYNIC-dimer)(EDDA)] and [99mTc(HYNIC-tetramer)(EDDA)] had almost identical tumor uptake over the 2 h period. The use of EDDA as coligand to replace tricine/TPPTS (TPPTS = trisodium triphenylphosphine-3,3',3''-trisulfonate) did not significantly change the uptake of the 99mTc-labeled HYNIC-dimer in noncancerous organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and lungs; but it did result in a significantly lower kidney uptake for the 99mTc-labeled HYNIC-tetramer due to faster renal excretion. It was also found that the radiotracer tumor uptake decreases in a linear fashion as the tumor size increases. The smaller the tumors are, the higher the tumor uptake is regardless of the identity of radiotracer.
