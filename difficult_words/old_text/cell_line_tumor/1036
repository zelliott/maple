To study the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in cultured human glomerular endothelial cells (HUGECs) stimulated by high concentration of glucose.

The effect of high concentration of glucose on the expression of MCP-1mRNA by HUGECs was detected by in situ hybridization and cell ELISA. The monocyte migration induced by the conditioned media of cultured HUGECs was assayed by a modified Boyden Chamber micropore filtration membrane method. Effects of anti-MCP-1 antibody on monocyte migration was detected as well.

The MCP-1 mRNA was only weakly expressed in HUGECs cultured under the condition of low concentration of glucose. Following a stimulation of high concentration of glucose (25 mmol/L), MCP-1 mRNA expression was upregulated from the 8th hour and reached the maximum at the 16th hour. Conditioned medium of cultured HUGECs stimulated with high concentration of glucose had marked chemotaxis for monocytes, which was inhibited by anti-MCP-1 antibody.

HUGEC stimulated by high glucose may highly express MCP-1, and produce chemotatic factors for monocytes.
