To analyze the gene expression profiles in colorectal cancer cell lines including high metastatic LoVo and SW620 cell lines and low metastatic SW480 and LS174T cells lines using cDNA microarray for tumor metastasis-associated gene and to screen specific colorectal cancer metastasis-associated genes.

The cDNAs reversely transcribed from the mRNA derived respectively from the 4 cell lines and normal colorectal tissues were labeled with cy3 and cy5 prior to hybridization with the microarray containing 399 genes. The acquired image was analyzed by software.

There were significant differences in gene expression profiles between high- and low- metastatic cell lines, and 44 up-regulated genes and 60 down-regulated genes were found to have statistical significance.

The complex alterations in gene expression underlie the development of metastasis of colorectal cancer. The genes that are expressed differentially in high- and low- metastatic cell lines are probably related to the high metastatic potentials.
