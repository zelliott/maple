We used a combination of spectral karyotyping, array comparative genomic hybridization, and cDNA microarrays to gain insights into the structural and functional changes of the genome in the MCF10 human breast cancer progression model cell lines. Spectral karyotyping data showed several chromosomal aberrations and array comparative genomic hybridization analysis identified numerous genomic gains and losses that might be involved in the progression toward cancer. Analysis of the expression levels of genes located within these genomic regions revealed a lack of correlation between chromosomal gains and losses and corresponding up-regulation or down-regulation for the majority of the approximately 1,000 genes analyzed in this study. We conclude that other mechanisms of gene regulation that are not directly related to chromosomal gains and losses play a major role in breast cancer progression.
