Immobilizing chemically synthesized analogues of PI(3,4,5)P3 onto Affi-10 beads and incorporating them into liposomes allowed their use as affinity absorbents in the comprehensive analysis of the phosphoinositide interactome using cytosolic cell extracts of the LIM1215 colon cancer cell line. This led to the identification of 282 proteins that either interact with PI(3,4,5)P3 or are indirectly captured as part of a complex containing a PI(3,4,5)P3 binding partner. Identification of the proteins was achieved using affinity/LC-MS/MS experiments.
