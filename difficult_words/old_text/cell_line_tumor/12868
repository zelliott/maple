Oncogenic BRAF is a critical driver of proliferation and survival and is thus a validated therapeutic target in cancer. We have developed a potent inhibitor, termed 1t (CCT239065), of the mutant protein kinase, (V600E)BRAF. 1t inhibits signaling downstream of (V600E)BRAF in cancer cells, blocking DNA synthesis, and inhibiting proliferation. Importantly, we show that 1t is considerably more selective for mutated BRAF cancer cell lines compared with wild-type BRAF lines. The inhibitor is well tolerated in mice and exhibits excellent oral bioavailability (F = 71%). Suppression of (V600E)BRAF-mediated signaling in human tumor xenografts was observed following oral administration of a single dose of 1t. As expected, the growth rate in vivo of a wild-type BRAF human tumor xenograft model is unaffected by inhibitor 1t. In contrast, 1t elicits significant therapeutic responses in mutant BRAF-driven human melanoma xenografts.
