To study the chemical components and antitumor activities of essential oil from the fruits of Dasymaschalon trichophorum.

The essential oil from the fruits of Dasymaschalon trichophorum was extracted by steam-stilling and analyzed by GC-MS. The inhibitory effect of extract of Dasymaschalon trichophorum on SPCA-1,BEL-7402, SGC-7901 and K-562 cell proliferation was assayed using the MTU.

GC-MS result showed that there were 55 peaks and 30 compounds were identified which weighed 74.98%. The major components were nerolidol (19.887%), caryophyllene (16.714%) and beta-myrcene (9.29%). The essential oil exhibited strong antitumor activity against SPCA-1 human tumor cell line with IC50 value of 6.61 microg/mL.

This experiment provides scientific foundation for further utilization of Dasymaschalon trichophorum.
