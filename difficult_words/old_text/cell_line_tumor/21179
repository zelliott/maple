We recently established human chorionic gonadotropin-, adrenocorticotropic hormone- and parathyroid hormone-related protein-secreting cell line derived from primary poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach. The cell line was designated as IGSK-3. Inverted-phase contrast microscopy revealed that the IGSK-3 cells consist of two morphological subtypes. One type has visible nucleoli and clear nuclei, but nucleoli and nuclear membrane of the other type are invisible. The population-doubling time was about 43 h. An analysis of conditioned medium by IGSK-3 cells cultured for 4 days revealed the IGSK-3 cells secrete human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (0.5 ng/mL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (5.5 pg/mL), parathyroid hormone-related protein (3.4 pmol/mL) and epidermal growth factor (14.2 pg/mL). Histopathological diagnosis of the graft of IGSK-3 cells revealed that IGSK-3 cells built a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which resembled the original tumor. In addition, the IGSK-3 cell line was immunocytochemically positive for human chorionic gonadotropin-beta and epidermal growth factor receptor, and negative for vascular endothelial growth factor.
