Phosphoethanolamine (Pho-s) is a compound involved in phospholipid turnover, acting as a substrate for many phospholipids of the cell membranes. In a recent study, we showed that Pho-s has antitumor effect in the several tumor cells. In this study we evaluated the antitumor activity of synthetic Pho-s on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Here we demonstrate that Pho-s is cytotoxic to MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, while it is cytotoxic to MCF10 only at higher concentrations. In addition, Pho-s induces a disruption in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). Furthermore, Pho-s induces mitochondria aggregates in the cytoplasm and DNA fragmentation of MCF-7 cells visualized by confocal microscopy. In agreement with the reduction on Δψm, we showed that Pho-s induces apoptosis followed by an increase in cytochrome c expression and capase-3-like activity in MCF-7 cells. Our results demonstrate that Pho-s induces a cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase through an inhibition of cyclin D1 and stimulates p53. An additional highlight of this study is the finding that Pho-s inhibits Bcl-2, inducing apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Taken together, these results show that Pho-s is a promising compound in the fight against cancer.
