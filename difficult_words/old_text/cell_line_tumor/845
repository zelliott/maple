Estrogen regulates the function, growth, and proliferation of lactotropes in the pituitary. We report here that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) gene expression and LDL uptake are strongly up-regulated by estrogen in pituitary somatolactotropic GH(3) cells. The uptake of LDL was significantly inhibited by the F-actin-severing drug, swinholide A, indicating that LDL uptake is dependent on the integrity of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in GH(3) cells. We examined whether the estrogen-inducible cytoskeletal linker protein, ezrin, interacts with the LDLR. The LDLR coimmunoprecipitated with ezrin, and fluorescently labeled LDL bound to regions of the cell membrane that colocalized with the active, phosphorylated form of ezrin (phosphoezrin). Evidence for a functional interaction between ezrin and the LDLR was obtained by transient transfection experiments using ezrin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression constructs. We observed that transient transfection of GH(3) cells with an ezrin N terminus-GFP dominant-negative construct prevented the uptake of LDL particles, whereas expression of GFP alone or an ezrin C terminus-GFP construct had no effect on LDL uptake. Transfection with the ezrin N terminus dominant- negative construct had no effect on the endocytosis of transferrin. Thus, estrogen stimulates the expression of ezrin and the LDLR in GH(3) cells, which interact physically and functionally to facilitate the endocytosis of LDL. We propose that the up-regulation and interaction of ezrin and the LDLR serves to augment the delivery of cholesterol and other lipids in support of the hypertrophic and proliferative response of cells to estrogen.
