To identify candidate genes involved in human colorectal carcinogenesis, we constructed the gene expression profiles of 50 colorectal cancers (CRCs) and 12 normal colorectal epithelia using a cDNA microarray specially constructed for CRC. Hierarchical clustering analysis and principal component analysis could clearly distinguish the gene profiles of cancer tissues from those of normal tissues. Our results confirm there are indeed differences in gene expression between cancer and normal mucosa. Our cDNA microarray identified 22 up-regulated genes and 32 down-regulated genes in CRC. Many of these genes have been previously identified in relation to human carcinogenesis, 68% and 78%, respectively. Subsequent validation of selected genes by serial analysis of gene expression and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, demonstrated expression patterns that were almost identical to our microarray analysis. Using a four-fold larger sample relative to that used in our previous study, candidate genes involved in human colorectal carcinogenesis were reproducibly identified. Further studies of comprehensive gene expression using our technique may elucidate the mechanism of CRC tumorigenesis.
