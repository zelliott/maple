Gliomas are common malignant tumors of the human neural system, and Wnt signaling activation is closely related to glioma malignancy. Human Pygopus 2 (Pygo2) was recently discovered to be a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is required for Î²-catenin/Tcf-dependent transcription. However, the role of Pygo2 in glioblastoma cell growth and survival remains uncertain. In the present study, Pygo2 expression was evaluated in 80 glioma tissue samples. Results demonstrated that tumor grade exhibited a positive correlation with overexpression of Pygo2. In addition, small hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to specifically knockdown Pygo2 expression in human glioblastoma U251 cell lines. Results showed that inhibition of Pygo2 expression resulted in inhibited cell proliferation and invasiveness, as well as increased cell cycle arrest at the G(1) stage and decreased expression of the Wnt target gene cyclin D1. These results demonstrated that Pygo2 was highly expressed in glioma tissue and required for growth of glioblastoma cells.
