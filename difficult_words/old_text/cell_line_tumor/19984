MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that mainly function as negative regulators of gene expression (Lai, 2002) and have been shown to be involved in schizophrenia etiology through genetic and expression studies (Burmistrova et al., 2007; Hansen et al., 2007a; Perkins et al., 2007; Beveridge et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010). In a mega analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorders (BP), a polymorphism (rs1625579) located in the primary transcript of a miRNA gene, hsa-miR-137, was reported to be strongly associated with SZ. Four SZ loci (CACNA1C, TCF4, CSMD1, C10orf26) achieving genome-wide significance in the same study were predicted and later experimentally validated (Kwon et al., 2011) as hsa-miR-137 targets. Here, using in silico, cellular and luciferase based approaches we also provide evidence that another well replicated candidate schizophrenia gene, ZNF804A, is also target for hsa-miR-137.
