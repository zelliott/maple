Compare the sensitivity of human cells in vitro to low dose-rate irradiation in air and in moderate hypoxia (4% O2).

Continuous low dose-rate beta-irradiation at a dose rate of 0.015 or 0.062 Gy/h was given to human T-47D breast cancer cells by incorporation of [3H] -labelled valine into cellular protein. Acute irradiation at a dose rate of 0.4 Gy/min was performed using [137Cs]gamma-irradiation. Cells were cultivated in an atmosphere with 4% O2 using an INVIVO2 hypoxia cabinet.

When grown in ambient air with continuous irradiation, T-47D cells were able to continue growth for at least 23 weeks at a dose-rate of 0.015 Gy/h with a surviving fraction stabilized at around 60%. When the dose rate was increased to 0.062 Gy/h the cell culture died out after about 23 days (corresponding to about 22 Gy). When grown in an atmosphere with 4% O2 we surprisingly found that the continuously irradiated T-47D cells (0.015 Gy/h) were severely inhibited in their growth, and cell death became extensive after about 3 weeks while un-irradiated cells continued growth seemingly unaffected by this low oxygenation. Peri cellular oxygenation varied between 4% and below 0.1% over an ordinary passage due to diffusion-limitations through the 2 mm deep medium. Online O2-recordings over a whole passage showed that oxygen was more depleted in the irradiated compared to the un-irradiated cultures indicating increased respiration during irradiation. While cells growing attached to the bottom were inhibited and inactivated during irradiation it was found that cells attached high up in the neck region, i.e., having only a shallow layer of medium above them, survived and formed colonies. When cells cultivated in 4% O2 for 7 weeks were irradiated with acute doses of 137Cs gamma-rays, the radiosensitivity was the same as for cells cultivated in ambient air.

Continuous irradiation with 0.015 Gy/h for several weeks results in a stronger inhibition for T-47D cells grown in an atmosphere with 4% as compared to 20% O2. The data indicate that this may be due to increased oxygen consumption resulting in more severe hypoxia in [3H]-incorporating compared to control (un-irradiated) cells.
