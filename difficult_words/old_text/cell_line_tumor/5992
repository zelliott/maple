Growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) antagonists have been developed for the treatment of various cancers. We investigated the effects of a novel GHRH antagonist, MIA-602, on nine breast cancer cell lines, differing in their expression for estrogen-, progesterone- and HER-2 receptors. We detected the presence of pituitary-type GHRH receptors (pGHRH-R) on 6 of the 9 breast cancer cell lines. The main splice variant of pGHRH-R, SV1, was found on all 9 cell lines. MTT assay showed that following treatment with MIA-602, cell viability decreased significantly in all 9 cell lines. The reduction in cell viability was greater in cells positive for both pGHRH-R and SV1, than in cells positive for only SV1, but the difference was not significant. Using Western blotting, we demonstrated that the levels of phospho-Akt, -GSK3β and -ERK1/2 decreased significantly following exposure to MIA-602 and the level of phospho-p38 increased after treatment. The reduction of the phosphorylated anti-apoptotic proteins was significantly greater in cells where both pGHRH-R and SV1 were present, than where only SV1 was expressed. In conclusion, our study shows that MIA-602 is effective against a wide range of breast cancer cells in vitro, independently of their receptor positivity, suggesting the potential use of GHRH antagonists also in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. The effect of MIA-602 was mediated nearly as well in tumors that expressed only the SV1 receptor compared to those in which both SV1 and pGHRH-R were present, although a difference could be detected at the level of cell signaling.
