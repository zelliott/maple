Lidamycin (LDM) is a new member of enediyne antitumor antibiotics family that can be separated and reconstituted. It consists of a labile active enediyne chromophore (AE) and a noncovalently bound apoprotein (LDP). LDM is now in phase II clinical trials. In this study, we described the antitumor features of a fusion protein of LDM, anti-CD20Fab-LDM, targeted to CD20 expressed by B-lymphoid malignancies. Especially, LDM was prepared by a novel two-step method including DNA recombination and molecular reconstitution. Anti-CD20Fab-LDM exerted potent cytotoxicity against CD20+ B-cell lymphoma cell lines in vitro (IC50: 10-30 pM) and in the Raji xenograft model. Two Raji xenografts were allowed to grow to an initial mass of 80 and 500 mm³, respectively, and then anti-CD20Fab-LDM was administered intravenously with the highest dose of 4 nmol kg⁻¹ . The inhibition rates of tumor growth were 90.1 and 85%, which were saliently superior to those of nontargeted LDM. It is noteworthy that anti-CD20Fab-LDM can inhibit the growth of patient-derived cells, including rituximab-resistant patient-derived cells. Thus, CD20-targeted delivery of LDM is a specific and potent therapeutic strategy for B-lymphoid malignancies. In addition, the two-step approach could serve as a new technology platform for making a series of highly potent engineered antibody-based drugs.
