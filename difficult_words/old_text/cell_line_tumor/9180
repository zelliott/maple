To examine the effect of Aurora A on the biological phenotypes of prostate cancer cells and the role of Aurora A in the carcinogenesis of prostate cancer.

Full length Aurora A gene was cloned and transfected into the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP to construct a positive cell clone with high expression of Aurora A. The growth and proliferation of the cells was detected by MTT. The mobility of the cells was examined by transwell cell layer infiltration assay. The growth and motility of LNCaP-Aurora A cells were compared with those of the LNCaP-pcDNA3. 1/LNCaP cells.

Compared to the LNCaP-pcDNA3. 1/ LNCaP cells, the cells with high expression of Aurora A had faster proliferation and stronger invasive ability. Three days after cultivation, more LNCaP-Aurora A cells had grown than the LNCaP-pcDNA3. 1/LNCaP cells (P < 0.05).

The increased expression of Aurora A is closely associated with the malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer. Aurora A may play a very important role in the carcinogenesis of prostate cancer.
