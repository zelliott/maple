Glioma is one of the most malignant tumors in the central nervous system. As a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) activator, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs) induce growth arrest and cell death in a broad spectrum of tumor cells. In this study, we investigated the role of rosiglitazone in glioma cells. We found that rosiglitazone, a member of TZDs, suppresses growth of human glioma cell lines U87 and U251. Rosiglitazone also induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which may be the mechanism of its anti-proliferation effect. Next, we found that rosiglitazone suppresses the expression of TGF-beta and its receptor TGF-betaR2, and suppresses phosphorylation of Smad3. Rosiglitazone also inhibits formation of the Smad3/Smad4 complex. Furthermore, Rosiglitazone affects the expression of Smad3/Smad4 associated regulators of gene expression, including p21 and c-Myc. These results suggest that rosiglitazone suppresses growth and cell cycle of human glioma cells by blocking the TGF-beta mediated pathway.
