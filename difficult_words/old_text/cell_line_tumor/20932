Various 4-(anilino)pyrrole-2-carboxamides were designed and synthesized as novel androgen receptor (AR) antagonists without steroidal or anilide structure, based on our strategy for developing full antagonists of nuclear receptors. Introduction of a bulky N-alkyl group, such as a cyclohexylmethyl or benzyl group, increased the binding affinity for wild-type AR and the potency for growth inhibition of androgen-dependent SC-3 cells. Among the compounds obtained, N-[4-[(benzyl)(4-nitrophenyl)amino]-1-methylpyrrole-2-carbonyl]pyrrolidine (22) is as potent an AR antagonist as the typical anilide-type AR antagonists hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide. Further, compound 22 had potent binding affinity for T877A mutated AR, and dose-dependently inhibited the testosterone-induced production of prostate-specific antigen in LNCaP cells bearing T877A AR.
