We examined the effects of suppressing multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) gene expression in a human glioma cell line U87MG. Hammerhead ribozymes, designed to cleave MRP1 mRNA (alphaMRP1-Rz), were transfected into the U87MG cells. The U87MG/alphaMRP1-Rz cells were significantly sensitive to nitrosourea (ACNU) and doxorubicin (DOX) compared with the U87MG cells ( p<0.01 and  p<0.05, respectively, unpaired t-test). There was no significant difference in the expression of other human genes between the U87MG/alphaMRP1-Rz and controls by cDNA array. The hammerhead ribozyme-mediated specific suppression of MRP1 was sufficient to reverse the resistance of ACNU and DOX in the human glioma cell line.
