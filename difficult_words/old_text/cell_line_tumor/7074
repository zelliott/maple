The role of Daxx, in particular its ability to promote or hinder proliferation, still remains controversial. In order to elucidate the functional relevance of Daxx in malignant myelocytes, the erythroleukemia cell line HEL was stably transfected with a Daxx-expressing vector or with the respective Daxx-negative control vector. Assessing the molecular consequences of ectopic Daxx-expression, we present evidence that Daxx downregulates p53. Moreover, we demonstrate that Daxx overexpressing myelocytes downregulate the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax, while expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 is not influenced. Furthermore, expression of Daxx diminishes expression levels of the initiator-procaspase-8 and -10, and the executioner procaspase-7, whereas the procaspase-3, -6 and -9 remain unaltered. The altered protein levels of the caspases in Daxx overexpressing myelocytes are accompanied by a decrease of expression levels of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) cIAP-1, -2 and survivin. Despite the described impact of Daxx expression on major molecules of the apoptotic cascade, expression of Daxx in neoplastic myelocytes does not impact on the rate of proliferation. Upon a proapoptotic stimulus such as serum withdrawal Daxx is unable to maintain its influence on expression levels of p53, Bax, IAPs and the procaspase-8, -10 and -7.
