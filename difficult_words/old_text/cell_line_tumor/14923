Vitexin, identified as apigenin-8-C-D-glucopyranoside, a natural flavonoid compound found in certain herbs such as hawthorn herb, has been reported to exhibit anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-metastatic and antitumor properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible existence of p53-dependent pathway underlying vitexin-induced metastasis and apoptosis in human oral cancer cells, OC2 cells. Vitexin decreased cell viability significantly. Meanwhile, the expression of tumor suppressor p53 and a small group of its downstream genes, p21(WAF1) and Bax, were upregulated. The p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α (PFT-α) knockdown of the signaling of p53 led vitexin to lose its antitumor effect and inhibited the expression of p53 downstream genes, p2(WAF1) and Bax. Vitexin had anti-metastatic potential accompanied with increasing plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) accumulation and decreasing matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression. Our present study evidenced, by using p53 inhibitor PFT-α, PAI-1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ are downstream genes of p53 in vitexin-induced signaling. MAPK inhibitor PD98059 decreased the OC2 cells viability significantly. The expression of p53 and its downstream genes p21(WAF1) and Bax were enhanced by blocking the activation of p42/p44 MAPK in response to treatment with vitexin. Moreover, p42/p44 MAPK played a negative role in p53-dependent metastasis and apoptosis. We give evidence for the first time that the novel p53-dependent metastatic and apoptotic pathway induced by vitexin in human oral cancer OC2 cells.
