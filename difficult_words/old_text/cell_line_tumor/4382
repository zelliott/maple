Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has been used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and many malignant solid tumors. Recently, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays an important role in As2O3-treated laryngeal squamous cell line Hep-2 cells. In the present work, the expression of ER stress-related proteins was investigated in As2O3-treated Hep-2 cells. The results showed that As2O3 increased the expression of GRP78, CHOP, phosphorylated eIF2Î± and ATF4, all of which are the molecule of ER stress. Therefore, As2O3 induced ER stress in Hep-2 cells.
