Anoikis or detachment-induced apoptosis plays an essential role in the regulation of cancer cell metastasis. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a key protein involved in tumor metastasis, but its role in anoikis and its regulation during cell detachment are unclear. We report here that Cav-1 plays a key role as a negative regulator of anoikis through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism in human lung carcinoma H460 cells. During cell detachment, Cav-1 is downregulated, whereas ROS generation is upregulated. Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical are two key ROS produced by cells during detachment. Treatment of the cells with hydrogen peroxide scavengers, catalase and N-acetylcysteine, promoted Cav-1 downregulation and anoikis during cell detachment, indicating that produced hydrogen peroxide plays a primary role in preventing anoikis by stabilizing Cav-1 protein. Catalase and N-acetylcysteine promoted ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Cav-1, which is a major pathway of its downregulation during cell anoikis. Furthermore, addition of hydrogen peroxide exogenously to the cells inhibited Cav-1 downregulation by preventing the formation of Cav-1-ubiquitin complex, supporting the inhibitory role of endogenous hydrogen peroxide in Cav-1 degradation during cell detachment. Together, these results indicate a novel role of hydrogen peroxide as an endogenous suppressor of cell anoikis through its stabilizing effect on Cav-1.
