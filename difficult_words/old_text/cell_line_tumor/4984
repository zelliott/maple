To study the apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG 2 induced by pitavastatin (NK-104) and to investigate the change of caspase-3 activity.

HepG 2 cells were treated with NK-104 for 48 hours and observed under a microscope by using Hoechst 33258 staining. The proliferation of the cells was detected with WST-8 method. The apoptosis peaks were examined by flow cytometry. The caspase-3 activity was detected with caspase-3 colorimetric protease assay.

The treatment of HepG 2 with 10 micromol/L NK-104 could inhibit the proliferation, and induce HepG 2 apoptosis and up-regulate the caspase-3 activity.

NK-104 at 10 micromol/L induces apoptosis of HepG 2 cells. It is dependent on caspase-3 pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
