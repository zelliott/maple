We have developed a measuring system for simultaneous monitoring of chemiluminescence and fluorescence, which indicate respectively, (i) generation of superoxide anion radicals (O2(-â€¢)) and (ii) change in the intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) of neutrophils triggered by the mechanism of innate immune response. We applied this measuring system for establishing a method to distinguish between anti-inflammatory actions and antioxidant actions caused by bioactive compounds. We evaluated anti-inflammatory agents (zinc ion [Zn(2+)] and ibuprofen) and antioxidants (superoxide dismutase [SOD] and ascorbic acid). It was shown that ibuprofen and Zn(2+) were anti-inflammatory while SOD and ascorbic acid were anti-oxidative. We conclude that it is possible to determine the mechanism of action of bioactive compounds using this method.
