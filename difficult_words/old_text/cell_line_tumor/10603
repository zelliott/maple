Malignant gliomas, the most common subtype of primary brain tumors, are characterized by high proliferation, great invasion, and neurological destruction and considered to be the deadliest of human cancers. Analgesic-antitumor peptide (AGAP), one of scorpion toxic polypeptides, has been shown to have antitumor activity. Here, we show that recombinant AGAP (rAGAP) not only inhibits the proliferation of gliomas cell SHG-44 and rat glioma cell C6, but also suppresses the migration of SHG-44 cells during wound healing. To explain these phenomena, we find that rAGAP leads to cell cycle of SHG-44 arrested in G1 phase accompanied by suppressing G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins CDK2, CDK6, and p-RB by means of the down-regulated protein expression of p-AKT. Meanwhile, rAGAP significantly decreases the production of NF-κB, BCL-2, p-p38, p-c-Jun, and p-Erk1/2 and further suppresses the activation of VEGF and MMP-9 in SHG-44 cells. These findings suggest rAGAP inhibit proliferation and migration of SHG-44 cells by arresting cell cycle and interfering p-AKT, NF-κB, BCL-2, and MAPK signaling pathways.
