Differentially expressed genes between normal liver and hepatocellular carcinomas were investigated using differential display. In previous study, human F-LANa was identified as a differentially expressed gene, up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we developed an in silico cloning approach to rapidly and accurately characterize the mouse ortholog of the human F-LANa. Mouse F-LANa encodes a 239 aa protein exhibiting 97.9% similarity to the human ortholog gene. Homology analysis was carried out in various species and showed that F-LANa was evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human. Based on the alignment results, phylogenetic tree was established here.
