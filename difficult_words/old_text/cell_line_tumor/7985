REGgamma (also called PA28gamma or PSME3) is a proteasome activator involved in the degradation of several proteins that regulate cell cycle and transcription. Recently, we demonstrated that this protein has a role also in the maintenance of chromosomal stability and in the response to spindle damaging agents. Here we report for the first time that REGgamma interacts with the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), accumulates in PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), but it does not play any role in normal or arsenic-induced PML degradation. However, REGgamma seems to regulate PML-NBs number, since its deficiency causes an increase in PML-NBs, which can be overcome by increased levels of SUMO1, and its overexpression has the opposite effect. We additionally found that REGgamma interacts with the DNA damage checkpoint kinase Chk2, whose presence is necessary for the increase of PML-NBs induced by REGgamma deficiency, and that REGgamma depletion resulted in a partial restoration of PML-NBs in APL derived cells. Altogether, these results underline a new role for REGgamma in the control and regulation of PML subnuclear structures.
