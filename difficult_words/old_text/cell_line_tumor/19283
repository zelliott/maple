To investigate the combined effect of the major tea polyphenol, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and retinoic acid (RA) on cervical adenocarcinoma.

Cell growth rate was examined after treatment for 4, 7 and 10 days with 0-100 microM EGCG and/or 1 microM RA in two cervical adenocarcinoma cell lines, HeLa and TMCC-1. The effect of EGCG treatment was examined for the induction of apoptosis by DNA ladder assay and caspase-3-related protease activity in cell lysate. Telomerase activity was detected by stretch PCR telomere extension assay. hTERT expression levels were quantified by a real-time PCR system.

Combining EGCG and RA increased the antiproliferative effect in adenocarcinoma cell lines, whereas EGCG or RA treatment alone caused a less sensitive response in these cells. Neither EGCG nor RA treatment alone affected apoptosis and telomerase activity. The combination treatment of EGCG and RA induced apoptosis and inhibited telomerase activity in adenocarcinoma cell lines. These results were consistent with those of an antiproliferative effect of EGCG and/or RA in cervical adenocarcinoma cells.

Our data suggest that EGCG and RA combined to prevent the carcinogenesis of cervical adenocarcinoma, induce apoptosis and inhibit telomerase activity. The treatments of combining EGCG and RA may be effective in preventing or treating cervical adenocarcinoma.
