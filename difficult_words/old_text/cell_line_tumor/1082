To investigate the damages of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) to L-02 and HepG2 cell lines.

Use MTT singe cell gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry was applied to detect the effects of peroxynitrite on cell viability, DNA impairment and cell apoptosis level in two cell lines.

Peroxynitrite had cell toxicity on both cell lines. It caused DNA damages, cell apoptosis and cell cycle change. Furthermore, the damage level was proportional to the concentration of peroxynitrite. The damages were more serious in L-02 in every concentration level than that in HepG2, but no statistic difference between two cell lines.

Peroxynitrite could cause DNA damage, apoptosis and changed cell cycles in both normal and carcinoma cell lines through no statistical significant difference among them was found.
