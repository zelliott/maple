To study the regulation on the biocompatibility of titanium metal surface structure, the interaction between the collagen and the titanium surface structure were studied with titanium surfaces subjected to anodic oxidation and acid-alkali treatment. The cell response on the treated surfaces was studied in vitro experiments of MG63 osteoblasts. The effects of different collagen adsorption ability on the biomineralization were investigated with simulated body fluid (SBF) experiment and osteoblasts culture experiments in a mineralization culture medium. It was found that the collagen adsorption ability was controlled by the wettability. The acid-alkali treated titanium could adsorb much more collagen on its surface. The abilities of cell attachment and proliferation were improved after collagen soaking. The apatite formation ability was inhibited in SBF after collagen adsorption on the surfaces, but improved in cell-involved situation. The ALP and OCN activity of MG63 cells assay showed the collagen on the titanium surface could enhance the bioactivity of the cells, which could accelerate the biomineralization process in cell culture experiments. The result indicated that the different adsorption ability of type I collagen could regulate the biocompatibility of titanium metal surface. It is possible to optimize the biocompatibility of the titanium metals by using suitable surface modification method.
