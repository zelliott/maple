To explore a new method in the gene therapy of human laryngocarcinoma.

The NP, HN and F gene of the Newcastle disease virus were cloned into the pcDNA3 by RT-PCR. The human laryngeal squamous carcinoma model in nude mice had been established by transplantation of the Hep-2 cell line. The nude mice had been grouped two in the third week of the Hep-2 cell line had been transplanted. The admixture of the pcDNA3-NP and the pcDNA3-HN and pcDNA3-F were injected into the tumor in the experimental group, the equal weights pcDNA3 was injected into the tumor in the control group. The microstructural and ultra-micro-structural changes of carcinoma were observed under light and electron microscopes. The chromatosome DNA were extracted from all tissue of the nude mice, the DNA was tested to do template by PCR, whether or not exist the NP gene. The nude mice serums were examined by the method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the antigen of the DNA V4.

There were statistically significant difference in the mice weight, the tumor weight, the tumor volume and the restrained tumor rate between the experimental group and the control group (each P < 0.01). A nude mouse died in the control group, the others were very asthenic. The tumor looked like nodosity and the tumor surface were defeated. The tumor in the experimental group were smaller than that in the control group, the tumors were round shape and hard and not adhered on the skin and deep part constitution. The necrosis and apoptosis of the tumor cell had been found under light and electron microscopes. The NP gene had not been explored in all tumor tissue by PCR in the experimental group. The experimental group was positive in ELISA, The control group was negative.

The NP, HN and F gene could play a role in treating tumor.
