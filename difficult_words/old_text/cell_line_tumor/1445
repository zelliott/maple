Nine known compounds were firstly isolated from the chloroform extract of Polyalthia rumphii stem by anticancer activity guidance, and the chemical structures were identified by using spectroscopic and physico-chemical analysis. Cytotoxic evaluation against four cancer cell lines was performed on all these compounds, which showed that K562 could be significantly inhibited by partial compounds with IC(50) values at the range from 40 to 60 Î¼/mL.
