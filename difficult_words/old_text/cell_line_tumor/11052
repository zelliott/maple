Exogenously added human interferon-beta (HuIFN-beta) protein possesses a remarkable antiproliferative activity in human glioma and melanoma. Endogenous HuIFN-beta protein, which is produced by its gene transfer using cationic liposomes, has much more effective antiproliferative activity against these tumors, even in cells resistant to exogenously added HuIFN-beta protein. As the first step to elucidate the possible difference in antiproliferative mechanisms between exogenous and endogenous HuIFN-beta protein, we here investigated the relationship between the intracellular level of its mRNA and susceptibility to exogenously added HuIFN-beta protein. In this study, we used seven human glioma cell lines (SK-MG-1, SK-MG-4, SK-AO2, U87MG, U251SP, U251MG and T98) and one human melanoma cell line (MMAN). At first, we examined the relationship between spontaneous expression of HuIFN-beta mRNA and susceptibility to exogenously added HuIFN-beta protein (50 IU/ml) in human glioma cells and then confirmed a significant correlation between them. Next, we confirmed that administration of 0-100 IU/ml exogenously added HuIFN-beta protein upregulated the HuIFN-beta mRNA in a dose-dependent manner using the RT-PCR technique and that the HuIFN-beta mRNA was suppressed by siRNA for HuIFN-beta in SK-MG-1 and MMAN cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that the siRNA for HuIFN-beta significantly suppressed the antiproliferative effect of SK-MG-1 cells treated with 10-100 IU/ml HuIFN-beta protein and MMAN cells with 25 and 50 IU/ml HuIFN-beta protein. We found this phenomenon in another human glioma cell line, U87MG cells, as well. This finding would suggest that susceptibility to exogenously added HuIFN-beta protein is related to the amount of intracellular HuIFN-beta mRNA in human glioma and melanoma cells.
