When covalently attaching biomolecules to surfaces such as titanium, trifunctional silanes are commonly used as primers to produce surface amine groups. However, these primed surfaces are rarely uniform in structure due to networking of the silane. Mono-functional aminosilanes may result in more uniform structures, although their long-term stability and effect on osteoblast cell responses are possible issues for orthopedic applications. This study examines for the first time the optimization of peptide coupling to titanium using mono-functional aminosilane reaction chemistry. The resultant surface topography, chemistry, and thicknesses were characterized showing improved surface uniformity compared with trifunctional silanized surfaces. The stability of the coatings was examined over a period of 8 days in environments of varying pH, temperature, and humidity. In addition, human osteosarcoma (HOS) cell adhesion and spreading on the samples was examined; adhesion was minimal on silanized surfaces, but after functionalization with cysteine the cell density was greater than the titanium control and showed no overall detrimental effect on initial cell responses.
