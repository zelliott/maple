A new furopyranone, phellifuropyranone A, was isolated from fruit bodies of wild Phellinus linteus as well as phelligridin G, and their chemical structures were determined by various spectroscopic methods including measurement of NMR spectra. Phellifuropyranone A together with meshimakobnol A and meshimakobnol B showed antiproliferative activity against mouse melanoma cells and human lung cancer cells in vitro.
