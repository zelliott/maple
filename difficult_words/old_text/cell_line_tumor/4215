Methylglyoxal (MG), the potent anticancer agent has been conjugated to a nontoxic, biocompatible polymer, chitosan, to protect it from in vivo enzymatic degradation. This polymeric complex, 'Nano-MG' shows remarkable antitumor property and elicits macrophage-mediated immunity in tumor bearing mice on intravenous (0.4 mg/kg body wt/day) treatment more efficiently than MG (20mg/kg body wt/day). These activated macrophages appear more in numbers in the peritoneum and produce more superoxide and nitrite. Moreover, immunomodulatory cytokines and surface receptors of these macrophages like iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, M-CSF, TLR-4 and TLR-9 also exhibit marked up-regulation in Sarcoma-180 tumor bearing mice after Nano-MG treatment compared to untreated tumor bearing counterpart. Hence, Nano-MG acts as an immunostimulant in tumor bearing mice to combat cancer at conspicuously lower dose, probably due to its longer circulation time in blood.
