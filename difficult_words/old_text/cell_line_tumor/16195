Dying cells release genomic DNA into the surroundings where the DNA is first degraded to oligodeoxynucleotides, then to nucleotides, nucleosides and so on. Given that the unmethylated CpG dinucleotide (CpG motif), which is characteristic of bacterial DNA, is also contained in mammalian DNA and has been reported to be involved in the exacerbation of DNA-associated autoimmune diseases, we investigated whether nucleotides and nucleosides affect immune responses to phosphodiester (PO)-CpG DNA. Addition of non-CpG DNA to RAW264.7, murine macrophage-like cells, induced no significant TNF-α production irrespective of treatment with DNase I; however, DNase I-treated, but not untreated, non-CpG DNA increased the PO-CpG DNA-mediated TNF-α production. This increase was not observed with phosphorothioate-CpG DNA or ligands for TLR3, TLR4 or TLR7. Deoxynucleotides with a 5'-phosphate showed similar effects to those of DNase I-treated non-CpG DNA, but DNase II-treated DNA or deoxynucleosides did not. Subcutaneous injection of PO-CpG DNA into the mouse footpad induced little swelling of the paw; however, significant swelling was observed when DNase I-treated DNA was co-injected with PO-CpG DNA. These results imply that PO-CpG DNA-dependent inflammatory responses are increased by DNA molecules with a 5'-phosphate; such molecules could therefore be considered as exacerbating factors for CpG motif-related inflammation.
