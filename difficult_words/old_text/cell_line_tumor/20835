To explore the bcl-2 and the bax protein expression, the effect and possible mechanism of phytic acid (IP6) on cell proliferation in human gastric carcinoma.

The inhibiting action of IP6 on human gastric carcinoma was examed by MTT assay. The morphological changes of SGC-7901 cells exposed to IP6 was examined by reverse discrepancy microscope. The apoptosis of SGC-7901 cells treated with IP6 was observed by single cell gel electrophoresis. The bax and bcl-2 protein expressions were detected by Western blotting method.

MTT assay indicated that the growth of SGC-7901 cells were inhibited by IP6 in dose and time dependent manners. The morphological observation by reverse discrepancy microscope indicated that the growth of cells exposed to IP6 were not well. The DNA damage rates of SGC-7901 cells treated with IP6 were more higher than those of control groups in dose and time dependent manners. The bcl-2 protein expressions treated with IP6 were reduced, and the bax protein expressions treated with IP6 were more than those of control groups in dose and time dependent manners.

The proliferation of gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells inhibitited by IP6 could be associated with apoptosis of gene bax and bcl-2.
