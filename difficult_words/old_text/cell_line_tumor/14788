Mitochondria vary in their number and function, but how these variations are associated with intestinal cell differentiation remains elusive. The object of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms of inosine-mediated intestinal cell maturation, analysing the effects of this nutrient on metabolic functionality, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function in human colonic cells. The role of oxidative stress in the control of intestinal cell growth was also explored. We report the novel finding that inosine-mediated differentiation improves aerobic metabolism through an increase in mitochondrial bioenergetics and biogenesis in colonic cells, which probably confers them greater resistance to cytotoxic oxidative stress.
