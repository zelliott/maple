This work describes the proteomic characterization of a novel in vitro prostate cancer model system, the clonal prostatic human epithelial cancer (PHEC) cell lines. The model is composed of three cell lines representing the three progressive cancer states found in vivo: non-tumorigenic, tumorigenic, and metastatic. The cell lines were evaluated for differential protein expression between states using two dimensional liquid:liquid chromatographic separation followed by mass spectral identification. The proteins from cellular extracts were first separated using liquid:liquid primary separation based on their isoelectric points and hydrophobicity. The resulting peptide fractions were applied to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) separation for mass determination and protein identification based on Mascot database inquiry. Over 200 proteins that change expression over the course of progression of this in vitro prostate cancer model were discovered during the comparative analysis of the three cell lines. The importance of these proteins on prostate cancer progression remains to be elucidated with further characterizations. The combination of the two dimensional liquid:liquid separation and mass spectral identifications was used to successfully analyze differential protein expression between multiple cell lines.
