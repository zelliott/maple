To establish a uterine cervical carcinoma cell line of Uyghur ethnical background and to evaluate the related biological characteristics for future biomedical investigations of diseases in the Uyghur population.

Poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma specimens of Uyghur patients were obtained and cultured in vitro by enzymatic digestion method, followed by continuous passaging to reach a stable growth determined by cell viability and growth curve. Morphological study, cell cycling and chromosomal analysis were performed. Tumorigenesis study was conducted by inoculation of nude mice. Biomarker (CK17, CD44, Ki-67, CK14 and vimentin) expression was detected by immunofluorescence and immunocytochemical techniques.

A cervical carcinoma cell line was successfully established and maintained for 12 months through 70 passages. The cell line had a stable growth with a population doubling time of 51.9 h. Flask method and double agar-agar assay showed that the cell line had colony-forming rates of 32.5% and 15.6%, respectively. Ultrastructural evaluation demonstrated numerous cell surface protrusions or microvilli, a large number of rod-shape structures in cytoplasm, typical desmosomes and nuclear atypia. Chromosomal analysis revealed human karyotype with the number of chromosomes per cell varying from 32 - 97 with a majority of 54 - 86 (60.3%). Xenogeneic tumors formed in nude mice showed histological structures identical to those of the primary tumor. The cells had high expression of CK17, CD44, Ki-67 and vimentin but no CK14 expression.

A cervical carcinoma cell line from a female Uyghur patient is successfully established. The cell line has the characteristics of human cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and it is stable with maintaining the characteristic biological and morphological features in vitro for more than 12 months, therefore, qualified as a stable cell line for further biomedical research.
