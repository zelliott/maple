P-glycoprotein mediated multidrug resistance presents a major obstacle in the successful therapeutic treatment of solid tumors such as ovarian cancer. Among the more promising techniques used to overcome multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer, is the transcriptional suppression of P-glycoprotein by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). To design more potent antisense ODNs, we explored the concept that double-stranded antisense ODNs may offer advantages in stability and potency over single-stranded in analogy to double-stranded siRNA.

Single-stranded phosphorothioate antisense ODNs against the human mdr1 gene were compared to the duplex of the active antisense and sense sequence of the same length. Concentration dependant effects on P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression and functionality were quantitatively compared in the Pgp overexpressing ovarian cancer cell line A2780/Adr and its parental cell line A2780. Antisense ODNs were (111)Indium- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated for stability, cellular uptake and nuclear localization studies. Duplex formation significantly enhanced transcriptional inhibition of Pgp surface expression and functionality. Cellular uptake and distribution to the nucleus was improved when utilized as double-stranded DNA.

Novel findings from this study suggest that double-stranded antisense ODNs more effectively inhibit target protein expression and consequently enhance chemoresponsiveness through improvements in cellular uptake and distribution to the nucleus.
