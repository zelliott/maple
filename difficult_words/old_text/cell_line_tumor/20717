Curcumin (CM) possesses anti-cancer activity against a variety of tumors. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in remodeling the extracellular matrix and their activities are regulated by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) family. Control of MMP and TIMP activity are now of great significance. In this study, the effect of CM is investigated on metastatic MMPs and anti-metastatic TIMPs genes on MDA breast cancer cells cultured in a mixture of DMEM and Ham's F12 medium and treated with different concentrations of CM (10, 20 and 40 Î¼M for various lengths of time. Reverse transcription followed by quantitative real time PCR was used to detect the gene expression levels of MMPs and TIMPs in CM-treated versus untreated cases and the data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. At high concentrations of curcumin, TIMP-1, -2, -3 and -4 genes were up-regulated after 48 hours of treatment, their over-expression being accompanied by down-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene expression levels in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. These results suggest that curcumin plays a role in regulating cell metastasis by inhibiting MMP-2 and MMP-9 and up-regulating TIMP1 and TIMP4 gene expression in breast cancer cells.
