To study the effect of hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) on apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) expression and AIF translocation from mitochondria to the nucleus in human hepatocellular cancer cell SMMC-7721 during apoptosis.

After treatment with 80 mg/ml of HCPT, the cancer cells were stained with A0/EB to monitor their apoptosis. Their mitochondria was examined with electronmicroscopy and the AIF expression of the cells was tested by RT-PCR and Western blot. The translocation of AIF from mitochondria to the nucleus during apoptosis was analyzed by confocal microscopy.

SMMC-7721 cells treated with HCPT showed chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and mitochondria swelling. The mRNA and protein expression of AIF in treated and untreated SMMC-7721 cells were not significantly different. However, cells treated with 80 mg/ml HCPT for 6 h or 12 h showed massive translocation of AIF into the nuclei.

These results show the important role the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis plays in HCPT-induced tumor cell death, at least in SMMC-7721 cells.
