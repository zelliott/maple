Fluoropyrimidines are useful anticancer agents and the compound 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) plays an important role in chemotherapy of colon cancers. Several nucleoside analogs, such as 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), can be incorporated into and cause depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These drugs are known to cause mitochondrial toxicity after prolonged treatment in patients. In this study we demonstrate that FdUrd reduces the mtDNA content and the expression level of the mtDNA encoded cytochrome c oxidase (COX II) in a CEM T-lymphoblastic cell line.
