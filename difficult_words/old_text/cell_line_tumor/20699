To compare the expression of nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) epithelial cell line BPH-1 versus those in androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cell line LNCap and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC-3.

We isolated NMPs from the BPH-1, LNCap and PC-3 cell lines by 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), analyzed the differentially expressed proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption / ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), and identified them by peptide mass fingerprint and database searching.

We successfully obtained well-resolved reproducible 2-DE patterns of NMPs in human prostate cancer cell lines, identified 12 differentially expressed NMPs including enzymes, regulatory proteins, RNA-binding protein and various other factors, 3 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated in prostate cancer cell lines.

There are obvious differences in the expressions of NMPs between human prostate cancer cell lines and benign prostatic hyperplasia epithelial cell line.
