The limited availability and potential to culture primary human brain cells means that there is still a need for cell lines that reliably model human neurons and glial cells. The human-derived NTera2/D1 (NT2) cell line is a promising tool from which both neuronal (NT2N) and astrocytic (NT2A) cells can be derived in vitro. Here we have investigated the potential to use this cell model to investigate the endocannabinoid system in the CNS. Through immunocytochemical characterization with a range of neuronal and glial markers, we found that these cell lines differentiate into cells with immature neuronal and astrocytic phenotypes, respectively. By real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, and functional inhibition of cAMP accumulation, the cannabinoid 1 receptors were identified only on NT2N cells, consistent with high levels of expression of this receptor in neuronal cells of the CNS. No evidence of cannabinoid 2 receptor expression was found on any of the NT2 cell types. Both the precursors and the differentiated NT2N and NT2A cells demonstrated mRNA expression for the key enzymes involved in endocannabinoid synthesis and degradation. This work establishes a cannabinergic phenotype in NT2N and NT2A cells, providing an alternative human derived renewable cell model for investigation of cannabinoid receptor function and endocannabinoid synthesis and metabolism in the CNS.
