Saccharina japonica (S. japonica), a brown macro-alga, has been used as             a traditional medicine in Korea for thousands of years. In this study, the potential             anticancer effects of S.Â japonica were evaluated on 267B1/K-ras human prostate             cancer cells. The exposure of cells to the extract induced inhibition of cell             growth by increasing the number of apoptotic cells with cell shrinkage and inhibition             of cell cycle progression. The effects of the extract on the cells were assessed             by studying the cleavage of caspases and the target proteins of caspases. The             increased expression of various cleaved caspases and changed expression of other             proteins related in the apoptosis pathway were observed. 4'-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole             (DAPI) and immunofluorescence staining showed the cells undergoing apoptosis.             Apoptosis induced changes in the expression of proteins involved in a variety             of signaling pathways such as endocellular reticulum (ER) stress, death receptor             and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-FoxO-mediated pathways. The data suggest             that the extract (n-hexane sub-fraction) of S. japonica, induces apoptosis and             cell cycle arrest in 267B1/K-ras human prostate cancer cells, and has potential             as a complementary agent for cancer prevention.
