Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) are emerging novel new biomarkers for prognosis, diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of cancer. Kallikrein-related peptidase 6 (KLK6) has the highest expression in normal brain among other tissues. Although its expression has been extensively studied in many types of cancer and in neurodegenerative diseases, very little is known for its expression in intracranial tumors. In the present study, 73 intracranial tumor samples were examined for KLK6 messenger ribunucleic acid (mRNA) gene expression using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analysis revealed the significant association of KLK6 expression with clinical and pathological parameters. Follow-up information was available for a median time of 20 months (range 1-59 months). KLK6 is expressed more frequently in tumors of high malignancy like the glioblastomas (70.6 %) and less in tumors of low malignancy like the meningiomas (12.5 %). KLK6 positive expression is associated with tumor grade (p < 0.001), malignancy status (p < 0.001), and tumor histologic type (p = 0.001). Cox proportional hazard regression model using univariate analysis revealed for the first time that positive KLK6 expression is a significant factor for disease-free survival (DFS; p = 0.041) of patients suffering from intracranial tumors. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that negative KLK6 expression is significantly associated with longer DFS (p = 0.032). KLK6 gene expression may have clinical utility as a marker of unfavorable prognosis for intracranial tumors, and consequently, it could be used as target for therapeutic intervention.
