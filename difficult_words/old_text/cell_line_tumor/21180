Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) profile predicts prognosis of gastric cancer; COX-2 positive tumors are more often aggressive, and COX-2 suppression is protective against gastric cancer. In contrast, COX-1 suppression is harmful to the intestinal mucosa. The COX-1, COX-2, and COX-1ir expression profiles were measured with real-time PCR in primary (AGS) and metastatic (NCI-N87) gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines treated with butyrate, hyperosmolar medium, and, in the case of NCI-N87, cell-free supernatants of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2 and Bifidobacterium lactis 420. The cell lines showed differences in the profile when treated with either hyperosmolar medium or butyrate. In NCI-N87 COX-2 expression was higher but only COX-1 expression was significantly upregulated by butyrate. Similarly to butyrate, the cell-free supernatant of L. acidophilus 74-2 upregulated COX-1, while COX-2 expression remained unchanged. COX-1ir, including COX-3, was upregulated by probiotics and osmotic stress. In conclusion, consumption of L. acidophilus 74-2 could be beneficial for the expression of cytoprotective COX-1.
