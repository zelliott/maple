Gold nanoparticles functionalized with doxorubicin and stabilized with multilayers of degradable polyelectrolyte were allowed to age in aqueous medium in vitro in order to show the possibility of drug release in cellular environment. The chemico-physical characteristics of the nanoparticles are reported. The observed release of doxorubicin (DOX) was pH-dependent, and it increased in acidic environment. Cell uptake of nanoparticles and drug release were monitored by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Data showed that drug-bearing nanoparticles delivered DOX into the nuclei of A549 cells, leading to pronounced cytotoxic effects to this lung tumor cells. Our results suggest that gold nanoparticles conjugated with doxorubicin could be used as a pH-triggered drug releasing carrier for tumor drug delivery.
