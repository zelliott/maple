RBM5 (RNA-binding motif protein 5) is a nuclear RNA binding protein containing 2 RNA recognition motifs. The RBM5 gene is located at the tumor suppressor locus 3p21.3. Deletion of this locus is the most frequent genetic alteration in lung cancer, but is also found in other human cancers. RBM5 is known to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest but the molecular mechanisms of RBM5 function are poorly understood. Here, we show that RBM5 is important for the activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Overexpression of RBM5 enhanced p53-mediated inhibition of cell growth and colony formation. Expression of RBM5 augmented p53 transcriptional activity in reporter gene assays and resulted in increased mRNA and protein levels for endogenous p53 target genes. In contrast, shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous RBM5 led to decreased p53 transcriptional activity and reduced levels of mRNA and protein for endogenous p53 target genes. RBM5 affected protein, but not mRNA, levels of endogenous p53 after DNA damage suggest that RBM5 contributes to p53 activity through post-transcriptional mechanisms. Our results show that RBM5 contributes to p53 transcriptional activity after DNA damage and that growth suppression and apoptosis mediated by RBM5 are linked to activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53.
