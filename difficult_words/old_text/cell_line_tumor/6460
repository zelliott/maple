MicroRNA (miRNA; miR) is a class of small regulatory RNA molecules, the aberrant expression of which can lead to the development of cancer. We recently reported that overexpression of miR-21 and/or miR-155 leads to activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway in malignant lymphomas expressing CD3(-)CD56(+) natural killer (NK) cell antigen. Through expression analysis, we show in this study that in both NK/T-cell lymphoma lines and samples of primary lymphoma, levels of miR-150 expression are significantly lower than in normal NK cells. To examine its role in lymphomagenesis, we transduced miR-150 into NK/T-cell lymphoma cells, which increased the incidence of apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation. Moreover, the miR-150 transductants appeared senescent and showed lower telomerase activity, resulting in shortened telomeric DNA. We also found that miR-150 directly downregulated expression of DKC1 and AKT2, reduced levels of phosphorylated AKT(ser473/4) and increased levels of tumor suppressors such as Bim and p53. Collectively, these results suggest that miR-150 functions as a tumor suppressor, and that its aberrant downregulation induces continuous activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, leading to telomerase activation and immortalization of cancer cells. These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of malignant lymphoma.
