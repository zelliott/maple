A simplified method of synthesis of triterpene l,2-trans-glycosides was developed using the glycosylation of glycyrrhetic acid (GLA) and 18,19-dehydro-GLA by beta-pyranose peracetates in the presence of SnCl(4) and molecular sieves 4 A. The synthesized glycosides exhibited hepatoprotective activity toward the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line on the model of alcohol hepatitis and decreased the level of TNF-alpha protein.
