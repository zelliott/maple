Leishmania (L.) chagasi is the etiological agent of visceral leishmaniasis, an important endemic zoonosis in the American continent, as well as in many other countries in Asia, Africa, and Mediterranean Europe. The treatment is difficult due to the high toxicity of the available drugs, high costs, and emergence of resistance in the parasites. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new leishmanicidal agents. The bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids have been related to antibacterial, antiprotozoal, and antifungal activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the growth inhibitory activity of warifteine (bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid) against L. chagasi promastigotes in axenic cultures and the occurrence of drug-induced ultrastructural changes in the parasite. This bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid was isolated from the leaves and roots of Cissampelos sympodialis Eichl. (Menispermaceae), a plant commonly used for the treatment of various diseases in Brazilian folk medicine. Using the purified warifteine, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) was determined at 0.08 mg/mL after 72 h in culture, inducing significant changes in the parasite morphology, like aberrant multisepted forms and blebs in the plasma membrane. In conclusion, warifteine represents an attractive candidate for future pharmacological studies aiming new leishmanicidal drugs.
