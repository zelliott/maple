There are multiple mechanisms by which cells evade TGF-β-mediated growth inhibitory effects. In this report, we describe a novel mechanism by which cells become resistant to TGF-β-mediated growth suppression. Although having all the components of the TGF-β signaling pathway, different cell lines, RL, HaCaT, and BJAB, have different sensitivities toward TGF-β-induced growth suppression. The TGF-β resistance of RL, a B-cell lymphoma cell line, was due to ligand-induced downregulation of TGF-β receptor II (TβRII) and only transient TGF-β induced nuclear translocation of Smad2 and Smad3. With low-dose phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or anti-IgM treatment, TGF-β sensitivity was restored by stabilizing TβRII expression and sustaining TGF-β signaling. The MEK inhibitor, U0126, blocked both PMA- and anti-IgM-induced upregulation of TβRII. In HaCaT and BJAB, two TGF-β-sensitive cell lines, which had higher basal levels of phospho-MEK and TβRII compared with RL, U0126 induced downregulation of TβRII and blocked subsequent TGF-β signaling. Similar results were also obtained with normal B cells, where MEK1 inhibitor downregulated TβRII and subsequent TGF-β signaling. Constitutively active MEK1, but not constitutively active ERK2, induced upregulation of TβRII. Furthermore, TβRII physically interacted with the constitutively active MEK1, but not with wild-type MEK1, indicating involvement of active MEK1 in stabilizing TβRII. Collectively, our data suggest a novel mechanism for MEK1 in regulating the sensitivity to TGF-β signaling by stabilizing TβRII.
