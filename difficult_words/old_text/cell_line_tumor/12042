The synthesis and the characterization (elemental analysis, (1)H NMR and X-ray) of the first cyclopalladated complexes containing 4-hydroxyacridinate as complementary ligand are described. 4-Hydroxyacridine acts as a bidentate [N,O] chelating ligand, giving rise to square planar Pd(II) complexes in the coordination of a cyclopalladated fragment of phenylpyridine or phenylpyrimidine, characterized by the presence of two almost coplanar metalated rings. The biological activity studies conducted on these new Pd(II) complexes proved that the phenylpyridine Pd(II) derivative is more efficient than cis-platinum. The intrinsically substitutional inertness of the cyclopalladated ring and the presence of the [N,O] chelated acridine ligand make these systems of particular interest in their promising biological activity.
