The exact role profilin plays in cell migration is not clear. In this study, we have evaluated the effect of overexpression of profilin on the migration of breast cancer cells. Overexpression was carried out by stably expressing GFP-profilin in BT474 cells. It was observed that even a moderate level of overexpression of profilin significantly impaired the ability of BT474 cells to spread on fibronectin-coated substrate and migrate in response to EGF. GFP-profilin expressing cells also showed increased resistance to detachment in response to trypsin and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin compared to the parental and GFP-expressing (control) cell lines. These results suggest that perturbation of profilin levels may offer a good strategy for controlling the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells.
