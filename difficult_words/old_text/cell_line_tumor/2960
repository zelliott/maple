A variety of 7-aminoisoquinoline-5,8-quinone derivatives were prepared from 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone, methyl aminocrotonate, and the corresponding amines, through a highly efficient three-step sequence. The members of this series were tested on normal human fibroblasts and on a panel of three human cancer cell lines and their redox properties were determined by cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile. Both the cytotoxicity and antitumor activity of 7-phenylaminoisoquinoline-5,8-quinone derivatives showed correlation with their half wave potentials and lipophilicities.
