Platelets have long been suspected of having a role in cancer progression and metastasis that has largely been attributed to platelet-mediated enhancement of tumor cell survival, extravasation, and angiogenesis. A study in this issue of the JCI suggests that platelet-derived lysophosphatidic acid is coopted by aggressive breast and ovarian cancer cells as a tumor cell mitogen and promoter of osteolysis during bone metastasis.
