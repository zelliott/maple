A new bisuracil analogue, 3,3-bis(uracil-1-yl)-propan-1-aminium (1), together with four known N-containing metabolites (2-5), were isolated from the South China Sea sponge Agelas clathrodes. Their chemical structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic and spectrometric analysis and comparison with known compounds. Compound 1 is an unusual naturally occurring bisuracil analogue, and compound 2 was isolated from a natural source for the first time. Compounds 2 and 4 exhibit moderate cytotoxicity against cancer cell line SGC7901.
