Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia are predominant opportunistic pathogens in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In healthy humans the lower respiratory tract as well as all mucosa, contains a very low free iron concentration (10(-18) M), while in CF patients sputum iron concentration is very high, showing a median value of 63x10(-6) M. Accumulation of catalytic reactive iron heavily contributes to subsequent clinical complications in the lung disorders by the production of reactive oxygen species and increases bacterial growth and virulence. The data reported in this study indicate that low iron concentration (Fe3+ 1 microM)induced free-living forms and motility both in P. aeruginosa and B. cenocepacia, while high iron concentrations (Fe3+ 10 and 100 microM) stimulated aggregation and biofilm formation already in the fluid phases, so demonstrating that aggregation and biofilm formation are positively iron-modulated in these bacteria. Moreover, the different morphological forms (free-living, aggregates and biofilm) showed different capabilities of adhering and invading the bronchial cell line A549. P. aeruginosa PAO1 aggregates, and mostly biofilm, exerted the highest adhesion efficiency, while B. cenocepacia PV1 aggregates or biofilm the lowest. A significant reduction in invasion efficiency by P. aeruginosa biofilm and a significant increase in cell internalization by B. cenocepacia biofilm has been reported. Therefore, the iron availability is an important signal to which P. aeruginosa and B. cenocepacia counteract by leaving the motile free-living forms and entering into a new lifestyle, i.e. biofilm. These data could contribute to explain that the iron-overload of the sputum of CF patients, inducing nonmotile forms, aggregates and biofilm, may facilitate penetration of host epithelial barriers contributing to the establishment of infection, colonization, persistence and systemic spread of these opportunistic pathogens.
