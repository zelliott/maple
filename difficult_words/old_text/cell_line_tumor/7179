Two new lactones (1, 2), descurainolide A and B, and one new aryl-8-oxa-bicyclo[3,2,1]-oct-3-en-2-one (3), descurainin, together with five known compounds (4-8), were isolated from the seeds of Descurainia sophia (L.) WEBB ex PRANTL. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by extensive studies of their 1D, 2D NMR and HR-MS. Compounds 4 and 5 showed cytotoxicity.
