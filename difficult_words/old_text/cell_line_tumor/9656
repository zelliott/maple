Two new cembranoids, flexibilisolide A (1) and flexibilisin A (2), along with one known combranoid 5 have been isolated from the cultured soft coral Sinularia flexibilis. Furthermore, two new cembranoids, flexibilisolide B (3) and flexibilisin B (4), along with two known combranoids (5, 6), have been isolated from the wild-type soft coral S. flexibilis. The structures of the new metabolites were determined on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis and by comparison of NMR data with those of known compounds. The metabolites 5 and 6 have been shown to exhibit weak cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cancer cell line.
