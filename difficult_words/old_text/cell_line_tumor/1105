Flavonoids are well-known phytochemicals that are produced by various plants in high quantities. The chemopreventive activity of flavonoids is dependent on their structural features. The studies of structure-FPTase inhibitory activity indicated that the number, position and substitution of hydroxyl groups of the A and B rings of flavonoid, and unsaturation of the C2-C3 bond are important factors affecting inhibition on FPTase by flavonoids. A couple of flavonoids inhibited FPTase and also the growth of human tumor cell lines, especially butein, which strongly inhibited the growth of colon cancer cell line (HCT116). However, flavanones and flavanols did not inhibit FPTase nor the growth of tumor cells.
