Glioblastoma multiform is one of the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors in adults. High glutamate levels are thought to contribute to glioma growth. While research has focused on understanding glutamate signaling in glioma cells, little is known about the role of glutamate between glioma and astrocyte interactions. To study the relationship between astrocytes and tumor cells, the CNS-1 rodent glioma cell line was used. We hypothesized increased glutamate uptake by astrocytes would negatively affect CNS-1 cell growth. Primary rodent astrocytes and CNS-1 cells were co-cultured for 7 days in a Boyden chamber in the presence of 5 mM glutamate. Cells were treated with propentofylline, an atypical synthetic methylxanthine known to increase glutamate transporter expression in astrocytes. Our results indicate astrocytes can increase glutamate uptake through the GLT-1 transporter, leading to less glutamate available for CNS-1 cells, ultimately resulting in increased CNS-1 cell apoptosis. These data suggest that astrocytes in the tumor microenvironment can be targeted by the drug, propentofylline, affecting tumor cell growth.
