Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by various types of collagens and is known to play a role in cell attachment, migration, survival, and proliferation. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the role of DDR1 in cancer. We report here that DDR1 induces cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) expression resulting in enhanced chemoresistance. Depletion of DDR1-mediated Cox-2 induction using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) results in increased chemosensitivity. We also show that DDR1 activates the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway and blocking this activation by an I kappaB superrepressor mutant results in the ablation of DDR1-induced Cox-2, leading to enhanced chemosensitivity, indicating that DDR1-mediated Cox-2 induction is NF-kappaB dependent. We identify the upstream activating kinases of the NF-kappaB pathway, IKK beta and IKK gamma, as essential for DDR1-mediated NF-kappaB activation, whereas IKK alpha seems to be dispensable. Finally, shRNA-mediated inhibition of DDR1 expression significantly enhanced chemosensitivity to genotoxic drugs in breast cancer cells. Thus, DDR1 signaling provides a novel target for therapeutic intervention with the prosurvival/antiapoptotic machinery of tumor cells.
