The tumor-associated antigen 90K (TAA90K)/Mac-2-binding protein implicated in cancer progression and metastasis is modified by beta1-6 branched N-linked oligosaccharides in colon cancer cells, glycans shown to contribute to cancer metastasis. To elucidate the role of TAA90K in colon cancer, we examined its expression and function in human colon tumors and colon carcinoma cell lines. Immunohistochemical analyses of colon tumors revealed elevated expression of TAA90K in all samples analyzed compared to normal colon. To examine the function of TAA90K in colon cancer, we carried out protein and cell binding assays using TAA90K-His purified from HT-29 cells colon carcinoma cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing TAA90K containing a C-terminal poly-histidine tag. TAA90K-His bound to fibronectin, collagen IV, laminins-1, -5, and -10 and galectin-3 (Mac-2) but poorly to collagen I and galectin-1. As expected, binding of TAA90K to galectin-3 was dependent on carbohydrate since it was inhibitable by lactose and asiolofetuin, and a TAA90K-His glycoform purified from HT-29 cells treated with the glycosylation inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin bound poorly to galectin-3. Unlike TAA90K isolated from other cell types, TAA90K-His isolated from colon cancer cells failed to mediate adhesion of colon cancer and normal cell lines, possibly due to cell-type specific glycosylation of TAA90K-His and/or its putative cellular receptor. However, at low concentrations, TAA90K-His enhanced galectin-3-mediated HT-29 cell adhesion while at high concentrations, it inhibited cell adhesion. Thus, a possible mechanism by which TAA90K may contribute to colon cancer progression is by modulating tumor cell adhesion to extracellular proteins, including galectin-3.
