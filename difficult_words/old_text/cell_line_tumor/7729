Prostate cancer is a known cause of mortality in men worldwide although the risk factor varies among different ethnic groups. Loss of the Y chromosome is a common chromosomal abnormality observed in the human prostate cancer.

We screened 51 standard sequence tagged sites (STSs) corresponding to a male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY), sequenced the coding region of the SRY gene and assessed the status of the DYZ1 arrays in the human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP. The MSY was found to be intact and coding region of SRY showed no sequence variation in both the cell lines. However, DYZ1 arrays showed sequence and copy number variations. DU145 and LNCaP cells were found to carry 742 and 1945 copies of the DYZ1, respectively per 3.3 pg of genomic DNA. The DYZ1 copies detected in these cell lines are much below the average of that reported in normal human males. Similarly, the number of "TTCCA" repeat and its derivatives within the DYZ1 arrays showed variation compared to those of the normal males.

Clearly, the DYZ1 is maximally affected in both the cell lines. Work on additional cell lines and biopsied samples would augment our understanding about the susceptibility of this region. Based on the present work, we construe that copy number status of the DYZ1 may be exploited as a supplementary prognostic tool to monitor the occurrence of prostate cancer using biopsied samples.
