Brain (central nervous system; CNS) metastases pose a life-threatening problem for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer. It has recently been shown that the vasculature within preclinical brain metastasis model markedly restricts paclitaxel delivery in approximately 90% of CNS lesions. Therefore to improve efficacy, we have developed an ultra-small hyaluronic acid (HA) paclitaxel nanoconjugate (âˆ¼5 kDa) that can passively diffuse across the leaky blood-tumor barrier and then be taken up into cancer cells (MDA-MB-231Br) via CD44 receptor-mediated endocytocis. Using CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis as an uptake mechanism, HA-paclitaxel was able to bypass p-glycoprotein-mediated efflux on the surface of the cancer cells. In vitro cytoxicity of the conjugate and free paclitaxel were similar in that they (i) both caused cell-cycle arrest in the G2-M phase, (ii) showed similar degrees of apoptosis induction (cleaved caspase), and (iii) had similar IC50 values when compared with paclitaxel in MTT assay. A preclinical model of brain metastases of breast cancer using intracardiac injections of Luc-2 transfected MDA-MB-231Br cells was used to evaluate in vivo efficacy of the nanoconjugate. The animals administered with HA-paclitaxel nanoconjugate had significantly longer overall survival compared with the control and the paclitaxel-treated group (P < 0.05). This study suggests that the small molecular weight HA-paclitaxel nanoconjugates can improve standard chemotherapeutic drug efficacy in a preclinical model of brain metastases of breast cancer.
