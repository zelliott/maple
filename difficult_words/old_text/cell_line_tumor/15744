The synthesis of a series of pyranoid derivatives comprising a conjugated carbonyl function and related triazole derivatives, structurally suitable for bioactivity evaluation, was achieved in few steps starting from readily available carboxymethyl glycoside lactones (CMGL). 3-Enopyranosid-2-uloses were generated by oxidation/elimination of tri-O-acylated 2-hydroxy pyranosides. Subsequent Wittig olefination provided stereoselectively 2-C-branched-chain conjugated dienepyranosides with (E)-configuration around the exocyclic double bond. A heterogeneous CuI/Amberlyst-catalyzed 'click' chemistry protocol was used to convert glycosides bearing a propargyl moiety into the corresponding 1,2,3-triazoles. These new molecules were screened for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities and those containing conjugated carbonyl systems demonstrated the best efficacy. (N-Dodecylcarbamoyl)methyl enone glycerosides were the most active ones among the enones tested. The α-anomer displayed very strong activities against Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis and strong activity toward Enterococcus faecalis and the fungal pathogen Penicillium aurantiogriseum. The corresponding β-anomer presented a very strong inhibitory effect against two fungal species (Aspergillus niger and P. aurantiogriseum). (N-Dodecyl-/N-propargyl/or N-benzylcarbamoyl)methyl dienepyranosides exhibited selectively a strong activity toward E. faecalis. Further acute toxicity evaluation indicated low toxic effect of the (N-dodecylcarbamoyl)methyl enone glyceroside α-anomer and of the carbamoylmethyl dienepyranosides N-protected with propargyl or benzyl groups.
