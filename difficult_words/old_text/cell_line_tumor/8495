A novel series of 3-methyl-1-benzofuran derivatives were synthesized and screened in vitro for their antiproliferative activity against two human NSCLC cell lines (NSCLC-N6 mutant p53 and A549 wild type p53). Most promising compounds presented a structural analogy with the west part of cercosporamide, a natural product of biological interest. In particular, compounds 10, 12 and 31 showed cytotoxic activities at micromolar concentrations (IC₅₀ < 9.3 μM) and compounds 13, 18 and 32 displayed moderate IC₅₀ values (25-40 μM).
