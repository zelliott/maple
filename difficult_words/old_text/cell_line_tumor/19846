Recent applications of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to studies of single biological cells are reviewed. This scanning probe microscopic technique allows the imaging of an individual cell on the basis of not only its surface topography but also such cellular activities as photosynthesis, respiration, electron transfer, single vesicular exocytosis and membrane transport. The operational principles of SECM are also introduced in the context of these biological applications. Recent progress in techniques for high-resolution SECM imaging are also reviewed. Future directions, such as single-channel detection by SECM, high-resolution imaging with nanometer-sized probes, and combined SECM techniques for multidimensional imaging are also discussed.
