Osteosarcoma is the commonest primary tumour of bone and the second highest cause of cancer-related death in the paediatric age group. Little is known of the aetiology of human osteosarcoma and lesser still of the various interactions that occur between host and tumour cells that govern growth and progression of osteosarcoma in vivo. Although numerous osteosarcoma cell lines have been established and characterized in vitro, some as far back as in the 1960s, there is a scarcity of reliable and reproducible in vivo animal models that mimics all aspects of the human condition at the temporal, physiological and histopathological level, hence, making the accurate testing of therapeutic strategies difficult. Given that osteosarcoma is a disease that affects young people and better disease management strategies are essential, development of a robust human osteosarcoma model is long overdue.
