The H-bonded complex of ATP with Arg 34 of Zn2+ finger I of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) determines trans-oligo-ADP-ribosylation from NAD+ to proteins other than PARP-1. This mechanism was tested in lysolecithin fractions of non-malignant and cancer cells separately and after their recombination. Cellular PARP-1 activity was recovered when the centrifugal sediment was recombined with the supernatant fraction containing cellular ADP-ribose oligomer acceptor proteins. Combination of the matrix fraction (Mx) of cancer cells (lacking OXPHOS) with its supernatant had the same PARP-1 activity as the Mx alone. The supernatant of non-malignant cells was replaced by glycolytic enzymes as ADP-ribose acceptor. The hexokinase activity of the supernatant increased when OXPHOS of intact cells was uncoupled by carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoro methoxy) phenylhydrazone. trans-ADP-ribosylation was demonstrated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
