This study investigated the possibility of incorporating alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) into poly(3hydroxybutyrate) (P(3HB))/Bioglass composites, which are being developed for bone tissue engineering matrices. P(3HB) films with 20 wt% Bioglass and 10 wt% vitamin E were prepared using the solvent casting technique. Addition of vitamin E significantly improved the hydrophilicity of the composites along with increasing the total protein adsorption. The presence of protein adsorbed on the composite surface was further confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Preliminary cell culture studies using MG-63 human osteoblasts showed that the addition of vitamin E in the P(3HB)/20 wt% Bioglass films significantly increased cell proliferation. The results achieved in this study confirmed the possibility of incorporating vitamin E as a suitable additive in P(3HB)/Bioglass composites to engineer the surface of the composites by promoting higher protein adsorption and increasing the hydrophilicity.
