Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) plays an important role in the defense against a number of viruses, including influenza A virus. However, the sensitivity of influenza A virus subtypes/strains to PML is unknown. We investigated the role of PML in the replication of different influenza A virus subtypes/strains using pan-PML knock-down A549 cells and PML-VI-overexpressed MDCK cells. We found that (i) depletion of pan-PML by siRNA rendered A549 cells more susceptible to influenza A virus strains PR8(H1N1) and ST364(H3N2), but not to strains ST1233(H1N1), Qa199(H9N2) and Ph2246(H9N2); (ii) overexpression of PML-VI in MDCK cells conferred potent resistance to PR8(H1N1) infection, while lacked inhibitory activity to ST1233(H1N1), ST364(H3N2), Qa199(H9N2) and Ph2246(H9N2). Our results suggest that the antiviral effect of PML on influenza A viruses is viral subtype/strain specific.
