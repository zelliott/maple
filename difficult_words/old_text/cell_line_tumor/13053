A series of N,N-disubstituted-N'-[1-aryl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]-methnimidamides was synthesized by a newly developed microwave reaction and their antiproliferative activities were evaluated. Microwave irradiation of 5-amino-1,3-disubstituted pyrazoles with various amide solvents in the presence of POCl(3) provided the corresponding 2a-2k, 3a-3c, and 4a-4f in good to excellent yields. The obtained methnimidamides were tested against NCI-H661, NPC-TW01, and Jurkat cancer cell lines and the results indicated that compounds 2d and 2e were the most potent with IC(50) values in low micromolar range.
