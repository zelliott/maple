As the exopeptidase over-expressed in the cell surface of endothelial cells, aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) is an essential target for tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Based on the previous work of L-lysine amide derivatives in our laboratory, we designed and synthesized two series of L-lysine ureido derivatives as APN inhibitors. Within these compounds, one compound, 5d (IC₅₀ = 4.51 μM), showed similar inhibitory effect compared with Bestatin (IC₅₀ = 5.87 μM).
