We report a novel class of biaryl polyamides highly selective for G-quadruplex DNA, and with significant cytotoxicity in several cancer cell lines; they form planar U-shaped structures that match the surface area dimensions of a terminal G-quartet in quadruplex structures rather than the grooves of duplex DNA.
