A series of novel 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives based on benzisoselenazolone has been prepared and tested for antiproliferative activity in vitro against the cells of human cancer cell lines: SSMC-7721 (human liver cancer cell), MCF-7 (human breast cancer cell) and A549 (human lung cancer cell). All the compounds obtained exhibited antiproliferative activity and showed selective cytotoxicity against different cancer cells. Compounds 7d and 7i showed significant antiproliferative activities against MCF-7 cells, with IC50 values of 1.07 and 1.76 µM respectively. Compound 7d were found to be the most potent compound against SSMC-7721 cells, with IC50 values 4.46 µM.
