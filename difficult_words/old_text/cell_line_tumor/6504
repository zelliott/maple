A novel pyrrole oligoglycoside 3-{O-beta-D-fucopyranosyl-(1-->3)-beta-D-fucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-[beta-D-quinovopyranosyl-(1-->2)]-beta-D-quinovopyranosyl}-2-acetyl-pyrrole, was isolated from the whole bodies of a common Pacific starfish Asterina pectinifera. Its structure was determined by interpretation of its spectral data, including one- and two-dimensional NMR methods.
