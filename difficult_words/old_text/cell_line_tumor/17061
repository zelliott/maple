We have cloned a cDNA from chromosome band 17p13.3, designated as HCAP1 (HCC-associated protein 1, originally named HC56). Database searches revealed that HCAP1 shares most of its open reading frame with GEMIN4. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screening revealed a high incidence of SNP in the coding region of HCAP1 (12 SNP sites). A collection of 140 controls and 22 cases from the Qidong area was genotyped at 6 SNP sites. The 22 cases exhibited higher frequencies of minor alleles than did the controls, and 2 sites revealed significant differences between the controls and the cases. We constructed 2 haplotypes, HCAP1-N (with common alleles at 5 SNP sites) and HCAP1-M (with minor alleles at 5 SNP sites), in a mammalian expression system. Both haplotypes resulted in a remarkable reduction in colony formation and suppression of cell growth after being transfected into the human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line. The inhibitory effect of HCAP1-N was stronger than that of HCAP1-M. Different haplotypes also resulted in different gene expression profiles in the Hep3B cell line according to an examination of 588 genes on an Atlas membrane. The expression induced by HCAP1-M caused an up-regulation of genes involved in cellular proliferation and a down-regulation of genes involved in cellular apoptosis and DNA repair. These results, in addition to the statistical data, are biological evidence that the HCAP1-M variant of HCAP1 has a reduced inhibitory effect on hepatocarcinoma cell growth and an impaired DNA repair system. This suggests that HCAP1-M may be related to cancer susceptibility.
