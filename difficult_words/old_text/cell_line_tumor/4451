Uncontrolled cell growth and tissue invasion define the characteristic features of cancer. Several growth factors regulate these processes by inducing specific signaling pathways. We show that FGF16, a novel factor, is expressed in human ovary, and its expression is markedly increased in ovarian tumors. This finding indicated possible involvement of FGF16 in ovarian cancer progression. We observed that FGF16 stimulates the proliferation of human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells, SKOV-3 and OAW-42. Furthermore, through the activation of FGF receptor-mediated intracellular MAPK pathway, FGF16 regulates the expression of MMP2, MMP9, SNAI1, and CDH1 and thus facilitates cellular invasion. Inhibition of FGFR as well as MAPK pathway reduces the proliferative and invasive behavior of ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, ovarian tumors with up-regulated PITX2 expression also showed activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway that prompted us to investigate possible interaction among FGF16, PITX2, and Wnt pathway. We identified that PITX2 homeodomain transcription factor interacts with and regulates FGF16 expression. Furthermore, activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway induces FGF16 expression. Moreover, FGF16 promoter possesses the binding elements of PITX2 as well as T-cell factor (Wnt-responsive), in close proximity, where PITX2 and β-catenin binds to and synergistically activates the same. A detail study showed that both PITX2 and T-cell factor elements and the interaction with their binding partners are necessary for target gene expression. Taken together, our findings indicate that FGF16 in conjunction with Wnt pathway contributes to the cancer phenotype of ovarian cells and suggests that modulation of its expression in ovarian cells might be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of invasive ovarian cancers.
