Marine organisms are being considered increasingly as sources of anti-tumour agents. The extract from Arca granosa L. has been shown to decrease the growth of tumours and this study was undertaken to determine its ability and mechanism of inhibition. The extract inhibited the proliferation of six human tumour cell lines from different origins with varying sensitivity. The cell lines Ketr-3, A549 and NCl-H460 with kidney or lung origins were more sensitive to the extract than those of the HepG-2, MCF-7 and MGC-803 cells from other origins. In the three sensitive cell lines (Ketr-3, A549 and NCI-H460) the extract was shown to block different phases of the cell cycle progression and inhibit DNA synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. It was concluded that the extract from A. granosa is potentially a novel anti-tumour agent, especially on kidney and lung tumour cell lines.
