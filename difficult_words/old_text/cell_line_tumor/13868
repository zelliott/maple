The majority of human prostate cancer cell lines, including the two "classical" cell lines DU-145 and PC-3, are reported to be androgen receptor (AR)-negative. However, other studies have provided evidence that the DU-145 and PC-3 cell lines express AR mRNA. These contradictory observations prompted us to investigate whether DU-145 and PC-3 cell lines express the androgen receptor. Using antipeptide antibodies directed against three distinct regions of the human AR protein and an improved method to detect AR protein in immunoblotting, we report that DU-145 and PC-3 cell lines express AR protein. We found that the relative levels of the AR mRNA and protein that were detected in DU-145 and PC-3 cell lines were lower than the LNCaP, an AR-positive cell line. Moreover, the antibody directed against the non-variant region (amino acids 299-315), but not the variant N- or C-terminal region (amino acids 1-20 and 900-919, respectively) of the human AR protein, detected the expression of AR in all prostate cancer cell lines. Notably, treatment of these cell lines with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) resulted in measurable increases in the AR protein levels and considerable nuclear accumulation. Although, treatment of DU-145 and PC-3 cells with DHT did not result in stimulation of the activity of an AR-responsive reporter, knockdown of AR expression in PC-3 cells resulted in decreases in p21(CIP1) protein levels, and a measurable decrease in the activity of the p21-luc-reporter. Our observations demonstrate the expression of AR protein in DU-145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines.
