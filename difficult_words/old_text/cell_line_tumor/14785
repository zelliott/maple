Acid-degradable microcapsules were prepared via an interfacial polymerization. Degradation of the thin wall of the capsules leads to all-or-nothing cargo release. The only byproducts of degradation are acetone, and a non-toxic triamide. Proof-of-concept experiments showed that cargo can be delivered to and released in cells.
