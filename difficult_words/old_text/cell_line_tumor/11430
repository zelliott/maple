Two series of new 4-aminopyrimido[4,5-b]indole ribonucleosides bearing phenyl or hetaryl group at position 5 or 6 have been prepared by Suzuki or Stille cross-coupling reactions employing X-Phos ligand with (het)arylboronic acids or stannanes. A series of 4-substituted nucleosides has been also prepared by Pd-catalyzed cross-couplings or nucleophilic substitution. Some of these compounds displayed moderate antiviral activities against HCV and dengue viruses.
