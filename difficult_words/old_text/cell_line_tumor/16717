To investigate the effect of gefitinib on the migration of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 cells.

Gefitinib was used in concentrations of 0 micromol/L, 0.1 micromol/L, 1 micromol/L, 10 micromol/L and 20 micromol/L, respectively. Phosphorylation levels of EGFR and Akt were analyzed by Western blot. The capability of migration was measured by scratch test and Boyden chamber assay. Microfilaments (cell skeleton ) remolding and polarization were evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy.

Comparing with the control group (0 micromol/L gefitinib), gefitinib effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream key proteins, and the effect displayed an obvious dose-effect relationship. At 24 hours after wound scratch, the cell migration distance of each group with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 20 micromol/L gefitinib was (36.3 +/- 4.0) microm, (30.3 +/- 3.8) microm, (26.8 +/- 3.3) microm, (17.0 +/- 2.6) microm, and (11.0 +/- 2.5) microm, respectively. At 3.5 hours after Boyden chamber assay, the cell count of each group with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 20 micromol/L gefitinib was 69.2 +/- 7.0, 51.8 +/- 7.5, 43.8 +/- 8.7, 30.6 +/- 4.8, and 28.4 +/- 3.4, respectively. Compared with the control group (0 micromol/L gefitinib), gefitinib could significantly prolong the wound-healing time and decrease the migrating cell count (P < 0.05), and significantly inhibit the lamellipodium formation, cell skeleton remolding and changes of the cytoskeleton polarization.

Gefitinib can reduce the migration capacity of triple-negative breast cancer cells through inhibiting phosphorylation of EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway, suppressing the cell skeleton (microfilaments) remolding and changes of its polarization.
