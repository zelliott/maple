Thirty-seven (E)-1-(4-methyl-2-arylaminothiazol-5-yl)-3-arylprop-2-en-1-ones were synthesized via Claisen-Schmidt condensation of 1-(4-methyl-2-(arylamino)thiazol-5-yl)ethanone with the corresponding arylaldehydes. All these thiazolyl-chalcones were characterized and evaluated by MTT assay on human cancer cell lines BGC-823, PC-3, NCI-H460, BEL-7402 in vitro. Compounds 5, 8, 26, 37 and 41 are effective against cancer cell lines with IC(50)s below 10 Î¼M. The antitumor activity in ICR mice bearing sarcoma 180 tumors indicates compounds 10 and 41 have moderate in vivo activity with 22-25% tumor-weight inhibition.
