The immediate-type allergic reaction is involved in many allergic diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. The discovery of drugs for the treatment of immediate-type allergic diseases is a very important subject in human health. In this study, we investigated the effect of Artemisia iwayomogi (AIAE) on mast cell-mediated allergic reaction and inflammatory cytokine secretion. AIAE inhibited compound 48/80-induced systemic reactions in mice. AIAE decreased the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction activated by antidinitrophenyl (anti-DNP) IgE antibody. AIAE dose-dependently reduced histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells activated by compound 48/80 or anti-DNP IgE. Furthermore, AIAE attenuated the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 secretion in human mast cells. These results provide evidence that AIAE may be beneficial in the treatment of allergic diseases.
