Separacenes A-D (1-4), novel polyene polyols, were isolated from Streptomyces sp. collected from the southern area of Jeju Island, Korea. The chemical structures of 1-4 were established by NMR, mass, UV, and IR spectroscopy as well as the modified Mosher's method. Separacenes A-B (1-2), which share an identical planar structure but possess different relative configurations, bear tetraene units flanked by two diol moieties, whereas the stereoisomeric separacenes C-D (3-4) possess a triene moiety between two diol substructures. Separacenes A-D each contain a terminal olefinic methylene. Separacene A displayed inhibitory activity against Candida albicans isocitrate lyase and weak cytotoxicity against both the colon carcinoma cell line HCT-116 and the lung cancer cell line A549.
