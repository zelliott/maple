A novel bioresponsive controlled-release biosensor using Au nanocages capped with an aptamer-based molecular gate was reported for the first time. The use of aptamers as caps has proven to be a suitable method for the preparation of "bio-gated" delivery systems that can be selectively opened in the presence of target biomolecules.
