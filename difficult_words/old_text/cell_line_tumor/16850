FGF signaling inhibits chondrocyte proliferation and requires the function of the p107 and p130 members of the Rb protein family to execute growth arrest. p107 dephosphorylation plays a critical role in the chondrocyte response to FGF, as overexpression of cyclin D1/CDK4 complexes (the major p107 kinase) in rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells overcomes FGF-induced p107 dephosphorylation and growth arrest. In cells overexpressing cyclin D1/CDK4, FGF-induced downregulation of cyclin E/CDK2 activity was absent. To examine the role of cyclin E/CDK2 complexes in mediating FGF-induced growth arrest, this kinase was overexpressed in RCS cells. FGF-induced dephosphorylation of either p107 or p130 was not prevented by overexpressing cyclin E/CDK2 complexes. Unexpectedly, however, FGF-treated cells exhibited sustained proliferation even in the presence of hypophosphorylated p107 and p130. Both pocket proteins were able to form repressive complexes with E2F4 and E2F5 but these repressors were not translocated into the nucleus and therefore were unable to occupy their respective target DNA sites. Overexpressed cyclin E/CDK2 molecules were stably associated with p107 and p130 in FGF-treated cells in the context of E2F repressive complexes. Taken together, our data suggest a novel mechanism by which cyclin E/CDK2 complexes can promote cell cycle progression in the presence of dephosphorylated Rb proteins and provide a novel insight into the key Retinoblastoma/E2F/cyclin E pathway. Our data also highlight the importance of E2F4/p130 complexes for FGF-mediated growth arrest in chondrocytes.
