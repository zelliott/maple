The azo coupling of the antibiotic olivomycin I (1) with aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborates produced 5-aryldiazenyl-6-O-deglycosyl derivatives of 1. The structures of new compounds were confirmed by (1)H NMR and mass spectrometry analysis. A quantum-chemical study was performed to analyze the possible directions of electrophilic substitution of 1 and the easiness of 6-O-disaccharide hydrolysis in the course of azo coupling. The antiproliferative and anti-retroviral activities of novel derivatives were studied.
