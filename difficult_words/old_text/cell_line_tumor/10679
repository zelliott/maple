JCC76 is a derivative of cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) selective inhibitor nimesulide and exhibits potent anti-breast cancer activity. It selectively induces apoptosis of Her2 positive breast cancer cells. However, the specific molecular targets of JCC76 still remain unclear, which significantly withdraw the further drug development of JCC76. To identify the molecular targets of JCC76, a six carbon linker and biotin conjugated JCC76 probe was designed and synthesized. The anti-proliferation activity of the probe and its analogs was evaluated.
