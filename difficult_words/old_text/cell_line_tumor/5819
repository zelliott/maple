To detect secretory REIC content in serum from the patients with gastric carcinoma and cell culture medium of gastric carcinoma cell lines, and determine the effects of recombinant REIC on proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells.

ELISA was employed to determine REIC content in serum and supernatant, and WST-8 to detect the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells.

The secretion level of REIC was obviously decreased in serum form gastric carcinoma, compared with healthy individuals ( p<0.05) and inversely correlated with the tumor size of gastric carcinomas ( p<0.05). The REIC content was lower in supernatant from gastric carcinoma cells than that in epithelial cells ( p<0.05). After the transfection of REIC-expressing plasmid, the concentration of REIC was increased in supernatant from AGS ( p<0.05). The proliferation of AGS and BGC-823 could be inhibited by recombinant REIC ( p<0.05).

REIC expression of secretion type decreased in gastric carcinoma cells, and inhibited the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. REIC protein might be employed as a good marker or target for the early diagnosis, biological and gene therapy of gastric carcinoma.
