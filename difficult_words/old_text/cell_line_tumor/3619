Recent advances in immunological and molecular technology have prompted proposals to change tumour classification and treatment strategies. Cell surface antigens are now easy to access, and tumour origins and clinical characteristics are now readily identifiable. However, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), one of the heterogeneous forms of haematological malignancy, the clinical significance of tumour surface antigens has not been well documented. We analysed the tumour surface antigens of 50 tumours from newly diagnosed DLBCL patients by flow cytometry in accordance with their clinical characteristics and followed the patients for a median 3.7 years. Statistical analysis showed that CD21 expression was significantly negatively associated with mortality in DLBCL (CD21 negative versus positive; relative risk = 2.36, P < 0.05). As a result of these clinical observations, we generated CD21-overexpressed (CD21(+)) lymphoma cell lines after gene transfection and analysed tumour cell growth in vivo in immunocompromised mice. Mice challenged with vector-only transfectants and parental cells as controls died within 50 d. In contrast, mice injected with CD21(+) transfectants exhibited significantly reduced tumour growth and 83% survived long term (versus control groups; P < 0.05). Interestingly, all established CD21(+) transfectants (six clones from different bulks) showed homotypic aggregation during in vitro cell culture, and anti-CD21 antibodies did not block this aggregation. Expression of CD21 is strongly associated with increased survival in DLBCL in vivo. CD21 expression may be indirectly concerned with the expression of additional cell adhesion molecules.
