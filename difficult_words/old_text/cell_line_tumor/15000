The aim of the current study was to investigate how proinflammatory conditions affect growth and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. Human hepatoma cell lines were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, Celecoxib, and in vitro proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression were assessed. This was followed up with in vivo xenograft assays to monitor tumor growth and metastatic progression under different treatment conditions. While LPS induced cell proliferation, Celecoxib induced apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that S-phase cell count in LPS group was higher than control group (41.9 ± 3.2 vs 30.6 ± 0.1%, respectively), whereas G0/G1-phase cells were significantly higher in the Celecoxib group in comparison with the control group (69.6 ± 5.0 vs 50.4 ± 1.6%, respectively) (p < 0.05). Immunoblot analyses showed induction of epidermal growth factor receptor expression and induction and nuclear accumulation of Wnt/β-catenin and p65 in LPS group. Xenograft assays showed that LPS treatment induced comparatively large, rapidly growing tumors (2,702 ± 572 mm(3)) that metastasized to lungs, whereas Celecoxib treatment alone (1,008 ± 296 mm(3)) or in combination with LPS (1,303 ± 283 mm(3)) suppressed tumor growth in comparison to control groups (2,072 ± 456 mm(3)) (n = 5; p < 0.05). Inflammation can thus promote hepatoma cell proliferation and growth, and enhance the invasion and metastatic ability of hepatocarcinoma cells through inducing tumor angiogenesis, which in turn may be related to the activation of Wnt/β-catenin and EGFR signaling pathways.
