A series of new heterocyclic derivatives of ursolic acid 1 were synthesized and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. Compounds 24-32, with an α,β unsaturated ketone in conjugation with an heterocyclic ring in ring A have improved antiproliferative activities. Compound 32 is the most active compound with an IC(50) of 1.9 μM which is sevenfold more active than ursolic acid 1. Compound 32 arrests cell cycle in G1 phase and induces apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells with upregulation of p53, p21(waf1) and NOXA protein levels.
