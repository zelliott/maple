HMGA chromatin proteins, a family of gene regulatory factors found at only low concentrations in normal cells, are almost universally overexpressed in cancer cells. HMGA proteins are located in the nuclei of normal cells except during the late S/G(2) phases of the cell cycle, when HMGA1, one of the members of the family, reversibly migrates to the mitochondria, where it binds to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In many cancer cells, this controlled shuttling is lost and HMGA1 is found in mitochondria throughout the cell cycle. To investigate the effects of HMGA1 on mitochondria, we employed a genetically engineered line of human MCF-7 cells in which the levels of transgenic HMGA1 protein could be reversibly controlled. "Turn-ON" and "turn-OFF" time course experiments were performed with these cells to either increase or decrease intracellular HMGA1 levels, and various mitochondrial changes were monitored. Results demonstrated that changes in both mtDNA levels and mitochondrial mass inversely paralleled changes in HMGA1 concentrations, strongly implicating HMGA1 in the regulation of these parameters. Additionally, the level of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased and the efficiency of repair of oxidatively damaged mtDNA decreased as consequences of elevated HMGA1 expression. Increased ROS levels and reduced repair efficiency in HMGA1-overexpressing cells likely contribute to the increased occurrence of mutations in mtDNA frequently observed in cancer cells.
