The expression of annexin A6 (AnxA6) in AnxA6-deficient non-invasive tumor cells has been shown to terminate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and downstream signaling. However, as a scaffolding protein, AnxA6 may stabilize activated cell-surface receptors to promote cellular processes such as tumor cell motility and invasiveness. In this study, we investigated the contribution of AnxA6 in the activity of EGFR in invasive breast cancer cells and examined whether the expression status of AnxA6 influences the response of these cells to EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and/or patient survival.

We demonstrate that in invasive BT-549 breast cancer cells AnxA6 expression is required for sustained membrane localization of activated (phosho-Y1068) EGFR and consequently, persistent activation of MAP kinase ERK1/2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathways. Depletion of AnxA6 in these cells was accompanied by rapid degradation of activated EGFR, attenuated downstream signaling and as expected enhanced anchorage-independent growth. Besides inhibition of cell motility and invasiveness, AnxA6-depleted cells were also more sensitive to the EGFR-targeted TKIs lapatinib and PD153035. We also provide evidence suggesting that reduced AnxA6 expression is associated with a better relapse-free survival but poorer distant metastasis-free and overall survival of basal-like breast cancer patients.

Together this demonstrates that the rapid degradation of activated EGFR in AnxA6-depleted invasive tumor cells underlies their sensitivity to EGFR-targeted TKIs and reduced motility. These data also suggest that AnxA6 expression status may be useful for the prediction of the survival and likelihood of basal-like breast cancer patients to respond to EGFR-targeted therapies.
