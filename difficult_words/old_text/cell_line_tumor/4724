The peptide hormone somatostatin, as well as the somatostatin analog octreotide, induces rapid morphological changes in neuroendocrine cells. The effect can be detected in less than 2 min: retraction fibers are formed, cells round up and cell-cell contacts are broken. Somatostatin-dependent cell contraction is inhibited by Y-27632, indicating that this effect is dependent on Rho kinase. In BON1 cells, the somatostatin-induced inhibition of forskolin-induced secretion of chromogranin A is not blocked by Y-27632. It is therefore concluded that the inhibitory effect of somatostatin in forskolin-stimulated cells is not dependent on cell contraction.
