To study the anti-tumor effect of tanshinon II A, tetrandrine, honokiol, curcumin, oridonin and paeonol on leukemia cell lines SUP-B15, K562, CEM, HL-60 and NB4.

To study the anti-tumor effect of tanshinone II A, tetrandrine, honokiol, curcumin, The leukemia cell lines were exposed to the six Chinese herbal components for 96 hours. The proliferative inhibitory effects were detected with MTT and described by IC50 value.

Tanshinone II A inhibited the proliferations of SUP-B15, K562, CEM, HL-60 and NB4 cell lines, with HL-60 showing the least impact. Tetrandrine, honokiol, curcumin and oridonin inhibited the proliferations of SUP-B15, K562, CEM, HL-60 and NB4 cell lines and there was no significant difference between the cell lines. Paeonol did not have significant inhibitory effect on leukemia cell lines.

Tetrandrine, honokiol, curcumin and oridonin inhibit the proliferation of five cell lines SUP-B15, K562, CEM, HL-60, NB4, and the effects are similar, which means that their anticancer effects are quite broad. Tanshinone II A has better anti-leukemia effects on SUP-B15, K562, CEM, NB4 than on HL-60. The effect of paeonol against leukemia cell lines is poor.
