The purpose of the present work was to formulate and evaluate cationic nano-liposomes as novel nonviral gene delivery for colon cancer treatment.

Recombinant pEGFP-c1-Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 ligand (FL) plasmids containing human FL gene and green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter genes were constructed. FL and GFP Gene-carrying cationic nano-liposomes were prepared based on the electrostatic adherence principle and then transfected into Lovo cells. The morphology, particle size, and zeta potential of gene-carrying cationic nano-liposomes were observed using an electron microscope. GFP expression was observed by fluorescence microscopy to assay the transfection efficiency. The cytotoxicity of FL/nano-liposomes was evaluated by the MTT method.

Recombinant plasmids pEGFP-c1-FL are successfully constructed using gene cloning methods and confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. The cationic nano-liposomes carrying pEGFP-cl-FL were observed by an electron micrograph and showed uniform spherical or elliptical shapes and many pores. The fluorescence microscopy images of gene-carrying cationic nano-liposomes showed good expression of GFP in pEGFP and pEGFP-cl-FL groups. The MTT assay of cell death indicated a significantly higher level of cell death between the FL group and the control group at 24, 48, and 96 hours after transplantation.

Cationic nano-liposomes show safe and high-performance transfection as gene carriers. Gene therapy has significant implications for colon cancer treatment in future.
