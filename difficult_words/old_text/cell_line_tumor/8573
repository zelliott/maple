Eleven curcumin-related compounds containing a benzyl piperidone moiety were synthesized and evaluated for their effects on cultured prostate cancer PC-3 cells, pancreas cancer BxPC-3 cells, colon cancer HT-29 cells and lung cancer H1299 cells. Inhibitory effects of these compounds on the growth of PC-3, BxPC-3, HT-29 and H1299 cells were determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and trypan blue exclusion assay. Compounds benzyl piperidone 2 (P2), P4, P7, 4-bromo-2-fluoro-benzyl piperidone 2 (PFBr2), PFBr3 and PFBr4 (see syntheses and structures in Figs. 1, 2) exhibited potent inhibitory effects on the growth of cultured PC-3, BxPC-3, HT-29 and H1299 cells. The IC50 for these compounds was lower than 2 µM in all four cell lines. PFBr4 was 41-, 36-, 40- and 46-fold more active than curcumin for inhibiting the growth of PC-3, BxPC-3, HT-29 and H1299 cells, respectively. The benzyl piperidone-containing compounds studied also stimulated apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Mechanistic studies indicate that the effects of both curcumin and PFBr4 on PC-3 cells were associated with a decrease in phospho-Akt and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2. The present study indicates that P2, P4, P7, PFBr2, PFBr3 and PFBr4 may have useful effects on human cancer cells.
