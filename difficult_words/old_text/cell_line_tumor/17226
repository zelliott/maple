We report here that the anticancer drug hexadecylphosphocholine (HPC) can control plasmid DNA-mediated gene transfer to renal carcinoma following intratumoral administration. Significant improvement of gene expression levels could be achieved depending on HPC dose administered. Optimal concentration of HPC co-injected with plasmid DNA was found to be 0.2% (w/v) showing up to a 10-fold increase in reporter gene expression levels when compared to DNA administered alone. In vivo gene transfer activity of HPC was not affected by the nature of the diluent used, i.e. glucose-based or saline-based isotonic solutions. Although in vitro transfection activity of HPC formulations could not be evidenced, a liposome leakage assay revealed that HPC could significantly destabilize stable lipid membranes suggesting that a possible membrane permeation enhancer activity of HPC combined to the physical stress induced by the intratumor injection may facilitate plasmid DNA entry inside the cells resulting in increased gene expression. HPC/plasmid formulations represent new and attractive non-viral gene delivery systems with potential in cancer gene therapy and vaccination.
