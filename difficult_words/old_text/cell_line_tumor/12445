In order to elucidate how phosphate regulates cellular functions, we investigated the effects of inorganic phosphate (Pi) on adenylate cyclase (AC)/cyclic AMP (cAMP) axis. Here we describe that Pi treatment of human osteosarcoma U2OS cells results in a decrease of both intracellular cAMP levels and AC activity, and in a cell growth inhibition. The phosphate-triggered effects observed in U2OS cells are not a widespread phenomenon regarding all cell lines, since other cell lines screened respond differently to parallel Pi treatments. In U2OS cell line, the AC activity/cAMP downregulation is accompanied by significant variations in the levels of some membrane proteins belonging to the AC system. Remarkably, the above effects are blunted by pharmacological inhibition of sodium-dependent phosphate transport. Moreover, 8-Br-cAMP and other cAMP-elevating agents, such as IBMX and forskolin, interestingly, prevent the cell growth inhibition in response to phosphate. Our results enforce the increasing evidences of phosphate as a signaling molecule, identifying in U2OS cell line the AC/cAMP axis, as a novel-signaling pathway modulated by phosphate to ultimately affect cell growth.
