To study the effect of Bifidobacterial adhesin on proliferation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cell induced by lypopolysaccharide (LPS) and H(2)O(2) in vitro.

With (3)H-TdR incorporation method, flow cytometry and fluorochrome staining, the proliferation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells induced by LPS and H(2)O(2) in vitro were studied.

LPS at the dose of 100 microg/L effectively stimulated the proliferation and apoptosis of cells, whereas H(2)O(2) at the dose of 200 micromol/L obviously restrained the proliferative ability while enhanced the apoptosis of the cells. Fluorochrome staining showed cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation and fragmentation under microscope. After treatment with Bifidobacterial adhesin, the cell proliferation and apoptosis decreased significantly in LPS group, and in H(2)O(2) group, cell apoptosis was significantly decreased.

Bifidobacterial adhesin can protect intestinal epithelial cells from the damage by LPS and H(2)O(2), and maintain the balance between the proliferation and apoptosis of the cells.
