We report the preparation of mannosylated nanoparticles loaded with messenger RNA (mRNA) that enhance the transfection of dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo and the anti-B16F10 melanoma vaccination in mice. Mannosylated and histidylated lipopolyplexes (Man(11)-LPR100) were obtained by adding mannosylated and histidylated liposomes to mRNA-PEGylated histidylated polylysine polyplexes. Upon intravenous injection, âˆ¼9% of the radioactivity of technetium 99 m-labeled lipopolyplexes measured in the liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys was found in the spleen. We demonstrate that spleen from mice injected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mRNA-loaded Man(11)-LPR100 contained four times more DCs expressing EGFP than that from mice injected with sugar-free LPR100. This better transfection of DCs is correlated with a better inhibition of B16F10 melanoma growth and an increased survival time when mice were immunized with MART-1 mRNA-loaded Man(11)-LPR100. These results indicate that mannosylated and histidylated LPR is an efficient system for the delivery of tumor antigen mRNA in splenic DCs aiming to induce an anticancer immune response.

This paper discusses the preparation of mannosylated nanoparticles loaded with messenger RNA that enhance the transfection of dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo and the anti-B16F10 melanoma vaccination in mice. The authors describe an efficient system for the delivery of tumor antigen mRNA in splenic DCs aiming to induce an anticancer immune response.
