In recent years, our knowledge on estrogen receptors (ER) has been modified profoundly with the identification and the deciphering of the role of its protein effectors, as well as with the deeper insight of its molecular structure/function dynamics, characteristics associated with its nucleo-cytoplasmic-membrane shuttling properties. Also, significant progress has been made concerning its turn-over and associated final proteasomal degradation processes. These advances could lead in the near future to the design and the synthesis of novel receptor-interacting drugs. Recently, a number of receptor-related peptides acting as specific ER ligands have been identified and extensively studied with respect to their estrogenic/antiestrogenic activities. Among them, ERα17p, a synthetic analog of the P(295)-T(311) sequence of ERα, has been shown to exert pseudo-estrogenic effects by interacting in the close vicinity of its hinge region (BF3 domain). Remarkably, this sequence appears as the epicenter of a number of post-transcriptional modifications as well as of the recruitment of co-regulators, suggesting that it would play a key role in ERα functions. Here, we provide evidence that ERα17p induces apoptosis in ERα-positive (MCF-7, T47D) and -negative (MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3) breast cancer cells by an ERα-independent membrane mechanism, triggering major pro-apoptotic signaling cascades. Finally, ERα17p induces the regression of breast ERα-negative cancer tumor xenografts, without apparent toxicity, suggesting that it could represent a new attractive tool for the development of future promising therapeutic approaches, and providing a novel insight to ER regulation of cell fate.
