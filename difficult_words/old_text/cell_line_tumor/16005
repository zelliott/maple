Our previous study had amplified antigen-specific full-length TCR α and β genes of clonally expanded T cells in the peripheral blood (PB) of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The transfer of T cell receptor (TCR) genes endows T cells with new antigen specificity. Therefore, the aim of this study is to generate diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)-specific T cells by T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer.

Two different eukaryotic expression plasmids harboring TCR Vα6 and TCR Vβ13 genes specific for DLBCL-associated antigens were constructed and subsequently transferred into human T cells using Nucleofector™ technique. The expression of targeted genes in TCR gene-modified cells was detected by real-time PCR, and western blot using TCR Vβ antibody. The specific cytotoxicity of TCR gene-transferred T cells in vitro was estimated using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay.

Two different eukaryotic expression plasmids harboring TCR Vα6 and TCR Vβ13 genes specific for DLBCL-associated antigens were constructed and subsequently transferred into T cells from healthy donors. Specific anti-DLBCL cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) could be induced by transduction of specific TCR gene to modify healthy T cells. The transgene cassette of TCR Vβ13-IRES-TCR Vα6 was superior to the other in the function of TCR-redirected T cells.
