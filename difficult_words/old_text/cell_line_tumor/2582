Carbamazepine, a sodium channel blocker and pro-autophagy agent used in the treatment of epilepsy and trigeminal neuralgia, is also an ionizing radiation mitigator and protector.

We measured the effect of carbamazepine, compared to other pro-autophagy drugs (i.e. lithium and valproic acid), on irradiation of autophagy incompetent (Atg5(-/-)) and competent (Atg5(+/+)) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, p53(-/-) and p53(+/+) bone marrow stromal cells, and human IB3, KM101, HeLa, and umbilical cord blood cell and in total body-irradiated or orthotopic tumor-bearing mice.

Carbamazepine, but not other pro-autophagy drugs, was a radiation protector and mitigator for mouse cell lines, independent of apoptosis, autophagy, p53, antioxidant store depletion, and class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but was ineffective with human cells. Carbamazepine was effective when delivered 24 hours before or 12 hours after total body irradiation of C57BL/6HNsd mice and did not protect orthotopic Lewis lung tumors.

Carbamazepine is a murine radiation protector and mitigator.
