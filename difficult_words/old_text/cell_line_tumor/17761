To study the expression and intracellular localization of FRZB gene in gastric cancer tissue, and to explore its significance in gastric cancer.

The expression of FRZB in tumor tissues from 90 patients with gastric cancer and in normal gastric mucous as control were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in tissue array. FRZB expression in gastric cancer cell lines and immortalized gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 were detected by quantitative real-time PCR(Q-PCR) and Western blot. The intracellular localization of FRZB was observed by immunofluorescence staining.

The positive expression rate of FRZB in gastric cancer was 92.2%. FRZB expressed in gastric cancer with well differentiation was higher than that with poor differentiation.The positive rate in normal gastric mucous was 10.0% (one out of ten). By confocal microscope, FRZB localized both in cytoplasma and nucleus, especially on the nuclear membrane. The Q-PCR and Western blot results also showed that the expression of FRZB in gastric cancer cell lines was higher than that in GES-1.

The expression of FRZB in gastric cancer is correlated with tumor cell differentiation and tumor Lauren classification. The nuclear localization of FRZB may contribute to its function in gastric cancer formation and progression.
