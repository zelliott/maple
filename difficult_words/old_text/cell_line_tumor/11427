The conjugates of anticancer nucleoside clofarabine [2-chloro-9-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-Î²-d-arabinofuranosyl)adenine] with 1,2- and 1,3-diacylglycerophosphates have been prepared by the phosphoramidite method using a combination of 1,1,3,3-tetraisopropyldisiloxane-1,3-diyl protecting group for the sugar moiety of the nucleoside and 2-cyanoethyl protection for the phosphate fragment. Some of the synthesized conjugates exhibited cytostatic activity against HL-60, A-549, MCF-7, and HeLa tumor cell lines.
