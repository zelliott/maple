Exposure in swine confinement buildings induces an intense airway inflammation. Twenty-two volunteers, of whom eleven wore a half-mask, were exposed for 3 hr in a swine barn. Blood samples were drawn before and after exposure. The ratio C3b/totalC3 in plasma decreased from 6.8 to 5.0% (p = 0.02) without mask and from 6.6 to 5.9% (p = 0.01) with mask (p = 0.67 between groups). The ratio Bb/totalB decreased from 14.5 to 13.5% (p < 0.01) without and 14.6-13.3% (p = 0.09) with mask (p = 0.25 between groups). Epithelial cells (A549) incubated up to 24 hr with 0.1 mg/mL dust suspensions were analysed for C3, IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. Cumulative C3 synthesis of dust stimulated cell cultures was 43,000 pg/mL compared to 25,000 pg/mL in unstimulated cells. Cumulative dust-induced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion was 200 and 3000 pg/mL, respectively and below detection in unstimulated cells. The activation of complement in vivo and induced C3 synthesis by epithelial cells suggests a role of complement in the airway reaction to organic dust exposure.
