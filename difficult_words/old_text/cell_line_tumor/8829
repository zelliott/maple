The microRNA miR-101 has been reported to be a tumor suppressor. Here we show that low expression of miR-101 is associated with poor survival in stage IV melanoma patients. We identified microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) as a direct target of miR-101. In melanoma cells, overexpression of miR-101 downregulated protein levels of MITF and a previously reported target protein, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). Functional assays showed that miR-101 suppressed invasion and proliferation - an outcome that could be phenocopied by siRNA knockdown of MITF and EZH2. Our data suggest that miR-101 might have a beneficial role in melanoma.
