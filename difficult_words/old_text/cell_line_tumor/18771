The risk of port site metastasis in laparoscopic surgery for cancer patients is a problem that has yet to be resolved. We examined the protective effect of a sodium hyaluronate-based bioresorbable membrane (Seprafilm) on tumor cell implantation at laparoscopic trocar sites.

Four 2-mm trocar sites were created in nude mice, and the peritoneal wounds were covered with different-sized pieces of Seprafilm. The protective effect of Seprafilm on the implantation of GB-d1 (a human gallbladder cancer cell line) at the trocar sites was assessed after 7 days. In addition, the effects of sodium hyaluronate and Seprafilm on the growth and motility of GB-d1 were examined in vitro.

Seprafilm significantly decreased the incidence of implantation compared with the control group. Histologically, Seprafilm was observed on days 1 and 3, as a sheet of gel that covered the injured peritoneum and muscle layer. In an invasion assay using Seprafilm, no cells were found to infiltrate through the gel sheet.

Seprafilm protects peritoneal wounds by physically covering the injured peritoneum. Therefore, if Seprafilm were attached to the injured peritoneum after laparoscopic surgery for cancer patients, it might reduce port site metastasis.
