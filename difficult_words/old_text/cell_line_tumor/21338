The steroid and xenobiotic receptor SXR (human pregnane X receptor) is a nuclear receptor that plays a key role in the body's detoxification response by regulating genes involved in drug metabolism and transport. SXR ligands include a wide range of compounds, which induce transcription of SXR target genes via activation of a heterodimeric transcription factor consisting of SXR and the related nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor (RXR). We investigated the effect of RXR-selective ligands, rexinoids, on SXR/RXR activity. In agreement with previous reports, we found that rexinoids are weak activators of SXR, but we also found that they can antagonize SXR activation by the potent SXR agonist rifampicin. This antagonism included suppression of rifampicin-induced expression of SXR target genes, as well as reduced binding of SXR/RXR to SXR response elements both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, two rexinoids, bexarotene (LGD1069/Targretin) and LG100268, caused a rapid and sustained decrease in the protein levels of both SXR and RXR. The decrease in SXR level was due to an enhanced rate of protein degradation and was dependent on calpain activity, as opposed to rexinoid-induced RXR degradation, which is mediated via the proteasome. Thus, we have demonstrated a novel, rexinoid-modulated mechanism regulating SXR protein stability, which may explain why rexinoids are only weak activators of SXR/RXR-mediated transcription, despite reports that they bind to SXR with high affinity. We suggest that the ability of rexinoids to induce degradation of both SXR and RXR, in combination with competition for binding to SXR, can also explain why rexinoids antagonize the activation of SXR by drugs like rifampicin.
