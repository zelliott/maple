Human thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) system is associated with cancer cell growth and anti-apoptosis process. Effects of 1, 2-[bis (1,2-Benzisoselenazolone-3 (2H) -ketone)]ethane (BBSKE), a novel TrxR inhibitor, were investigated on A549, HeLa, Bel-7402, BGC823 and KB cell lines. After treated with BBSKE, a good linear correlation coefficient (r>or=0.989) between TrxR activity and cell viability exists in each cell line together with cell growth/proliferation inhibition and apoptosis through Bcl-2/Bax and Caspase-3 pathways. These results suggest that there exists some relationship between TrxR inactivation and growth/proliferation inhibition or apoptosis in the investigated cell lines.
