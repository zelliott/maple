We have previously shown that fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) plays an important role in gastric carcinogenesis. In this study, we assessed DNA methylation status in the promoter region of FGFR2 gene in gastric cancer cell lines, and indicated that this region was highly methylated, compared with FGFR2-expressing gastric cancer cell lines. Moreover, the restoration of FGFR2 expression by treating methylated cells with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine strongly suggests that the loss of FGFR2 expression may be due to the aberrant hypermethylation in the promoter region of the FGFR2 gene. Thus, our results suggest that the epigenetic silencing of FGFR2 through DNA methylation in gastric cancer may contribute to tumor progression.
