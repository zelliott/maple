Estrogen action is mediated by the two receptor isoforms: estrogen receptor alpha and beta. Both receptors are expressed in human prostate tissue and have different action profiles. ERalpha is positively correlated with the malignancy of prostate cancer, while ERbeta may protect against abnormal prostate cell growth. 17Î²-Estradiol (E2), at least in part, induces cancerous transformations by causing deleterious mutations through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim was to study the effect of E2 on oxidative stress and the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and antioxidant enzymes in several prostate cancer cell lines with different ERalpha/ERbeta ratios. The cell prostate lines with a lower ERalpha/ERbeta ratio had lower oxidative stress, which could be partially explained by the increased expression of antioxidant enzymes and UCPs. Moreover, the action of E2 on the expression of antioxidant enzymes and UCPs was dual and dependent on the ERalpha/ERbeta ratio. Treatments with 0.1 nM E2 in cell lines with high ERalpha/ERbeta ratio produced a decrease in antioxidant enzymes and UCPs levels, with an increase in ROS production. These effects disappeared when the treatment was done in the presence of an ERalpha antagonist (MPP). In the cell lines with greatest levels of ERbeta and the lowest ERalpha/ERbeta ratio, E2 treatment caused the up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes and UCPs with a look-up decrease in ROS production. These effects were reversed when the cells were treated with E2 in the presence of an ERbeta antagonist (R,R-THC). On the whole, our results suggest a dual E2 effect; increasing or decreasing oxidative stress in part by modulation of UCPs and antioxidant enzymes according to the abundance ERbeta and ERalpha/ERbeta ratio in prostate cancer cell lines.
