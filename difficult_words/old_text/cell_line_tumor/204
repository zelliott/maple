Efficient synthesis of the deoxysugar part of versipelostatin (VST) was achieved by direct and stereoselective glycosylation of the reduced VST aglycon. Activation of 2-deoxyglycosyl imidate with IBr under basic conditions enables alpha-selective glycosylation of beta-2-deoxylglycosides without anomerization. Comparison of the synthetic and natural VST products using NMR indicates that versipelostatin has a beta-D-digitoxose-(1,4)-alpha-L-oleandrose-(1,4)-beta-D-digitoxose trisaccharide. In addition, results of a biological assay indicate that the deoxyoligosaccharide unit of the synthetic glycoside was important for biological activity of the compound.
