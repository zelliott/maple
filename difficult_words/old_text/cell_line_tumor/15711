Although one of the several chronic effects of ionizing radiation is aging, there are no experimental data on radiation-induced immunological aging. The most interesting change in aging was a helper T (Th) 1/Th2 imbalance. We investigated chronic effect on immune responses after ionizing radiation and its effects in irradiated mice were compared with those of aged mice. The 2-month-old mice received a whole-body irradiation of 5Gy. At 6months after irradiation, we compared the immune functions of the irradiated mice with those of normal mice of the same age and with those of older. Interferon (IFN)-Î³ and antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G2a level were lower in the irradiated mice than in normal mice of same age, showing similar levels to those of old normal mice. In contrast, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 and antigen-specific IgG1 level were increased in irradiated mice when compared with the same aged-normal mice. Next, we investigated the low expression of IL-12p70, IL-12 receptors and IL-18 receptors in irradiated and old mice. Also, the decrease of natural killer cell activity was intensified in the irradiated mice, showing lower than values to those of old mice. Interestingly, in irradiated mice, the absolute numbers and the percentages of natural killer (NK) cells was extremely decreased. But the absolute numbers of Th cells and cytotoxic T (Tc) cells in old mice were significantly decreased. In conclusion, an immunological imbalance by the whole-body irradiation of 5Gy induces to persist in the long term, resulting in the similar results with aging. Our results suggest that the downregulation of the Th1-like immune response shown in old mice rapidly occurred through exposure of ionizing radiation.
