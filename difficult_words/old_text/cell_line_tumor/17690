The use of anti-cancer chemotherapy often leads to the rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumors. We have previously reported the overexpression of a 40kDa protein (P-40) in several MDR tumor cell lines. In this report we describe the cloning of a 1.4kb cDNA with an open reading frame of 344 amino acids that encodes the P-40 protein. Analysis of the P-40 amino acid sequence showed it is identical to the human annexin I (Anx-I) protein. The identity of the isolated P-40 cDNA as Anx-I was confirmed by the specific binding of IPM96 mAb to a 40kDa protein following the in vitro expression of P-40 full-length cDNA. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from drug-sensitive and -resistant cells revealed an increase in P-40 (or Anx-I) mRNA in drug-resistant cells relative to drug-sensitive cells. Transfection of Anx-I cDNA into drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells was carried out without further drug selection and showed 2- to 5-fold increase in resistance of transfected cells to adriamycin, melphalan, and etoposide. Conversely, transfection of reverse Anx-I cDNA into SKOV-3 cells decreased the expression of Anx-I without affecting the expression of other members of the annexin family and showed a 3- to 8-fold increase in sensitivity to these drugs. Of interest was the correlation between the presence of Anx-I and MDR in MDA-MB-231 cells when compared to MCF-7 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells show 3- to 20-fold increase in resistance to adriamycin, melphalan, and etoposide in the absence of detectable levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp1), the multidrug resistance protein (MRP1) or the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Taken together, these results provide the first direct evidence for the role of Anx-I in MDR of tumor cells.
