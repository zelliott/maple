The present study shows that the IFN-gamma-mediated upregulation of secretory phospholipase A2 of group IIA (sPLA2-IIA) in HASMC and HepG2 cells is synergistically increased after simultaneous inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) by indirubin-3'-monoxime, 5-iodo or AR-A014418. The effect of GSK-3beta inhibition was dose- and time-dependent and can be further augmented by its concomitant incubation with Clostridium difficile toxin B, an inhibitor of small Rho proteins, or H-1152, an inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase. Using AG-490 and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), it is further demonstrated that the effect of GSK-3beta inhibition on sPLA2-IIA expression depends on Janus kinase-2 and NF-kappaB-signaling.
