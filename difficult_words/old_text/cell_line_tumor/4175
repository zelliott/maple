Lhx8 is a transcription factor for cholinergic differentiation. Our previous experiments found upregulation of Lhx8 promoted cholinergic neuronal differentiation of hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells or hippocampal newborn neurons in vitro. However, the role of Lhx8 in VAChT expression and ACh release is still less understood. In this report, we transfected Lhx8 cDNA into neuronal cell line SHSY5Y by lentiviral vectors to acquire the cells which stably expressed high level of Lhx8. Using this cell model, we provided experimental evidence that increasing Lhx8 upregulated the expression of ChAT and VAChT, and also increased the ACh release in culture medium. We suggested that Lhx8 overexpression is a useful strategy to increase the release of ACh and maybe of therapeutic value to neurodegenerative diseases.
