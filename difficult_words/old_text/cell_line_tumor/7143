CDK11p110 (cyclin-dependent kinase 11p110, formerly known as PITSLRE) is a member of the CDK superfamily. It associates with cyclin L and is involved in the regulation of transcription and in premRNA splicing. During staurosporine-, Fas- and tumour necrosis factor a-induced apoptosis, CDK11p110, is cleaved by caspases to generate smaller 46-50 kDa proteins containing the catalytic kinase domain. Ectopic expression of the caspase-processed form CDK11p46 induces apoptosis. The mechanisms that regulate activation and stability of CDK11 isoforms are still unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that in human melanoma cells CDK11p110 and CDK11p46 interact with Hsp90 (heat-shock protein 90) and its co-chaperone cdc37. Furthermore, we show that the treatment of cells with the Hsp90-specific inhibitor geldanamycin leads to ubiquitination and enhanced degradation of both CDK11p110 and CDK11p46 through a proteasome-dependent pathway. We also determined that geldanamycin-triggered degradation of CDK11p46 slows down the progression of apoptosis. These results indicate that Hsp90 and cdc37 stabilize CDK11 kinase, and suggest that this stabilization is crucial for its pro-apoptotic function.
