TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) triggers apoptosis in various tumor cells by engaging death receptors 4 and 5. We investigated the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on death receptor 4 mediated apoptosis in human renal cell carcinoma cells using HGS-ETR1, which is a human monoclonal agonistic antibody specific for death receptor 4.

Cytotoxicity was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Synergy was assessed by isobolographic analysis.

Treatment of the ACHN human renal cell carcinoma cell line with HGS-ETR1 combined with 5-fluorouracil, vinblastine or gemcitabine did not overcome resistance to these agents. However, treatment with HGS-ETR1 combined with doxorubicin had a synergistic cytotoxic effect. Synergy was also achieved in another human renal cell carcinoma cell line, Caki-1, and in 5 freshly derived renal cell carcinoma cell cultures. A synergistic effect was also observed with HGS-ETR1 combined with the doxorubicin derivatives epirubicin, pirarubicin or amrubicin. The synergy achieved in cytotoxicity with HGS-ETR1 and doxorubicin was also achieved in apoptosis. Sequential treatment with doxorubicin followed by HGS-ETR1 induced significantly more cytotoxicity than reverse treatment or simultaneous treatment ( p<0.05). Doxorubicin remarkably increased the cell surface expression of death receptor 4 in renal cell carcinoma cells. The combination of doxorubicin and HGS-ETR1 significantly activated the caspase cascade, including caspase-8, 9, 6 and 3, which are the downstream molecules of death receptors.

These findings indicate that doxorubicin sensitizes renal cell carcinoma cells to death receptor 4 mediated apoptosis through the induction of death receptor 4 and the activation of caspases, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and HGS-ETR1 might be effective as renal cell carcinoma therapy.
