A novel drug delivery system of doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded Zein in situ gel for interstitial chemotherapy was investigated in this study. The possible mechanisms of drug release were described according to morphological analysis by optical microscopy and scanning electronic microscope (SEM). In vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity studies showed that DOX-loaded Zein in situ gel was superior to DOX solution. Local pharmacokinetics in tumor tissue was studied by quantitative analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) combined with microdialysis technology. A pharmacokinetics mathematical model of DOX-loaded Zein in situ gel in tumors was then built.
