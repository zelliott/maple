Increasing evidence is emerging highlighting the role of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) during metastasis by regulating cell adhesion. The current study demonstrated that modulation of PTHrP expression by PTHrP overexpression and small interfering RNA-induced silencing resulted in changes in cell adhesion and integrin expression. RNA interference of endogenous PTHrP caused a significant reduction in cell adhesion of a breast cancer cell line to collagen type I, fibronectin and laminin ( p<0.05) and of a colon cancer cell to collagen type I and fibronectin ( p<0.05). Overexpression of PTHrP induced a significant increase in cell adhesion of colon ( p<0.0001) and breast ( p<0.05) cancer cells to the same extracellular matrix proteins. These PTHrP-mediated effects were attributed to changes in integrin expression as the differences in adhesion profile correlated with the integrin expression profile. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism whereby PTHrP regulates integrin expression, promoter activity of the integrin alpha5 subunit was analysed and significant increases in transcriptional activity were observed in PTHrP overexpressing cells ( p<0.0001), which was dependent on nuclear localisation. These results indicate that modulation of cell adhesion is a normal physiological action of PTHrP, mediated by increasing integrin gene transcription.
