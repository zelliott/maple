The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R), a ligand-gated Ca(2+) channel, is the main regulator of intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in non-excitable cells. An emerging body of evidence suggests that specific regulatory control of the Ca(2+) signaling pathway is modulated by the activation of additional signaling pathways. In the present study, we investigated the influence of the PI3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway on the activity of the IP(3)R/Ca(2+) signaling pathway in RINm5F cells. We used a co-immunoprecipitation approach to show that mTOR physically interacts with IP(3)R-3 in an mTOR activity-dependent manner. We also showed that IP(3)R is phosphorylated by mTOR in cellulo. All the conditions known to modulate mTOR activity (IGF-1, wortmannin, rapamycin, PP242, and nutrient starvation) were shown to modify carbachol-induced Ca(2+) signaling in RINm5F cells. Lastly, we used an assay that directly measures the activity of IP(3)R, to show that mTOR increases the apparent affinity of IP(3)R. Given that mTOR controls cell proliferation and cell homeostasis, and that Ca(2+) plays a key role in these two phenomena, it follows that mTOR facilitates IP(3)R-mediated Ca(2+) release when the nutritional status of cells requires it.
