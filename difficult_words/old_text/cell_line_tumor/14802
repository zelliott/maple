Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, thus remaining a crucial health problem among women despite advances in conventional therapy. Therefore, new alternative strategies are needed for effective diagnosis and treatment. One approach is the use of oncolytic viruses for gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy. Here, the lacZ-carrying vaccinia virus (VACV) strain GLV-1h68 was used in combination with a β-galactosidase-activatable prodrug derived from a seco-analog of the natural antibiotic duocarmycin SA. Tumor cell infection with the VACV strain GLV-1h68 led to production of β-galactosidase, essential for the conversion of the prodrug to the toxic compound. Furthermore, drug-dependent cell kill and induction of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in tumor cells was also observed on combination therapy using the prodrug and the GLV-1h68 strain, despite the fact that VACV strains encode antiapoptotic proteins. Moreover, GI-101A breast cancer xenografts were effectively treated by the combination therapy. In conclusion, the combination of a β-galactosidase-activatable prodrug with a tumor-specific vaccinica virus strain encoding this enzyme, induced apoptosis in cultures of the human GI-101A breast cancer cells, in which a synergistic oncolytic effect was observed. Moreover, in vivo, additional prodrug treatment had beneficial effects on tumor regression in GLV-1h68-treated GI-101A-xenografted mice.
