Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family, has been demonstrated as a potential new target for apoptosis-based therapy in cancer and lymphoma. The aim of this study is to investigate effects and mechanisms of survivin siRNA transfection on lung adenocarcinoma cell lines SPCA1 and SH77.

A siRNA plasmid expression vector and pSi scrambled against survivin were constructed and transfected into SPCA1 and SH77 cells with Lipofectamine 2000. The proliferations of lung adenocarcinoma SPCA1 and SH77 cells were detected by MTT. The apoptotic rate and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometer. The activity of survivin mRNA and protein expression were analyzed with RT-PCR and Western blot.

Survivin siRNA reduced the proliferation of SPCA1 and SH77 cells. Cell cycle was inhibited in G0/G1. Expressions of survivin siRNA mRNA and protein were reduced in transfected cells compared with the control cells.

siRNA targeted against survivin can effectively suppress SPCA1 and SH77 cells proliferation and significantly induce SPCA1 and SH77 cells apoptosis.
