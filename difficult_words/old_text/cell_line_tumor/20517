Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), a process to deliver excess cholesterol from the periphery to the liver for excretion from body, is a major atheroprotective property of high-density lipoproteins. As major transporters for cholesterol efflux in macrophages, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1) are critical for RCT. We investigated mechanisms for the regulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression by fatty acids (FA) in RAW264.7 macrophages. Cells were incubated with 100 μmol/L of palmitic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic or eicosapentaenoic acids in the absence or presence of T0901317, a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist. Unsaturated FA, but not saturated FA, significantly reduced ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA without the agonist. Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, not only increased basal ABC transporter expression but abrogated the transcriptional repression by unsaturated FA. The increased basal ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA by TSA paralleled the increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and PPARγ coactivator 1α expression, whereas LXRα and PGC-1β expression was significantly lowered. Although the repressive effect of ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA by unsaturated FA was abolished by T0901317, protein levels remained diminished. Chemical and genetic deficiency of protein kinase C δ did not abolish the repressive effect of linoleic acid on ABCA1 and ABCG1. In conclusion, unsaturated FA repressed ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression by two distinct mechanisms in RAW 264.7 macrophages: LXR-dependent transcriptional repression possibly by modulating histone acetylation state and LXR-independent posttranslational inhibition.
