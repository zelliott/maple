This paper aimed to investigate the treatment efficiency of 188Re labeled folate targeting albumin nanoparticles with cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum Cisplatin (188Re-folate-CDDP/HAS MNP) on human ovarian cancer. SKOV3 cells or tumor-bearing mice were divided into different groups and treated as follow: (A) negative control; (B) chemotherapy; (C) radiotherapy; (D) hyperthermia; (E) chemotherapy and radiotherapy; (F) chemotherapy and hyperthermia; (G) radiotherapy and hyperthermia; (H) chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hyperthermia. Treatment of B to H inhibited proliferation of SKOV3 cells, with the greatest inhibition being observed in group H ( p<0.05). Obvious apoptotic hypodiploid peak appeared beside G1 phase in groups of B to H. The apoptotic rates of SKOV3 cells in groups of A to H were 0.08%, 7.56%, 8.64%, 17.14%, 21.64%, 23.77%, 33.94% and 57.16%, respectively. Our findings in vivo study showed that the mass of tumor in each group of B to H was significantly lower than that in the negative control (p <0.05). In addition, compared with each group of B to G, group H showed highest inhibition of tumor growth ( p<0.05). In conclusion, the combination of magnetic induced hyperthermia, chemotherapy and targeted radionuclide of radiation exposure can effectively inhibit the growth of ovarian cancer, which indicates a potential applications in ovarian cancer treatment.
