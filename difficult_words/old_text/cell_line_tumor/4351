Prohibitin (PHB), also known as inhibin, is important in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. This protein localizes to the inner membrane of mitochondria, where it acts as a chaperone protein, and is also found in the nucleus, where it negatively regulates transcription. The tumor-suppressive role of PHB in cell proliferation appears to be contradictory. In this study, we investigated the existence, localization and alterations in the expression of PHB in the whole cell and nuclear matrix and analyzed its co-localization with the expression products of related genes. The western blot analysis results revealed that PHB exists in the composition of nuclear matrix proteins and that the expression level of PHB is significantly increased in the whole cell and markedly decreased in the nuclear matrix after curcumin (1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione) treatment. The laser confocal scanning microscope results demonstrated the co-localization of PHB with p53, c-Myc, Bax, and Fas in HaCaT cells, and this co-localization region was transferred as a result of curcumin treatment. In addition, the results of the GST pull-down assay demonstrated the direct interaction of PHB with p53, c-Myc and Bax but not Fas in vitro. Results of the present study confirmed that the expression and distribution of PHB, which is a nuclear matrix protein, affect the apoptosis of HaCaT cells and its co-localization with specific gene products connected with cell apoptosis.
