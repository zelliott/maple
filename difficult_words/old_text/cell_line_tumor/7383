Increased EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) expression has been reported in many types of human cancer and its levels are positively associated with advanced cancers. Recently, upregulation of Id-1 (inhibitor of differentiation or DNA binding) protein was found in over 70% of ovarian cancer samples and correlated with poor survival of ovarian cancer patients. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the role of Id-1 in ovarian cancer are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Id-1 on ovarian cancer proliferation and its association with the EGFR pathway. To achieve this, we transfected an Id-1 expression vector into three ovarian cancer cell lines and examined cell proliferation rate by flow cytometry and bromodeoxyuridine staining. We found that ectopic Id-1 expression led to increased cell proliferation demonstrated by increased BrdU incorporation rate and S-phase fraction. The Id-1-induced cell growth was associated with upregulation of EGFR at both transcriptional and protein levels. In contrast, inactivation of Id-1 through transfection of an Id-1 antisense vector resulted in downregulation of EGFR. Our results indicate that increased Id-1 in ovarian cancer cells may promote cancer cell proliferation through upregulation of EGFR. Our findings also implicate that Id-1 may be a potential target for the development of novel strategies in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
