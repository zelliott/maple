Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a protein tyrosine kinase, has recently been suggested to play a role in signal transduction through integrins. In fact, FAK is involved in cell proliferation and cell motility by performing signal transduction through integrins. FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK) has been found to be an inhibitor of FAK. As the expression level of FRNK in the cell is very low, the study of FRNK has been preferentially performed by gene overexpression, up to the present, and the role of constitutive FRNK in cells remains unclear. We hypothesized that FRNK is involved in the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and investigated the expression of FRNK by time kinetic analysis shortly after cell seeding. We found that FRNK expression was significantly increased in the cells during the early stage of cell adhesion to the ECM. These data indicated that FRNK plays an important role in cell adhesion during the very early stages of cell culture.
