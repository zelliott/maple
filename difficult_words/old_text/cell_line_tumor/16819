To detect the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), glucose transporter protein-1 (GLUT-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human laryngeal carcinoma tissue, and to study the relationship between hypoxia and HIF-1α, GLUT-1, VEGF in human laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells and to explore the effect of HIF-1α, GLUT-1 and VEGF as endogenous hypoxic markers on laryngeal carcinoma.

The expression levels of HIF-1α, GLUT-1 and VEGF were detected in 35 cases of laryngeal carcinoma by SP immunohistochemical methods and in Hep-2 cells by SP immunocytochemical methods. The relationship between HIF-1α and GLUT-1, VEGF protein expression was analyzed.

Of the 35 cases, 16 cases expressed HIF-1α, 16 cases expressed GLUT-1, 19 cases expressed VEGF. The expression of HIF-1α and VEGF were closely correlated with pathologic grading and lymphnode metastasis. GLUT-1 was correlated with lymphnode metastasis. The expression levels of HIF-1α, GLUT-1 and VEGF in Hep-2 cells under hypoxic condition were higher than those under normoxic condition.

HIF-1α may promote the expression of GLUT-1 and VEGF in laryngeal carcinoma, furthermore promote tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of the laryngeal carcinoma.
