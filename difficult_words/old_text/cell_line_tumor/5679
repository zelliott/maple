Two analogues of cryptophycin were synthesized and biologically evaluated for their in-vitro cytotoxicities against several solid tumors and leukemia cell lines. The results revealed that both analogues exhibited a broad range of cytotoxic activity with observed IC(50 )values in the muM-range, and compound 4 was more effective than compound 3 in most assays studied.
