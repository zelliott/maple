Maspin is a member of serine protease inhibitor family with tumor suppressing activity for breast and prostate cancers, acting at the level of tumor invasion and metastasis. However, there have been no published data regarding the role of maspin in human bladder cancer. We evaluated maspin expression in 65 series of bladder cancer samples (22 transurethral resection (TUR) and 43 radical cystectomy) and studied the regulatory mechanism of maspin gene activation in bladder cancer cells. Maspin expression was immunohistochemically detected in four (18.2%) patients with TUR and 22 (51.2%) patients with radical cystectomy whereas no expression was observed in normal transitional cells located at tumor-free area in bladder. The maspin expression was significantly correlated with the development of muscle invasive bladder cancer (P=0.00008). Using a luciferase reporter system, maspin promoter activity was induced in the maspin-positive bladder cancer cell lines as well as maspin-negative RT4 cells. Furthermore, treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine, and histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, led to re-expression of maspin in RT4 cells. Our results indicate that maspin may contribute to bladder cancer development and that DNA methylation and histone deacetylation may be important for regulating maspin gene activation in bladder cancer cells.
