In this paper we investigate the Ca2+ response after Substance P (SP) stimulation of U373 MG cells. SP is a tachykinin and physiologically acts as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in the nervous system, but pathologically triggers malignant glial cells, such as U373 MG, to release cytokines and increase proliferation rate. In this paper we show that SP increases the proliferation rate of U373 MG cells and the intracellular Ca2+ concentration by mobilizing Ca2+ only from thapsigargin-sensitive stores. In fact, Ca2+ entry through store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channels, which was observed after thapsigargin treatment, was not detected after stimulation by SP. The inhibition of SOCE after SP stimulation must be mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), because it was not observed in the presence of calphostin C (an inhibitor of PKC). Moreover, stimulation by SP-induced membrane potential hyperpolarization. Our results are consistent with the following sequence of events: (i) SP interacts with NK(1) receptors; (ii) fast homologous receptor desensitization occurs; (iii) reuptake by endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase quantitatively overwhelms the extrusion by plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase. These results have two important consequences. In U373 MG cells the SOCE does not contribute to the Ca2+ response after SP, and is not necessarily involved in promoting cell proliferation.
