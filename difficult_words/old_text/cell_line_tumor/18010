To study the effect of short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) on F10 gene expression in KLE cells and the effect of F10 knock-down on KLE cell apoptosis.

The short dsRNA specifically targeting F10 gene prepared by in vitro transcription was transfected into KLE cells via lipofectamine 2000. The expression of F10 mRNA in the transfected KLE cells was detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and the apoptosis of the cells was assayed by flow cytometry.

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that transfection of the KLE cells with the short dsRNA induced effective knock-down of F10 gene, and transfection of the cells with 20 nmol/L dsRNA for 48 h decreased the expression of F10 mRNA by 83%. Compared with the control, the apoptosis index of the transfected KLE cells increased from 0.36% to 8.91%.

F10 gene in KLE cells can be specifically knocked-down with dsRNA prepared by in vitro transcription, and the down-regulation of F10 gene induces apoptosis of KLE cells.
