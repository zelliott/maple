A series of aminomethylidene derivatives obtained from 4-formyledaravone were synthesized and characterized by IR, NMR and elemental analysis. All the compounds were screened for their antitumor activity. The compound containing 5-phenylpyrazole moiety (3q) exhibited remarkable antitumor activity in in vitro assays, especially against human breast cancer MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453 cell lines. The most important whole-molecule descriptors for antitumor activity on MDA-MB-453 cells belong to the group of quantum-chemical descriptors.
