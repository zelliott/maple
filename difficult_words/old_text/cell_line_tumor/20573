Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease with nearly equal yearly rates of diagnosis and death. Current therapies have failed to improve outcomes due to rapid disease progression and late stage at presentation. Recently, pathways involved in progression and metastasis have been elucidated; however, new knowledge has not generated more effective therapies. We report on the use of subcellular fractionation and liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry to identify 3,907 proteins in four pancreatic cancer cell lines, 540 of which are unique to primary cancer cells, and 487 unique to cells derived from metastatic sites. Statistical analysis identified 134 proteins significantly differentially expressed between the two populations. The subcellular localization of these proteins was determined and expression levels for four targets were validated using western blot techniques. These identified proteins can be further investigated to determine their roles in progression and metastasis and may serve as therapeutic targets in the development of more effective treatments for pancreatic cancer.
