MicroRNA-10b (miR-10b) has been reported to facilitate the metastasis of breast cancer. However, little is known about the role of miR-10b in the metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we show that high levels of miR-10b expression in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1)-expressing NPC cells, and its expression is down-regulated by silencing LMP1 or Twist. Induction of miR-10b over-expression in LMP1-silent C666-1 cells promoted significant wound healing and transmembrane invasiveness in vitro. More importantly, miR-10b over-expression promoted the metastasis of NPC and accelerated the death of tumor-bearing nude mice. These findings strongly suggest that miR-10b positively regulates the metastasis of NPC.
