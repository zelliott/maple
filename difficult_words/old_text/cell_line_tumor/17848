A polymeric terbium complex that can be excited by near-infrared excitation at 800 nm via multiphoton absorption processes has been synthesized. This complex has been demonstrated to show strong, observable, three-photon-induced f-f emission in cell imaging. In vitro studies carried out in three carcinoma cell lines (A549, HONE1, and HeLa) have been performed and shown to have low cytotoxicity. This complex is therefore a potential candidate for future infrared excitation imaging dyes.
