Integrins function as cell-extracellular matrix adhesion proteins and have been implicated in tumor progression. In ovarian tumors, elevated integrin β1 expression correlates with high clinical stage and poor patient survival. In this study, we report that EGF treatment up-regulated integrin β1 mRNA and protein levels in ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of MEK totally abolished EGF-induced integrin β1 up-regulation and cell invasion suggesting that MAPK/ERK signaling is required for EGF-induced integrin β1 up-regulation and cell invasion. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of integrin β1 expression reduced the intrinsic invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells and the EGF-induced cell invasion. Finally, we found that overexpression of integrin β1 was sufficient to promote ovarian cancer cell invasion. This study demonstrates that integrin β1 mediates EGF-induced cell invasion in ovarian cancer.
