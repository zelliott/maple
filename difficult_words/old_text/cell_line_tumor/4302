Upon DNA damage, tumor suppressor p53 determines cell fate by repairing DNA lesions to survive or by inducing apoptosis to eliminate damaged cells. The decision is based on its posttranslational modifications. Especially, p53 phosphorylation at Ser46 exerts apoptotic cell death. However, little is known about the precise mechanism of p53 phosphorylation on the induction of apoptosis. Here, we show that amphiregulin (AREG) is identified for a direct target of Ser46 phosphorylation via the comprehensive expression analyses. Ser46-phosphorylated p53 selectively binds to the promoter region of AREG gene, indicating that the p53 modification changes target genes by altering its binding affinity to the promoter. Although AREG belongs to a family of the epidermal growth factor, it also emerges in the nucleus under DNA damage. To clarify nuclear function of AREG, we analyze AREG-binding proteins by mass spectrometry. AREG interacts with DEAD-box RNA helicase p68 (DDX5). Intriguingly, AREG regulates precursor microRNA processing (i.e., miR-15a) with DDX5 to reduce the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. These findings collectively support a mechanism in which the induction of AREG by Ser46-phosphorylated p53 is required for the microRNA biogenesis in the apoptotic response to DNA damage.
