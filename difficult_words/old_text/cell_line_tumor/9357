In the present study, an ultrahigh-resolution system was applied as a simple and convenient technique to characterize the extent of metal nanoparticle agglomeration in solution and to visualize nanoparticle agglomeration, uptake, and surface interaction in three cell phenotypes under normal culture conditions. The experimental results demonstrated that silver (25, 80, 130 nm); aluminum (80 nm); and manganese (40 nm) particles and agglomerates were effectively internalized by rat liver cells (BRL 3A), rat alveolar macrophages (MACs), and rat neuroendocrine cells (PC-12). Individual and agglomerated nanoparticles were observed within the cells and agglomerates were observed on the cell surface membranes. The particles were initially dispersed in aqueous or physiological balanced salt solutions and agglomeration was observed using the Ultra Resolution Imaging (URI) system. Different methods, such as sonication and addition of surfactant (0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]) reduced agglomeration. Due to effects of SDS itself on cell viability, the surfactant could not be directly applied during cell exposure. Therefore, following addition of 0.1% SDS, the particles were washed twice with ultrapure water, which reduced agglomeration even further. Reducing the agglomeration of the nanoparticles is important for studying their uptake and in applications that benefit from individual nanoparticles such as diagnostics. In summary, this study demonstrates a simple technique to characterize the extent of nanoparticle agglomeration in solution and visualize nanoparticle (40 nm and larger) uptake and interaction with cells. Additionally, an example application of nanoparticle labeling onto the surface and neurite extensions of murine neuroblastoma cells (N2A) is presented as a potential imaging tool.
