SEREX has proven to be a powerful method that takes advantage of the presence of spontaneous humoral immune response in some cancer patients. In this study, immunoscreening of normal testis and two ovarian cancer cell line cDNA expression libraries with sera from ovarian cancer patients led to the isolation of 75 independent antigens, designated KP-OVA-1 through KP-OVA-75. Of these, RT-PCR showed KP-OVA-52 to be expressed strongly in normal testis, in ovarian cancer cell lines (3/9) and in ovarian cancer tissues (1/17). The expression of KP-OVA-52 in cancer cells is also induced by the demethylating agent 5‑aza‑2'‑deoxycytidine (ADC). To test immunogenicity, we used the Serum Antibody Detection Assay (SADA) to analyze anti-IgG antibodies against the 75 antigens that were initially isolated by SEREX. Four of the 75 antigens (KP‑OVA‑25, KP‑OVA‑35, KP‑OVA‑68 and KP‑OVA‑73) reacted exclusively with sera from cancer patients. However, KP‑OVA‑52 reacted with 1 of 20 ovarian cancer sera. These data suggest that the KP-OVA-52 can be considered a novel CT antigen that is regulated by DNA methylation.
