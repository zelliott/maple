The bICP0 protein encoded by bovine herpesvirus 1 stimulates productive infection and viral gene expression but inhibits interferon (IFN)-dependent transcription. bICP0 inhibits beta IFN (IFN-beta) promoter activity and induces degradation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Although bICP0 inhibits the trans-activation activity of IRF7, IRF7 protein levels are not reduced. In this study, we demonstrate that bICP0 is associated with IRF7. Furthermore, bICP0 inhibits the ability of IRF7 to trans-activate the IFN-beta promoter in the absence of IRF3 expression. The interaction between bICP0 and IRF7 correlates with reduced trans-activation of the IFN-beta promoter by IRF7.
