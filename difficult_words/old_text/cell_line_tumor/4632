Evaluation of the importance of C18/C19 stereochemistry of azinomycin A/B epoxyamide partial structures with respect to DNA alkylation sequence selectivity is reported using a unique assay with a DNA oligomer containing imbedded normal (5'-GGC-3'/3'-CCG-5') and inverted (5'-CGG-3'/3'-GCC-5') azinomycin consensus cross-linking sequences. Both species were found to have unique selectivity profiles and alkylate DNA in a manner distinct from azinomycin B. Computational docking experiments support altered binding modes for the enantiomers.
