Multidrug resistance is a major obstacle to successful treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Lately, we found a novel human gene named tongue cancer chemotherapy resistance-associated protein1 (TCRP1) in the tongue cancer multi-drug resistance cell line (Tca8113/PYM) established by us. In this study, we focus on recombinant expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of TCRP1. After molecular cloning and purification of the gene encoding the 24-kDa protein, a mouse polyclonal antibody against TCRP1 was prepared, and the specialty of the antibody was confirmed by Western blot. The cell proliferation was evaluated by MTS assay and DNA damage was determined by comet assay, the results indicated that this protein especially mediated the cell's resistance to cisplatin; it was associated with its role of providing protection against DNA damage. We also found that TCRP1 expression was increased in cisplatin-resistant carcinoma cell lines (Tca/PYM and A549/DDP), but not in cisplatin-sensitive MDR cell lines (MCF-7/5-Fu), compared with their parental counterparts by Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analysis showed TCRP1 is mainly expression in cytoplasmic, the Mann-Whitney U test exhibited that TCRP1 positive patients predicted the worst sensitive with cisplatin of OSCC patients. All these findings suggest that TCRP1 is a novel cisplatin-resistant protein which is mainly localized in the cytoplasm and can mediate cisplatin resistance against DNA damage; the expression level of TCRP1 in patients with OSCC may be useful as an indicator of therapeutic efficacy of the sensitivity to cisplatin.
