Electron microscopic study of changes in cultured cells caused by Vibrio cholerae recombinant hemagglutinin/protease (HA/P) showed significant structural changes, most pronounced in HeLa and L-929 cells not forming a compact monolayer with tight junctions between the cells: formation of numerous vesicles on the cell surface and clasmatosis, vacuolation of the cytoplasm, swelling of mitochondria, clarification of their matrix and crist distortions, and increase in the number of lysosomes. Cytoplasm vacuolation predominated in MDCK culture, while clasmatosis was less intense. Addition of HA/P to CaCo2 cells forming a differentiated polarized monolayer, led to extension of cell-cell spaces not impairing tight junctions, swelling of mitochondria, cytoplasm vacuolation, and clasmatosis on the apical surface. These changes virtually completely coincided with those caused by the so-called NMDCY factor (non-membrane-damaging cytotoxin), described as new Vibrio cholerae toxin. These findings confirm our previous hypothesis about the identity of these factors.
