Gallbladder carcinoma is a highly lethal and aggressive disease with early metastasis, strong invasion and poor prognosis. Most patients with this disease are at the advanced and un-resectable stage and should be considered for palliative treatment such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unfortunately, reports of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for gallbladder carcinoma are disappointing. We investigated the influence of norcantharidin (NCTD) on proliferation, proliferation-related gene proteins PCNA and Ki-67 of human gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells in vitro.

GBC-SD cell lines of human gallbladder carcinoma were cultured by the cell culture technique. The experiment was divided into NCTD group and control group. The tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay was used to evaluate cell growth. The streptavidin-biotin complex method was used to determine the expressions of proliferation-related gene proteins PCNA and Ki-67 of human gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells.

NCTD inhibited the growth and proliferation of GBC-SD cells from 10 mg/L or after 6 hours in a dose-and time-dependent manner, with the IC50 value of 56.18 microg/ml at 48 hours. After treatment with NCTD, the expression of PCNA (0.932+/-0.031 vs. 0.318+/-0.023,  p<0.001) and Ki-67 (0.964+/-0.092 vs. 0.297+/-0.018,  p<0.001) proteins were decreased significantly.

NCTD inhibits the proliferation of human gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells in vitro and the expression of their proliferation-related gene proteins PCNA and Ki-67.
