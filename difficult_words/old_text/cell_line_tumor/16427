A γ-AApeptide-based tracer for positron emission tomography imaging of integrin α(v)β(3) is reported. Despite its shorter sequence and linear nature, this tracer had comparable integrin α(v)β(3) binding affinity to the cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide but significantly higher resistance to enzymatic degradation and better stability.
