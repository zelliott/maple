Mycoplasma hyorhinis (M. hyorhinis) exerts multiple effects on cell metabolisms including apoptosis mediated by their endonucleases and nitric oxide production in vitro. Although AsA is preferable to health in general because of its reactive oxygen species scavenging activity, we found that in a human carcinoma cell line AZ-521 infected with M. hyorhinis, apoptosis was enhanced by addition of L-ascorbic acid (AsA) to the cell cultures. No significant differences were evident between the AZ-521 cells with and without AsA (AsA-) after 24 hr of incubation in the mitochondrial fluorescence. M. hyorhinis-infected AZ-521 cells treated with AsA (AsA +) have developed distinct DNA ladders as compared to the control cells AsA- after 24 hr of incubation. Marked cytopathic effects were rather apparent in AsA-treated cells than in control cells AsA- after 24 hr. Our data demonstrate that AsA addition to cell cultures enhances apoptosis induced by M. hyorhinis infection. We suggest that the presence of another external apoptotic pathway by M. hyorhinis infection.
