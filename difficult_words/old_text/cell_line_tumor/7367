A modified form of the cationic colloidal silica technique for plasma membrane isolation has been combined with SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics for evaluation as a proteomics strategy with human multiple myeloma cells and human breast cancer cells. On the basis of Western blots, half of the protein isolated is estimated to come from the plasma membrane. Forty-three percent of the 366 proteins identified by mass spectrometry had been previously classified as plasma membrane proteins. Thirty proteins previously categorized as hypothetical membrane proteins are now reported to be expressed.
