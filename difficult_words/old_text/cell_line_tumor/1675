Various approaches have been evaluated for generation of efficient immune response against tumor antigens. Our approach exploits usage of particulate delivery to generate immune response against prostate cancer antigens.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of prostate cancer vaccine derived from a murine prostate cancer cell line, TRAMP C2 in murine model via oral route using aleuria aurantia lectin as a targeting ligand for M-cells in the intestinal Peyer's patches.

The whole cell lysate (WCL) was obtained from TRAMP C2 murine prostate cancer cell line and was formulated into particles using one step spray drying process. For in vivo studies, 4-6 week old C57BL/6 male mice were vaccinated orally biweekly for 10 weeks. Serum samples were analyzed at regular intervals to determine serum IgG levels. The mice were then challenged with live TRAMP C2 cells to determine efficacy of the vaccine.

The serum IgG levels of vaccinated animals were higher compared to that of the controls. Moreover, the tumor growth was retarded significantly in the vaccinated mice compared to that of controls (p < 0.001).

The above findings suggest that oral particulate WCL vaccine can trigger an immune response against prostate cancer antigens.
