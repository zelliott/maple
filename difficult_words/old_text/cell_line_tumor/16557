Earlier we isolated and characterized human milk pro-apoptotic peptide - lactaptin and generated its engineered analog - RL2. It was shown that both lactaptin and RL2 are capable to induce apoptotic death of MCF-7 cells. In this report we have analyzed biochemical markers of RL2 induced MCF-7 apoptosis. The activation of initiator and effector caspases as well as mitochondrial membrane potential and cytoplasm membrane changes were analyzed using flow cytometry and Western-blot methods. We have found that RL2 induced apoptotic death of MCF-7 cells was accompanied by PS exposure on the plasma membrane surface. It also was shown that RL2 has induced dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and resulted in activation of initiator caspases 8, 9 and effector caspase 7.
