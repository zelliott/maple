A novel series of (S)-1-acryloyl-N-[4-(arylamino)-7-(alkoxy)quinazolin-6-yl]pyrrolidine-2-carboxamides were synthesized and evaluated as Her-1/Her-2 dual inhibitors. In contrast to the Her-1 selective inhibitors, our novel compounds are irreversible inhibitors of Her-1 and Her-2 tyrosine kinases with the potential to overcome clinically relevant, mutation-induced drug resistance. The selected compounds (19c, 19d) showed excellent EGFR inhibition activity even toward the T790M mutation of Her-1 tyrosine kinase with excellent selectivity. The excellent pharmacokinetic profiles of these compounds in rats and their robust in vivo efficacy in an A431 xenograft model clearly demonstrate that they merit further investigation as novel therapeutic agents for EGFR-targeting treatment of solid tumors, especially Her-1 selective inhibitor-resistant non-small cell lung cancer.
