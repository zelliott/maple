Translation initiation plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis, proliferation, differentiation and malignant transformation. Consistently, increasing the abundance of the eIF2-GTP-tRNA(i)(Met) translation initiation complex transforms normal cells and contributes to cancer initiation and the severity of some anemias. The chemical modifiers of the eIF2-GTP-tRNA(i)(Met) ternary complex are therefore invaluable tools for studying its role in the pathobiology of human disorders and for determining whether this complex can be pharmacologically targeted for therapeutic purposes. Using a cell-based assay, we identified N,N'-diarylureas as unique inhibitors of ternary complex accumulation. Direct functional-genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrated that the N,N'-diarylureas activate heme-regulated inhibitor kinase, thereby phosphorylating eIF2Î± and reducing the abundance of the ternary complex. Using tumor cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo as paradigms, we demonstrate that N,N'-diarylureas are potent and specific tools for studying the role of eIF2-GTP-tRNA(i)(Met) ternary complex in the pathobiology of human disorders.
