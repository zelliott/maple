A platform for specifically modulating kinase-dependent signaling using peptides derived from the catalytic domain of the kinase is presented. This technology, termed KinAce, utilizes the canonical structure of protein kinases. The targeted regions (subdomain V and subdomains IX and X) are analyzed and their sequence, three-dimensional structure, and involvement in protein-protein interaction are highlighted. Short myristoylated peptides were derived from the target regions of the tyrosine kinases c-Kit and Lyn and the serine/threonine kinases 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and Akt/protein kinase B (PKB). For each kinase an active designer peptide is shown to selectively inhibit the signaling of the kinase from which it is derived, and to inhibit cancer cell proliferation in the micromolar range. This technology emerges as an applicable tool for deriving sequence-based selective inhibitors for a broad range of protein kinases as hits that may be further developed into drugs. Moreover, it enables identification of novel kinase targets for selected therapeutic indications as demonstrated in the KinScreen application.
