While brain-dead organ donors represent the majority of the organ donor pool, it appears that graft survival is adversely affected by brain death itself. Brain death has been shown to cause severe disturbances in the hormonal, hemodynamic and immunological homeostasis, which could in part be responsible for the inferior outcome of organs originating from brain-dead donors compared to living donors. Hemodynamic effects of brain death lead to a wide fluctuation in mean perfusion pressures, blood flow to the organs and systemic oxygen consumption, altering regional perfusion. In addition, a wide array of immunological changes has been shown to occur after brain death contributing to organ injury and hemodynamic instability. Recent studies have shown that brain death upregulates multiple lymphocyte- and macrophage-derived cytokines and the injured brain itself may be the source of proinflammatory factors such as S100B. This increased inflammatory response seen during and immediately after brain death has also been associated with poor allograft function. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that the massive inflammatory response seen in brain-dead donors could also lead to increased immunogenicity and accelerated allograft rejection after transplantation. Hence, we hypothesize that nonspecific downregulation of this inflammatory response by hemoadsorption could potentially lead to improved donor organ and allograft function. As a 'proof of concept' we tested the ability of a novel hemoadsorbent to remove S100B in vitro using two human glioblastoma cell lines. Our results indicate a >80% reduction in S100B after 2 h of circulation with the sorbent.
