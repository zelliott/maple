Gliotoxin is a natural mycotoxin with immunosuppressive and antimicrobial activity. Inhibition of farnesyltransferase (IC50 80 microM) and geranylgeranyltransferase I (IC50 17 microM) stimulated interest in the potential antitumor activity of this epidithiodioxopiperazine. Gliotoxin inhibited proliferation of six breast cancer cell lines in culture with mean +/- SD IC50 289 +/- 328 microM (range 38-985 microM); intracellular farnesylation of Lamin B and geranylgeranylation of Rap1A were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In randomized controlled studies using the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea rat mammary carcinoma model, gliotoxin had pronounced antitumor activity in vitro and little systemic toxicity when administered to 10 animals at 10 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection weekly for 4 wk compared with 10 controls. Single doses up to 25 mg/kg were well tolerated. The present studies confirm that gliotoxin is a dual inhibitor of farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I with pronounced antitumor activity and favorable toxicity profile against breast cancer in vitro and in vivo.
