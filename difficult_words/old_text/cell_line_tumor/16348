We tried to explore the intrinsic differences in the optical properties of the four representative NPC cell lines on the models of radiobiology and metastasis by OCT. The scattering coefficients and anisotropies were extracted by fitting the average a-scan attenuation curves based on the multiple scatter effect. The values of scattering coefficients and anisotropy factors were 5.21 ± 0.11, 5.30 ± 0.09, 5.92 ± 0.21, 6.97 ± 0.22, and 0.892 ± 0.009, 0.886 ± 0.006, 0.884 ± 0.009, 0.86 ± 0.01 for CNE1, CNE2, 5-8F and 6-10B pellets (p < 0.05, P = 0.07 for CNE1 and CNE2), respectively. The results showed that the radiobiology and metastasis cell's model could be distinguished obviously; which implied that the corresponding types of NPC tissue might be potentially differentiated by OCT.
