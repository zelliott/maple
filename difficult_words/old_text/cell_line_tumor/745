R-etodolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, inhibits the progression of CWRSA6 androgen-independent and LuCaP-35 androgen-dependent prostate cancer xenograft growth through downregulation of cyclin D1 expression via the PPARgamma pathway. PPARgamma protein degradation, observed post-R-etodolac treatment, resulted from phospho-MAP kinase (p44/42) induction by R-etodolac negatively regulating PPARgamma function. Negative regulation of PPARgamma was overcome by a combination regimen of R-etodolac with the HER-kinase axis inhibitor, rhuMab 2C4, which demonstrated an additive antitumor effect. We further show that the inhibition of HER-kinase activity by rhuMab 2C4 is sufficient to inhibit PPARgamma protein degradation. This study introduces a novel concept of an in vivo crosstalk between the HER-kinase axis and PPARgamma pathways, ultimately leading to negative regulation of PPARgamma activity and tumor growth inhibition.
