Glial progenitors from the brain of normal adult Sprague-Dawley rats were compared to their initiated and malignant counterparts that were isolated from apparently normal brains of animals exposed to methylnitrosourea (MNU). Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A or -B induced differentiation of normal progenitors to a pro-astrocytic or oligodendrocytic morphology, respectively, whereas the combination of these factors resulted in their terminal differentiation to oligodendrocytes and senescence. In contrast, initiated progenitors did not exit the cell cycle when stimulated with PDGF and/or FGF-2. cDNA oligoarray analysis and RT-PCR verification showed an early upregulation/ induction of growth factor/receptors, PDGF-A, PDGFR-beta, IGFR-1, IGF-1 and -2, IL-6, MEGF-5, FRAG-1, IRS-2, HSPG, and FGFR-1, followed by a late increase in the expression IGFBP-6, PDGF-alpha, FGFR-4A, c/ERB-A, and FGFR-4, 2, and 1 during the tumorigenic progression. Western blot analyses demonstrated that MNU exposure caused progressive reduction of p21 protein levels, an increase of Rb phosphorylation, activation of AKT and CDK2, and upregulation of FGF receptors. Double immunofluorescence labeling showed progressive increase in nuclear colocalization of FGFR1, 2, and 4, which peaked in malignant lines. It is postulated that transition of normal rat glial progenitors to an initiated state is driven by IGF-1 and 2, IL-6, and the upregulation of the receptors PDGFR-beta and FGFR-1, 2, and 4. Deregulation of the cell cycle in this state involves reduction of p21 protein, concomitant upregulation of CDC2, and an increase in Rb phosphorylation that favors expression and nuclear translocation of FGFR-4 and FRAG-1 and 2. These events are associated with progressive activation of AKT and RAS. Malignant transformation is enhanced by near elimination of p21 and PC3, induction of AP-1 (upregulation of JUN-B, c-JUN, FRA-1), activation of the NF-kB pro-survival pathway, and inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-apoptotic pathway possibly in response to changes in the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) I-A and NGFI-B. These data demonstrate that the events leading to malignancy in the rat brain in response to MNU treatment are to a great extent similar to those described for secondary glial malignancies in humans.
