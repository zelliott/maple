The authors found in an earlier study that Phyllanthus amarus extract could significantly inhibit the solid and ascites tumor development in mice induced by Dalton's lymphoma ascites (DLA) cells. In the present study, the apoptotic effects of P. amarus against DLA cells in culture was evaluated. P. amarus produced significant reduction in cell viability as determined by the MTT assay. It also induces the formation of apoptotic bodies with characteristic features like plasma membrane invagination, elongation, fragmentation, and chromatin condensation. P. amarus at concentrations of 100 and 200 microg/mL is shown to induce DNA fragmentation. Gene expression analysis reveals that P. amarus induces the expression of caspase-3 and inhibits the expression of Bcl-2, which is an antiapoptotic protein. So the present study provides some insights into the possible mechanism by which P. amarus brings about apoptosis and growth inhibition in DLA cells.
