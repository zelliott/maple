Systematic work on differential protein expression in mitosis is limited, and we therefore used neuroblastoma cells (N1E-115) incubated with either colcemid or nocodazole to arrest mitosis. Proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS with subsequent quantification of spot volumes with specific software. Immunoblotting was used for verification of selected proteins. Levels of 10 individual proteins were increased and levels of 6 proteins were decreased concordantly by both treatments. These proteins were constituents of heat shock and chaperone, cytoskeleton, proteasomal, heterochromatin, and DNA replication signaling as well as housekeeping and metabolic systems. Identification of mitosis-dependent proteins is of importance for the interpretation of previous work and for designing future experiments.
