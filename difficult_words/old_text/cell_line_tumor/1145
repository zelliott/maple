The implication of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the major stages of cancer progression has fueled interest in the design of synthetic MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) as a novel anticancer therapy. Thus far, drugs used in clinical trials are broad-spectrum MMPIs the therapeutic index of which proved disappointingly low. The development of selective MMPIs for tumor progression-associated MMPs is, thus, likely to offer improved therapeutic possibilities.

The anti-invasive capacity of a series of pyrimidine-trione derivatives was tested in vitro in a chemoinvasion assay, and the most potent compound was further evaluated in vivo in different human tumor xenograft models. The activity of this novel selective MMPI was compared with BB-94, a broad-spectrum inhibitor.

Ro-28-2653, an inhibitor with high selectivity for MMP-2, MMP-9, and membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP, showed the highest anti-invasive activity in vitro. In vivo, Ro-28-2653 reduced the growth of tumors induced by the inoculation of different cell lines producing MMPs and inhibited the tumor-promoting effect of fibroblasts on breast adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, Ro-28-2653 reduced tumor vascularization and blocked angiogenesis in a rat aortic ring assay. In contrast, BB-94 up-regulated MMP-9 expression in tumor cells and promoted angiogenesis in the aortic ring assay.

Ro-28-2653, a selective and orally bioavailable MMPI with inhibitory activity against MMPs expressed by tumor and/or stromal cells, is a potent antitumor and antiangiogenic agent. In contrast to broad-spectrum inhibitors, the administration of Ro-28-2653 was not associated with the occurrence of adverse side effects that might hamper the therapeutic potential of these drugs.
