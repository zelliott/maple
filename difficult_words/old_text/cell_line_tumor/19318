Xanthohumol (X), isoxanthohumol (IX), 8-prenylnaringenin (8PN) and 6-prenylnaringenin (6PN), prenylflavonoids from hop (Humulus lupulus L.), were investigated for their cytotoxicity and the mechanism by which they exert cell death when incubated with prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU145. All compounds induced cell death in the absence of caspase-3 activation and typical apoptotic morphological features. The general pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk could not protect this form of cell death. In addition, the formation of vacuoles was observed in PC-3 cells treated with IX and 6PN, and in DU145 treated with IX, 8PN and 6PN, which could suggest the induction of autophagy and consequent cell death. The results indicate that hop-derived prenylflavanones (IX, 8PN, 6PN), but not prenylchalcones (X) induce a caspase-independent form of cell death, suggested to be autophagy. Therefore, IX, 8PN and 6PN appear to be promising candidates for further investigation in prostate anticancer therapy.
