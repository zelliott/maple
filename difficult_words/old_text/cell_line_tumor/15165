Identification of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes from additional tumor antigens is essential for the development of specific immunotherapy of malignant tumors. Neuritin, a recently discovered antigen overexpressed in astrocytoma, is considered to be a promising target for biological therapy. In the present study, we predicted and identified HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitopes from neuritin by using the following four-step procedure: (1) computer-based epitope prediction from the amino acid sequence of neuritin; (2) peptide-binding assay to determine the affinity of the predicted peptide with HLA-A2.1 molecule; (3) stimulation of primary T cell response against the predicted peptides in vitro; and (4) testing of the induced CTLs toward target cells expressing neuritin and HLA-A2.1. The results demonstrated that effectors induced by peptides of neuritin containing residues 13-21, 121-129 and 4-12 could specifically-secrete interferon-Î³ and lyse target cells. Our results indicate that these peptides are new HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL epitopes, and may serve as valuable tools for astrocytoma immunotherapy.
