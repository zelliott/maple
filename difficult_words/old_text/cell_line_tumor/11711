HER2 has become a solicitous therapeutic target in metastatic and clinical drug-resistant cancer. Here, we evaluated whether or not 1-benzyl-3-(5-hydroxymethyl-2-furyl)indazole (YC-1) and its furopyrazole and thienopyrazole analogues repress the expression of the HER2 protein. Among the test compounds, (1-benzyl-3-(p-hydroxymethylphenyl)-5-methylfuro[3,2-c]pyrazol) (CLC604), an isosteric analogue of YC-1, significantly suppressed the expression of HER2, and preferentially inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in HER2-overexpressing cancer cells. Our results revealed that CLC604 reduced HER2 expression through a post-transcriptional mechanism and involvement of proteasomal activity. CLC604 disrupted the association of 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) with HER2 resulting from the inhibition of Hsp90 ATPase activity. Moreover, we found that CLC604 significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of clinical drugs against HER2-overexpressing tumors and efficiently reduced HER2-induced drug resistance in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that CLC604 should be developed further as a novel antitumor drug candidate for the treatment of drug-resistant cancer.
