New small molecule inhibitors of HCV were discovered by screening a small library of indoline alkaloid-type compounds. An automated assay format was employed which allowed identification of dimerization inhibitors of core, the capsid protein of the virus. These compounds were subsequently shown to block production of infectious virus in hepatoma cells.
