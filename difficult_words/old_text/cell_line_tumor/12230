In an effort to identify new pharmacological inhibitors of disease-relevant protein kinases with increased potency and selectivity, we synthesized and evaluated new 5-substituted indirubins. The effects of 34 indirubin derivatives on CDK1/cyclin B, CDK5/p25, and GSK-3, as well as on SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell survival, were investigated.
