Procedure of the synthesis is described for new platinum(IV) drug LA-12 [(OC-6-43)-bis(acetato)(1-adamantylamine)amminedichloroplatinum(IV)]. The X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the structure is created by molecules with octahedral arrangement of ligands around a platinum atom and contains one H(2)O molecule that is not a part of the coordination sphere of platinum. This new drug is more reactive with glutathione than cisplatin and is lacking cross-resistance with cisplatin as proven on the panel of cancer cell lines.
