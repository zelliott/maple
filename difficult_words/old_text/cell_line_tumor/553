In resting human neuronal cells, nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is present in its native 160 kDa form in a quiescent state predominantly co-localized on the plasma membrane, via its PDZ (Psd-95/Discs-large/Zona Occludens) domain, with NMDA receptor (NMDA-R) and in tight association with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Following exposure of the cells to Ca(2+)-ionophore or to NMDA, nNOS undergoes proteolytic removal of the PDZ domain being converted into a fully active 130 kDa form. The newly generated nNO synthase form dissociates from NMDA-R and extensively diffuses into the cytosol in direct correlation with NO production. Intracellular redistribution and activation of nNOS are completely prevented in cells preloaded with calpain inhibitor-1, indicating that these processes are triggered by a concomitant activation of calpain. The role of calpain has been confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments revealing that also mu-calpain is specifically recruited into the NMDA-R-nNOS-HSP90 complex following calcium loading. Thus, the formation of clusters containing HSP90, mu-calpain, nNOS and NMDA-R represents the limiting step for the operation of the mechanism that links an efficient synthesis of NO to a local increase in Ca(2+) influx.
