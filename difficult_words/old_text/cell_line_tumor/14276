The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in prostate cancer.

We investigated the expression of RAS components in prostate cancer cells treated with hormonal agents. Real-time PCR data showed the expression of the AT1 receptor, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), and angiotensin I/II (Ang-I/II) precursor in all 87 prostate tissue samples.

Expression of these genes in hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) was significantly higher than that in normal prostate tissue and untreated prostate cancer tissue. Western blot showed that protein expression of the AT1 receptor and Ang-I/II was enhanced in LNCaP cells cultivated in steroid-free medium. When LNCaP cells were stimulated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol (E2), dexamethasone (DEX), or anti-androgen drugs, protein expression of the AT1 receptor and Ang-I/II was augmented.

The present data suggest that prostatic RAS is overexpressed in HRPC tissue, and expression of its components is influenced by several kinds of hormonal stimulation.
