It has been proposed that thioredoxin reductase (TR) is a mediator that allows non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to develop resistance to irradiation; however, little is known regarding the detailed mechanisms of action. Thus, ethaselen {1, 2-[bis (1,2-benzisoselenazolone-3 (2H)-ketone)] ethane, BBSKE}, a novel organoselenium TR inhibitor, is currently being investigated in a phase I clinical trial in China. However, its radiosensitizing effect remains unexplored. In this study, we found that the activity of TR increased dramatically in both A549 and H1299 cells after radiation, and moreover, could be inhibited by pretreatment with BBSKE (5 μmol/l). As a TR inhibitor, BBSKE enhanced the efficacy of radiation therapy both in vivo and in vitro without observable toxicity. BBSKE was found to suppress irradiation-induced NF-κB activation dramatically when using A549 cells stably transfected with NF-κB luciferase reporter. These results show the critical role of TR in the radioresistance of NSCLC and suggest that BBSKE is a potentially promising agent for the treatment of patients with NSCLC clinically.
