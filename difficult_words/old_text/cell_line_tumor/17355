AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was recently suggested to have a pro-apoptotic effect although its primary function is believed to mediate cellular adaptation to metabolic stresses. Here, we investigated the effect of the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-ribonucleoside (AICAR) on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis using mouse Neuro 2a neuroblastoma cells. H2O2-induced apoptosis was increased by AMPK activation, either with AICAR pretreatment or with overexpression of active AMPK. AICAR also induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation along with activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Correlation between NF-kappaB activation and the AICAR-enhanced apoptotic cell death was observed. In addition, NF-kappaB inhibitor SN50 prevented the augmented cell death by AICAR. Thus, our data suggest that NF-kappaB mediates the pro-apoptotic effect of AICAR.
