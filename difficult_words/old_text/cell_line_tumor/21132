Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a multifunctional, cytosolic protein deacetylase that primarily acts on alpha-tubulin. Here we report that stable knockdown of HDAC6 expression causes a decrease in the steady-state level of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, in A549 lung cancer cells. The decreased levels of in EGFR in HDAC6-knockdown cells, which correlated with increased acetylation of microtubules, were due to increased turnover of EGFR protein. Despite the decrease in EGFR levels, A549 cells lacking functional HDAC6 appeared to grow normally, probably due to increased expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2. Indeed, HDAC6-knockdown cells were more sensitive than control cells to the MEK inhibitor U0126. These results suggest that HDAC6 inhibitors combined with inhibitors of growth factor signaling may be useful as cancer therapy.
