To investigate the effect of triptolide on the proliferation and apoptosis of human epidermal squamous cell carcinoma cell line A431 in vitro.

Human epidermal squamous cell carcinoma cell line A431 was cultured. After the treatment with triptolide, the inhibition of cellular growth was determined by measuring MTT dye absorption of the living cells. Light microscope showed morphological changes. The cell cycle and apoptosis rate were assessed by flow cytometry.

Triptolide could significantly inhibit the proliferation of A431 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Triptolide could also cause cell morphological changes (the number of floating cells and nuclear pyknosis increase), induce cell apoptosis, and change the distribution of cell cycle phase in A431 cells. Compared with the control group, the G( 0) /G( 1) phase A431 cell rate increased and the rate of S phase cell decreased in TP-treated group. Cell cycles were obviously inhibited by triptolide in G( 0) /G( 1) phase ( both  p<0.05).

TP could play an anti-tumor role by effectively inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting the proliferation of A431 cells.
