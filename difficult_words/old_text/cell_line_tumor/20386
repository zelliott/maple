A series of 2',3'-bis-O-silylated or -acylated derivatives of lead compound 3a (2',3'-bis-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-5'-deoxy-5'-(N-methylcarbamoyl)amino-N(6)-(N-phenylcarbamoyl)adenosine) were prepared and evaluated for antiproliferative activity against a panel of murine and human cancer cell lines (L1210, FM3A, CEM, and HeLa). 2',3'-O-Silyl groups investigated included triethylsilyl (10a), tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (10b), and triisopropylsilyl (10c). 2',3'-O-Acyl groups investigated included acetyl (13a), benzoyl (13b), isobutyryl (13c), butanoyl (13d), pivaloyl (13e), hexanoyl (13f), octanoyl (13g), decanoyl (13h), and hexadecanoyl (13i). IC(50) values ranged from 3.0±0.3 to >200μg/mL, with no improvement relative to lead compound 3a. Derivative 10a was approximately equipotent to 3a, while compounds 13e-g were from three to fivefold less potent, and all other compounds were significantly much less active. A desilylated derivative (5'-deoxy-5'-(N-methylcarbamoyl)amino-N(6)-(N-phenylcarbamoyl)adenosine; 5) and several representative derivatives from each subgroup (10a-10c, 13a-13c) were screened for binding affinity for bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1b (BMPR1b). Only compound 5 showed appreciable affinity (K(d)=11.7±0.5μM), consistent with the inference that 3a may act as a prodrug depot form of the biologically active derivative 5. Docking studies (Surflex Dock, Sybyl X 1.3) for compounds 3a and 5 support this conclusion.
