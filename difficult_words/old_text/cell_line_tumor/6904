The polyene antibiotic amphotericin B (AMB) is an effective antifungal agent whose therapeutic potential is limited by poor aqueous solubility and toxicity toward host tissues. Addition of apolipoprotein A-I to a multilamellar phospholipid vesicle dispersion containing 20% (w/w) AMB induces the formation of reconstituted high density lipoprotein (rHDL), with solubilization of the antibiotic. Density gradient ultracentrifugation resulted in flotation of the complexes to a density of 1.16 g/ml, and negative stain electron microscopy revealed a population of disk-shaped particles. Native gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a particle diameter of approximately 8.5 nm. Absorbance spectroscopy provided evidence for AMB integration into the lipid milieu. AMB-rHDLs were potent inhibitors of Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth, yielding 90% growth inhibition at <1 microg/ml yeast culture. In studies with pathogenic fungal species, similar growth inhibition characteristics were observed. Compared with AMB-deoxycholate micelles, AMB-rHDL displayed greatly attenuated red blood cell hemolytic activity and decreased toxicity toward cultured hepatoma cells. In in vivo studies in immunocompetent mice, AMB-rHDLs were nontoxic at 10 mg/kg, and they showed efficacy in a mouse model of candidiasis at concentrations as low as 0.25 mg/kg. These results indicate that AMB-rHDLs constitute a novel formulation that effectively solubilizes the antibiotic and elicits strong in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity with no observed toxicity at therapeutic doses.
