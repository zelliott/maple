Water-dispersible Re(3+) doped CeF(3) colloidal nanocrystals with well controllable morphology and high crystallinity have been successfully synthesized through a solvothermal process. The TEM images illustrate that the Re(3+) doped CeF(3) nanocrystals are rectangular (or cubic) with a mean diameter of ~10 nm. The excellent dispersibility in some of the polar solvents including water is achieved by using polyethyleneimine as the capping agent. The amine groups of the polymer chains on one hand bind to the nanocrystal surface; on the other hand the free ones could link to functional materials including bio-molecules. The CeF(3) nanocrystals doped with Tb(3+) and Dy(3+) ions show the characteristic emission of Tb(3+ 5)D(4)-(7)F(J) (J = 6-3, with (5)D(4)-(7)F(5) green emission at 542 nm as the strongest one) and Dy(3+ 4)F(9/2)-(6)H(15/2) (blue-green color at 478 nm) and (4)F(9/2)-(6)H(13/2) (yellow color at 571 nm) transitions, respectively. The energy transfer from Ce(3+) to Tb(3+) and Dy(3+) was also investigated in detail. In vitro studies of Re(3+) doped CeF(3) colloidal nanocrystals on HepG2 cells confirm their excellent biological compatibility. The obtained solid CeF(3)â€‰: Tb(3+)/PDMS nanocomposites are very stable and flexible and exhibit strong green photoluminescence upon UV excitation.
