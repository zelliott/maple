The synthesis and evaluation of a group of 2,6-, 2,7- and 3,6-bis-aminoalkylamido acridones are reported, which show a similar level of activity against telomerase in vitro compared to their acridine counterparts. Computer modelling and calculations of relative binding energies suggest an equivalent binding mode to human intramolecular G-quadruplex DNA, but with significantly reduced affinity, as a result of the limited delocalisation of the acridone chromophore compared to the acridine system. Thermal melting studies on acridone and acridine quadruplex complexes using a FRET approach support these predictions. Long-term cell proliferation studies at sub-cytotoxic doses with two representative acridones using the SKOV3 cell line, show that neither compound produces growth arrest, in contrast with the effects produced by the tri-substituted acridine compound BRACO-19. It is concluded that telomerase inhibitory activity is a necessary though by itself insufficient property in order for cellular growth arrest to occur at sub-toxic concentrations, and that tight quadruplex binding is also required.
