Since head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) preferentially metastasizes to the locoregional lymphatics, treatment of the tumor-draining cervical lymph nodes is paramount.

We developed a hyaluronan-cisplatin (HA-Pt) nanoconjugate with prolonged lymphatic retention and greatly improved tumor tissue deposition for the treatment of metastatic HNSCC. We also developed an orthotopic metastatic xenograft model of HNSCC to examine the efficacy of the nanoconjugate. HNSCC (1/week x 3 weeks) were completely cured for 57% of the female mice in the HA-Pt treatment group, which demonstrated greatly hindered HNSCC progression compared with the standard cisplatin therapy (p < 0.05).

With this insight, we will be able to optimize the carriers for better uptake, penetration and retention within cancer cells.
