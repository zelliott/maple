A conjugate of antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AS ODN) covalently linked with deoxorubicin (DOX) was synthesized. Its properties and antitumour activity in human carcinoma DOX resistant cells (KB-A-1) were investigated in vitro. The results showed that the conjugate was strongly stable both in Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) and in culture medium. The intracellular concentration of the conjugate was higher than that of the AS DON by HPLC analysis. The conjugate showed potent dose-dependent inhibition to the growth of KB-A-1 cells. Chemosensitivity of KB-A-1 cells to DOX was also investigated in vitro. When the cells were first exposed to the conjugate (0.5 microM) and then exposed to DOX for 24 h, the IC50 value of DOX decreased from 21.5 to 2.2 microM. In contrast, when treated with the mixture of the same concentration of the AS ODN with equivalent DOX, the IC50 value of DOX was 16.8 microM. Intracellular DOX concentration was detected in KB-A-1 treatment with the conjugate in vitro by HPLC. The results showed that the intracellular DOX concentration was 6.4-fold increased in KB-A-1 cells treated with the conjugate compared to treatment with DOX alone. In contrast, 1.8-fold increasing was observed when treated with the AS ODN. Western blot analysis showed a significantly decrease in the amount of P-glycoprotein in KB-A-1 cells. These results suggest that the conjugate is effective in reversing multidrug resistance. Certainly, further studies are conducting to explore the antitumour effect of the conjugate in vivo.
