This work aimed to determine if the treatment outcomes of bladder cancer could be improved by targeting micelles that are decorated with bladder cancer-specific ligands on the surface and loaded with the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel.

Targeting efficacy and specificity was determined with cell lines. An in vivo targeting and anti-tumor efficacy study was conducted in mice carrying patient-derived xenografts.

Targeting micelles were more efficient than nontargeting micelles in delivering the drug load into bladder cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo (p < 0.05). The micelle formulation of paclitaxel was less toxic than free paclitaxel in Cremophor(Â®) (Sigma, MO, USA) and allowed administration of three-times the maximum tolerated dose without increasing the toxicity. Targeting micelles were more effective than the nontargeting micelles in controlling cancer growth (p = 0.0002) and prolonging overall survival (p = 0.002).

Targeting micelles loaded with paclitaxel offer strong potential for clinical applications in treating bladder cancer.
