Some colorectal cancers (CRC) display microsatellite instability (MSI) leading to mutations in genes such as MRE11. The aim of this study was to determine whether MSI or MRE11 mutational status correlates with sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor LT-626 and whether LT-626 synergizes with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents. CRC cells harboring biallelic MRE11 mutations were more sensitive to LT-626 and stable overexpression or knock-down of MRE11 in cell lines correlated with sensitivity. Synergism was evident between LT-626 and cisplatin, oxaliplatin and SN-38 suggesting that PARP inhibitors in combination with DNA damaging agents may be a successful strategy for treatment of CRC.
