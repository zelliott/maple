Selective messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling of transfected breast cancer gene expression in a living cell is demonstrated. Atomic force microscope (AFM) probe tips are structurally modified to create a dielectrophoretic force that attracts mRNA molecules within the cell nucleus. The tip end is chemically modified to hybridize only to the target mRNA from a pool of molecules within the nucleus. We successfully combined this scheme with standard assay techniques to develop an assay technology that can be used for early disease detection and basic studies in cell biology.
