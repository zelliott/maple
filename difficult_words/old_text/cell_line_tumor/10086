The effect of polystyrene surface polarity on the conformation of adsorbed fibronectin (FN) has been studied with atomic force microscopy. We demonstrated that bare sulfonated and nonsulfonated polystyrene surfaces featured similar topographies. After the FN adsorption, direct comparison of both types of substrata revealed drastically different topographies, roughness values, and also cell-adhesive properties. This was interpreted in terms of FN conformational changes induced by the surface polarity. At high-solute FN concentrations the multilayer FN adsorption took place resulting, for the sulfonated substratum, in an increase of surface roughness, whereas for the nonsulfonated one the roughness was approximately stable. Conversely, the FN conformation characteristic for the first saturative layer tended to be conserved in the consecutive layers, as evidenced by height histograms. The height of individual FN molecules indicated, consonantly with the derived thickness of the adsorbed protein layer (the latter value being 1.4 nm and 0.6 nm, respectively, for an unmodified and sulfonated polystyrene surface), that molecules are flattened on polar surfaces and more compact on nonsulfonated ones. It was also demonstrated that the FN adsorption and conformation on polymeric substrata, and hence the resultant cell-adhesive properties, depended on the chemistry of the original surface rather than on its topography. Our results also demonstrated the ability of surface polarity to influence the protein conformation and its associated biological activity.
