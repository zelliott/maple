Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in a wide variety of malignant cell lines, in contrast to normal cells, but with considerable heterogeneity in response. Death receptor-mediated apoptosis may be attenuated by a variety of different mechanisms, including phosphorylation-based signaling pathways. We have demonstrated that casein kinase I can attenuate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human cell lines derived from colon adenocarcinoma (HT29 and HCT8) and pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (JR1). Inhibition of casein kinase I (CKI) phosphorylation events in HT29, HCT8, and JR1 cells by CKI-7 dramatically increased apoptosis after exposure to TRAIL, in the absence of apoptosis induced by TRAIL treatment alone. CKI inhibition enhanced the recruitment of Fas-associated death domain and procaspase-8 to the death-inducing signaling complex after TRAIL treatment and enhanced cleavage of procaspase-8 at the death-inducing signaling complex. In HT29 cells studied further, rapid cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3, Bid, and the caspase substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase occurred when CKI-7 and TRAIL were combined. Overexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or mutant DN-Fas-associated death domain protected HT29 cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the presence of the CKI inhibitor. In addition, TRAIL combined with CKI-7 promoted the release of cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, HtrA2/Omi, and AIF from the mitochondria and down-regulated the expression of XIAP and c-IAP1. Small hairpin RNAs directed against CKI revealed that the CKIalpha isoform contributed significantly to the inhibition of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that CKIalpha plays an antiapoptotic role through the generation of phosphorylated sites at the level of the death-inducing signaling complex, thereby conferring resistance to caspase cleavage mediated by TRAIL.
