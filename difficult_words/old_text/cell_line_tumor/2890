15-Lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) is transcriptionally silenced in cancer cells, and its transcription reactivation (for example, through histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs)) restores apoptosis to cancer cells. However, the exact mechanism underlying 15-LOX-1 transcription reactivation in cancer cells is still undefined. Therefore, we evaluated the critical mechanisms required for 15-LOX-1 transcription reactivation in colon cancer cells. Specific HDAC1 and HDAC2 inhibition activated 15-LOX-1 transcription. 15-LOX-1 transcription was repressed through transcription repressor complex recruitment in the region of -120 to -391 of the 15-LOX-1 promoter. The nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) repression complex was recruited to this region. Depsipeptide significantly reduced the recruitment of NuRD key components (for example, metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) and HDAC1) to the 15-LOX-1 promoter before 15-LOX-1 transcriptional activation. Knock down of NuRD key components (for example, MTA1 and HDAC1) by small interfering RNA (siRNA) activated 15-LOX-1 transcription, as measured by luciferase reporter assays in stably transfected SW480 cells with the 15-LOX-1 promoter construct of the -391, but not the -120 region. Relative to expression in normal tissue, MTA1 expression in colorectal cancer mucosa from colorectal cancer patients was negatively related to 15-LOX-1 expression. Thus, our results show that NuRD contributes to 15-LOX-1 transcription suppression in colon cancer cells and that HDACIs can inhibit NuRD recruitment to a promoter to activate gene transcription, as in the case of 15-LOX-1.
