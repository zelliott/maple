Recently, we combined a retrovirus-mediated expression cloning with a simple screening method using non-adherent cells and panning [Anal. Biochem. 315 (2003) 138]. In this study, we applied this method to identify the antigen recognized by an uncharacterized monoclonal antibody raised against a feline cell line, and identified it as the feline homologue of CD63. This simple method is useful for characterizing unknown antibodies that recognize cell surface molecules. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody identified as an anti-feline CD63 antibody will be useful for studying feline molecular function(s).
