Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a prime target for antitumor therapies. The information obtained by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is combined with NMR data to provide a cross-validated atomic resolution model of the complementary interactions of heat shock protein 90 with a peptidic (shepherdin) and a non-peptidic (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside, AICAR) inhibitor, showing antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in multiple tumor cell lines. This approach highlights the relevant role of imidazolic moiety in the interaction of both antagonist molecules. In 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside bound state, one conformation of those present in solution is selected, where imidazolic, H4 and H5 protons have a key role in defining a non-polar region contacting heat shock protein 90 surface. The dynamic equilibrium between N-type and S-type puckered forms of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside moiety is shown to be functional to inhibitor binding. The first experimental structural data on these inhibitors are presented and discussed as hints for future design of improved molecules.
