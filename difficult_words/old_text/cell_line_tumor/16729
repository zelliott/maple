The use of herbal products as radiosensitizers is a promising approach to increase the efficacy of radiotherapy. However, adverse effects related to the use of herbal medicine on radiotherapy are not well characterized. The present study concerns the impact of Derris scandens Benth extract on the radiosensitivity of Hep-2 laryngeal cancer cells. Pretreatment with D. scandens extract prior to gamma irradiation significantly increased clonogenic survival and decreased the proportion of radiation-induced abnormal nuclei of Hep-2 cells. Furthermore, the extract was found to enhance radiation-induced G2/M phase arrest, induce Akt activation, and increase motility of Hep-2 cells. The study thus indicated that D. scandens extract potentiates radioresistance of Hep-2 cells, further demonstrating the importance of cellular background for the adverse effect of D. scandens extract on radiation response in a laryngeal cancer cell line.
