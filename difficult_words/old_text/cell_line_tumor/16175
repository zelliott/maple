Nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 (NOLC1) is a phosphoprotein that transiently associates with the mature nucleolar H/ACA and C/D box small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs). Several lines of evidence indicate that NOLC1 plays an important role in the synthesis of rRNA and the biosynthesis of ribosomes. In the present study, we examined the transcriptional regulation mechanisms that govern the expression of NOLC1. We first performed functional dissection of the NOLC1 promoter. We demonstrated that transcription factors NF-κB and CREB could bind to the minimal NOLC1 promoter. This was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutagenesis and overexpression assays revealed that NF-κB and CREB positively regulated the NOLC1 promoter. These findings may provide new insight into the mechanisms that regulate NOLC1 expression.
