In a series of 404 adult soft tissue sarcomas, analyzed by array-CGH, we have observed in approximately 10% of them a genomic amplification of either chromosome bands 11q22 or 3p12. These two amplicons likely target the YAP1 and VGLL3 genes, respectively. Both genes encode proteins that are cofactors of the TEAD family of transcription factors. Very good correlations between amplification and expression levels were observed. Welch test analyses of transcriptome data demonstrate that tumors with amplicons share a large set of upregulated and downregulated genes. Inhibition of YAP1 and VGLL3 in cell lines with these amplifications/overexpressions leads to similar phenotypes: decrease of proliferation rate, and to a lesser extent decrease of migration properties. These data, and the fact that these amplicons are observed either in de-differentiated liposarcomas or in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, suggest that these genetics events could be involved in oncogenesis and progression of soft tissue sarcomas.
