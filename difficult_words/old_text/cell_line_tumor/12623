Pyrroles and pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines were reported to act as potent anticancer agents, in this work, a series of novel 2-substituted-3-cyano-4-phenyl-pyrrole 5, 6, 11-18, and 5-phenyl-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives 7-10, 19-24 bearing either sulfathiazole or sulfapyridine were synthesized. The structures of these compounds were confirmed by elemental analysis, IR, (1)H NMR and mass spectral data. All the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity against liver and breast cancer cell line (HEPG2 and MCF7). Most of the screened compounds showed interesting cytotoxic activities compared with the used reference drug (doxorubicin). The radiosensitizing ability of some of the synthesized compounds was studied and the results showed an increase in the cell killing effect of Î³-radiation after combination with the tested compounds.
