Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women. To discover molecular targets that are applicable for development of novel breast cancer therapy, we previously did genome-wide expression profile analysis of 81 breast cancers and found dozens of genes that were highly and commonly up-regulated in breast cancer cells. Among them, we here focused on one gene that encodes PDZ-binding kinase/T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (PBK/TOPK), including a kinase domain. Northern blot analyses using mRNAs of normal human organs, breast cancer tissues, and cancer cell lines indicated this molecule to be a novel cancer/testis antigen. Reduction of PBK/TOPK expression by small interfering RNA resulted in significant suppression of cell growth probably due to dysfunction in the cytokinetic process. Immunocytochemical analysis with anti-PBK/TOPK antibody implicated a critical role of PBK/TOPK in an early step of mitosis. PBK/TOPK could phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser10 in vitro and in vivo, and mediated its growth-promoting effect through histone H3 modification. Because PBK/TOPK is the cancer/testis antigen and its kinase function is likely to be related to its oncogenic activity, we suggest PBK/TOPK to be a promising molecular target for breast cancer therapy.
