The methanolic extract of the whole plant of Cyperus longus originating in Egypt was found to show antiallergic effect on ear passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reactions in mice. By bioassay-guided separation, 11 stilbenes and stilbene dimers including a novel norstilbene dimer, longusone A, and three new stilbene dimers, longusols A, B, and C, were isolated. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence. Among the isolates, longusol B (IC(50)=96 µM), luteolin (3.0 µM), resveratrol (17 µM), piceatannol (24 µM), and cassigarols E (84 µM) and G (84 µM) were found to inhibit the release of β-hexosaminidase, as a marker of antigen-induced degranulations, in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. In addition, the methanolic extract and the constituents showed 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity (SC(50)=22 µg/ml and 2.8-29 µM, respectively).
