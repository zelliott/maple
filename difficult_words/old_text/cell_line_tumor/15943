Inhibition of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17β-HSD1) is a novel and attractive approach to reduce the local levels of the active estrogen 17β-estradiol in patients with estrogen-dependent diseases like breast cancer or endometriosis. With the aim of optimizing the biological profile of 17β-HSD1 inhibitors from the hydroxyphenylnaphthol class, structural optimizations were performed at the 1-position of the naphthalene by introduction of different heteroaromatic rings as well as substituted phenyl groups. In the latter class of compounds, which were synthesized applying Suzuki-cross coupling, the 3-methanesulfonamide 15 turned out to be a highly potent 17β-HSD1 inhibitor (IC(50) = 15 nM in a cell-free assay). It was also very active in the cellular assay (T47D cells, IC(50) = 71 nM) and selective toward 17β-HSD2 and the estrogen receptors α and β. It showed a good membrane permeation and metabolic stability and was orally available in the rat.
