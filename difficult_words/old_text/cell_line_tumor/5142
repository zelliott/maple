Previous studies indicate that green tea extract may inhibit breast cancer progression by blocking angiogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms are not well defined. We demonstrate that administration of Polyphenon E (Poly E), a standardized green tea extract, inhibited MDA-MB231 breast cancer and human dermal microvascular endothelial (HMVEC) cell migration and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). In addition, Poly E inhibited VEGF-induced neovascularization in vivo. We also demonstrate that Poly E blocked signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling by suppressing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced gene transcription via IFN-gamma-activating sequence (GAS) elements and downstream STAT3 activation by inhibiting STAT1 and STAT3 dimerization in MDA-MB231 cells. Transient expression of constitutively active STAT3 significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of Poly E on cell migration and VEGF and MMP9 expression. Taken together, these observations indicate that green tea extract inhibits angiogenesis partly through the disruption of STAT3-mediated transcription of genes, including VEGF.
