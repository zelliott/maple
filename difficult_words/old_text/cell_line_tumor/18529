Novel 1,4,6-trisubstituted pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines are reported with preliminary in vitro activity data indicating that several of them are potent inhibitors (better than the reference compound) of Src phosphorylation of the breast cancer cells 8701-BC, known to overexpress Src. The ability of such compounds to significantly reduce 8701-BC cell proliferation suggests that this scaffold could be a promising lead for the development of antitumoral agents able to block Src phosphorylation of breast cancer cells.
