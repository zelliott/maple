Odontogenic tumors occur within the jaw bones and may be derived from odontogenic epithelium or ectomesenchyme or contain active components of both tissue types. We investigated the gene expression profile of enamel matrix proteins (EMPs), genes related to osteogenesis, and the mineralization process in odontogenic tumor cell populations focusing on an ameloblastoma (AB-1), a keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT-1), and a calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor (CEOT-1). All cell populations were shown to be epithelial in origin by CK14 expression. All tested EMPs were expressed by all odontogenic tumor cell types, with higher transcript levels seen in the AB-1 population especially for AMEL, AMBN, and ODAM. CEOT-1 cell populations showed a greater content of ALP-positive cells as well as higher ALP mRNA levels. Using qRT-PCR, we found a higher expression of 8 genes in the CEOT-1 compared to the AB-1 and KCOT-1. In this study we demonstrated the establishment of AB-1, KCOT-1 and CEOT-1 cell populations. The unique gene expression profiles of AB-1, KCOT-1, and CEOT-1 cells and their interactions with the surrounding microenvironment may support their unique tumor development, progression, and survival.
