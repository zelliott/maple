Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system probably mediated by Th1 lymphocytes. IFN-beta is an established therapy for relapsing MS patients, although the mechanisms underlying its efficacy are yet to be well characterized. We determined IL-2 production, CD25 expression and T-cell proliferation from relapsing-remitting MS patients before and three months after starting therapy. A decrease in the percentage of CD80-induced IL-2-producing cells was observed after in vivo IFN-beta treatment. These data support that one of the immunomodulatory effects of IFN-beta treatment in MS may be a limitation of the autoimmune response modifying the CD80:CD28/CTLA-4 pathway.
