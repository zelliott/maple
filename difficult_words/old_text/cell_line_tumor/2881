Tumor cells have an invasive and metastatic phenotype that is the main cause of death for cancer patients. Tumor establishment and penetration consists of a series of complex processes involving multiple changes in gene expression. In this study, intraperitoneal administration of a high concentration of ascorbic acid inhibited tumor establishment and increased survival of BALB/C mice implanted with S-180 sarcoma cancer cells. To identify proteins involved in the ascorbic acid-mediated inhibition of tumor progression, changes in the liver proteome associated with ascorbic acid treatment of BALB/C mice implanted with S-180 were investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Eleven protein spots were identified whose expression was different between control and ascorbic acid treatment groups. In particular, Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) and annexin A5 expression were quantitatively up-regulated. The increase in RKIP protein level was detected in the tumor tissue and accompanied by an increase in mRNA level. Our results suggest a possibility that these proteins are related to the ascorbic acid-mediated suppression of tumor formation.
