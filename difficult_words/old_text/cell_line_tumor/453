In this Letter we report the synthesis and in vitro studies of cleavable polymer-drug conjugates derived from dendritic polyglycerol and maleimide-bearing prodrugs of doxorubicin and methotrexate that are cleaved by cathepsin B. Cleavage properties and cytotoxicity of the new conjugates are presented.
