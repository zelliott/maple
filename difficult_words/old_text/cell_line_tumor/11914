We used cDNA microarrays to examine the extent to which the expression of individual genes varies in mouse brain and in cultured N2A neuroblastoma cells mRNA extracted from sixC57B1/6J neonatal mouse brains and from four distinct cultures of N2A neuroblastoma cells was cross-hybridized with ten AECOM cDNA microarray chips to determine the individual gene expression variability. A mathematical algorithm reduced the effect of potential sources of variability not associated to the biological material by about 80%. The interval estimates of the standard deviation of individual gene expressionwere determined through chi-square statistics. The newly introduced relative expression variability, defined as the quotient of the middle of the interval estimate of the standard deviation and the mean expression ratio (and its inverse, gene transcription control), was used to rank the most unstably and the most stably transcribed genes. In brains of different animals and in separate cultures of N2A cells, unique sets ofgenes exhibited exceptional stability or were highly variable. Possible implications for such tight or loose transcriptional control are discussed.
