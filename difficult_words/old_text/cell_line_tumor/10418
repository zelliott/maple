KIT mutations may be associated with a poor prognosis in t(8;21) AML. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone frequently used by cancer cells to stabilize mutant oncoproteins. Inhibition of Hsp90 by 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) disrupted downstream signaling pathways of mutant KIT in Kasumi-1 cells. AML1-ETO fusion gene and mutated KIT act as "two-hit" factors in Kasumi-1 cells. Histone deacetylation (HDAC) inhibitors sodium phenylbutyrate (PB) and valproic acid (VPA) block AML1-ETO. Co-treatment with 17-AAG and PB or 17-AAG and VPA resulted in a synergistic effect in Kasumi-1 cells. Our results confirmed that Hsp90 and mutated KIT were valid molecular targets in the therapy of AML.
