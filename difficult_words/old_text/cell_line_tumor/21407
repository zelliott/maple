Ligand size and valency strongly influence the receptor uptake and clearance of tumor angiogenesis imaging agents. The structures of successful imaging agents exhibit a high degree of variability, encompassing small monovalent arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-containing peptides, multivalent RGD-oligomers, and a monoclonal antibody against integrin alpha-v-beta-3 (alpha-v-beta-3). We have pursued a nanoscale approach to imaging of angiogenesis using rationally designed polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers covalently adorned with RGD-cyclopeptides. An orthogonal oxime-ligation strategy was applied to chemoselectively effect conjugation of the PAMAM dendrimers with RGD-cyclopeptides for targeting alpha vbeta 3. Fluorescent dyes for optical imaging and chelates for gadolinium-based magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were subsequently appended to create robust multimodal macromolecular imaging agents. Fluorescence microscopy revealed selective binding of the resulting RGD peptide-bearing dendrimer with empty chelates to alpha-v-beta-3-expressing cells, but somewhat reduced selectivity was observed following Gd(III) complexation. The expected incomplete saturation of chelates with Gd(III) ions permitted radiometal complexation, and an in vivo tissue distribution of the resulting agent in M21 melanoma tumor-bearing mice showed mostly renal and reticuloendothelial accumulation, with the tumor:blood ratio peaking (3.30+/-0.03) at 2 h postinjection.
