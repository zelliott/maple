The objective of the current study was to investigate the regulation of VEGF signaling and tumor angiogenesis by gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT in glioblastoma. Effects of DAPT on VEGFR1, VEGFR2, endothelial cell proliferation and vessel function were evaluated using mouse microvascular endothelial H5V cell line and U87MG xenograft mouse models. We found that DAPT efficiently inhibited Notch signaling, increased VEGFR2 expression, but decreased VEGFR1 expression. DAPT treatment enhanced endothelial cell proliferation when used combined with VEGF, but exerted no effect if used alone. In U87MG xenograft mouse models, DAPT treatment increased tumor vessel density but compromised vessel function, as evidenced by poor perfusion and aggravated hypoxia. Therefore, DAPT treatment results in an uncoupling of tumor vessel density from vessel function and suppresses glioblastoma growth; disturbance of angiogenesis with DAPT presents a novel therapeutic approach for glioblastoma.
