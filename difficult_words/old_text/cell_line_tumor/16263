The idiotypes of B cell lymphomas represent tumor-specific antigens. T cell responses induced by idiotype vaccination in vivo are directed predominantly against CDR peptides, whereas in vitro T cells also recognize framework-derived epitopes. To investigate the mechanisms regulating the specificity of idiotype-specific T cells, BALB/c or B10.D2 mice were immunized with mature dendritic cells loaded with H-2K(d)-restricted peptides from influenza hemagglutinin, or from shared (J region) or unique (CDR3) structures of the A20 lymphoma idiotype. Antigen-specific T cells were induced in vivo by the CDR3 and influenza epitopes, but not by the J peptide. Gene expression profiling of splenic regulatory T cells revealed vaccination-induced Treg activation and proliferation. Treg activity involved J epitope-dependent IL-10 secretion and functional suppression of peptide-specific effector T cells. Vaccination-induced in vivo proliferation of transgenic hemagglutinin-specific T cells was suppressed by co-immunization with the J peptide and was restored in CD25-depleted animals. In conclusion, Treg induced by a shared idiotype epitope can systemically suppress T cell responses against idiotype-derived and immunodominant foreign epitopes in vivo. The results imply that tumor vaccines should avoid epitopes expressed by normal cells in the draining lymph node to achieve optimal anti-tumor efficacy.
