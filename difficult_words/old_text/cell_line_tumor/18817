Ten vulvar squamous cell carcinoma cell lines established at the University of Michigan (UM-SCV-1A, -1B, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7) and at the University of Turku (UT-SCV-1, -2, -3) were characterized by G-banding karyotyping, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) flow cytometry.

All cell lines had hyperdiploid DNA content as measured by flow cytometry. The DNA index (DI) remained relatively stable through different passages in 9 of 10 cases. DIs of UM-SCV-3 and UT-SCV-2 were near-diploid, as were the corresponding karyotypes. The 10 SCVs showed remarkable genetic similarities with respect to consistent chromosome rearrangements. Loss of 3p, noted in 8/10 SCVs, was narrowed to the smallest common region at 3p11-3p13. Loss of 8pter-p11 was observed in 10/10 cell lines. Loss of 11qter-q23 was present in UM-SCV-1 and -2, and in all four recently karyotyped SCVs. Other consistent losses include Xpter-p11 in 6/10, and 18qter-q11 in 7/10 cell lines. Common gains included gain of 8q in 8/10 and 3q in 6/10. Consistent copy number imbalances were confirmed by CGH; concerning loss of 3p, in 63%, to loss of 8p in 70%, to gain of 3q in 83%, and to gain of 8q in 75% of the cell lines.

CGH and karyotyping showed concordance in defining copy number imbalances, thus supporting the accuracy of CGH to detect chromosome imbalances in tumors that cannot be karyotyped.
