In the previous article we have reported that 3,4-dihydroquinazoline 1 is a potent and selective T-type calcium channel blocker that exhibited strong anti-cancer activity in vitro. Compound 1·2HCl was further in vivo evaluated against A549 xenograft in BALB/c nude mice, which exhibited 49% tumor-weight inhibition through intravenous administration of 2 mg/kg of body weight and was more potent than doxorubicin. Moreover, compound 1·2HCl has an oral bioavailability of 98% with LD(50) values of 693 mg/kg (p.o. route) and 40.0 mg/kg (i.v. route) of body weight. In addition, its efficient scale-up synthetic method was developed.
