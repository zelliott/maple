We examined hypoxia-induced changes in global thiol proteome profile in human prostate cancer cells using a BIAM-based display method. We analyzed the kinetics of protein thiol modification by using a pattern recognition algorithm, self-organizing maps (SOM) clustering, and identified the BIAM-labeled proteins by MALDI-TOF and ESI-tandem mass spectrometry. We found 99 out of 215 of total BIAM-labeled proteins were affected by hypoxia treatment and, yet, with diverse patterns and kinetics of redox modification. Our study proved that proteomics analysis employing the BIAM-labeling method can provide valuable information pertaining to global changes in the redox status of proteins in response to hypoxia.
