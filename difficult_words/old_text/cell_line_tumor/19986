Histone H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated to become γH2AX after exposure to DNA-damaging agents that cause double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). γH2AX can be detected and quantified by numerous methods, giving a direct correlation with the number of DSBs. This relationship has made γH2AX an increasingly utilised endpoint in multiple scientific fields since its discovery in 1998. Applications include its use in pre-clinical drug assessment, as a biomarker of DNA damage and in in vitro mechanistic studies. Here, we review current in vitro regulatory and non-regulatory genotoxicity assays proposing the γH2AX assay as a potential complement to the current test battery. Additionally, we evaluate the use of the γH2AX assay to measure DSBs in vitro in tobacco product testing.
