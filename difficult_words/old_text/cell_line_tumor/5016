Previous reports have demonstrated the suitability of adding different chemotherapeutic drugs to acrylic cement for the treatment of bone metastases. The best results so far have been obtained with methotrexate (MTX) for which diffusion from the implanted cement has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. In this study the suitability of adding MTX to acrylic cement as local adjuvant chemotherapy was investigated.

Using an in vitro model of human breast cancer cells we demonstrated that the drug is eluted in an active form able to exert a cytotoxic effect over a long period of time. The use of different concentrations of drug on the kinetic of elution and on the mechanical properties of cement was also evaluated.

The results obtained suggest that the release of MTX is higher at the beginning and progressively decreases over time being affected by the concentration of drug used. Our results also demonstrated that the addition and the subsequent elution of MTX does not alter the compressive properties of the cement.

These findings confirm the suitability of MTX-supplemented cement and support its use as an effective aid for the management of bone metastases requiring surgical curettage and acrylic cement implantation for structural support.
