A compound that can target cells expressing the estrogen receptor (ER), and produce predominantly 3-MeA adducts in those cells has been designed and synthesized. This compound produces mainly the 3-MeA adduct upon reaction with calf thymus DNA, and binds to the ER with a relative binding affinity of 51% (estradiol = 100%). The compound is toxic to ER-expressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and pre-treatment with the ER antagonist fulvestrant abrogates the toxicity. Pre-treatment of MCF-7 cells with netropsin, which inhibits N3-adenine methylation by the compound, resulted in a threefold decrease in the toxicity. These results demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy for producing 3-MeA adducts in targeted cells.
