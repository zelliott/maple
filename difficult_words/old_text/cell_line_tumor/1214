2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME) is an endogenous estradiol metabolite, which acts antiproliferative in various tumor cell lines independent of the hormone receptor status. We investigated whether combinations of 2ME with various chemotherapeutic or endocrine compounds may result in an additive effect on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells. The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (receptor-positive), BM (receptor-negative) and a MCF-7 line transfected with the aromatase gene were used. All cell lines were incubated in the concentration range of 0.8 microM to 25 microM with 2ME alone and in equimolar combinations with the following compounds: epirubicine, daunorubicine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil, mafosfamide and 4-OH tamoxifen. The effect of letrozole and 2ME alone and in equimolar combinations was tested in the concentration range of 0.6 to 1 microM. Proliferation was measured after 4 days using the ATP-chemosensitivity test. In MCF-7 cells 2ME in combination with 4OH-tamoxifen, epirubicine, docetaxel, 5-fluoprouracil, mafosfamide and carboplatin led to an additive effect. In BM cells only 2ME combined with 4OH-tamoxifen, daunorubicine and mafosfamide showed an additive action. Both letrozole and 2ME were nearly similar effective in inhibition of the aromatase gene. Here no additive effect was found. 2ME displayed antiproliferative actions in various human breast cancer cells. In addition 2ME was able to increase the antiproliferative property of certain antihormones and cytostatic substances. Furthermore 2ME exhibits a similar property as compared to letrozole in inhibiting the aromatase activity. Since 2ME was well tolerated in a recently conducted phase II trial in patients with refractory metastatic breast cancer, the combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics or antihormones may offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen.
