We investigate the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the control of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cell proliferation by a PKC inhibitor, Enzastaurin, in human MTC primary cultures and in the TT cell line. We found that PKC inhibition reduces cell proliferation by inducing caspase-mediated apoptosis and blocks the stimulatory effect of IGF-I on calcitonin secretion. Enzastaurin reduces PKCβII (Thr500) phosphorylation, indicating a direct involvement of this isoform as well as the phosphorylated levels of Akt (Ser 473) and glycogen synthase kinase (Ser9), PKC pathway downstream targets and pharmacodynamic markers for PKC inhibition. PKCβII and PKCδ enzyme isoforms expression and localization were investigated. These data indicate that in vitro PKC is involved in the control of human MTC proliferation and survival by modulating apoptosis, with a mechanism that implicates PKCβII inhibition and translocation in different subcellular compartments. Targeting PKC may represent a useful therapeutic approach for controlling MTC proliferation.
