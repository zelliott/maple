The effects of organophosphate pesticides on human placenta remain poorly investigated although an increased risk of pregnancy alterations has been reported in women chronically exposed to these pesticides. Here, we have addressed whether chlorpyrifos (CPF) modifies the expression of genes relevant for placental function. Human placental JEG-3 cells were exposed to increasing CPF concentrations up to 100 μM for 24 and 48 h and cell viability, mRNA, protein and hormone levels were analyzed. Quantitative RT-PCR assays revealed that CPF increased the expression of ABCG2, GCM1 and, even more significantly, βhCG mRNAs in conditions where cell viability and morphology were not compromised. In addition, βhCG protein synthesis and secretion were time-dependently augmented. Present results may reflect a CPF nocive effect on placenta cells or a placental-defense mechanism to preserve its function. These novel CPF trophoblast target genes should be considered in future studies of pregnancy outcomes associated with in vivo exposures.
