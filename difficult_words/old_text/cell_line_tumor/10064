Identification of antibodies against high-prevalence Scianna (Sc; ERMAP) antigens, like Sc1 and Sc5, is difficult and may incur delays in blood procurement and costs. The detection of additional clinically significant alloantibodies is hampered in the presence of anti-Scianna. Soluble recombinant Scianna protein is demonstrated to facilitate antibody diagnostics in both cases.

Soluble recombinant Scianna protein (Sc:1,-2,3,-4,5,6,7) was produced comprising the antigenic extracellular domain fused to a V5-His tag. The protein was isolated from eukaryotic cell culture supernatants of stably transfected HEK293 cells. Seven serum samples with anti-Sc1, anti-Sc2, and anti-Sc5 and 30 serum samples with antibodies to other blood group antigens were evaluated in hemagglutination inhibition assays. Antisera with mixed antibody specificities and autoantibodies were also tested.

Soluble Scianna protein inhibited specifically antibodies to the high-prevalence Scianna antigens Sc1 and Sc5. No antibodies were neutralized that were directed to the low-prevalence Sc2 antigen or to a large representative set of antigens from other blood group systems. Clinically relevant antibodies could be identified despite being masked by anti-Sc1 and anti-Sc5. A mixture of Scianna and JMH proteins allowed detecting a common antibody despite the presence of antibodies to high-prevalence antigens of the Scianna or JMH blood group systems.

Antibody detection systems comprising soluble recombinant Scianna protein provide an easy single-step method for detection and identification of antibodies to high-prevalence Scianna antigens. Reagents with Scianna and other recombinant blood group proteins and mixtures of such proteins would be useful routine reagents in immunohematology.
