Reliable prediction of the chance of a successful treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma by cytostatics and targeting therapies would be very valuable, since HNSCC due to their heterogenic biology mostly respond non-uniformly and moreover with low response rates. To raise the prospect of chemotherapy by using multimodal therapies usually goes hand in hand with a higher incidence of severe adverse events and acute toxicity but also chemo-associated increased cancer risk following successful treatment. In addition, the increasing numbers of treatment options without availability of reliable prognostic biomarkers for a probably successful outcome make the decision for one or the other medication to something rather like gambling. Therefore, quite early a pre-therapeutic predictive exvivo chemoresponse testing of bioptic specimens was intended. However, the results gained mostly were disillusioning and allowed not for reliable prediction of chance of successful outcome of treatment with tolerable doses of the pharmaceuticals and in particular their combinations. Predictive testing, hence, was belittled as improper for the clinical context. Based on advanced methods, some working groups reassume this subject. This review describes recent advances in ex-vivo chemoresponse testing, discusses pre-requisites which have to be fulfilled before their inclusion into decision-making, and outlines why ex-vivo chemoresponse testing probably is not an old hat.
