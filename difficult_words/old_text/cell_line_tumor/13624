It has recently been suggested that, in addition to genetic and environmental factors and tobacco exposure, estrogens also may be an independent risk factor in the development of lung cancer. Therefore, we evaluated the transcript and protein levels of 17-beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD17B1), and the conversion of estrone (E1) to 17-beta-estradiol (E2) in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Calu-6, Calu-1 and A549 cells. In our work, we established the presence of HSD17B1 transcripts and proteins in all examined NSCLC cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that human NSCLC Calu-6, Calu-1 and A549 cells are able to convert weak estrogen E1 to highly potent E2 in vitro. Our results indicate that NSCLC cells are able to produce E2 from E1.
