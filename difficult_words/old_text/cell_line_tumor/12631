Complexes of the type trans-[PdX(2)(isn)(2)] {X = Cl (1), N(3) (2), SCN (3), NCO (4); isn = isonicotinamide} were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antimycobacterial and antitumor activities. The coordination mode of the isonicotinamide and the pseudohalide ligands was inferred by IR spectroscopy. Single crystal X-ray diffraction determination on 2 showed that coordination geometry around Pd(II) is nearly square planar, with the ligands in a trans configuration. All the compounds demonstrated better in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis than isonicotinamide and pyrazinamide. Among the complexes, compound 2 was found to be the most active with MIC of 35.89 Î¼M. Complexes 1-4 were also screened for their in vitro antitumor activity towards LM3 and LP07 murine cancer cell lines.
