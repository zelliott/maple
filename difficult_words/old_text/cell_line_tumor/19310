To study expression of the zinc finger transcriptional factor Snail in colorectal carcinoma and its significance.

Expressions of Snail in colorectal carcinoma SW480 and SW620 cells were assayed by immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescent cytochemistry. The paraffin-embedded specimens from 68 cases of colorectal carcinoma and its corresponding adjacent tissues, 33 cases of adenoma and 35 cases of metastatic lymph nodes were also examined for Snail expressions using immunohistochemistry.

Snail protein was located mainly in the cell nucleus of SW480 and SW620 cells. The expressions of PRL-3 protein in the specimens of colorectal carcinoma, normal mucosa, adenoma and metastatic lymph nodes were significantly different (Chi(2)=92.852, P=0.000). In the adenoma tissues, the expression was significantly higher than that in normal mucosa (Z=-2.902, P=0.004), the metastatic lymphnodes had significantly higher expressions than the primary colorectal carcinomas (Z=-4.951, P=0.000), which, in turn, showed significantly higher expression than the adenoma tissues (Z=-3.572, P=0.000). Significant correlation of Snail expression was found to the progression and metastasis of colorectal carcinoma (Z=-2.043, P=0.041).

The expression of Snail is significantly correlated to genesis, progression and metastasis of colorectal carcinoma.
