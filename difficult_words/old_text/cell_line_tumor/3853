In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, acquired resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) can occur through a generation of bypass signals such as MET or AXL activation. In this study, we investigated the antitumor activity of NPS-1034, a newly developed drug that targets both MET and AXL, in NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib (HCC827/GR and HCC827/ER, respectively). Characterization of H820 cells and evaluation of NPS-1034 efficacy in these cells were also performed. The resistance of HCC827/GR was mediated by MET activation, whereas AXL activation led to resistance in HCC827/ER. The combination of gefitinib or erlotinib with NPS-1034 synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in both resistant cell lines. Accordingly, suppression of Akt was noted only in the presence of treatment with both drugs. NPS-1034 was also effective in xenograft mouse models of HCC827/GR. Although the H820 cell line was reported previously to have T790M and MET amplification, we discovered that AXL was also activated in this cell line. There were no antitumor effects of siRNA or inhibitors specific for EGFR or MET, whereas combined treatment with AXL siRNA or NPS-1034 and EGFR-TKIs controlled H820 cells, suggesting that AXL is the main signal responsible for resistance. In addition, NPS-1034 inhibited cell proliferation as well as ROS1 activity in HCC78 cells with ROS1 rearrangement. Our results establish the efficacy of NPS-1034 in NSCLC cells rendered resistant to EGFR-TKIs because of MET or AXL activation or ROS1 rearrangement.
