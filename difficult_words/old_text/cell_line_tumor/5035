The protein cage of a plant virus may provide a template for monodispersed nanosized systems for drug delivery. Using the Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (HCRSV) as a model plant virus, we have prepared nanosized protein cages (30 nm) capable of encapsulating the anticancer drug, doxorubicin. The technique utilized the simultaneous encapsulation of a polyprotic acid of mw 200 kDa to produce an encapsulation efficiency for doxorubicin of about 7.5%. Folic acid was conjugated onto the capsids to impart cancer-targeting capability. The resultant nanosized systems improved the uptake and cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in the ovarian cancer cells, OVCAR-3, with statistical significance. Plant virus capsids may therefore provide viable templates for targeted drug delivery in cancer chemotherapy.
