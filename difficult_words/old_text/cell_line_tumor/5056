A novel class of 2,3,4-triarylbenzopyrans has been synthesized and were evaluated for their selective estrogen receptor modulation activity and as a therapeutic agent for breast cancer. Among the compounds synthesized, compounds 11a and 12c exhibited 73.91% and 69.24% inhibition as estrogen antagonistic activity, respectively. Compound 12a showed the lowest IC(50) at 6.97 microM against MCF-7 and 11f showed the lowest IC(50) value of 5.6 microM against MDA-MB-231 cell line in spite of their low receptor binding affinity implicating these compounds probably act through ER independent mechanism.
