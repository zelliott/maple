Human neutrophil peptides (HNP1-3), small molecular antimicrobial peptides, are expressed within tumors and associated with tumor necrosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. Recent investigations have suggested that HNP1-3 are likely to be involved in the host immune responses to tumors.

We used recombinant pSec-HNP1, which expresses a secretable form of HNP1, to obtain expression of HNP1 in the tumor milieu in immunocompetent mice to explore the possible roles of HNP1 in tumor immunity. The antitumor effects were investigated in established CT26 colon cancer and 4T1 breast cancer models.

HNP1-mediated chemotactic and activating effects on immature dendritic cells were detected both in vitro and in vivo. Intratumoral expression of HNP1 resulted in not only significant tumor growth inhibition but also increased CTL infiltration within tumors. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes and a (51)Cr release assay revealed specific cellular immune responses. Furthermore, increased antibodies were also found in sera from pSec-HNP1-treated mice supporting specific humoral immune responses. Increased apoptosis and decreased angiogenesis were also shown in treated tumors.

These findings indicate that HNP1 can exert multiple antitumor effects through different mechanisms; more importantly, HNP1 mediates host immune responses to tumors in situ through the recruitment and subsequent activation of immature dendritic cells and thus shows promising potential in cancer therapy.
