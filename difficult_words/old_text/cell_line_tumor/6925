We synthesized a diverse series of 9H-isothiazolo[5,4-b]quinoline-3,4-diones containing heteroaromatic groups at the 7-position via palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling. Many of these compounds demonstrated potent antistaphylococcal activity (MICs 2 microg/mL) against a multi-drug-resistant strain (ATCC 700699) and low cytotoxic activity (CC(50)>100 microM) against the human cell line Hep2 (laryngeal carcinoma).
