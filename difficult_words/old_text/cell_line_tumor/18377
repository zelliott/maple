We report the synthesis of new guanylhydrazones from imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles and of a bis-guanylhydrazone from diimidazo[1,2-a:1,2-c]pyrimidine. The compounds were tested as potential antitumor agents at the National Cancer Institute. Two derivatives are now under review by BEC: one of these was also subjected to a test for positive inotropic activity in view of a possible coanthracyclinic activity. Tyrosine kinase receptors may be involved as molecular targets in the mechanism of action of the guanylhydrazones described.
