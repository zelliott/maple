MiR-155 is known to participate in various cellular processes by targeting gene expression. We previously revealed a link between miR-155 and perturbation of trophoblast invasion and differentiation. This study aimed to investigate the target molecule(s) of miR-155 on the influence on the proliferation and migration of trophoblast cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed that, at the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of cyclin D1, six bases are complementary to the seed region of miR-155. Luciferase assays and cyclin D1 3'UTR transfection assays validated that cyclin D1 3'UTR was the target of miR-155 in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Overexpression of miR-155 in HTR-8/SVneo cells reduced the level of cyclin D1 protein, decreased cell proliferation and invasion, and increased cell number at the G1 stage. Furthermore, the increased expression of miR-155 also regulated the protein levels of kinase inhibitory protein p27 and phosphorylated cytoskeletal protein filamin A. In conclusion, we found that cyclin D1 may be a target of miR-155 in HTR-8/SVneo cells, and demonstrated a negative regulatory role of miR-155 involved in cyclin D1/p27 pathway in proliferation and migration of the cells.
