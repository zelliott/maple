Melanin is a dark pigment protecting the skin against UV radiation in some organisms. Studies on invasion and metastasis using retinoic acid as inhibitor agent are well known, but its role in melanin production (melanogenesis), especially at ultrastructural level and using morphometry were not well studied. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of retinoic acid on the melanosomes in B16F10 melanoma cells. These organelles were identified and quantified using routine electron microscopy and the specific HMB45 antibody. Other approaches such as immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry were also used. Our results indicated that retinoic acid increased the melanogenesis process in B16F10 melanoma cells. Furthermore, this work also provided evidence that this substance interferes at the subcellular level altering the numerical density of melanosomes, as well as the relative volume of the nucleus and nucleolus. In addition, the cells displayed altered morphology and an increase in the percentage of the relative volume of melanosomes, mainly the stages II-III and IV, leading to melanin formation. Furthermore, a decrease in the cells number after retinoic acid treatment was also observed.
