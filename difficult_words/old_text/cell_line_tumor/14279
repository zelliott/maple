Gene regulated in breast cancer 1 (GREB1) is a novel estrogen-regulated gene shown to play a pivotal role in hormone-stimulated breast cancer growth. GREB1 is expressed in the prostate and its putative promoter contains potential androgen receptor (AR) response elements.

We investigated the effects of androgens on GREB1 expression and its role in androgen-dependent prostate cancer growth.

Real-time PCR demonstrated high level GREB1 expression in benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), localized prostate cancer (L-PCa), and hormone refractory prostate cancer (HR-PCa). Androgen treatment of AR-positive prostate cancer cells induced dose-dependent GREB1 expression, which was blocked by anti-androgens. AR binding to the GREB1 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Suppression of GREB1 by RNA interference blocked androgen-stimulated LNCaP cell proliferation.

GREB1 is expressed in proliferating prostatic tissue and prostate cancer, is regulated by androgens, and suppression of GREB1 blocks androgen-induced growth suggesting GREB1 may be critically involved in prostate cancer proliferation.
