A series of cyclophosphazene crown ether derivatives bearing aziridinyl (ethylene imine) units and also 2-naphthyl or anthraquinone groups as co-substituents has been synthesized and their cytostatic activity against the panel of eight cancer cells in vitro has been studied. The substituents used exhibit different activities: alkylation (aziridinyl groups) and intercalation (naphtyl, anthraquinone groups) against DNA. These both interactions are supposed to enhance the efficiency of the cyclophosphazene crown ether derivatives studied as cytotoxic agents.
