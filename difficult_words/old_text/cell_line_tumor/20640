The aim of this study was to evaluate whether apoptosis-resistant cancer cells have cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties.

Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells were incubated in the presence of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for 24 h, and further incubated without 5-FU for 28 days. To assess the capacity of self-renewal, surviving cells were planted for sphere-forming assay. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was induced with TGF-Î², then mRNA expression was evaluated by real-time PCR for E-cadherin, SNAIL, and vimentin. The E-Cadherin protein levels were also examined by immunoblot analysis. The Local invasion ability was analyzed by Matrigel invasion assay.

The frequency of cells that were capable of initiating spheres was higher in 5-FU-pre treated cells, which also overexpressed stem cell marker genes, OCT4 and NANOG. Matrigel invasion activity of apoptosis-resistant Panc-1 cells was greater than that of control Panc-1 cells.

Apoptosis-resistant cancer cells have CSC-like properties, i.e., able to initiate sphere formation, express stem cell genes, and respond to EMT stimulation.
