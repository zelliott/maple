Nuclear factor (NF)-κB is the key transcription factor involved in the inflammatory             responses, and its activation aggravates tumors. Peptidoglycan (PGN), a main cell             wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, stimulates Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2)             and activates a number of inflammatory pathways, including NF-κB. Cannabinoids             have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects. The mechanisms             underlying these actions, however, are largely unknown. The purpose of this study             was to investigate whether cannabinoids can suppress the PGN-induced activation             of NF-κB and cell growth via cannabinoid receptors in U87MG human malignant glioma             cells. PGN treatment induced the phosphorylation of NF-κB and cell proliferation             in a concentration-dependent manner. The main endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol,             prevented the PGN-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB, which was reversed by the             CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist, AM281. The synthetic cannabinoid, WIN55,212-2,             abolished the PGN-activated cell growth, and this effect was reversed by AM281.             The preferential expression of CB1 rather than CB2 receptors in these cells was             confirmed by reverse transcription-mediated polymerase chain reaction experiments             and the observation that the WIN55,212-2-induced morphological changes were completely             reversed by AM281 but not by the CB2 antagonist, AM630. Our finding that cannabinoids             suppress the NF-κB inflammatory pathway and cell growth via CB1 receptors in glioma             cells provides evidence for the therapeutic potential of targeting cannabinoid             receptors for the treatment of inflammation-dependent tumor progression.
