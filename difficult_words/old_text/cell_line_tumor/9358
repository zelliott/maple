The chemical constituents research of the fermentation of Penicillium thomi separated from the root of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza led to the isolation of a new compound, 4',5-dihydroxy-2,3-dimethoxy-4-(hydroxypropyl)-biphenyl (1) and 11 known compounds. The structures of isolated compounds were determined by spectroscopic and chemical analysis. Their cytotoxic effects against three human cancer cell lines (A549, HepG2 and HT29) were also investigated.
