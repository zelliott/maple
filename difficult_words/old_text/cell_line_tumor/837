This article describes the production and characterization of cationic submicron particles constituted with Eudragit RS 100, plus different cationic surfactants, such as dioctadecyl-dimethyl-ammonium bromide (DDAB18) and diisobutylphenoxyethyl-dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride (DEBDA), as a transport and delivery system for DNA/DNA and DNA/peptide nucleic acid (PNA) hybrids and PNA-DNA chimeras. Submicron particles could offer advantages over other delivery systems because they maintain unaltered physicochemical properties for long time periods, allowing long-term storage, and are suitable for industrial production. Submicron particles were characterized in terms of size, size distribution, morphology, and zeta potential. Moreover, the in vitro activity and ability of submicron particles to complex different types of nucleic acids were described. Finally, the ability of submicron particles to deliver functional genes to cells cultured in vitro was determined by a luciferase activity assay, demonstrating that submicron particles possess superior transfection efficiency with respect to commercially available, liposome-based transfection kits.
