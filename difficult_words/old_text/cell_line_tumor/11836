Like many solid tumors, glioblastomas are characterized by intratumoral biologic heterogeneity that may contribute to a variable distribution of drugs and their associated pharmacodynamic responses, such that the standard pharmacokinetic approaches based on analysis of whole-tumor homogenates may be inaccurate. To address this aspect of tumor pharmacology, we analyzed intratumoral pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics of the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib in mice with intracerebral tumors and developed corresponding mathematical models. Following a single oral dose of gefitinib (50 or 150 mg/kg), tumors were processed at selected times according to a novel brain tumor sectioning protocol that generated serial samples to measure gefitinib concentrations, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), and immunohistochemistry in 4 different regions of tumors. Notably, we observed up to 3-fold variations in intratumoral concentrations of gefitinib, but only up to half this variability in pERK levels. As we observed a similar degree of variation in the immunohistochemical index termed the microvessel pericyte index (MPI), a measure of permeability in the blood-brain barrier, we used MPI in a hybrid physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to account for regional changes in drug distribution that were observed. Subsequently, the PBPK models were linked to a pharmacodynamic model that could account for the variability observed in pERK levels. Together, our tumor sectioning protocol enabled integration of the intratumoral pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variability of gefitinib and immunohistochemical indices followed by the construction of a predictive PBPK/pharmacodynamic model. These types of models offer a mechanistic basis to understand tumor heterogeneity as it impacts the activity of anticancer drugs.
