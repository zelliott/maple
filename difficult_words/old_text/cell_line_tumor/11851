CXC chemokine receptor 4 was found to be expressed by many different types of human cancers and its expression has been correlated with tumor aggressiveness, poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. However the effect of CXCR4 on the esophageal carcinoma cells remains unclear, the present study explored the effects of CXCR4 siRNA on proliferation and invasion of esophageal carcinoma KYSE-150 and TE-13 cells. Two siRNA sequence targeting CXCR4 gene were constructed and then were transfected into KYSE-150 and TE-13 cells by Lipofectamineâ„¢2000. Changes of CXCR4 mRNA and protein were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Effect of CXCR4 siRNA on KYSE-150 and TE-13 cells proliferation was determined by MTT. Transwell invasion assay was used to evaluate the invasion and metastasis of KYSE-150 and TE-13 cells. Tumor growth was assessed by subcutaneous inoculation of cells into BALB/c nude mice. qRT-PCR and Western blot demonstrate that the expression level of CXCR4 gene were obviously decreased in KYSE-150 and TE-13 cells transfected with CXCR4 targeting siRNA expression vectors. The average amount of cells transfected with CXCR4 siRNA penetrating Matrigel was significantly decreased ( p<0.05). Injection of CXCR4 siRNA transfected cells inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft model compared with blank and negative control groups (p <0.05). CXCR4 silenced by siRNA could suppress the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of esophageal carcinoma cell lines KYSE-150 and TE-13 in vitro and in vivo. The results provide a theoretical and experimental basis for the gene therapy of ESCC using RNAi technology based on CXCR4 target site.
