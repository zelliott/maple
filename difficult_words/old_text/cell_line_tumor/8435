Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples are an outstanding source of new information regarding disease evolvements. Current research on new biomarkers and diseases features has recently invested resources in FFPE-related projects.

In order to initiate clinical protein-expression studies using minute amount of biological material, a workflow based on the combination of filter-assisted sample preparation with MS analysis and label-free quantification was developed. Xenograft lung tumor tissue was investigated as a model system. The workflow was optimized and characterized in terms of its reproducibility from a quantitative and qualitative point of view. We proposed a modification of the original filter-assisted sample preparation protocol to improve reproducibility and highlight its potential for the investigation of hydrophobic proteins.

Altogether the presented workflow allows analysis of FFPE samples with improvements in the analytical time and performance, and we show its application for lung cancer xenograft tissue samples.
