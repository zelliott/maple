A new hydroxyiminoamide ligand, 1-(2-nitroimidazole-1-yl)-propanhydroxyiminoamide (N2IPA) was synthesized. The biodistribution of (99m)Tc-N2IPA in mice bearing S180 tumor demonstrated that the complex showed a selective accumulation in tumor and slow clearance from it. The tumor-to-tissue uptake ratios increased with time. At 4 hours after injection, the uptake ratios of tumor to muscle, blood, liver, heart, and lung reached 8.4, 1.5, 0.6, 2.9, and 2.3, respectively. Moreover, the tumor-to-liver uptake ratio steadily increased to 0.9 at 8 hours and 2.3 at 24 hours. The complex showed little uptake and quick clearance in blood, lung and other organs. Compared with other proposed hypoxia-imaging agents, this novel agent has advantages of higher tumor-to-muscle and tumor-to-blood uptake ratios and easier synthesis.
