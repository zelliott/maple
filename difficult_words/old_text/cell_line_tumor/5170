Tumour cell dissemination through corporal fluids (blood, lymph and body cavity fluids) is a distinctive feature of the metastatic process. Tumour cell transition from fluid to adhesive conditions involves an early polarization event and major rearrangements of the submembrane cytoskeleton that remain poorly understood. As regulation of cortical actin-membrane binding might be important in this process, we investigated the role of ezrin and moesin, which are key crosslinking proteins of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) family. We used short interfering RNA (siRNA) to show that moesin is crucial for invasion by melanoma cells in 3D matrices and in early lung colonization. Using live imaging, we show that following initial adhesion to the endothelium or 3D matrices, moesin is redistributed away from the region of adhesion, thereby generating a polarized cortex: a stable cortical actin dome enriched in moesin and an invasive membrane domain full of blebs. Using Lifeact-GFP, a 17-amino-acid peptide that binds F-actin, we show the initial symmetry breaking of cortical actin cytoskeleton during early attachment of round cells. We also demonstrated that ezrin and moesin are differentially distributed during initial invasion of 3D matrices, and, specifically, that moesin controls adhesion-dependent activation of Rho and subsequent myosin II contractility. Our results reveal that polarized moesin plays a role in orienting Rho activation, myosin II contractility, and cortical actin stability, which is crucial for driving directional vertical migration instead of superficial spreading on the fluid-to-solid tissue interface. We propose that this mechanism of cortical polarization could sustain extravasation of fluid-borne tumour cells during the process of metastasis.
