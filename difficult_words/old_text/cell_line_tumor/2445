Cancer cells acquire drug resistance via various mechanisms including enhanced cellular cytoprotective and antioxidant activities. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a key enzyme exerting potent cytoprotection, cell proliferation and drug resistance. We aimed to investigate roles of HO-1 in human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells for cytoprotection against chemotherapeutic agents. KKU-100 and KKU-M214 CCA cell lines with high and low HO-1 expression levels, respectively, were used to evaluate the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, gemcitabine (Gem) and doxorubicin. Inhibition of HO-1 by zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) sensitized both cell types to the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. HO-1 gene silencing by siRNA validated the cytoprotective effect of HO-1 on CCA cells against Gem. Induction of HO-1 protein expression by stannous chloride enhanced the cytoprotection and suppression of apoptosis caused by anticancer agents. The sensitizing effect of ZnPP was associated with increased ROS formation and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, while Gem alone did not show any effects. A ROS scavenger, Tempol, abolished the sensitizing effect of ZnPP on Gem. Combination of ZnPP and Gem enhanced the release of cytochrome c and increased p21 levels. The results show that HO-1 played a critical role in cytoprotection in CCA cells against chemotherapeutic agents. Targeted inhibition of HO-1 may be a strategy to overcome drug resistance in chemotherapy of bile duct cancer.
