Quantitative proteomics can be used as a screening tool for identification of differentially expressed proteins as potential biomarkers for cancers. Here, we comparatively analyzed the proteome profiles of ovarian cancer tissues and normal ovarian epithelial tissues. Using the high-throughput proteomic technology of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-coupled with two-dimensional-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, 1,259 unique proteins were identified. Of those, 205 were potentially differentially expressed between ovarian cancer and normal ovarian tissues. Several of the potentially differentially expressed proteins were validated by Western blotting and real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Furthermore, up-regulation of KRT8, PPA1, IDH2, and S100A11 were validated in ovarian tissue microarrays by immunohistochemistry. Silencing of S100A11 expression suppressed the migration and invasion properties of ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Our study represents the successful application of iTRAQ technology to an investigation of ovarian cancer. Many of the potentially differentially expressed proteins identified had not been linked to ovarian cancer before, and provide valuable novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis in human ovarian cancer.
