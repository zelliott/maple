Insulin receptor substrate-4 (IRS-4) is a scaffold protein that mediates the actions of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Its expression increases dramatically after partial hepatectomy (a liver regeneration model). Herein, we report IRS-4 expression in a human hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) and IGF-I-dependent IRS-4 tyrosine phosphorylation.

The role of IRS-4 in HepG2 proliferation was established by RNA interference (siRNA). After 72h of transfection with IRS-4 siRNA, we observed a specific reduction in IRS-4 expression.

Depletion of IRS-4 levels decreased ERK phosphorylation, p70S6K phosphorylation and IGF-I-stimulated cell proliferation. Changes in ERK phosphorylation in IRS-4-depleted cells were independent of ras/raf/MEK1/2- and PI3K/Akt-cascades. IRS-4 down-regulation abolished IGF-I-, TPA- and IGF-I plus TPA-stimulated ERK and p70S6K activities. Our results suggest that PKC-epsilon mediates the effect of IRS-4 on ERK activity. Moreover, decreased IRS-4 levels diminished FBS- and IGF-I-stimulated HepG2 growth and cause stress fiber disruption in HepG2 cell line.

Collectively, our data suggest that IRS-4 plays an important role in HepG2 proliferation/differentiation and exerts its actions through ERK and p70S6K activation in a ras/raf/MEK1/2- and PI3Kinase/Akt-independent manner and in a PKC-dependent way.
