To investigate the mechanism of staurosporine-induced glioma cell death and cell cycle arrest using adenovirus-mediated gene transfection, as well as the function of retinoblastoma (Rb) and genetic instability induced by staurosporine.

Cell cycle regulation, cell death and nuclear abnormalities induced by staurosporine were examined using an adenovirus vector expressing Rb, p16 or p21 genes in human glioma cell lines.

The Rb-defective SF-539 cell line was resistant to staurosporine compared with cell lines expressing intact Rb. SF-539 glioma cells exposed to staurosporine became multinucleated and then died. Multinucleation was prevented in SF-539 cells transfected with the Rb gene, thus decreasing the death rate of these cells.

These results imply that enforced Rb expression protects cells from genomic instability induced by staurosporine regardless of its upstream molecular effects.
