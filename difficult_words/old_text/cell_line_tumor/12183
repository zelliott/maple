We have synthesized rigid analogues of combretastatin bearing a furan ring in place of the olefinic bridge. These compounds are cytotoxic at nanomolar concentrations in neuroblastoma cells, display a similar structure-activity relationship compared to combretastatin A4, and inhibit tubulin polymerization. We also show that the furan ring can be further functionalized. Thus, it is possible that combretafurans could act as scaffolds for the development of dual-action antitumoral agents.
