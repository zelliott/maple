FR235222, a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), at 50nM caused accumulation of acetylated histone H4, inhibition of cell proliferation and G1 cycle arrest accompanied by increase of p21 and down-regulation of cyclin E in human promyelocytic leukaemia U937 cells. The compound was also able to increase the protein and mRNA levels of annexin A1 (ANXA1) without effects on apoptosis. Similar effects were observed in human chronic myelogenous leukaemia K562 cells and human T cell leukaemia Jurkat cells. Cycle arrest and ANXA1 expression, without significant effects on apoptosis, were also induced by different HDACi like suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and trichostatin-A (TSA). FR235222 at 0.5 microM stimulated apoptosis of all leukaemia cell lines associated to an increased expression of the full-length (37kDa) protein and the appearance of a 33kDa N-terminal cleavage product in both cytosol and membrane. These results suggest that ANXA1 expression may mediate cycle arrest induced by low doses FR235222, whereas apoptosis induced by high doses FR235222 is associated to ANXA1 processing.
