Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Here, we report elevated expression of tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) in primary human lung tumors and in non-small cell lung cancer cells that express low levels of differentiation-inducing transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα). In approximately 10-20% of cases, elevated TRIB2 expression resulted from gene amplification. TRIB2 knockdown was found to inhibit cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth. In addition, TRIB2 knockdown led to morphological changes similar to C/EBPα overexpression and correlated with increased expression and activity of C/EBPα. TRIB2-mediated regulation of C/EBPα was found to occur through the association of TRIB2 with the E3 ligase TRIM21. Together, these data identify TRIB2 as a potential driver of lung tumorigenesis through a mechanism that involves downregulation of C/EBPα.
