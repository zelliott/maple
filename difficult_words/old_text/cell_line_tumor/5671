A xanthonolignoid, 2-O-demethylkielcorin, and a phenylxanthone, chinexanthone A, were isolated from stems of Hypericum chinense together with four known xanthonolignoids and seven known xanthones. Their structures were established by spectroscopic analysis, as their optical properties and absolute stereochemistry determined. The cytotoxicities of the isolated xanthone derivatives as well as additional 32 xanthones against a panel of human cancer cell lines were also evaluated.
