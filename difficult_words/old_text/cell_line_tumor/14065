Transactivation domain (TAD)-truncated p73, DeltaNp73, associates with p53, resulting in suppression of p53's functions. Using p53 null cell lines, we examined whether or not DeltaNp73 can regulate gene expression in a p53-independent manner. When DeltaNp73alpha was co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid with various enhancer elements, NFkappaB-responsive luciferase gene expression was selectively up-regulated by DeltaNp73alpha, but not by other p73-isoforms with TAD and DeltaNp73beta. Deletion of the TAD endowed p73alpha with the ability to enhance the responsive gene's expression, but deletion of the N-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) rendered the TAD-deleted p73alpha inactive. Considering the inability of DeltaNp73beta, which is the C-terminus-truncated form of DeltaNp73alpha, to function, these results indicate that both the PRD and C-terminus are necessary for DeltaNp73alpha to can activate NFkappaB-responsive luciferase expression. Over-expression of p53 suppressed the TAD-truncated p73alpha-mediated luciferase expression, suggesting that p53 interferes with the TAD-truncated p73alpha-mediated activation of NFkappaB. Inhibitors for NFkappaB activation reduced the TAD-truncated p73alpha-dependent NFkappaB-responsive gene expression, indicating that TAD-truncated p73alpha activates NFkappaB as does TNFalpha. In addition to the results obtained in the reporter gene assay, TAD-truncated p73alpha stimulated the translocation of NFkappaB to the nucleus and the expression of an endogenous NFkappaB-responsive gene, Bcl-XL. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TAD-truncated p73alpha can activate NFkappaB.
