Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is a widely used medicinal herb in several Asian countries including Korea. The various medicinal properties attributed to Scutellaria baicalensis include anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. The present study investigated the cytotoxicity of Scutellaria baicalensis water extract (SBWE) on A549 non-small-cell-lung cancer cells and the A549 expression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and the effects of SBWE on cell cycle progression, especially the G1/S phase, and on cell motility.

SBWE cytotoxicity was assessed by a standard colorimetric assay utilizing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 protein in SBWE-treated A549 cells was assessed by Western blot analysis. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to determine the effect of SBWE on A549 cell cycle progression. A549 cell MMP-2 activity was examined by zymography. Cell motility and migration was assessed by a scratch wound healing assay.

SBWE was not cytotoxic. The production of Cyclin D1, CDK4 and MMP-2 activity were significantly decreased in a SBWE dose-dependent manner, with maximum inhibition occurring at SBWE concentrations of 250 μg/ml and 500 μg/ml. SBWE inhibited cell cycle progression in the G1/S phase and significantly inhibited the motility of A549 cells.

Cyclin D1 protein may be associated with MMP-2 activity and cell motility. Thus, SBWE promotes a strong protective effect against MMP-2 mediated metastasis and cell proliferation through the down-regulation of cyclin D1. SBWE may be a useful chemotherapeutic agent for lung cancer.
