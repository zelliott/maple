The objective of this study was to measure the antibody content of NuTu-19 ovarian cancer cells in serum samples using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) immunosensor.

NuTu-19 cells were first cultured onto the electrode surfaces of crystals in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, and then specified amounts of immunized serum samples of immunized rabbit were also added. The change in mass caused by specific adsorbtion of antibodies of NuTu-19 to the surfaces of the crystals was detected.

The change in resonance frequency of crystals caused by immobilization of NuTu-19 cells was from 83 to 429 Hz. The antibody content of NuTu-19 detected was 341 ng/ul. The frequency shifts were linearly dependent on the amount of antibody mass in the range of 69 to 340 ng. The positive detection rate and the negative detection rate were 80% and 100%, respectively.

This immunoassay provides a viable alternative to other early ovarian cancer detection methods and is particularly suited for health screening of the general population.
