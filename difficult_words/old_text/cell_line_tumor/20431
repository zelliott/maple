With scanning electron microscopy analysis, we investigated the role of nanoscale topography on cellular activities; e.g. cell adhesion and spreading by culturing A549 cells (human lung carcinoma cell line cells) for 1-48 h on three sets of nanostructures; quartz nanopillars (QNPs), silicon nanopillars and silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays, along with planar glass substrates. We found that cells on QNP arrays developed a longer shape than those on SiNW arrays. In addition, we studied how cell morphologies influence the cell-capture yield on the three sets of nanostructures. This research showed that the filopodial formations were directing the cell-capture yield on nanostructured substrates. This finding implies the possibility of using nanoscale topography features to control the filopodial formation including extension and migration from the cells. Using streptavidin-functionalized SiNW substrate, we further demonstrated a substantially higher yield (~91.8 ± 5.9%) than the planar glass wafers (~24.1 ± 7.5%) in the range of 200-3000 cells.
