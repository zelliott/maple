PI3 kinases are a family of lipid kinases mediating numerous cell processes such as proliferation, migration and differentiation. The PI3 Kinase pathway is often de-regulated in cancer through PI3KÎ± overexpression, gene amplification, mutations and PTEN phosphatase deletion. PI3K inhibitors represent therefore an attractive therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. Herein we describe how the potency of a benzothiazole fragment hit was quickly improved based on structural information and how this early chemotype was further optimized through scaffold hopping. This effort led to the identification of a series of 2-acetamido-5-heteroaryl imidazopyridines showing potent in vitro activity against all class I PI3Ks and attractive pharmacokinetic properties.
