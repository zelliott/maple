Two new steroid glycosides: distolasteroside D6, (24S)-24-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-5alpha-cholestane-3beta,6alpha,8,15beta,16beta,24-hexaol, and distolasteroside D7. (22E,24R)-24-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-5alpha-cholest-22-ene-3beta,6alpha,8,15beta,24-pentaol were isolated along with the previously known distolasterosides D1, D2, and D3, echinasteroside C, and (25S)-5alpha-cholestane-3beta,4beta,6alpha,7alpha,8,15alpha,16beta,26-octaol from the Far Eastern starfish Distolasterias nipon. The structures of new compounds were elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. Like neurotrophins, distolasterosides D1, D2, and D3 were shown to induce neuroblast differentiation in a mouse neuroblastoma C 1300 cell culture.
