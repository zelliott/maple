Barx2 is a member of the Bar class of homeobox genes and has been shown to regulate specific cell adhesion molecules, L1, Ng-CAM, N-CAM, and cadherin 6. By Northern blotting and in situ hybridization, we show that Barx2 is expressed throughout the gut and is located in epithelial cells of the proliferative and differentiative regions of the stomach, esophagus, and intestine. Barx2 was expressed in muscle cells of the muscularis externa and also showed a graded pattern of expression in intestinal enterocytes, decreasing in a crypt-to-villous direction. We speculate that Barx2 may regulate cell adhesion molecules in epithelial cells of the gut.
