Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that regulates many             important biological processes, including cell migration, viral infection and             autophagy. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of HDAC6             in the invasion and metastasis activities of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Three             HCC cell lines and two primary cultures of hepatocytes were used for biological             experiments. Immunohistochemistry for HDAC6 protein was also examined in 70 resected             primary HCCs. Knockdown of the HDAC6 gene in the HCC cell lines was carried out             by treatment with siRNA, and their migration and invasion activities were examined             by the scratch assay and Matrigel invasion assay, respectively. HDAC6 expression             was greater in all of the HCC cell lines compared to the primary cultures of hepatocytes.             Knockdown of HDAC6 markedly downregulated the migration and invasion activities             of all HCC cell lines ( p<0.05). Overexpression of HDAC6 protein to a level             higher than that in the corresponding normal hepatocytes was observed in 14 (20%)             of the 70 primary HCCs, and was significantly correlated with high clinical stage,             number of tumors, vascular invasion and intrahepatic metastasis ( p<0.05). These             results suggest that overexpression of the HDAC6 protein is involved in the migration             and invasion activities of HCC cells, and may be a good biomarker for prediction             of intrahepatic metastasis.
