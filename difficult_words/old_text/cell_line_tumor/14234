Dipeptidyl peptidase I is involved in the activation of a number of disease-related proteases by removal of N-terminal prodipeptides. We here report a selective activity-based probe for monitoring dipeptidyl peptidase I activity in whole proteomes as well as in intact cells, without labeling of closely related enzyme family members.
