Fas and p75 neurotrophin receptors (p75(NTR)) are death receptors that alone induce apoptosis of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line respectively by Fas ligand or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, a p75(NTR) ligand). We report on the modulation of Fas-mediated apoptosis by concomitant p75(NTR) activation. The exposure to both ligands suppressed the apoptotic effect. A co-localisation of Fas and p75(NTR) receptors was evidenced by co-capping and immunoprecipitation assays. Moreover, a caspase-8 inhibitor suppressed the protective effect of the concomitant BDNF and Fas ligand stimulation, suggesting that p75(NTR) and Fas receptors could share common signalling pathways.
