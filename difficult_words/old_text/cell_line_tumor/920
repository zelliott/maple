Dihydrobenzoxathiin analogs (1-11) with modifications on the basic side chain region were prepared and evaluated for estrogen/anti-estrogen activity in both in vitro and in vivo models. The compounds generally maintained a high degree of selectivity for ERalpha over ERbeta, similar to the original lead compound I. Many of the compounds also maintained high potency in the inhibition of human carcinoma MCF-7 cell growth. However, all were less potent in the inhibition of estradiol-triggered uterine growth. This work demonstrates the sensitive nature of modification to the antagonist basic side chain region.
