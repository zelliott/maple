Naturally fluorescent proteins have been widely used in biological research. In this study, we found that the simple and effective way to obtain enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) nude mice is to cross transgenic EGFP C57BL/6J mice with nude (nu/nu) mice. EGFP expression is identified by tail genotyping. Establishment of the orthotopic EGFP nude mouse model used surgical orthotopic implantation. The morphology and human glioma cell markers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S-100, remain unchanged in this mouse model. The tumor blood vessels obtained from the orthotopic model show brilliant EGFP fluorescence as observed by fluorescence microscopy. These findings suggested that this is an ideal mouse model with which to study interaction among host, tumor, and tumor microenvironment; the findings also suggested that the host (EGFP nude mouse) was involved in tumor angiogenesis.
