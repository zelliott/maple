To study the effect of NF-kappaB, survivin, Bcl-2 and Caspase3 on tumor necrosis factors related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells.

Gastric cancer cells of SGC-7901, MKN28, MKN45 and AGS lines were cultured in PRMI-1640 medium and the apoptosis rates of the cells of 4 lines were observed after treatment of tumor necrosis factors related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) with a flow cytometer. The expression of NF-kappaB, survivin, Bcl-2 and Caspase3 in gastric cancer cells of 4 lines was analyzed with Western blot.

After the gastric cancer cells were exposed to TRAIL 300 ng/ml for 24 hours, the apoptosis rate was 36.05%, 20.27%, 16.50% and 11.80% in MKN28, MKN45, AGS and SGC-7901cells respectively. Western blot revealed that the expressions of NF-kappaB and survivin were lower in MKN28 cells than in MKN45, AGS and SGC-7901 cells. In contrast, the expression of Caspase3 was higher in MKN28 cells than in MKN45, AGS and SGC-7901 cells.

There is a selectivity of TRAIL potency to induce apoptosis in gastric cancer cells of different cell lines. The anticancer potency of TRAIL is associated with the decreased expression of NF-kappaB and survivin and increased expression of Caspase3 of gastric cancer cells.
