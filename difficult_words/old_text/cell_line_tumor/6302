Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a population of non-conventional T-lymphocytes which are restricted by the MHC-related 1 (MR1) molecule. MR1 is a non-classical member of the MHC class I family of proteins, it is unknown if MR1 presents any kind of antigens to MAIT cells. In the present manuscript we describe that detection of MR1 on the cell surface by conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies is enhanced upon culture the cells at 26Â°C; we also show that detection of MR1 on the cell surface is lost after treating the cells at pH 3.3 as in the case of classical MHC class I molecules. Finally, the re-expression of MR1 on the cell surface is independent of proteasome. Taken together these results strongly suggest that MR1 needs to bind proteasome-independent ligands in order to properly reach the cell surface.
