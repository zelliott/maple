The cytotoxicity of three alkaloids from the roots of Aconitum yesoense var. macroyesoense as well as 36 semi-synthetic C(20)-diterpenoid atisine-type alkaloid derivatives against A549 human lung carcinoma cells was examined. Ten acylated alkaloid derivatives, pseudokobusine 11-veratroate (9), 11-anisoate (12), 6,11-dianisoate (14), 11-p-nitrobenzoate (18), 11,15-di-p-nitrobenzoate (22), 11-cinnamate (25) and 11-m-trifluoromethylbenzoate (27), and kobusine 11-p-trifluoromethylbenzoate (35), 11-m-trifluoromethylbenzoate (36) and 11,15-di-p-nitrobenzoate (39), exhibited cytotoxic activity, and 11,15-dianisoylpseudokobusine (16) was found to be the most potent cytotoxic agent. Their IC(50) values against A549 cells ranged from 1.72 to 5.44 Î¼M. In the occurrence of cytotoxic effects of atisine-type alkaloids, replacement by an acyl group at both C-11 and C-15 resulted in the enhancement of activity of the parent alkaloids compared to that from having hydroxy groups at this position, and the presence of a hydroxy group at the C-6 position was required for the cytotoxic effects. These acylated alkaloid derivatives inhibit cell growth through G1 arrest.
