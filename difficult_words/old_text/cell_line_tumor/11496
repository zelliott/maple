Development of effective polymer-based nanocarriers for the successful application in cancer therapy still remains a great challenge in current research. In the present study we present a dendritic polyglycerol-based multifunctional drug immunoconjugate that specifically targets and kills cancer cell lines expressing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The nanocarrier was provided with a dendritic core as a multifunctional anchoring point, doxorubicin (Doxo) coupled through a pH-sensitive linker, a fluorescence marker, poly(ethylene glycol), as solubilizing and shielding moiety, and a scFv antibody conjugated through the SNAP-Tag technology. The study provides the proof of principle that SNAP-tag technology can be used to generate drug-carrying nanoparticles efficiently modified with single-chain antibodies to specifically target and destroy cancer cells.
