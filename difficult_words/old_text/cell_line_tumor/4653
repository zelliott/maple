The sequential one-pot double dearomatization of bis(N-benzyl-P,P-diphenylphosphinamides) via anionic cyclization is described for the first time. Protonation and alkylation of the dearomatized dianions provide bis(tetrahydro-2,1-benzazaphospholes) in good yield and with very high regio- and stereocontrol. Acid-catalyzed methanolysis of the bisheterocycles affords bis(methyl gamma-aminophosphinates) stereospecifically. The doubly phosphorylated systems proved to be active against a series of cancer cell lines.
