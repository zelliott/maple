Multiple myeloma can be classified into hyperdiploid (HRD) (with 48-74 chromosomes) and non-hyperdiploid tumors (usually with immunoglobulin heavy chain translocations). The OH-2 human myeloma cell line (HMCL) retains the same HRD genotype as the primary tumor, with extra copies of chromosomes 3, 7, 15, 19, and 21. Both OH-2 and primary cells have a complex secondary translocation in which the IGK 3' enhancer is inserted between MYC and MAFB, resulting in dysregulation of both oncogenes. OH-2 provides a unique example of an HMCL and the corresponding primary tumor that are shown to share the same HRD genotype.
