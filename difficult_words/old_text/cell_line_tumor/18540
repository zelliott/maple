Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a DNA tumor virus known to induce cancers in laboratory animals. There are numerous reports of the detection of SV40 DNA and/or proteins in human malignancies of the same types as those induced by SV40 in animals, including brain cancers. However, known exposure to the virus has not yet been linked directly to cancer development in a specific individual. Here we describe the detection of SV40 sequences in the meningioma of a laboratory researcher who had a probable direct exposure to SV40 and subsequently developed a tumor positive for viral DNA sequences indistinguishable from those of the laboratory source. This case suggests a link between viral exposure and tumor development.
