Low-power laser therapy has become popular in clinical applications including promoting wound healing and pain relief. However, effects of this photoradiation on human hepatoma cells are rarely studied. Previously, we found 808 nm gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) continuous wave laser had an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and J-5 at the energy density of 5.85 and 11.7 J/cm(2), respectively. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible mechanism of action of this photoradiation on HepG2 and J-5 cells. HepG2 and J-5 cells were cultured in 24-well plates for 24 h. After photoradiation by 130 mW 808 nm GaAlAs continuous wave laser for different time intervals (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 s), Western blot and immunofluorescent staining were used to examine the expression and distribution of histone and cytoskeletal proteins. The cell counts as well as histone and synemin expression of HepG2 and J-5 cells were reduced by photoradiation at the energy density of 5.85 and 11.7 J/cm(2), respectively. Furthermore, the architecture of cytoskeletons and the distribution of intermediate filament-associated proteins (plectin and synemin) were disorganized by photoradiation. Photoradiation by 808 nm GaAlAs continuous wave laser at the energy density of 5.85 and 7.8 J/cm(2) inhibited the survival of human hepatoma cell lines. The mechanism might reduce synthesis of histone and synemin. Reduced histone synthesis might further reduce the proliferation rate of these cells. Reduced synemin synthesis might result in the destruction of the cytoskeleton. Therefore, the net effects by this photoradiation were reduced cell survival.
