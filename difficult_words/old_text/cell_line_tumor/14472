The present paper reports on an analytical method for the routine analysis of perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs). A rapid method for the derivatization, extraction and determination of PFCAs was developed. Technological samples were extracted with ethyl acetate and the anilides obtained were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Residue levels in cell growth incubation media were determined by GC-FID. Confirmation analysis of PFCAs was carried out by GC-MS in selected ion monitoring (SIM) and total ion current (TIC) modes. The compounds were identified on the basis of retention time and comparison of primary and secondary ions. The results showed that this method provided a simple, rapid and sensitive way of analyzing PFCAs in different matrices.
