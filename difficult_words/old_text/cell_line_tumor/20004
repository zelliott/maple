A nano-sized graphene oxide-photosensitizer conjugate with a redox-responsive cleavable disulfide linker is non-fluorescent and non-phototoxic, even upon light irradiation. It becomes highly fluorescent and phototoxic inside cancer cells, where glutathione is used as an initiator for activating the photosensitizer.
