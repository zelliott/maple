The growth of human breast cancer-derived MCF-7 cells was affected by oil-in-water lipid emulsions prepared with fish oil (FO) rich in n-3 fatty acids (FAs) and egg-yolk phosphatides (EYP) (FO-emulsions), but not by lipid emulsions prepared with soybean oil (SO) and EYP (SO-emulsions). On the other hand, the growth of human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells was affected by neither SO-emulsions nor FO-emulsions. The growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells in the presence of FO-emulsions was not affected by trolox, but was inhibited by alpha-lipoic acid, and was even potentiated by ebselen, which works as an antioxidant as well as a lipoxygenase inhibitor. Since prostaglandin E(3), generated from n-3 FAs by cyclooxygenases, has a suppressive effect on tumour cell growth, and increases when lipoxygenases are inhibited, these findings suggest that lipid emulsions incorporating triglycerides of n-3 FAs might be effective in suppressing the growth of MCF-7 cells, possibly via oxidative stress and through eicosanoid production with anti-proliferating activity against cancer cells.
