A frameshift mutation 138delT generates an open reading frame in the pseudogene, cytochrome P4502D7 (CYP2D7), and an alternate spliced functional transcript of CYP2D7 containing partial inclusion of intron 6 was identified in human brain but not in liver or kidney from the same individual. mRNA and protein of the brain variant CYP2D7 were detected in 6 of 12 human autopsy brains. Genotyping revealed the presence of the frameshift mutation 138delT only in those human subjects who expressed the brain variant CYP2D7. Genomic DNA analysis in normal volunteers revealed the presence of functional CYP2D7 in 4 of 8 individuals. In liver, the major organ involved in drug metabolism, a minor metabolic pathway mediated by CYP2D6 metabolizes codeine (pro-drug) to morphine (active drug), whereas norcodeine is the major metabolite. In contrast, when expressed in Neuro2a cells, brain variant CYP2D7 metabolized codeine to morphine with greater efficiency compared with the corresponding activity in cells expressing CYP2D6. Morphine binds to micro-opioid receptors in certain regions of the central nervous system, such as periaqueductal gray, and produces pain relief. The brain variant CYP2D7 and micro-opioid receptor colocalize in neurons of the periaqueductal gray area in human brain, indicating that metabolism of codeine to morphine could occur at the site of opioid action. Histio-specific isoforms of P450 generated by alternate splicing, which mediate selective metabolism of pro-drugs within tissues, particularly the brain, to generate active drugs may play an important role in drug action and provide newer insights into the genetics of metabolism.
