Several viruses have been demonstrated to be the etiologic agent in chronic progressive diseases, associated with persistence; however, major questions concerning the pathogenic mechanisms of viral persistence are still unanswered. With the aim of identifying host cellular proteins that may play a role in viral replication, we established long-term persistently infected human glioblastoma cell lines with mutant measles virus (MV) and analyzed the host proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) with mass spectrometry. We observed significant down-modulation in the expression of mitochondrial short chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS), which catalyzes the beta-oxidation pathway of fatty acid. Knockdown of this gene by a short interference RNA (siRNA) apparently impaired wild-type MV replication and the cytopathic effects (CPEs) of MV were significantly reduced in siRNA-transfected cells. These findings will shed light upon a new important notion for the interaction between virus replication and lipid metabolism in host cells and might provide a new strategy for virus control.
