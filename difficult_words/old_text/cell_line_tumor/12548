To study the effect of matrine (MAT) on the proliferation of human ovary malignant teratoma cell line PA-1 in vitro.

PA-1 cells allocated in different groups were treated with different concentrations (0.25 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL and 1.0 mg/mL) of MAT. The inhibitory effect of MAT and its dose- and time-effect relationship were detected with MTT; the apoptosis rate and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry; and the changes of bcl-2/bax mRNA expression in cells were measured using semi-quantitative RT-PCR.

After being exposed to MAT, the PA-1 cell proliferation was decreased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; cell apoptosis rate raised as the increasing concentration of MAT and acting time; cells retarded at G1 phase in the cell cycle dose-dependently; and the bcl-2/bax mRNA expression in cells dawn-regulated significantly.

MAT can dose- and time-dependently inhibit the proliferation of PA-1 cell by reducing bcl-2/bax mRNA ratio to produce a G1 phase arresting in cell cycle.
