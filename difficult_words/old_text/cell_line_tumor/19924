Recent microarray analyses revealed that expression of S100A11 is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of S100A11 with pancreatic carcinogenesis.

We measured S100A11 mRNA expression in various clinical samples related to pancreatic cancer and its precursor lesions, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.

Levels of S100A11 were significantly higher in pancreatic cancer (n=22) and IPMN (n=18) bulk tissues than in nonneoplastic bulk tissues (n=22;  p<0.0001 for both). Levels of S100A11 did not differ between pancreatic cancer and IPMN bulk tissues. In microdissection analyses, however, IPMN cells (n=21) expressed significantly higher levels of S100A11 than did cancer cells (n=23; P=0.003). The median level of S100A11 expression was higher in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia cells (n=6) than in cancer cells. In pancreatic juice analyses, cancer-related (n=24; P=0.004) and IPMN-related (n=18; P=0.001) juice expressed significantly higher levels of S100A11 than did chronic pancreatitis-related juice (n=23).

The present data suggest that expression of S100A11, a putative tumor suppressor gene, is increased in the early stage of pancreatic carcinogenesis and decreased during subsequent progression to cancer. Analysis of the S100A11 level in pancreatic juice may be an effective tool for screening of patients with high-risk lesions that could progress to pancreatic cancer or detecting early-stage pancreatic cancer.
