Membrane transporters play important roles in mediating chemoresistance and chemosensitivity of tumor cells. Five sets of 5 genes were designed to simultaneously detect drug transporter expression in a single reaction tube using multiplex RT-PCR for 25 genes, including 17 ABC transporters, one non-ABC transporter, 4 SLC transporters, 2 copper transporters and one housekeeping gene. We optimized the multiplex RT-PCR conditions using chemosensitive cancer cells and then validated the system using chemoresistant cancer cells. This reliable multiplex RT-PCR assay can be utilized not only to investigate anticancer drug-resistance mechanisms but also to estimate the efficacy of anticancer chemotherapy in the clinic.
