An efficient synthesis of a C16 side chain benzophenone analogue of cryptophycin-24 using a crotylboration reaction and Heck coupling as key steps is described. In an in vitro tubulin assembly assay, the benzophenone analogue of the beta isomer (IC(50)=7.4 microM) is twice as active as cryptophycin-24 (IC(50)=15 microM).
