Activating Gs a mutations have been identified in most instances of fibrous dysplasia (FD). This mutation leads to consistently elevated intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, with various biological consequences. The development of secondary sarcoma in FD is a rare but well-established phenomenon. This finding raised the possibility that a common gene mutation exists in these tumors.

The expression of the Gs a mutation was examined in 16 cell lines and 173 musculoskeletal tumor tissues, including 13 cases of FD, via RT-PCR and sequence analysis.

No expression of a Gs a mutation was detected in any cell line or clinical tissue sample, excluding FD tissues. Direct sequence analysis demonstrated results identical to those of RT-PCR.

Activating Gs a mutation rarely occurs in musculoskeletal tumors other than FD. The occurrence of most sarcomas displays no correlation with Gs a mutations.
