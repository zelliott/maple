Liposomes, modified with monoclonal antibodies, are suitable carriers for targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs into brain tumors. Here, we investigate the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal anticancer antibody 2C5-modified long-circulating liposomes (LCL) loaded with doxorubicin (2C5-DoxLCL) for the treatment of U-87 MG human brain tumors in an intracranial model in nude mice. In vitro, 2C5-DoxLCL is significantly more effective in killing the U-87 MG tumor cells than Doxil (commercial doxorubicin-loaded PEGylated LCL) or DoxLCL modified with a non-specific IgG. 2C5-immunoliposomes also demonstrate a significantly higher accumulation in U-87 MG tumors compared to all controls in a subcutaneous model. The treatment of intracranial U-87 MG brain tumors in nude mice with 2C5-DoxLCL provides a significant therapeutic benefit over control formulations, substantially reducing the tumor size and almost doubling the survival time. Thus, monoclonal antibody 2C5-modified LCL can specifically target the anticancer drugs to brain tumors, leading to improved therapeutic treatment of brain tumor in an intracranial model, in vivo.
