RNase L mediates critical cellular functions including antiviral, proapoptotic, antiproliferative and tumor suppressive activities. In this study, the expression and function of RNase L in lung cancer cells were examined. Interestingly we have found that the expression of RNase L in lung cancer cells was 3- and 9-fold higher in its mRNA and protein levels, but a significant decrease of its enzymatic activity when compared to that in corresponding normal lung cells. Further investigation revealed that 2-5A-induced dimerization of the RNase L protein, a necessary prerequisite for activation of RNase L, was inhibited, as a result of that RLI, a specific inhibitor of RNase L, was remarkably up-regulated in the cancer cells. Our findings provide new insight into how cancer cells escape normal growth-regulating mechanisms to form a tumor and the information may be useful for the design of novel strategies for treating lung cancer through regulating RNase L activity.
