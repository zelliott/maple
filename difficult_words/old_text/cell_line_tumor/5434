Secreted frizzled related protein (sFRP)-2, a Wnt antagonist, was strongly expressed by both stromal and tumor cells of ameloblastoma. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether sFRP-2 secreted from tumor cells have any direct role in suppressed bone formation or not. A pre-osteoblastic cell line, KUSA/A1 cells, cultured in conditioned medium of an ameloblastoma-derived cell line (AM-1CM) was used in the study. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, alizarin red staining, mineral quantification and MTS assay was performed. Wnt-canonical pathway is a major pathway for osteoblasts. Antagonists of this pathway, sFRP-1, 2 and 3, were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. KUSA/A1 cells cultured in AM-1CM showed high cell proliferation, low ALP activity without mineralized matrix deposition. sFRP-2 was strongly expressed in ameloblastoma tissue and AM-1 cells. After sFRP-2 depletion, the cells showed diffuse mineralization. In this study, it was confirmed that ameloblastoma cells have a major role in decreased bone formation by secreting sFRP-2 in cell culture model. Though, sFRP-2 has great effect on tumor progression, inhibition of sFRP-2's anti-bone formation activity and cell proliferative activity may reduce the invasive property of ameloblastoma and possibility of recurrence rate.
