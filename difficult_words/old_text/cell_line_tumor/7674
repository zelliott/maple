Several Chinese herbs, namely, Pu-Gong-Ying, Gan-Cao, Chai-Hu, Mu-Xiang, Gua-Lou and Huang-Yao-Zi, are frequently used in complex traditional Chinese medicing formulas for breast hyperplasia and breast tumor therapy. The pharmacological effects of these Chinese herbs are all described as 'clearing heat-toxin and resolving masses' in traditional use. However, the chemical profiles of anti-breast cancer constituents in these herbs has not been investigated so far. In this study, a bioactivity-oriented screening platform, which was based on a human breast cancer MCF-7 cellular model, semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet spectrophotometry and ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer, was developed to rapidly screen the six Chinese herbs. Two potential anti-breast cancer compounds, which were costunolide (Cos) and dehydrocostus lactone (Dehy), were identified in Mu-Xiang. Combination of the two compounds showed a synergism on inhibiting the proliferation of MCF-7 cells in vitro, which exhibits a potential application prospect for breast cancer therapy. This bioactivity-oriented screening strategy is rapid, economical, reliable and specific for screening potential anti-breast cancer compounds in traditional Chinese medicines.
