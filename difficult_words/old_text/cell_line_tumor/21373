Phloroglucinol derivatives tomoeones A-H (1-8) and three known compounds were isolated from leaves of Hypericum ascyron. Their structures were established based on spectroscopic analyses. They are all acylphloroglucinol derivatives possessing a spiro skeleton with geminal isoprenyl groups and a monoterpene moiety, and they are stereoisomers to each other at C-4 and C-13. They appear to be a class of phloroglucinol derivatives. Cytotoxicities of the isolated phloroglucinol derivatives against human tumor cell lines, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cell lines, were evaluated. Tomoeone F (6) demonstrated significant cytotoxicity against KB cells with an IC50 value of 6.2 microM. Compound 6 was also cytotoxic against MDR cancer cell lines (KB-C2 and K562/Adr), which was more potent than doxorubicin.
