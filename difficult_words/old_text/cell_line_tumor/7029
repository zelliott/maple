It is widely recognized that the growth of solid tumor depends on angiogenesis. Vascular endothelia growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen that promotes angiogenesis in solid tumor. Inhibition of angiogenesis is considered a promising approach for cancer therapy, and treatments including administration of antisense drugs and RNA interference for the VEGF gene are geared to the suppression of tumor angiogenesis.

As a new approach for gene therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), four groups of antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASODN) (A-Cap, A-AUG, A-UGA and A-Exon-3) were used to block the expression of VEGF, then VEGF mRNA and protein were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot.

After treatment with ASODN, the relative VEGF mRNA levels of A-Cap, A-AUG, A-UGA, and A-Exon-3 were decreased significantly to (32+/-9)%, (63+/-1)%, (86+/-3)%, and (70+/-5)%, respectively(F=64.18,  p<0.001). The relative VEGF protein levels of A-Cap, A-AUG, A-UGA and A-Exon-3 were decreased significantly to (41+/-5)%, (59+/-3)%, (88+/-7)%, and (79+/-9)% respectively (F=60.64,  p<0.001).

Among the four ASODNs, the ASODN for Cap structure showed the strongest inhibitory effect and that for A-UGA, the least ( p<0.05 ). The inhibitory effect of ASODN on the expression of VEGF proteins was similar to that of VEGF mRNA expression.
