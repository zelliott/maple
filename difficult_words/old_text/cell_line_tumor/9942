A series of N-(imidazolidin-2-ylidene)hydrazones and N-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-N-methylhydrazones were prepared and examined for alpha 1-, alpha 2-adrenergic and imidazoline I1, I2 receptors binding affinities as well as cytotoxic activity against human tumor cell lines. Among the compounds tested, 2-naphthaldehyde N-(imidazolidin-2-ylidene)hydrazone (3e) exhibited a significant affinity for both alpha 2-adrenergic and imidazoline I1 receptors (Ki = 94.3 nM and IC50 = 51.7 nM, respectively). Moreover, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde N-(imidazolidin-2-ylidene)hydrazone (3l) showed the highest binding affinity to alpha 1-adrenoceptors (Ki = 24.6 nM), while quinoline-2-carboxaldehyde N-(imidazolidin-2-ylidene)hydrazone (3m) displayed the highest I2 affinity with a Ki value of 26.7 nM and a high selectivity with respect to alpha 2-adrenergic and imidazoline I1 receptors (Ki = 22470.0 nM and IC50 = 6145.0 nM, respectively). None of the tested N-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-N-methylhydrazones 4p-u displayed cytotoxic activity.
