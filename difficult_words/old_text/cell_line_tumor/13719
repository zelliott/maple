The hollow fiber assay (HFA) is a drug discovery tool to aid investigators in the prioritization of lead compounds identified by in vitro testing for further development in animal models of disease. In the HFA, cells are cultured in hollow fibers containing pores of a diameter (500 kDa) large enough for proteins and other macromolecules to enter, but too small for the cells to escape. The fibers are filled with cells, sealed and placed in the peritoneal cavity of immunodeficient mice. The mice undergo a predetermined treatment regimen after which the fibers are retrieved and the cells evaluated for activity of a target relevant to the disease modeled. The HFA combines advantages of both in vitro and in vivo assay systems. It uses the same cell lines used in culture systems, is a rapid assay, and requires fewer animals and less test substance than conventional xenograft systems. Like traditional in vivo assays, the test substance is evaluated in a live animal, which affords an initial assessment of associated toxicity and pharmacokinetic properties of the test substance.
