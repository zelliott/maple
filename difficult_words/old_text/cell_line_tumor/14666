Infiltration of leukocytes into post-ischemic cerebrum is a well-described phenomenon in stroke injury. Because CD-8(+) T-lymphocytes secrete cytotoxic proteases, including granzyme-b (Gra-b) that exacerbates post-ischemic brain damage, we investigated roles of Gra-b in human stroke. To study the role of Gra-b in stroke, ischemic and non-ischemic tissues (from post-mortem stroke patients) were analyzed using immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, terminal deoxy uridine nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Annexin-V immunostaining, and in vitro neuron survival assays. Activated CG-SH cells and supernatants were used to model leukocyte-dependent injury. Non-ischemic brain tissues were used as non-pathological controls. Non-activated CG-SH cells and supernatants were used as controls for in vitro experiments. Human stroke (ischemic) samples contained significantly higher levels of Gra-b and interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10/CXCL10) than non-ischemic controls. In stroke, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and heat shock protein-70 were cleaved to canonical proteolytic "signature" fragments by Gra-b. Gra-b was also found to bind to Bid and caspase-3. Gra-b also co-localized with Annexin-V(+) /TUNEL(+) in degenerating neurons. Importantly, Gra-b inhibition protected both normal and ischemia-reperfused neurons against in vitro neurotoxicity mediated by activated CG-SH cells and supernatants. These results suggest that increased leukocyte infiltration and elevated Gra-b levels in the post-stroke brain can induce contact-dependent and independent post-ischemic neuronal death to aggravate stroke injury.
