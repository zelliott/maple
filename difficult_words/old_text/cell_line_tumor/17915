To observe the inhibition of maspin on the angiogenesis in tumor and lung metastasis of breast carcinoma and the feasibility of treatment of tumor by microencapsulated transgene cells in vivo.

Microencapsulated Chinese hamster ovarian epithelial cells (CHO) modified with maspin gene, CHO/pcDNA3.1/maspin cells, were prepared. Twenty BALB/C nude rats underwent subcutaneous injection of breast carcinoma cells of the line Bcap37 to establish tumor-loaded animal models and then randomly divided into 2 groups: maspin group, undergoing subcutaneous injection of CHO/pcDNA3.1/maspin cells next to the transplanted tumor, and control group undergoing subcutaneous injection of microencapsulated CHO/pcDNA3.1 cells. One month later, the rats were killed and the size and microvessel density (MVD) of the transplanted tumor and metastatic tumor in lung were observed.

The MVD of the transplanted tumor of the maspin group was 26 +/- 9, significantly lower than that of the control group (60 +/- 16, P < 0.05). The lung metastatic rate of the maspin group was 15%, significantly lower than that of the control group (55%, P < 0.05).

Maspin may inhibit the MVD in tumor and the occurrence of metastatic tumor in lung. It is feasible to use microencapsulated transgene cells as tumor-killer.
