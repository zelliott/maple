Piceamycin, a new macrolactam polyketide antibiotic, was detected by HPLC-diode array screening in extracts of Streptomyces sp. GB 4-2, which was isolated from the mycorrhizosphere of Norway spruce. The structure of piceamycin was determined by mass spectrometry and NMR experiments. It showed inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria, selected human tumor cell lines and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B.
