To find a new kind of biological response modifier to anti-laryngocarcinoma through studying the efficiency of resveratrol.

To detect the growth inhibiting rate of Hep-2 exposed to resveratrol with MTT colorimetry and to analyze the apoptosis and cell cycle of Hep-2 with flow cytometry. As having formed the model of laryngocarcinoma, quite a few indicatrixes including the content changes of IL-2, IL-8,TGF-beta1 and VEGF were detected.

Resveratrol could induce apoptosis of Hep-2 in time-concentration-dependent manners showing obvious cell cycle blocking of G0/G1 and apoptotic peak. Furthermore, resveratrol improved remarkably the growth condition of mice planted with Hep-2 while enhancing their immunological function.

As a kind of biological response modifier, resveratrol could strengthen anti-tumor immunoresponse, accommodating lymphocyte to secrete cytokine, through which it exerted the efficiency of anti-laryngocarcinoma.
