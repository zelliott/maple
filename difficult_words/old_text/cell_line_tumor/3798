Four new alkylated anthraquinone analogues (1-4) were isolated from a soil actimomycete Streptomyces sp. WS-13394. The structures of compounds 1-4 were elucidated to be 1,4,6-trihydroxy-8-alkylanthraquinones by means of spectroscopic methods, including UV, one dimensional (1D), 2D-NMR and MS spectrometry. All compounds showed activities against BGC-823 and MCF-7 with IC50 from 0.99 to 3.54 µg/mL, while 2 exhibited cytotoxicity against HepG2, A875, BGC-823 and MCF-7 with IC50 2.29, 4.90, 0.99, and 1.66 µg/mL, respectively.
