Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines treated by genotoxic agents or by Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFalpha) acquire potent cytotoxicity towards myeloid cells through activation of granzyme B (GrB)/perforin (PFN) system. Here we first extend this observation to another death receptor activator, Fas Ligand (FasL). Moreover, we analyzed GrB induction signalling pathway in TNFalpha- and FasL-stimulated AML cells. The effects of TNFalpha and FasL on GrB expression were specifically mediated by p38MAPK (Mitogen-activated-protein-kinase) activation. Otherwise, TNFalpha and FasL stimulation led to radical oxygen species (ROS) generation and ASK1 (Apoptosis-signal-regulating-kinase-1) activation. Endogenous activation of ASK1 by either H2O2 or thioredoxin (Trx) reductase inhibition had the same effects as TNFalpha and FasL on GrB up regulation. Altogether, our results suggest that TNFalpha- and FasL-stimulated AML cell lytic induction is regulated by a signalling pathway involving sequentially, ROS generation, Trx oxidation, ASK1 activation, p38MAPK stimulation and GrB induction at mRNA and protein levels.
