The breast and ovarian cancer-specific tumor suppressor BRCA1, along with its heterodimer partner BRCA1-associated RING domain protein (BARD1), plays important roles in DNA repair, centrosome regulation, and transcription. To explore further functions of BRCA1/BARD1, we performed mass spectrometry analysis and identified Obg-like ATPase 1 (OLA1) as a protein that interacts with the carboxy-terminal region of BARD1. OLA1 directly bound to the amino-terminal region of BRCA1 and Î³-tubulin. OLA1 localized to centrosomes in interphase and to the spindle pole in mitotic phase, and its knockdown resulted in centrosome amplification and the activation of microtubule aster formation. OLA1 with a mutation observed in breast cancer cell line, E168Q, failed to bind BRCA1 and rescue the OLA1 knockdown-induced centrosome amplification. BRCA1 variant I42V also abrogated the binding of BRCA1 to OLA1. These findings suggest that OLA1 plays an important role in centrosome regulation together with BRCA1.
