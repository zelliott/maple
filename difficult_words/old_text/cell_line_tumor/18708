Anti-rhEPO McAb is valuable for the determination of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) levels for diagnosis of renal anemia and for doping control analysis. In this paper, anti-rhEPO hybridoma was prepared by fusion of SP2/0 murine myeloma cells with spleen cells isolated from immunized BALB/c mouse, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method to screen the positive hybridoma. The purified McAb was characterized by ELISA, SDS-PAGE, and Western-blotting. Experimental results showed that the subclass and the light chain of anti-rhEPO McAb was IgG1 and kappa light chain. The molecular weight of anti-rhEPO McAb was 166,000 Daltons. The affinity constant (K(aff)) of anti-rhEPO McAb with coated antigen was 5.0 x 10(5)L/mol.
