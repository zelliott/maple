It has been known for some time that the human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) E4orf6 and E1B55K proteins work in concert to degrade p53 and to regulate selective export of late viral mRNAs during productive infection. Both of these functions rely on the formation by the Ad5 E4orf6 protein of a cullin 5-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing elongins B and C. E1B55K is believed to function as the substrate recognition module for the complex and, in addition to p53, Mre11 and DNA ligase IV have also been identified as substrates. To discover additional substrates we have taken a proteomic approach by using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis to detect cellular proteins that decrease significantly in amount in p53-null H1299 human lung carcinoma cells after expression of E1B55K and E4orf6 using adenovirus vectors. Several species were detected and identified by mass spectroscopy, and for one of these, integrin alpha3, we went on in a parallel study to confirm it as a bone fide substrate of the complex (F. Dallaire et al., J. Virol. 83:5329-5338, 2009). Although the system has some limitations, it may still be of some general use in identifying candidate substrates of any viral cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and we suggest a series of criteria for substrate validation.
