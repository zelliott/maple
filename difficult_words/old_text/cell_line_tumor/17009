Cyclic peptide (arginine-glycine-aspartic-glutamic-valine acid, cRGD)-modified monomethoxy (polyethylene glycol)-poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)-poly (L-lysine) nanoparticles (mPEG-PLGA-PLL-cRGD NPs) with antitumor drug Mitoxantrone (DHAQ) or fluorescence agent Rhodamine B (Rb) encapsulated in their interior were prepared. The remarkable features of the mPEG-PLGA-PLL-cRGD NPs are the effective improvement for the cytotoxicity and uptake of the cell in vitro, and the significant enhancement of delivery ability for DHAQ or Rb in vivo. As a consequence, an excellent therapeutic efficiency for cancer is obtained, demonstrating the mPEG-PLGA-PLL-cRGD NPs play a key role in enhancing cancer therapeutic efficiency.
