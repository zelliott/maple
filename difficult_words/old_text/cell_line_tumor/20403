Increases in intracellular free Ca(2+) play a major role in many cellular processes. The deregulation of Ca(2+) signaling is a feature of a variety of diseases, and modulators of Ca(2+) signaling are used to treat conditions as diverse as hypertension to pain. The Ca(2+) signal also plays a role in processes important in cancer, such as proliferation and migration. Many studies in cancer have identified alterations in the expression of proteins involved in the movement of Ca(2+) across the plasma membrane and subcellular organelles. In some cases, these Ca(2+) channels or pumps are potential therapeutic targets for specific cancer subtypes or correlate with prognosis.
