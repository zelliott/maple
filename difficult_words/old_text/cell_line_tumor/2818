Bone tissue reacts in different ways to implant surfaces with different patterns. The aim of this study is to understand which laser generated surface pattern produces the best cell adhesion in vitro, evaluating both the activity of the alkaline phosphatase and the cells adhering to titanium samples. Tests were carried out on titanium samples with sandblasted surfaces with laser-produced holes with diameters of 5, 10, and 20 microm, and on sandblasted titanium cylinders without holes as controls. The samples were inserted into culture medium containing SaOS-2 cells for 3, 7 and 10 days. The results showed that at days 3 and 7 the laser surfaces stimulated a higher production of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) compared to the data from the control group. At day 10 there were no significant differences between the test group and the control group.
