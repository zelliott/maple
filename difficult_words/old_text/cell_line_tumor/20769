The JAK-STAT3 pathway regulates genes that are important in cell proliferation and thus is a promising target for cancer therapy. A high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign using an Apo-ONE Homogenous Caspase 3/7 assay in U266 cells identified 4-oxo-1-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester 4 as a potential STAT3 pathway inhibitor. Optimization of this HTS hit led to the identification of the 7-cyano analogue 8, which inhibited STAT3-Y705 phosphorylation with an EC 50 of 170 nM. Compound 8 also inhibited cytokine induced JAK activation but did not inhibit BCR-ABL activated STAT5 phosphorylation in K562 cells.
