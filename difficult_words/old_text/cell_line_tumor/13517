MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors in the malignant progression of different tumor types. MiR-663 was recently reported to be decreased and identified as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. We also verified its role in repressing cell proliferation of a gastric cancer cell line. In this study, however, miR-663 was found to be upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells compared with human immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelium cells, using a miRNA microarray, and this higher expression was confirmed in NPC tissue samples. Indeed, inhibition of miR-663 impaired the proliferation of NPC cells in vitro and the NPC tumor growth of xenografts in nude mice. Mechanistically, miR-663 directly targeted p21(WAF1/CIP1) to promote the cellular G1/S transition, as the inhibitory effects of miR-663 on the G1/S transition could be rescued by p21(WAF1/CIP1) silencing. Our results imply that miR-663 may act as an oncogene in NPC. The newly identified miR-663/p21(WAF1/CIP1) axis clarifies the molecular mechanism of NPC cell proliferation and represents a novel strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with NPC.
