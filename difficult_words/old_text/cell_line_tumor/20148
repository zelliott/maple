We found that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-EPF mRNA is highly expressed             in cervical squamous cancer relative to normal tissues and its expression levels             positively correlate with clinical stage. Reduction of E2-EPF protein levels by             >80% using shRNA decreases the expression levels of HIF-1Î±, and the proliferation,             invasion and tumorigenicity of SiHa, a cervical squamous cancer cell line. E2-EPF             knockdown also increases the chemosensitivity to topoisomerase I inhibitor (topotecan)             and II (etoposide and doxorubicin). Our results suggest that E2-EPF is associated             with the growth and aggressivity of cervical tumor cells. Targeting the E2-EPF             pathway may have potential clinical applications for the treatment of cervical             cancer.
