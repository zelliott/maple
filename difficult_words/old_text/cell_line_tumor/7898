Exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on cellular membranes and membrane-derived microvesicles stimulates a number of anti-inflammatory responses involved in malignant processes. Herein we show that B16F10 cells, a highly metastatic melanoma cell line, produce large quantities of PS-containing microvesicles in vitro. Tumor microvesicles increased TGF-beta(1) production by cultured macrophages and, in vivo, enhanced the metastatic potential of B16F10 cells in C57BL/6 mice, both effects being reversed by annexin V. Most strikingly, microvesicles induced melanoma metastasis in BALB/c mice, which are normally resistant to this tumor cell line. Altogether, this is the first demonstration that tumor-derived microvesicles favor the establishment of melanoma metastasis in a PS-dependent manner, possibly by down-regulating the host's inflammatory and/or anti-tumoral immune responses.
