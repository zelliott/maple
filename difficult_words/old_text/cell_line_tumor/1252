The targeted delivery of taxoids, in the form of taxane-antibody immunoconjugates, requires the preparation of taxoids containing moieties suitable for their conjugation to monoclonal antibodies. A series of taxoids incorporating a disulfide-containing linker at various positions of the taxoid framework have been prepared to investigate the most suitable position for conjugation. A second series of taxoids modified at the C-2 position aimed at increasing the potency of these taxanes has also been prepared.
