Two cucurbitacins, dihydrocucurbitacin B (1) and cucurbitacin B (2), which can be obtained in large amounts from the roots of Wilbrandia ebracteata and from the fruits of Luffa operculata, respectively, were used as starting materials for the preparation of a library of 29 semi-synthetic derivatives. The structural changes that were performed include the removal, modification or permutation of functional groups in rings A and B as well as in the side chain. All new semisynthetic compounds, as well as 1 and 2, were tested in vitro for their cytotoxic effects on non-small-cell lung cancer cells (A549 cells). Some of these compound displayed potent to moderate activity against A549 tumor cells, especially those cucurbitacin B derivatives which were modified at ring A.
