GnRH-II modulates ovarian cancer cells invasion and is expressed in normal ovary and ovarian epithelial cancer cells; however, the upstream regulator(s) of GnRH-II expression in these cells remains unclear. We now demonstrate that epidermal growth factor (EGF) increases GnRH-II mRNA levels in several human ovarian carcinoma cell lines and up-regulates GnRH-II promoter activity in OVCAR-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas an EGF receptor inhibitor (AG148) abolishes EGF-induced increases in GnRH-II promoter activity and GnRH-II mRNA levels. EGF increases the phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (p-CREB) and its association with the coregulator, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta, whereas blocking the EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation with MAPK inhibitors (PD98059/U0126) markedly reduced these effects. Moreover, depletion of CREB using small interfering RNA attenuated EGF-induced GnRH-II promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that EGF induces p-CREB binding to a cAMP responsive-element within the GnRH-II promoter, likely in association with CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta, and mutagenesis of this cAMP responsive-element prevented EGF-induced GnRH-II promoter activity in OVCAR-3 cells. Importantly, GnRH-II acts additively with EGF to promote invasion of OVCAR-3 and CaOV-3 cells, but not SKOV-3 cells that express low levels of GnRH receptor (GnRHR). Treatment with GnRHR small interfering RNA also partially inhibited the EGF-induced invasion of OVCAR-3 and CaOV-3 cells. Furthermore, EGF treatment transiently increases GnRHR levels in OVCAR-3 and CaOV-3, which likely accentuates the effects of increase GnRH-II production on cell invasion. These results provide evidence that EGF is an upstream regulator of the autocrine actions of GnRH-II on the invasive properties of ovarian cancer cells.
