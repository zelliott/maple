To explore the effects of nuclear protein-like transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group E member 1 (NR2E1) on the growth, division, and proliferation of neuroblastoma cell line IMR32.

A NR2E1 shiRNA plasmid vector was constructed and transfected into neuroblastoma cell line IMR32 using lipofedamineâ„¢2000. Subsequent cell growth was measured by cell counting and the protein expression of somatic nuclear division was examined by immunofluorescent staining.

At 48 h after the neuroblastoma cells IMR32 were transfected with NR2E1-shiRNA vector, the related nuclear division protein and the proliferation of the transfected cells IMR32 were remarkably depressed.

Cells division and proliferation of neuroblastoma cell line IMR32 is inhibited through transfection with the NR2E1-shiRNA plasmid vector.
