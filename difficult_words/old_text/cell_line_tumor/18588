In multiple myeloma (MM), bone marrow microenvironment has an important role for the survival and growth of plasma cells. We previously showed that a high bone turnover, induced by ovariectomy, increased MM cells growth in the 5T2MM model. The present study characterized a new plasma cell line (5THL) which was isolated from 5T2MM mice previously ovariectomized. Cells were propagated unchanged in normal C57BL/KaLwRij mice during six generations. 5THL was compared to the original 5T2MM phenotype. Paraproteinemia was detected 6 weeks post injection in 5THL mice and after 8 weeks in 5T2MM mice. All 5THL mice developed a hind-limb paralysis after 10 weeks. 5T2MM mice were euthanized at 16 weeks, due to a more progressive development of the disease. In 5THL mice, osteolytic lesions were observed after 8 weeks and severe bone destruction was evidenced at 10 weeks. In 5T2MM mice, minimal lesions were observed only after 10 weeks. Like in 5T2MM mice, no extra osseous lesions were observed in 5THL mice. The 5THL MM model closely mimics human myeloma with higher and faster bone aggressiveness. This new aggressive cell line, with a preserved phenotype, was selected by an altered microenvironment due to an increased bone turnover.
