Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) is required for embryonic epidermal morphogenesis including brain development, lung morphogenesis, and initiation of limb bud formation. In this study, we investigated the role of FGF10 as a lead induction factor for stem cell differentiation toward urothelial cell. To this end, human multipotent stem cell in vitro system was employed. Human amniotic fluid stem cells were co-cultured with immortalized bladder cancer lines to induce directed differentiation into urothelial cells. Urothelial markers, uroplakin II, III, and cytokeratin 8, were monitored by RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and Western blot analysis. Co-cultured stem cells began to express uroplakin II, III, and cytokeratin 8. Targeted FGF10 gene knockdown from bladder cancer cells abolished the directed differentiation. In addition, when FGF10 downstream signaling was blocked with the Mek inhibitor, the co-culture system lost the capacity to induce urothelial differentiation. Exogenous addition of recombinant FGF10 protein promoted stem cell differentiation into urothelium cell lineage. Together, this report suggests that paracrine FGF10 signaling stimulates the differentiation of human stem cell into urothelial cells. Current study provides insight into the potential role of FGF10 as a lead growth factor for bladder regeneration and its therapeutic application for bladder transplantation.
