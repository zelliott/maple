Gangliosides are abundantly expressed in the nervous system, and deregulated expression or activity of gangliosides is associated with the progression of various disorders, including lysosomal storage diseases, Guillain-Barre syndrome and Alzheimer disease. By contrast, previous studies show that GM1 ganglioside may act in a protective manner in the drug (e.g., MPTP and 6-OHDA)-induced Parkinsonian models, although the precise mechanisms have not been well addressed. In our recent publication, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)-linked neuroblastoma cells were treated with D-Threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), an inhibitor of glycosyl ceramide synthetase. These PDMP-treated cells develop lysosomal diseases characterized by reduced lysosomal activity, enhanced lysosomal permeability and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, PDMP-mediated inhibition of autophagy-lysosomal pathway result in both accumulation of alpha-synuclein and mutant beta-synuclein. Finally, these phenotypes are reversed by ganglioside treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that endogenous gangliosides may play a protective role against the lysosomal pathology of synucleinopathies.
