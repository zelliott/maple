Mutations in the BRCA1 gene are responsible for the majority of hereditary breast/ovarian cancers. The functional significance of many mutations/splicing variants identified during the screening of high-risk individuals is difficult to predict due to the lack of in vitro functional tests correlating sequence variants with a risk of cancer development. RNA interference is a promising tool in analyzing functional properties of BRCA1 mutations. Here we designed and functionally analyzed shRNAs directed to 3'-UTR of BRCA1 mRNA that may be used to knock-down expression of endogenous BRCA1. Using retroviral infection, we achieved long-term down-regulation of BRCA1 in a cell-type specific manner. We propose that 3'-UTR-directed shRNAs, coupled with up-regulation of exogenous mutated BRCA1 variants, may constitute a versatile system for the functional analysis of BRCA1 gene alterations.
