It has been reported that cancer stem cells may contribute to glioma radioresistance through preferential activation of the DNA damage checkpoint response and an increase in DNA repair capacity. We have examined DNA repair in five stem and nonstem glioma cell lines. The population doubling time was significantly increased in stem compared with nonstem cells, and enhanced activation of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases was observed in untreated CD133(+) compared with CD133(-) cells. Neither DNA base excision or single-strand break repair nor resolution of pH2AX nuclear foci were increased in CD133(+) compared with CD133(-) cells. We conclude that glioma stem cells display elongated cell cycle and enhanced basal activation of checkpoint proteins that might contribute to their radioresistance, whereas enhanced DNA repair is not a common feature of these cells.
