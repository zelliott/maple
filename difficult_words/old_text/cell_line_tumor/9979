The novel swine-origin influenza A H1N1 virus (S-OIV) causes the current pandemic. Its tissue tropism and replication in different cell lines are not well understood.

Compare the growth characteristics of cell lines infected by S-OIV, seasonal influenza A H1N1 (sH1N1) and avian influenza A H5N1 (H5N1) viruses and the effect of temperature on viral replication.

Cytopathic effect (CPE), antigen expression by immunofluorescence (IF) and viral load profile by quantitative RT-PCR in 17 cell lines infected by S-OIV, sH1N1 and H5N1 were examined. Comparison of their replication efficiency in chick embryo was performed. The effect of temperature on viral replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was determined by TCID(50) at 33 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C for 5 consecutive days.

S-OIV replicated in cell lines derived from different tissues or organs and host species with comparable viral load to sH1N1. Among 13 human cell lines tested, Caco-2 has the highest viral load for S-OIV. S-OIV showed a low viral load with no CPE or antigen expression in pig kidney cell PK-15, H5N1 demonstrated the most diverse cell tropism by CPE and antigen expression, and the highest viral replication efficiency in both cell lines and allantoic fluid. All three viruses demonstrated best growth at 37 degrees C in MDCK cells.

Cell line growth characteristics of S-OIV, sH1N1 and H5N1 appear to correlate clinically and pathologically with involved anatomical sites and severity. Low replication of S-OIV in PK-15 suggests that this virus is more adapted to human than swine.
