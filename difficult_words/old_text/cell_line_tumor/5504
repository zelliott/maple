The activities of cell surface serine proteases are markedly enhanced in malignant tumours. Proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix and basal membrane of normal cells is an important event for tumour cell growth and invasion. Two well-known broad-spectrum inhibitors of serine protease, Foy-305 and Ono-3403, were evaluated for their ability to affect the growth rate and survival of MCF7 breast cancer cells co-cultured with MRC5 lung fibroblasts as feeder cells in the absence of serum. Flow cytometry and differential staining demonstrated that in the mixed culture, the rate of tumor growth was dependent upon the presence of the feeder MRC5 lung fibroblasts and could be obviated by the additional presence of the inhibitors of serine proteases.
