Targeting aldosterone synthesis and/or release represents a potentially useful approach to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Aldosterone production is stimulated by angiotensin II (Ang II) or extracellular K+ and is mediated mainly by Ca2+ influx into adrenal glomerulosa cells through T-type calcium channels. We therefore examined the effects of efonidipine, a dual T-type/L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, on aldosterone secretion in the H295R human adrenocarcinoma cell line; 100 nmol/L Ang II and 10 mmol/L K+ respectively increased aldosterone secretion from H295R cells 12-fold and 9-fold over baseline. Efonidipine dose-dependently inhibited both Ang II- and K+-induced aldosterone secretion, and nifedipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, and mibefradil, a relatively selective T-type channel blocker, similarly inhibited Ang II- and K+-induced aldosterone secretion, but were much less potent than efonidipine. Efonidipine also lowered cortisol secretion most potently among these drugs. Notably, efonidipine and mibefradil also significantly suppressed Ang II- and K+-induced mRNA expression of 11-beta-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase, which catalyze the final two steps in the aldosterone synthesis, whereas nifedipine reduced only K+-induced enzyme expression. These findings suggest that efonidipine acts via T-type Ca2+ channel blockade to significantly reduce aldosterone secretion, and that this effect is mediated, at least in part, by suppression of 11-beta-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase expression.
