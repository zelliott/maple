The effects of the Akt inhibitor perifosine and the RAF/MEK/ERK inhibitor sorafenib were investigated using two CD30(+)Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines (L-540 and HDLM-2) and the CD30(-)HD-MyZ histiocytic cell line. The combined perifosine/sorafenib treatment significantly inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt phosphorylation in two of the three cell lines. Profiling of the responsive cell lines revealed that perifosine/sorafenib decreased the amplitude of transcriptional signatures that are associated with the cell cycle, DNA replication and cell death. Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) was identified as the main mediator of the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of perifosine/sorafenib. Combined treatment compared with single agents significantly suppressed cell growth (40-80%,  p<0.001), induced severe mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptotic cell death (up to 70%,  p<0.0001) in a synergistic manner. Furthermore, in vivo xenograft studies demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor burden ( p<0.0001), an increased survival time (81 vs 45 days,  p<0.0001), an increased apoptosis (2- to 2.5-fold,  p<0.0001) and necrosis (2- to 8-fold,  p<0.0001) in perifosine/sorafenib-treated animals compared with mice receiving single agents. These data provide a rationale for clinical trials using perifosine/sorafenib combination.
