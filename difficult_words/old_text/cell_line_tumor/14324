SCC-S2/GG2-1/NDED (approved gene symbol TNFAIP8) is a transcription factor NF-kappaB-inducible, antiapoptotic, and oncogenic molecule. In this study, we examined the role of SCC-S2 in invasion and experimental metastasis. We demonstrate that expression of SCC-S2 cDNA in MDA-MB 435 human breast cancer cells is associated with enhanced invasion in vitro and increased frequency of pulmonary colonization of tumor cells in athymic mice. Systemic treatment of athymic mice with a cationic liposomal formulation of SCC-S2 antisense oligo led to decreased incidence of pulmonary metastasis and inhibition of SCC-S2 expression in vivo. Antisense inhibition of endogenous SCC-S2 expression correlated with decreased expression of VEGF receptor-2 in tumor cells and human lung microvascular endothelial cells and loss of endothelial cell viability. In addition, downregulation of SCC-S2 expression in tumor cells was associated with decreased expression of known metastasis-related molecules MMP-1 and MMP-9. These results demonstrate a novel role for SCC-S2 in tumor progression, involving multiple effectors, and provide a basis for SCC-S2-targeted cancer gene therapy.
