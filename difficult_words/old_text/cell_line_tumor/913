Ca2+-activated K+ channels were studied in C6-glioma cells in an attempt to correlate changes in expression with cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we treated C6-glioma cells with thapsigargin for 48 h. Cell proliferation was markedly inhibited, and cell morphology changed from round to a spindle differentiated shape. Furthermore, intracellular calcium concentration was initially increased during acute treatment with thapsigargin. The internal [Ca2+]i pool was eventually depleted after a 48-h thapsigargin treatment. We have characterized Ca2+-activated K+ currents in less differentiated C6 cells. After differentiation of C6 cells induced by thapsigargin, Ca2+-activated K+ currents were selectively suppressed. These data lend further support to the notion that the expression of Ca2+-activated K+ channels is intimately associated with the proliferation of C6-glioma cells, and the suppression of Ca2+-activated K+ channels coincides with the inhibition of proliferation and subsequent induction of cell differentiation.
