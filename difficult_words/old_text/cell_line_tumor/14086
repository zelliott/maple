A series of rhodanine derivatives was synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit PRL-3. Benzylidene rhodanine derivative showed good biological activity, while compound 5e was the most active in this series exhibiting an IC50 value of 0.9 microM in vitro and showed a reduced invasion in cell-based assay.
