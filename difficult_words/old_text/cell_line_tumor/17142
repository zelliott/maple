We have demonstrated that the basement membrane regulates the myoepithelioma. We are now studying the effect of laminin, a basement membrane protein, in the morphology of a cell line (M1) derived from human salivary gland plasmacytoid myoepithelioma. These cells were grown inside a three-dimensional preparation of laminin-1. Phenotype differences were assessed by light and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, we analysed the effect of a molecular domain of laminin-1, the peptide SIKVAV, on M1 cells. This peptide was chosen because it is effective in cell proliferation and differentiation. M1 cells grown inside laminin-1 were mostly plasmacytoid-like, while cells treated by SIKVAV showed light and electron microscopic features of typical plasmacytoid cells. This peptide also modulated smooth-muscle actin expression in M1 cells. We demonstrated that laminin-1 and its derived peptide SIKVAV morphoregulates myoepithelioma cells in culture.
