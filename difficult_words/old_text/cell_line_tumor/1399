To investigate the antitumor lymphangiogenesis activity and the synergistic effect of indomethacin and oxaliplatin in a transplantation tumor model of human lung cancer in nude mice.

Human lung cancer A549 cells were injected subcutaneously into BALB/c nude mice. The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: the control group, the indomethacin group, the oxaliplatin group, and the indomethacin combined with oxaliplatin group. The tumor volume was measured in a 7 day interval, and the mice were sacrificed after 42 days. The tumor tissues were collected and prepared for detection by immunohistochemistry of expressions of VEGF-C, Survivin, β-catenin and intratumoral microlymphatic density(MLD). Real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR was performed for detecting the expression of VEGF-C and Survivin mRNA. SPSS version 16.0 was used for statistical analysis. Data were present as (x(-) ± s), and means were compared with analysis of variance. The correlation of 2 variables was analyzed by liner correlation analysis.

The tumor volumes in the indomethacin group, oxaliplatin group, and indomethacin plus oxaliplatin group [(1322 ± 327) mm(3), (962 ± 221) mm(3), (611 ± 161) mm(3)] decreased significantly as compared with that of the control group [(1664 ± 318) mm(3), F = 23.331, P < 0.01]. Compared with the control group, the expression levels of VEGF-C, Survivin, β-catenin and MLD protein in the indomethacin group, and indomethacin plus oxaliplatin group were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical studies showed an increase in the expression of VEGF-C in the oxaliplatin group (20 825 ± 2067) as compared to the control group (16 075 ± 875, F = 97.24, P < 0.05), but no significant differences in β-catenin and MLD (17 396 ± 1693, 9666 ± 978) as compared with the control group (9824 ± 1181, 17 588 ± 1698)respectively, P > 0.05. VEGF-C and Survivin proteins were positively correlated with MLD respectively (t = 0.737, 0.662, respectively P < 0.01), and β-catenin protein was positively correlated with Survivin protein (r = 0.582, P < 0.01). VEGF-CmRNA was positively correlated with its protein (r = 0.873, P < 0.01).

The combined use of indomethacin and oxaliplatin promoted antitumor lymphangiogenesis activity, possible by inhibiting the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 and Wnt pathways.
