A series of 3-substituted benzamide derivatives structurally related to STI-571 (imatinib mesylate), a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), was prepared and evaluated for antiproliferative activity against the Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia cell line K562. About ten 3-halogenated and 3-trifluoromethylated benzamide derivatives were identified as highly potent Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors. One of these, NS-187 (9b), is a promising new candidate Bcr-Abl inhibitor for the therapy of STI-571-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia.
