A reduced peptide bond analogue of RA-VII, [Tyr-5-Î¨(CH(2)NMe)-Tyr-6]RA-VII (3), was designed and synthesized. The key reduced cycloisodityrosine unit was prepared by reduction of the cycloisodityrosine derived from natural RA-VII, followed by connection with the tetrapeptide segment to afford a hexapeptide. Subsequent macrocyclization of the hexapeptide with FDPP under dilute conditions gave 3. Analogue 3 showed cytotoxic activity against P-388 cells, but its activity was much weaker than that of parent peptide RA-VII.
