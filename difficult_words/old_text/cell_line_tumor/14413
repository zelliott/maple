We conducted a study on the functional characteristics of mitochondria in an oxyphilic thyroid tumor cell line, which may provide useful clues about Hürthle cell tumors carcinogenesis.

The functional study on thyroid tumors with cell oxyphilia (Hürthle cell tumors), characterized by mitochondrial hyperplasia, was carried out in XTC.UC1, and B-CPAP, an oxyphilic and nonoxyphilic thyroid tumor cell line, respectively.

XTC.UC1 cell line showed higher activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and II and decreased activity of complex III. The increased activity of complex I was not matched by increased expression of complex I subunits. The XTC.UC1 cells relied mostly on oxidative phosphorylation for energy conservation, although their mitochondrial energetic function was less efficient when related to mitochondrial content of the cells. Finally, the oxyphilic cell line produced significantly higher amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in comparison with B-CPAP cell line.

The involvement of ROS in mitochondrial biogenesis and proliferation as well as in carcinogenesis and apoptosis indicate that differences in activity of respiratory chain components and their unbalance may be responsible for development of morphological and functional changes observed in thyroid tumors with cell oxyphilia.
