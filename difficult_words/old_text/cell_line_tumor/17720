IL-21 is an immune-stimulatory four alpha helix cytokine produced by activated T cells. To study the in vivo antitumor activities of IL-21, TS/A murine mammary adenocarcinoma cells were genetically modified to secrete IL-21 (TS/A-IL-21). These cells developed small tumors that were subsequently rejected by 90% of s.c. injected syngeneic mice. Five days after injection, TS/A-IL-21 tumors showed numerous infiltrating granulocytes, NK cells, and to a lesser extent CD8(+) T cells, along with the expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. At day 7, CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells increased together with IFN-gamma, and the CXC chemokines IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10, monokine induced by IFN-gamma, and IFN-inducible T cell alpha-chemoattractant. The TS/A-IL-21 tumor displayed a disrupted vascular network with abortive sprouting and signs of endothelial cell damage. In vivo depletion experiments by specific Abs showed that rejection of TS/A-IL-21 cells required CD8(+) T lymphocytes and granulocytes. When injected in IFN-gamma-deficient mice, TS/A-IL-21 cells formed tumors that regressed in only 29% of animals, indicating a role for IFN-gamma in IL-21-mediated antitumor response, but also the existence of IFN-gamma-independent effects. Most immunocompetent mice rejecting TS/A-IL-21 cells developed protective immunity against TS/A-pc (75%) and against the antigenically related C26 colon carcinoma cells (61%), as indicated by rechallenge experiments. A specific CTL response against the gp70-env protein of an endogenous murine retrovirus coexpressed by TS/A and C26 cells was detected in mice rejecting TS/A-IL-21 cells. These data suggest that IL-21 represents a suitable adjuvant in inducing specific CTL responses.
