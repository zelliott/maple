ATBF1 was first discovered as a suppressor of AFP expression in hepatocytes. It is present in brain, adult liver, lung, and gastro-intestinal tract. Recently, it has been reported that ATBF1 regulates myoblastic differentiation and interacts with v-Myb in regulation of its transactivation. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we searched for protein-protein interactions to uncover new functions for ATBF1. We present here experimental evidence that ATBF1 is a new regulatory factor for STAT3-mediated signal transduction through its interaction with PIAS3. PIAS3 was thus identified as an ATBF1-binding protein. In co-transfection experiments, the full-length ATBF1 was found to form complexes with PIAS3 in Hep G2 cells. In the luciferase assay, ATBF1 was found to have no influence on STAT3 signaling induced by IL-6 stimulation, but it did synergistically enhance PIAS3 inhibition of activated STAT3. In conclusion, ATBF1 can suppress the IL-6-mediated cellular response by acting together with PIAS3.
