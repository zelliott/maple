CC-5079, a small molecule inhibitor of tubulin polymerization and phosphodiesterase-4 activity, was evaluated for antiangiogenic and antitumor activities.

First, CC-5079 in vitro activity on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), fibroblasts, and MC38 were evaluated by proliferation, migration, and invasion assays. Second, CC-5079 effect on microvessel formation was evaluated ex vivo by chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), rat aortic rings assays, and with directed in vivo angiogenesis assay (DIVAA). Third, CC-5079 antitumor effect was determined in treatment of C57BL/6 mice with MC38 tumors. Finally, CC-5079 modulation of MKP1 in HUVECs, human fibroblast, and MC38 were determined by RNA isolation for qRT-PCR.

At the 0.1 μM concentration CC-5079 significantly inhibited HUVEC, fibroblast, and MC38 proliferation and migration (all P < 0.001). At the 0.1 μM concentration, CC-5079 also inhibited HUVEC invasion (P < 0.05) but not fibroblast. In the CAM and rat aortic ring assays, CC-5079 at 0.1 μM inhibited microvessel formation (P < 0.05). By DIVAA, CC-5079 at 1 mg/kg/d continuous delivered inhibited microvessel formation (P < 0.05). Intraperitoneal CC-5079 was well tolerated and inhibited the growth of subcutaneous MC38 at 100 mg/kg/d (P < 0.01). By qRT-PCR, CC-5079 stimulated MKP1 expression in HUVEC and fibroblast.

CC-5079 demonstrated stimulation of MKP1, antiangiogenic, and antitumor properties.
