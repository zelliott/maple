Cytotoxicity-guided fractionation of the stems of Helicteres hirsuta, of Indonesian origin, led to the isolation and identification of six lignans, namely, (+/-)-pinoresinol, (+/-)-medioresinol, (+/-)-syringaresinol, (-)-boehmenan, (-)-boehmenan H and (+/-)-trans-dihydrodiconiferyl alcohol. Of these isolates, (+/-)-pinoresinol exhibited potent cytotoxic effects when evaluated against a small panel of cancer cell lines.
