The knockdown of Pim-1 or inhibition of Pim-1 activity significantly increased Î³-H2A.X expression. The effect was correlated to apoptosis and was attributed to the inhibition of nonhomologous DNA-end-joining (NHEJ) repair activity supported by the following observations: (1) inhibition of ATM and DNA-PKcs activities, (2) down-regulation of Ku expression and nuclear localization and (3) decrease of DNA end-binding of both Ku70 and Ku80. The data suggest that Pim-1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of NHEJ repair. In the absence of Pim-1, the ability of DNA repair significantly decreases when exposed to paclitaxel, leading to severe DNA damage and apoptosis.
