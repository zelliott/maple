An increasing number of studies suggest that disturbances in cholesterol homeostasis may promote the formation and deposition of beta-amyloid (A beta) and the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this paper, we have analyzed the effect of the lipid-lowering compound rosuvastatin on apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to A beta(1-42) alone resulted in a significantly increased caspase-3 activity approximately by 35% (135+/-15%,  p<0.05), and decreased alpha-secretase activity by 34% (67.4+/-2.7%,  p<0.001) compared to the controls (100+/-18.1%). Rosuvastatin alone decreased caspase-3 activity by 15% (85.3+/-1.5%,  p<0.0005) compared to the controls and by 50% to cells exposed to A beta alone ( p<0.00005). Cells exposed to rosuvastatin alone had a higher alpha-secretase activity compared to cells exposed to A beta (76.4+/-23.8%, n.s.) but a slightly lower activity compared to the controls (n.s.). Pre-treatment of SY-SY5Y cells with rosuvastatin prior to incubation with A beta(1-42) resulted in decreased caspase-3 activity by approximately 15% compared to the controls and by approximately 48% (86.8+/-16.9%,  p<0.05) compared to cells treated with A beta(1-42) alone. Also, alpha-secretase activity was increased by approximately 50% compared to the controls and by 84% (151.3+/-10.1%,  p<0.05), compared to cells treated with A beta(1-42) alone. Mevalonate abrogated the effect of rosuvastatin in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that the hydrophilic compound rosuvastatin decreases caspase-3 activity and increases alpha-secretase activity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells exposed to A beta in vitro. These effects are essential for modulation of the amyloidogenic pathway and mediators of apoptosis in AD.
