The infiltration of both monocyte and activated T cells in the skin is one of critical steps in the development of UVB-induced inflammation. Upregulation of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on the surface of keratinocytes plays an important role in this process. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism responsible for UVB-induced expression of ICAM-1 and subsequent monocyte adhesion by keratinocyte. We observed that (1) UVB induced protein and mRNA expression of ICAM-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in human keratinocyte cell HaCaT; (2) UVB induced the translocation of NF-kappaB and inhibition of NF-kappaB by NF-kappaB inhibitors suppressed UVB-induced mRNA and protein expression of ICAM-1; (3) UVB increased the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by HaCaT cells; (4) UVB-induced increase of intracellular ROS level was suppressed by pretreatment with diphenyl iodonium (DPI) and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC); and (5) inhibition of UVB-induced ROS production by DPI or NAC suppressed UVB-mediated translocation of NF-kappaB, expression of ICAM-1 and subsequent monocyte adhesion in HaCaT cells. These results suggest that UVB-induced ROS is involved in the translocation of NF-kappaB which is responsible for expression of ICAM-1 and subsequent increased monocyte adhesion in human keratinocyte.
