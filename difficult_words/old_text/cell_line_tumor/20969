In vitro assessment of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and P-selectin expression on endothelial cells cocultured with c-erbB2-positive (SK-BR-3) and c-erbB2-negative (MCF-7) breast carcinoma cell lines.

The expression of adhesion molecules was determined by immunofluorescence, and measured by a laser scanning cytometer.

Endothelial cells cocultured with c-erbB2-negative breast carcinoma cell line--as compared to endothelial cells cultured without carcinoma cells--demonstrated an increase in the expression of VCAM-1 and P-selectin, a decrease in the expression of ICAM-1, and an increase of the maximal pixel intensity of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and P-selectin orange fluorescence. A higher increase of the expression and maximal pixel intensity of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and P-selectin was observed in endothelial cells cocultured with c-erbB2-positive breast carcinoma cells as compared to endothelial cells cocultured with c-erbB2-negative cell line.

An increase in the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells cocultured with c-erbB2-positive breast carcinoma cells may be responsible for the increased adhesion of tumor cells to endothelium and the increased invasiveness of c-erbB2-positive breast carcinomas.
