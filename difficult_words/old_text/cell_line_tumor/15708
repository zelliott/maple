Cytogenetic alterations, such as amplifications, deletions, or translocations, contribute to myeloid malignancies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of hematopoiesis, and their aberrant expression has been associated with leukemia. Genomic regions containing sequence alterations and fragile sites in cancers are enriched with miRNAs; however, the relevant miRNAs within these regions have not been evaluated on a global basis. Here, we investigated miRNAs relevant to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by (1) mapping miRNAs within leukemia-associated genomic alterations in human AML cell lines by high-resolution genome arrays and (2) evaluating absolute expression of these miRNAs by massively parallel small RNA sequencing. Seventy-seven percent (542 of 706) of miRNAs mapped to leukemia-associated copy-number alterations in the cell lines; however, only 18% (99 of 542) of these miRNAs are expressed above background levels. As evidence that this subset of miRNAs is relevant to leukemia, we show that loss of 2 miRNAs identified in our analysis, miR-145 and miR-146a, results in leukemia in a mouse model. Small RNA sequencing identified 28 putative novel miRNAs, 18 of which map to leukemia-associated copy-number alterations. This detailed genomic and small RNA analysis points to a subset of miRNAs that may play a role in myeloid malignancies.
