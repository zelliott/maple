Denosumab and Zoledronic acid (ZOL) are two antiresorptive drugs currently in use for treating osteoporosis. They have different mechanisms of action but both have been shown to delay the onset of skeletal-related events in patients with giant cell tumor of bone (GCT). However, the anti-tumor mechanisms of denosumab on the neoplastic GCT stromal cells remain unknown. In this study, we focused on the direct effects of denosumab on the neoplastic GCT stromal cells and compared with ZOL. The microscopic view demonstrated a reduced cell growth in ZOL-treated but not in denosumab-treated GCT stromal cells. ZOL was found to exhibit a dose-dependent inhibition in cell growth in all GCT stromal cell lines tested and cause apoptosis in two out of three cell lines. In contrast, denosumab only exerted a minimal inhibitory effect in one cell line and did not induce any apoptosis. ZOL significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in two GCT stromal cell lines whereas their protein levels remained unchanged. On the contrary, denosumab did not regulate RANKL and OPG expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the protein expression of Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (M-CSF), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), and Collagen Î±1 Type I were not regulated by denosumab and ZOL either. Our findings provide new insights in the anti-tumor effect of denosumab on GCT stromal cells and raise a concern that tumor recurrence may occur after the withdrawal of the drug.
