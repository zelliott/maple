The metabolism that sustains cancer cells is adapted preferentially to glycolysis, even under aerobic conditions (Warburg effect). This effect was one of the first alterations in cancer cells recognized as conferring a survival advantage. In this study, we show that gene associated with retinoid-interferon-induced mortality-19 (GRIM-19), which was previously identified as a tumor suppressor protein associated with growth inhibition and cell apoptosis, contributes to the switch between oxidative and glycolytic pathways. In parallel to this, vascular endothelial growth factor, which promotes neovascularization, is also regulated. We have identified hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) as the downstream factor of GRIM-19 in human glioblastoma cell lines. Downregulation of GRIM-19 promotes HIF1α synthesis in a STAT3-dependent manner, which acts as a potential competitive inhibitor for von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL)-HIF1α interaction, and thereby prevents HIF1α from pVHL-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Taken together, it is concluded that GRIM-19, a potential tumor suppressor gene, performs its function in part via regulating glioblastoma metabolic reprogramming through STAT3-HIF1α signaling axis, and this has added new perspective to its role in tumorigenesis, thus providing potential strategies for tumor metabolic therapy.
