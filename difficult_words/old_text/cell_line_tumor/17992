In antibody-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy (ADEPT), an antibody-bound enzyme localizes to tumor tissue, where it selectively converts a subsequently administered non-toxic prodrug into a cytotoxic drug. A33scFv::CDy is a bifunctional fusion construct comprising a single chain antibody against the gpA33 antigen and the prodrug-converting enzyme cytosine deaminase. gpA33 is highly and homogeneously expressed in >95% of all colorectal cancers. Here we describe the biodistribution and tumor-targeting capacity of 131I labeled A33scFv::CDy. 131I labeling of A33scFv::CDy was performed by the chloramine-T method, and the properties of the resulting [131I]A33scFv::CDy conjugate were determined in vivo and in vitro, including biodistribution studies in nude mice bearing human LIM1215 colon carcinoma xenografts. The [131I]A33scFv::CDy conjugate bound specifically to colorectal cancer cells in vitro with KD = 15.8 nM as determined by a saturation assay. in vivo, the tumor uptake of [131I]A33scFv::CDy peaked at 87% injected dose/g 47 h post injection. Normal tissue uptake was low, and activity in blood was lower than in tumor at all time-points studied (6-92 h). The tumor-to-blood ratio increased over time with a maximum of 8.1 at 67 h post injection. [131I]A33scFv::CDy thus shows a biodistribution that makes it attractive for both radioimmunotherapy (RIT) and ADEPT. Preliminary therapeutic experiments showed a significant reduction of tumor size in mice treated with the A33scFv::CDy-5-fluorocytosine/5-fluorouracil ADEPT system. This work demonstrates the feasibility of ADEPT and RIT based on the A33scFv::CDy recombinant construct.
