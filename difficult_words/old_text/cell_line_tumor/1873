In this study, we applied near-infrared fluorescent quantum dots (NIRF-QDs) for non-invasive in vivo and in situ imaging of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The U14 squamous cancer cell line with high expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was implanted subcutaneously into the head and neck regions of nude mice to establish HNSCC models. NIRF-QDs with an emission wavelength of 800 nm (NIRF-QD800) were conjugated with EGFR monoclonal antibodies to develop the QD800-EGFR Ab probe. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that the QD800-EGFR Ab probe can specifically bind EGFR expressed on U14 cells. U14 squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck can be clearly visualized by in vivo imaging after intravenous injection of QD800-EGFR Ab probes. The results suggested that in situ imaging using NIRF-QD-EGFR Ab probes has unique advantages and prospects for the investigation of tumor development, early diagnosis and personalized therapy of HNSCC.
