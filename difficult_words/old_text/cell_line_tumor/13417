MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have an important role in the development of chemosensitivity or chemoresistance in different types of cancer. Activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is a major determinant of diverse cellular processes and cancer development and is responsible for the transcription of several important miRNAs. Here we show a link between the ERK1/2 pathway and BIM expression through miR-494. We blocked ERK1/2 nuclear activity through the overexpression of an ERK1/2 natural interactor, the protein PED/PEA15, and we performed a microRNA expression profile. miR-494 was the most down-regulated microRNA after ERK1/2 inactivation. Moreover, we found that miR-494 induced Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through the down-modulation of BIM. Elucidation of this undiscovered ERK1/2 pathway that regulates apoptosis and cell proliferation through miR-494 in NSCLC will greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for TRAIL resistance and will provide an additional arm for the development of anticancer therapies.
