To investigate the correlation of the nuclear factor (NF-kappaB) and laryngocarcinoma circulating tumor cells (CTC), observe nuclear factor inhibitor PDTC on laryngeal cancer CTC and its possible mechanism.

In order to establish of laryngocarcinoma nude mice model ,The nude mice inoculated with laryngo carcinoma Hep-2 cells. To 50 nude mice were randomly divided into experimental group (PDTC pretreatment group), the control group (saline group), and Sham group (not inoculated carcinoma cells), tumor inoculated mice were labeled with CK-19 CTC markers, and sacrificed after 8 weeks, then RT-PCR detect CK-19mRNA expression in peripheral blood as to understand the expression of laryngocarcinoma CTC; removed tumor to determine its size, immunohistochemical expression of NF-kappaB in laryngocarcinoma, real-time fluorescence Quantitative PCR detection of laryngocarcinoma VEGF and MMP-9mRNA expression.

CTC occurrence and the expression of NF-kappaB was not obviously associated, expression in the CTC-positive laryngeal carcinoma, NF-kappaB-positive rate was 90%, while the expression of negative CTC laryngocarcinoma, NF-kappaB-positive rate was 56.7% (p>0.05), but connected with the activity of NF-kappaB; PDTC can inhibit NF-kappaB activation, reduce the incidence of CTC in laryngocarcinoma nude mice model, PDTC group CTC positive rate of 5%, significantly lower than the control group CTC positive rate of 45% ( p<0.01).

PDTC can reduce the incidence of CTC in the laryngocarcinoma nude mouse model, its role may benefit from PDTC reduced the ability of laryngocarcinoma metastasis, which may be as PDTC inhibit NF-kappaB activity, thus make VEGF-C and the expression of MMP-9 down, reducing angiogenesis and reduce tumor invasion of the larynx.
