Reactions of N-[N',N'-diethylamino(thiocarbonyl)]benzimidoyl chloride with 4,4-dialkylthiosemicarbazides give a novel class of thiosemicarbazides/thiosemicarbazones, H(2)L, which causes a remarkable reduction of cell growth in in vitro experiments. These strong antiproliferative effects are also observed for oxorhenium(V) complexes of the general composition [ReOCl(L)], which are formed by reactions of the potentially tridentate ligands with (NBu(4))[ReOCl(4)]. A systematic substitution of the alkyl groups in the thiosemicarbazone building blocks of the ligands do not significantly influence the biological activity of the metal complexes, while the replacement of the chloro ligand by a PPh(3) ligand (by the replacement of the oxo unit by a nitrido ligand) completely terminated the cytotoxicity of the metal complexes.
