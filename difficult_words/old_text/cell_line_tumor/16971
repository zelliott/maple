With the increase in molecular diagnostics and patient-specific therapeutic approaches, the delivery and targeting of imaging molecules and pharmacologically active agents gain increasing importance. The ideal delivery system does not exist yet. The realization of two features is indispensable: first, a locally high concentration of target-specific diagnostic and therapeutic molecules; second, the broad development of effective and safe carrier systems. Here we characterize the transport properties of the peptide-based BioShuttle transporter using FFM and CLSM methods. The modular design of BioShuttle-based formulations results in a multi-faceted field of applications, also as a theranostic tool.
