A series of functionally substituted pyrazole compounds have been synthesized and evaluated in vitro for their antiproliferative effects on a panel of 60 cellular lines, according to the National Cancer Institute screening protocol. Three of the 12 tested compounds showed moderate antitumor activity, one of them being chosen for the 5-dose assay and presented logGI(50) values up to -5.75.
