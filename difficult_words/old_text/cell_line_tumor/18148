In present study, a natural phenylalanine-rich cycloheptapeptide segetalin C (compound VIII) was synthesized by coupling and cyclization of peptide units Boc-gly-L-leu-L-his-OH and L-Phe-L-alaL-phe-L-pro-OMe and examined for different bioactivities. The structure of compound VIII was elucidated by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass spectral data and elemental analysis. It was demonstrated that the newly synthesized cyclopeptide has good activity against pathogenic fungi Candida albicans and dermatophytes, in addition to high cytotoxicityagainst Dalton's lymphoma ascites (DLA) and Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC) cell lines with CTC50 values of 3.35 and 5.72 micromol/L.
