Anticancer peptides are polycationic amphiphiles capable of preferentially killing a wide spectrum of cancer cells relative to noncancerous cells. Their primary mode of action is an interaction with the cell membrane and subsequent activation of lytic effects; however, the exact mechanism responsible for this mode of action remains controversial. Using zeta potential analyses we demonstrate the interaction of a small anticancer peptide with membrane model systems and cancer cells. Electrostatic interactions have a pivotal role in the cell killing process, and in contrast to the antimicrobial peptides action cell death occurs without achieving full neutralization of the membrane charge.
