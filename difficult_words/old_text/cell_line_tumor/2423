Sortase-mediated protein ligation is a biological covalent conjugation system developed from the enzymatic cell wall display mechanism found in Staphylococcus aureus. This three-component system requires: (i) purified Sortase A (SrtA) enzyme; (ii) a substrate containing the LPXTG peptide recognition sequence; and (iii) an oligo-glycine acceptor molecule. We describe cloning of the single-chain antibody sc528, which binds to the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), from the parental monoclonal antibody and incorporation of a LPETGG tag sequence. Utilizing recombinant SrtA, we demonstrate successful incorporation of biotin from GGG-biotin onto sc528. EGFR is an important cancer target and is over-expressed in human tumor tissues and cancer lines, such as the A431 epithelial carcinoma cells. SrtA-biotinylated sc528 specifically bound EGFR expressed on A431 cells, but not negative control lines. Similarly, when sc528 was labeled with fluorescein we observed antigen-specific labeling. The ability to introduce functionality into recombinant antibodies in a controlled, site-specific manner has applications in experimental, diagnostic, and potentially clinical settings. For example, we demonstrate addition of all three reaction components in situ within a biosensor flow cell, resulting in oriented covalent capture and presentation of sc528, and determination of precise affinities for the antibody-receptor interaction.
