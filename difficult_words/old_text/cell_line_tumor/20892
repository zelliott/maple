To study the effects of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on the adhesiveness and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells.

We determined the effect of IFN-gamma on the adhesiveness of prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 by treating the plate with fibronectin and laminin, on the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells into the artificial basal membrane consisting of Matrigel and fibronectin using the Transwell chamber, and on the expression of annexin-2 in these cells by Western blot.

The adhesion rates of prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 were 21% and 23% in the IFN-gamma treatment group, significantly lower than 46% and 40% in the untreated group (P < 0.05). The invasiveness of the cells was markedly decreased in the former as compared with the latter (P < 0.05). IFN-gamma significantly inhibited the expression of annexin-2 in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 (P < 0.05).

IFN-gamma can decrease the adhesiveness and invasiveness of the prostate cancer cell line by down-regulating the expression of annexin-2.
