RAB25 belongs to the Rab family of small GTPases and is implicated in the             development of various types of human cancer. To evaluate the role of RAB25 in             ovarian cancer, RAB25 was knocked down by siRNA in HEY and ESâ€‘2 human ovarian             cancer cells. Autophagy, cell growth and cell apoptosis were evaluated. The results             showed that knockdown of RAB25 increased acidic vesicle organelles and GFP-microtubule-associated             protein 1 light chain 3 punctate fluorescence in ovarian cancer cells. Autophagy             that promoted by knockdown of RAB25 was not observed in cells where the ERK1/2             signaling pathway had been inhibited by U0126. Knockdown of RAB25 reduced cell             cycle progression and cell growth. Apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells could be             induced by knockdown of RAB25. These results support the tumorigenic role of RAB25             in ovarian cancer cells.
