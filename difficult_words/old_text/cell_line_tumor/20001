The aim of this study was to determine whether the exposure to either single or multiple radio-frequency (RF) radiation frequencies could induce oxidative stress in cell cultures. Exposures of human MCF10A mammary epithelial cells to either a single frequency (837 MHz alone or 1950 MHz alone) or multiple frequencies (837 and 1950 MHz) were conducted at specific absorption rate (SAR) values of 4 W/kg for 2 h. During the exposure period, the temperature in the exposure chamber was maintained isothermally. Intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the ratio of reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) showed no statistically significant alterations as the result of either single or multiple RF radiation exposures. In contrast, ionizing radiation-exposed cells, used as a positive control, showed evident changes in all measured biological endpoints. These results indicate that single or multiple RF radiation exposure did not elicit oxidative stress in MCF10A cells under our exposure conditions.
