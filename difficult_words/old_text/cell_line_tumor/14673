A novel growth hormone secretagogues type 1a (GHS1a) receptors antagonist (2R)-N'-[3,5- bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2-[(8aR)-hexahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazin-2(1H)-yl]-2-(3- pyridinyl)ethanohydrazide (GSK1614343) was functionally characterised in rat pituitary adenoma cell line, RC-4B/C endogenously expressing GHS1a receptors. The antagonism profile of GSK1614343 was compared with that of 6-[(4-fluorophenyl)oxy]-2-methyl-3-{[(3S)-1-(1-methylethyl)-3- piperidinyl]methyl}-4(3H)-quinazolinone (YIL-781) another ghrelin receptor antagonist recently published. The activity of both compounds was also evaluated at rat recombinant GHS1a receptors. The characterization of the two antagonists was performed by intracellular calcium mobilization measurements by using fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) technology and inositol phosphate (IP) turnover measurements by [3H]-IP accumulation assay. RC-4B/C and U2-OS cells transiently transduced with rat GHS1a receptors virus were used. In RC-4B/C cells, GSK1614343 and YIL-781, depressed the ghrelin maximal response in FLIPR assay as result of hemi-equilibria phenomenon. When using the [3H]-IP accumulation assay both compounds behaved as competitive antagonist with pKB values of 8.03 for GSK1614343 and 7.54 for YIL-781. In rat recombinant receptor, GSK1614343 and YIL-781 inhibited the calcium response induced by ghrelin with pIC50 values of 7.90 and 8.27, respectively. GSK1614343 and YIL-781 did not show intrinsic activity in both endogenously expressed and recombinant rat GHS1a receptors. The new ghrelin receptor antagonist GSK1614343 is a potent competitive antagonist in rat pituitary RC-4B/C cells endogenously expressing GHS1a receptors when equilibrium conditions between ligand and receptor are reached in the test assay. GSK1614343 represents a useful tool to investigate the physiological relevance of the ghrelin system in rat models.
