Two new cyclobutane-type norlignans, methyl rel-(1R,2S,3S)-2-(7-methoxy-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-3-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)cyclobutanecarboxylate (1), and methyl rel-(1R,2R,3S)-2-(7-methoxy-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-3-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)cyclobutanecarboxylate (2), and a new lignanamide, 3-hydroxy-N-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-α-[4-(2-{N-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]carbamoyl}ethenyl)-3-methoxyphenoxy]-4-methoxycinnamamide 4,8″-ether (3), along with five known amides, 4-8, were obtained from the whole plant of Peperomia tetraphylla. Their structures were elucidated mainly by the analysis of NMR and MS data. The new compounds 1-3 and the known compound 4 were tested for their cytotoxic activities against the HepG2 (human hepatocarcinoma), A549 (human lung cancer), and HeLa (human cervical cancer) cell lines. Compound 4 showed significant cytotoxicity against HepG2 cell lines with an IC(50) value of 9.4 ± 1.0 μM.
