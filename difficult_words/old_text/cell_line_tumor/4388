Cells are generally stored at low temperature which slows their cellular metabolism. However, the stress induced by cold shock can lead to cell injury or death. Here, we found that exposing human leukemia HL-60 cells to cold shock followed by rewarming (CS/RW) increased the number of dead cells with remodeled genomic structures in which DNA fibers fully unfold and extrude into extracellular space, similar to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The unfolded DNA was associated with NET marker proteins, such as neutrophil elastase and histone H3, and could trap significant numbers of Escherichia coli. We also found that reactive oxygen species-a requisite for NET generation-accumulated during CS/RW in HL-60 cells. This treatment of HL-60 cells to trigger global DNA structural alterations has not been reported before, and helps to elucidate the mechanisms of human cellular response to cold stress.
