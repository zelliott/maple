Genetic diversity of the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori in an individual host has been observed; whether this diversity represents diversification of a founding strain or a mixed infection with distinct strain populations is not clear. To examine this issue, we analyzed multiple single-colony isolates from two to four separate stomach biopsies of eight adult and four pediatric patients from a high-incidence Mexican population. Eleven of the 12 patients contained isolates with identical random amplified polymorphic DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism, and vacA allele molecular footprints, whereas a single adult patient had two distinct profiles. Comparative genomic hybridization using whole-genome microarrays (array CGH) revealed variation in 24 to 67 genes in isolates from patients with similar molecular footprints. The one patient with distinct profiles contained two strain populations differing at 113 gene loci, including the cag pathogenicity island virulence genes. The two strain populations in this single host had different spatial distributions in the stomach and exhibited very limited genetic exchange. The total genetic divergence and pairwise genetic divergence between isolates from adults and isolates from children were not statistically different. We also analyzed isolates obtained 15 and 90 days after experimental infection of humans and found no evidence of genetic divergence, indicating that transmission to a new host does not induce rapid genetic changes in the bacterial population in the human stomach. Our data suggest that humans are infected with a population of closely related strains that vary at a small number of gene loci, that this population of strains may already be present when an infection is acquired, and that even during superinfection genetic exchange among distinct strains is rare.
