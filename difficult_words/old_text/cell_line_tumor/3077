By means of "emulsion-electrospinning", both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, paclitaxel (PTX) and doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), were successfully loaded into PEG-PLA nanofiber mats to realize multi-drug delivery. The release behaviors of both the drugs from the same fiber mats were ascribed to their solubility properties and distribution status in the fibers. Due to its high hydrophilicity, DOX was easy to diffuse out from the fibers, and its release rate was always faster than that of hydrophobic PTX. Moreover, the release rate of PTX was accelerated by DOX's release from the same drug-loaded fibers. In vitro cytotoxicity against rat Glioma C6 cells indicated that the dual drug combination showed a higher inhibition and apoptosis against C6 cells than a single drug-loaded system, which suggests the promise for multi-drug delivery on combination therapy.
