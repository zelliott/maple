Three canine osteosarcoma cell lines were established from spontaneous pelvic and radial osteosarcomas. The cell populations cultured exhibited characteristics of malignancy and consisted of adherent, pleomorphic, mostly large spindle-shaped or polyhedral cells, characterised by the presence of numerous cytoplasmic granules and vacuoles. The main ultrastructural features included the presence of abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and numerous cytoplasmic vesicles, deposit vacuoles and small cytoplasmic protrusions. Zymography showed that the cell lines produce high levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9, enzymes directly involved in crucial aspects of the metastatic process. Consistent with their osteoblastic lineage and malignant phenotype, all cell lines were immunoreactive to vimentin, osteopontin, PCNA, p53, MMP-2 and MMP-9, while they were negative for cytokeratin, desmin, SMA, Factor VIII, NSE, GFAP, Rb and p21 protein. No retroviral particles or RNA were detected ultrastructurally or with RT-PCR, although the possibility of viral involvement in osteosarcoma cannot be excluded. The new cell lines provide excellent in vitro models that may allow further studies on the pathobiology of canine osteosarcoma to be undertaken.
