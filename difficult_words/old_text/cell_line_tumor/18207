The gene for beta-agarase of an Agarivorans sp. JA-1 was expressed in Bacillus subtilis strain DB104 for efficient and economical mass-production of the enzyme. We isolated 360 mg protein with a specific activity of 201 U/mg from the culture broth. The efficiency of production was approximately 130-fold higher than that in E. coli. The enzyme produced neoagarohexaose, neoagarotetraose and neoagarobiose from agar. Neoagarooligosaccharides produced by the enzyme had a whitening effect and inhibited tyrosinase activity in the murine melanoma cell line, B16F10. Neoagarooligosaccharides were not cytotoxic to B16F10 or normal cells. beta-Agarase could therefore be a good whitening, cosmetic additive.
