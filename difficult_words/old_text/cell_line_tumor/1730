Isoflavones are a class of polyphenols that contain various substituents such as hydroxy, methoxy, and glycosyl groups. Methoxy groups are known to increase cell permeability and stability, but small structural changes can result in large differences in biological activity. In this study, the anticancer activities of several methoxy isoflavones were tested using a clonogenic survival assay. The relationship between structural properties of methoxy isoflavones and their anticancer activities on HCT116 colon cancer cell lines were studied quantitatively using comparative molecular field analysis and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis. The purpose of this study was to identify structural changes in isoflavones that increase the inhibitory effect on HCT116 colon cancer cell clonogenicity.
