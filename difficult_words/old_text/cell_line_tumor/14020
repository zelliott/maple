To observe the effect of polo like kinase 1 (plk1) gene depletion on the growth of gastric cancer cell line-MKN45 cells in vitro and vivo and discuss the feasibility and effectiveness of arranging plk1 as gene therapeutic target for gastric cancer.

The plk1 expression of MKN45 cells was inhibited by RNA interference (RNAi). The plk1 mRNA and protein level were measured by real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting, and the change of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rate were detected by flow-cytometry, and the MKN45 cells proliferation was measured by MTT method. MKN45 cells treated with plk1 siRNA were transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice and their tumorgenesis ability were observed, the plk1 protein levels of the samples from nude mice in different groups were compared.

After treatment with plk1 siRNA, plk1 mRNA and protein level decreased obviously in certain time, more MKN45 cells accumulated at G(2)/M (P < 0.05). Apoptosis rate of MKN45 cells treated with plk1 siRNA was higher than that of control cells at 48 h and 72 h (P < 0.05), and MKN45 cells proliferated slowly than control groups (P < 0.05), while the tumorgenesis ability obviously decreased, but the plk1 protein levels of the samples from nude mice in different groups were not different.

siRNA targeting plk1 can inhibit the proliferation of MKN45 cells in vitro and vivo. Plk1 may be a novel therapeutic target for gastric cancer.
