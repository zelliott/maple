Loss of MHC class II expression in B-cell lymphoma has been associated with a higher tumorigenicity resulting from lower titers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This report aims towards the identification of the molecular mechanism leading to defective MHC class II expression in a B-cell lymphoma cell line, Rec-1. We evidenced a coordinated alteration of HLA-D gene transcription, reminiscent of B lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with MHC class II deficiency. Genetic complementation performed between these cell lines and the lymphoma cells indicated that Rec-1 is altered in the MHC2TA gene. MHC2TA encodes the class II transactivator (CIITA), the master regulator of HLA-D gene expression. However, the coding sequence of the Rec-1 CIITA transcript did not reveal any mutation that could hamper the activity of the encoded protein. In agreement with the genetic complementation analysis, we evidenced a highly residual CIITA protein expression in the Rec-1 cell line resulting from a transcriptional defect affecting MHC2TA expression. Anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody treatment has proved efficient in the destruction of B lymphoma cells. Our data indicate that the appearance of variants losing CIITA, and thereby HLA-DR, expression will require a thorough monitoring during such immunotherapy protocols.
