Although surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are used to treat breast tumors, normal tissue tolerance, development of metastases, and inherent tumor resistance to radiation or chemotherapy can hinder a successful outcome. We have developed a thermally responsive polypeptide, based on the sequence of Elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), that inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation by blocking the activity of the oncogenic protein c-Myc. Following systemic administration, the ELP - delivered c-Myc inhibitory peptide was targeted to tumors using focused hyperthermia, and significantly reduced tumor growth in an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer. This work provides a new modality for targeted delivery of a specific oncogene inhibitory peptide, and this strategy may be expanded for delivery of other therapeutic peptides or small molecule drugs.
