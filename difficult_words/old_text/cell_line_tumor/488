Special delivery! Polyionic complex (PIC) micelles that contain the charge-conversional moieties citaconic amide or cis-aconitic amide were developed for cytoplasmic protein delivery. The increase of the charge density on the protein cargo helped the stability of the PIC micelles without cross-linking, and the charge-conversion in endosomes induced the dissociation of the PIC micelles to result in efficient endosomal release (see picture).
