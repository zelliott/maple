The total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) technique is a powerful tool for visualizing the process of insulin exocytosis. This technique allows us to observe the events just beneath the plasma membrane, allowing us to explore the molecular mechanism of insulin exocytotic processes such as docking and fusion. In this review, we describe the method of TIRF for visualizing insulin exocytosis in pancreatic beta-cells.
