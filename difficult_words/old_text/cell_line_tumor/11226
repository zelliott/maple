In this study we demonstrated that Triticuside A, one of the flavonoid compounds isolated from wheat bran, induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of human breast cancer cells. Triticuside A inhibited the proliferation of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) in a dose-dependent manner but barely showed cytotoxicity to the normal human fibroblasts. Triticuside A-induced apoptosis was accompanied by a significant decrease of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 proteins and by an increase of cleavage of caspases-3, -7, -9, and PARP. Triticuside A also suppressed the level of phospho-Akt and its downstream targets, mTOR and P70 S6 kinase. LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, significantly enhanced the Triticuside A-induced apoptosis. Moreover LY294002 not only downregulated the level of phospho-Akt but also enhanced the inhibition of Mcl-1 expression when combined with Triticuside A. Our results demonstrate for the first time the specific apoptogenic activity of Triticuside A in tumor cells and involvement of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Thus, Triticuside A may be a potentially useful wheat bran component that can be used for prevention or treatment of breast cancer.
