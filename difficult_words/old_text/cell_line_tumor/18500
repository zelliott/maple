The two known estrogen receptors, ER alpha and ER beta, are hormone inducible transcription factors that have distinct roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. The natural ligand, 17 beta-estradiol (E2), binds with high affinity to both ER alpha and ER beta. However, a close analogue, 16 alpha-iodo-17 beta-estradiol (16 alpha IE2) showed about 10-fold selectivity for ER alpha over ER beta. From X-ray studies, it has been shown that the ligand-binding domains (LBD) of the two receptors are strikingly similar, and that only two changes fall within the binding cavity (ER alpha Leu384 to ER beta Met336, and ER alpha Met421 to ER beta Ile373). To understand the molecular basis for the ER alpha selectivity of 16 alpha IE2, mutants and chimeras of ER alpha and ER beta were generated, and ligand-binding and transactivation functions were studied. The ER alpha Leu384 Met mutant behaved like ER alpha WT in the presence of 16 alpha IE2; whereas the profile of the ER alpha Met421 Ile mutant was similar to that of ER beta WT. The ER beta mutant Ile373 Met behaved like ER alpha with 16 alpha IE2. The results clearly demonstrate the role of ER alpha Met421 in the ER alpha selectivity of 16 alpha IE2.
