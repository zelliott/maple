The Bcl-2 gene is a member of the rapidly expanding Bcl-2 family of genes that regulate apoptosis. Bcl-2 has been shown to repress cell death triggered by a diverse array of stimuli, including chemotherapy and gamma irradiation.

The purpose of this study was to determine feline Bcl-2 expression level in feline lymphoma cells using an immunoblot assay with anti-human and anti-canine Bcl-2 monoclonal antibodies.

About 708 base pairs containing the coding sequence of the feline Bcl-2 gene were transformed into Escherichia coli. The recombinant Bcl-2 was used as a positive control for an immunoblot assay using mouse monoclonal antibodies against human and canine Bcl-2. An immunoblot assay using the monoclonal antibodies was carried out to determine the level of feline Bcl-2 expression in lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia cell lines.

The recombinant feline Bcl-2 protein produced in E. coli had a molecular weight of about 26 kDa and was detected by immunoblot assay by using anti-human Bcl-2 mouse monoclonal antibody. Feline Bcl-2 expression was high in lymphoma cell lines (FL-74-UDC-1 and FT-1) and low in the cell line from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy cat (FeTJ-1) but not low in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy cat. The anti-human Bcl-2 mouse monoclonal antibody was found to cross-react with feline Bcl-2.

These results confirm the expression of Bcl-2 in T-cell lymphoma cell lines and indicate that it is suitable to detect feline Bcl-2 using an immunoblot assay. Pending further evaluation, Bcl-2 expression might be useful in the differential diagnosis of feline tumors.
