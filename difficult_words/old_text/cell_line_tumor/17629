Our previous studies on rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells suggested that IK(Ca) channels similar to those in red blood cells (RBC) may be involved in the antigen-induced beta-hexosaminidase release. Since cetiedil blocks these channels in both cell types, we studied the inhibition by a selection of the synthetic analogues of cetiedil (UCL compounds) of antigen-induced beta-hexosaminidase release and 86Rb(+)-efflux from RBL-2H3 cells. We tested the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of cetiedil (UCL 1348 and UCL 1349), the more lipophilic triphenylacetic acid derivatives (UCL 1495 and UCL 1617) and (9-benzyl-fluoren)-9-yl derivatives (UCL 1608 and UCL 1710). They all inhibited antigen-induced beta-hexosaminidase release and 86Rb(+)-efflux. Their relative potency in inhibiting antigen-induced beta-hexosaminidase release was UCL 1608>1710>1617>1348>1349>1495, with IC(50) values of 9.6+/-0.6, 14.4+/-2.2, 23.4+/-1.4, 29.8+/-1.1, 77.5+/-11.8 and 104.6+/-14.7 (microM), respectively. These IC(50)s suggest some dissimilarity between IK(Ca) in RBL-2H3 cells and RBC. Lipophilicity and potency were well correlated in RBC, but not in RBL-2H3 cells.
