H-2 antigens from three murine tumor-cell lines (YAC, EL-4 and P815) were solubilized with triton X-100 and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were eluted from gel slices and assayed for inhibition by a target-effector binding (TBC) assay. Fractions inhibiting alloimmune T cells also contained serologically detectable H-2 molecules as judged by a complement-dependent microcytotoxicity-inhibition assay. Fractions containing Moloney cell-surface antigen (MCSA), gp 71, or p30 did not inhibit alloimmune TBC. H-2 antigens were selective for T cells since they failed to inhibit binding of natural killer (NK) cells to NK-sensitive targets, whereas, in the reciprocal experiment, the NK target antigens inhibited NK cells but not alloimmune T cell binding to intact targets. Cross inhibition tests in the T-cell system revealed that the H-2 molecules maintained their specific antigenic structure. These observations suggest that it will be possible to characterize further those parts of the subcellular H-2 preparations reacting with distinct killer T-cell clones.
