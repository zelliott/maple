Osteosarcoma is the third most frequent neoplasm in adolescents. Although chemotherapy, frequently used in pre- and post-operative settings, has resulted in significant improvement in disease-free survival, some patients show little sensitivity to chemotherapy and alternative therapeutic strategies are needed. Because the Fas ligand/Fas receptor (CD95, APO-1) apoptosis pathway is a potential therapeutic target in osteosarcomas, we examined the effect of IFN-gamma on Fas-induced apoptosis in four osteosarcoma cell lines.

As measured by flow cytometry, all cell lines expressed cell surface IFN-gamma receptors, and when cultured for 2 days in the presence of IFN-gamma, all cell lines exhibited a significant increase in expression of Fas receptors. By flow cytometric detection of intracellular fragmented DNA as a marker of apoptosis, all cell lines cultured with either IFN-gamma or anti-Fas antibody (clone CH-11) alone showed only moderate apoptosis, whereas significantly high levels of apoptosis occurred in cells cultured with both IFN-gamma and CH-11. Western blotting analysis also revealed that IFN-gamma caused up-regulation of caspase-8 in all cell lines, but no change in Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD/MORT1) or caspase-3. Both caspase-8 and caspase-3 were activated when apoptosis was induced with both IFN-gamma and CH-11. Addition to cultures of z-IETD-fmk, an inhibitor of caspase-8, significantly blocked this apoptosis.

IFN-gamma sensitizes osteosarcoma cells to Fas-induced apoptosis through up-regulation of Fas receptor and caspase-8. Combined immunotherapy with IFN-gamma and either anti-Fas monoclonal antibody or cytotoxic T cells that bear Fas ligand might be a useful adjunctive therapy for patients with osteosarcoma.
