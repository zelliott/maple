Oncolytic adenoviruses (Ads) are an emerging alternative therapy for cancer; however, clinical trial have not yet demonstrated sufficient efficacy. When oncolytic Ads are used in combination with taxoids a synergistic increase in both cytotoxicity and viral replication is observed. In order to generate a next generation oncolytic adenovirus, virion were physically conjugated to a highly potent taxoid, SB-T-1214, and a folate targeting motif. Conjugation was enabled via the metabolic incorporation of non-canonical monosaccharides (O-GlcNAz) and amino acids (homopropargylglycine), which served as sites for chemoselective modification.
