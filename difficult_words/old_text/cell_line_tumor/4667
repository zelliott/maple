A detailed phytochemical investigation of an extract of Bacopa monniera resulted in the isolation of two new dammarane glycosides along with eight known compounds. They have been identified as glycosides of the 20-deoxy derivatives of jujubogenin and pseudojujubogenin. The structures were established by different spectroscopic methods that included 1D and 2D NMR experiments. The compounds were tested for their cytotoxicity, antileishmanial, antimalarial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Only few compounds exhibited mild to moderate cytotoxicity towards non-cancerous kidney cell lines.
