Reduction of bare carbon dots (CDs) in aqueous NaBH(4) solution is a facile and effective approach to enhance their fluorescence without any surface coverage. CDs are treated with dilute aqueous NaBH(4) solutions, enhancing their quantum yields (QYs) successfully from 1.6 % to 16 % which is comparable to semiconductive QDs in aqueous environments. If pristine CDs are treated hydrothermally prior to reduction by NaBH(4), QYs reach 40.5 %. This value is among the highest QYs reported for bare CDs in the literature. The approach to enhance fluorescence through chemical reduction is generally applicable to other kinds of CDs synthesized by various methods. Alteration of the chemical structure of the CDs by NaBH(4)-reduction is analyzed by (13) C NMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy, which demonstrate that the carbonyl group content is decreased after NaBH(4)-reduction, whereas the number of sp(3)-type carbon defects is increased. The valence-band maxima (VBM) near the surface related to the surface energy bands of the CDs are estimated by XPS. VBM data show a semiconducting layer on the surface of the CDs, and the VBM of the CDs decrease with increasing NaBH(4)-reduction time. The layered graphite structures in the cores of the CDs are clearly observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). CDs could perhaps be regarded as semiconductive surface defect layers formed by chemical erosion over conductive graphite cores. Chemical reduction by NaBH(4) changes the surface-energy bands of the CDs, thus, enhances their fluorescence. The fluorescence properties of aqueous NaBH(4)-reduced CDs are also studied for possible biological applications.
