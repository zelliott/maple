Receptor-associated protein (RAP) is a ligand for all members of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor families. RAP is internalized into cells via receptor-mediated endocytic trafficking, making it an attractive mechanism for efficient gene delivery. In this study, we have developed a gene delivery system using RAP as a targeting ligand. A RAP cDNA lacking a C-terminal heparin-binding domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a human liver cDNA library and was reamplified by using a primer containing a cysteine codon at its carboxyl end to facilitate its conjugation to polylysine (polyK). RAP was purified using a bacterial expression system and coupled to poly-D-lysine (PDL) or poly-L-lysine (PLL) of average MW 50 kDa via the heterobifunctional cross-linker SPDP. Using fluorescence-labeled RAP ligand, cellular uptake of the transfection complexes into HepG2 cells was shown to be highly efficient and more specific to PDL-conjugated RAP compared with PLL-conjugated one. Plasmid DNA containing a luciferase reporter gene was condensed with either RAP-PDL or RAP-PLL. In vitro transfection into HepG2 cells with RAP-PDL conjugate resulted in significantly higher luciferase expression levels in comparison to either nonconjugated PDL, or RAP-PLL, or LipofecAMINE/DNA complexes in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. Luciferase expression was inhibited by the addition of excess RAP. Treatment of the cells with Lovastatin, which inhibits HMG-Co reductase and increases expression of LDL receptor, stimulates luciferase expression, suggesting that the gene delivery is specifically mediated by LDL receptor. Thus, RAP-PDL conjugates have the potential to be used as a new nonviral gene delivery vector.
