Estrogen receptor (ER) alpha is mutated (lysine 303 to arginine, K303R) in approximately one third of premalignant breast hyperplasias, which renders breast cancer cells expressing the mutant receptor hypersensitive for proliferation in response to low doses of estrogen. It is known that ERalpha is posttranslationally modified by protein acetylation and phosphorylation by a number of secondary messenger signaling cascades. The K303R ERalpha mutation resides at a major protein acetylation site adjacent to a potential protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site at residue 305 within the hinge domain of the receptor. Mutation of this phosphorylation site to aspartic acid to mimic constitutive phosphorylation blocks acetylation of the K303 ERalpha site and generates an enhanced transcriptional response similar to that seen with the naturally occurring K303R mutant receptor. Activation of PKA signaling by the cell-permeable cyclic AMP (cAMP) analog 8-bromo-cAMP further enhances estrogen sensitivity of the mutant receptor, whereas a specific PKA inhibitor antagonizes this increase. We propose that the hypersensitive ERalpha mutant breast cancer phenotype involves an integration of coupled acetylation and phosphorylation events by upstream signaling molecules.
