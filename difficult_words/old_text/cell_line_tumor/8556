The study investigated the effects of pemetrexed, gefitinib, and their combination on human colorectal cancer cells.

Six human colorectal cancer cells were exposed to pemetrexed, gefitinib, and their combination. Antitumor effects were measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Thymidylate synthase (TS) mRNA expression and EGFR mutation were studied by real-time RT-PCR and DNA sequence determination. Pharmacological interaction was studied using the combination index method. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. Activity assay was performed to assess the effects of drugs on TS activity, and Western blot was performed to assess the protein expression of pEGFR, pAKT, and pERK 1/2.

Six colorectal cancer cells are all sensitive to pemetrexed, and TS gene expression of cells was negatively related to pemetrexed sensitivity. The cytotoxic synergism was observed in concurrent pemetrexed combined with gefitinib and sequential pemetrexed followed by gefitinib. The combination of pemetrexed and gefitinib modulated cell cycle and induced apoptosis. Pemetrexed combined with gefitinib decreased TS mRNA expression and in situ activity. Pemetrexed induced an EGFR-mediated activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and ERK pathway, which was inhibited by gefitinib.

Pemetrexed is a promising agent, and pemetrexed combined with gefitinib has a significantly synergistic effect on colorectal cancer cells, which seems to present a strategy of pemetrexed combined with EGFR-TKIs in colorectal cancer treatment.
