In present publication we describe for the first time the obtainment of cancer stem cells from a weakly metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cell line MIP101 via selecting from the native population the cells that express intensively an embryonic stem cell marker, POU5F1 (Oct4). We provide the evidence that these cells possess an elevated clonogenic and tumorigenic potential when compared to the native population, and this correlates to the hypothesis of cancer stem cells' primary role in the development of malignant neoplasms.
