Both betulinic acid (BA) and mithramycin A (MIT) exhibit potent antitumor activity through distinct mechanisms of Sp1 inhibition. However, it is unknown whether a combination of these two compounds results in a synergistic inhibitory effect on pancreatic cancer growth and/or has a therapeutic advantage over gemcitabine. In xenograft mouse models of human pancreatic cancer, treatment with either BA or MIT alone showed dose-dependent antitumor activity but led to systemic side effects as measured by overall weight loss. Treatment with a nontoxic dose of either compound alone had only marginal antitumor effects. Importantly, combination treatment with nontoxic doses of BA and MIT produced synergistic antitumor activity, including inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. The treatment combination also produced less discernible side effects than therapeutic doses of gemcitabine. Moreover, combined treatment of BA and MIT resulted in drastic inhibition of Sp1 recruitment onto Sp1 and VEGF promoters, leading to transcriptional inhibition of both Sp1 and VEGF and downregulation of Sp1 and VEGF protein expression. Ectopic overexpression of Sp1 rendered tumor cells resistant to BA, MIT, and the combination of the two. Overall, our findings argue that Sp1 is an important target of BA and MIT and that their combination can produce an enhanced therapeutic response in human pancreatic cancer.
