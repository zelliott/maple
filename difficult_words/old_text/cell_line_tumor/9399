The importance of microenvironment and context in regulation of tissue-specific genes is well established. DNA exposure to or the sequestration from nucleases detects differences in higher order chromatin structure in intact cells without disturbing cellular or tissue architecture. To investigate the relationship between chromatin organization and tumor phenotype, we used an established three-dimensional assay in which normal and malignant human breast cells can be easily distinguished by the morphology of the structures they make (acinus-like versus tumor-like, respectively). We show that these phenotypes can be distinguished also by sensitivity to AluI digestion in which the malignant cells resist digestion relative to nonmalignant cells. Treatment of T4-2 breast cancer cells in three-dimensional culture with cAMP analogs or a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor not only reverted their phenotype from nonpolar to polar acinar-like structures but also enhanced chromatin sensitivity to AluI. By using different cAMP analogs, we show that cAMP-induced phenotypic reversion, polarization, and shift in DNA organization act through a cAMP-dependent protein-kinase A-coupled signaling pathway. Importantly, inhibitory antibody to fibronectin produced the same effect. These experiments underscore the concept that modifying the tumor microenvironment can alter the organization of tumor cells and demonstrate that architecture and global chromatin organization are coupled and highly plastic.
