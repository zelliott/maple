Livin is a member of the family of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs)             and tumor cell invasion is a general property of multiple IAPs. Livin is highly             expressed in prostate cancer (PCa) tissues. Livin overexpressing cells are more             resistant to apoptotic stimuli than normal cells. Thus, aberrantly increased cell             survival is an invariable requirement of metastasis. In this study, we investigated             whether livin signaling affects metastasis by transfecting siRNA targeting livin             into the DU-145 prostate cancer cell line to confirm the anti-invasion effect             and blockade of the livin gene. We found that livin knockdown inhibited DU-145             prostate carcinoma cell invasion. We investigated how livin promotes tumor cell             invasion, and found that livin induction of fibronectin contributed to tumor cell             invasion. In addition, we found that livin induction of fibronectin regulates             tumor cell invasion via nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. These data showed             that livin, as a gene directly promoting metastasis, can be useful for therapeutic             intervention against advanced and disseminated PCa.
