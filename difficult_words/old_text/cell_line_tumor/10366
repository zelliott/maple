Theranostic systems have been explored extensively for a diagnostic therapy in the forms of polymer conjugates, implantable devices, and inorganic nanoparticles. In this work, we report theranostic systems in situ assembled by host-guest chemistry responding to a request. As a model theranostic system on demand, cucurbit[6]uril-conjugated hyaluronate (CB[6]-HA) was synthesized and decorated with FITC-spermidine (spmd) and/or formyl peptide receptor like 1 (FPRL1) specific peptide-spmd by simple mixing in aqueous solution. The resulting (FITC-spmd and/or peptide-spmd)@CB[6]-HA was successfully applied to the bioimaging of its target-specific delivery to B16F1 cells with HA receptors and its therapeutic signal transduction with elevated Ca(2+) and phosphor-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) levels in FPRL1-expressing human breast adenocarcinoma (FPRL1/MCF-7) cells. Finally, we could confirm in vitro and in vivo stability of the highly specific host-guest interaction. The on-demand theranostic platform technology using host-guest chemistry can be exploited for various bioimaging, biosensing, drug delivery, and tissue engineering applications.
