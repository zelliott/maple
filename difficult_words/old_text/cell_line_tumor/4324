In glioblastoma, EphB4 receptors, a member of the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases, are overexpressed in both tumor cells and angiogenic blood vessels. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the EphB4-binding peptide TNYL-RAW labeled with both (64)Cu and near-infrared fluorescence dye Cy5.5 could be used as a molecular imaging agent for dual-modality positron emission tomography/computed tomography [PET/CT] and optical imaging of human glioblastoma in orthotopic brain tumor models.

TNYL-RAW was conjugated to Cy5.5 and the radiometal chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazadodecane-N,N',N″,N‴-tetraacetic acid. The conjugate was then labeled with (64)Cu for in vitro binding and in vivo dual μPET/CT and optical imaging studies in nude mice implanted with EphB4-expressing U251 and EphB4-negative U87 human glioblastoma cells. Tumors and brains were removed at the end of the imaging sessions for immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence microscopic examinations.

μPET/CT and near-infrared optical imaging clearly showed specific uptake of the dual-labeled TNYL-RAW peptide in both U251 and U87 tumors in the brains of the nude mice after intravenous injection of the peptide. In U251 tumors, the Cy5.5-labeled peptide colocalized with both tumor blood vessels and tumor cells; in U87 tumors, the tracer colocalized only with tumor blood vessels, not with tumor cells.

Dual-labeled EphB4-specific peptide could be used as a noninvasive molecular imaging agent for PET/CT and optical imaging of glioblastoma owing to its ability to bind to both EphB4-expressing angiogenic blood vessels and EphB4-expressing tumor cells.
