A growing body of evidence indicates that dysregulation of cerebral biometals (Fe, Cu, Zn) and their interactions with APP and Abeta amyloid may contribute to the Alzheimer's amyloid pathology, and thus metal chelation could be a rational therapeutic approach for interdicting AD pathogenesis. However, poor target specificity and consequential clinical safety of current metal-complexing agents have limited their widespread clinical use. To develop the next generation of metal chelators, we have designed and synthesized a new bifunctional molecule-XH1, based on a novel 'pharmacophore conjugation' concept. This lipophilic molecule has both amyloid-binding and metal-chelating moieties covalently connected by amide bonds. It achieved a putative binding geometry with Abeta1-40 peptide by the computational chemistry modeling and reduced Zn(II)-induced Abeta1-40 aggregation in vitro as determined by turbidometry. Moreover, our pilot data indicated that XH1 has no significant neurotoxicity at low micromolar concentrations and acute animal toxicity. XH1 specifically reduced APP protein expression in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and attenuated cerebral Abeta amyloid pathology in PS1/APP transgenic mice without inducing apparent toxicity and behavior disturbances. Collectively, these preliminary findings carry implication for XH1 being a BBB-permeable lead compound for AD therapeutics targeting Alzheimer's amyloidogenesis, although further studies are needed.
