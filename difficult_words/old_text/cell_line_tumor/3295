The effect of pitavastatin on the mRNA levels of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in HepG2 cells was examined to establish whether pitavastatin affects bile acid synthesis and if so, to determine a possible molecular mechanism.

HepG2 cells were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium for 18 h before drug treatment. Total RNA was extracted at set times and mRNA levels were quantified by reverse transcription-real time polymerase chain reaction. Pitavastatin at 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 micromol/L increased the mRNA levels of apo A-I, PPARalpha, CYP7A1, and FXR in a dose-dependent manner. The mRNA levels of apo A-I, PPAR alpha, CYP7A1, and FXR similarly increased with increasing doses of pitavastatin. Coincubation of mevalonate (4 mmol/L) with pitavastatin (5 micromol/L) reversed the inductive effects of pitavastatin on the mRNA levels of these genes, indicating that the inductive effects of pitavastatin were related to its inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.

Pitavastatin increased the mRNA levels of CYP7A1 in HepG2 cells, suggesting that increased conversion of cholesterol to bile acids may be the mechanism for its potent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering effects.
