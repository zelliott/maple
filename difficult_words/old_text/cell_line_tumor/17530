Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is known to possess tumor suppressor functions. In contradiction, TSP1 enhances the stromal vascularization and growth of certain cancers. A cell adhesion receptor, CD36, has been shown to interact with a ligand TSP1. We studied how CD36 affects the growth of the osteosarcoma cell line (HOS) expressing TSP1. We used the anti-CD36 ribozyme to specifically suppress CD36 gene expression in the HOS. The expression of the CD36 mRNA was significantly suppressed in the ribozyme-introduced cell line (HOS/Rz). The transformant HOS/Rz markedly decreased its growth. The growth of the osteosarcoma cell line HOS may be regulated by autocrine or paracrine loop TSP1 and CD36.
