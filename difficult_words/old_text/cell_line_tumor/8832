Glypican-5 (GPC5) may be a potential tumor suppressor gene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study aimed to clarify the GPC5 expression pattern and to explore its potential functions in NSCLC. The expression of GPC5 gene was lower in lung cancer tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. The GPC5 gene expression in the lymph node metastasis group was remarkably lower than that in the non-metastasis group. The tissue microarray (TMA) study found that the overall survival rate of GPC5-positive group was significantly higher than that of GPC5-negative group in AC subgroup. Overexpressing GPC5 in NSCLC cell lines significantly suppressed their migration, invasion, and proliferation activities and also induced G1/S phase arrest of the cells in vitro. Our data suggest that GPC5 is a novel metastasis suppressor gene in NSCLC and may be a potential biomarker that predicts NSCLC metastasis.
