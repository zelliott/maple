Recently we generated a mathematical model (Bentele, M., Lavrik, I., Ulrich, M., Stosser, S., Heermann, D. W., Kalthoff, H., Krammer, P. H., and Eils, R. (2004) J. Cell Biol. 166, 839-851) of signaling in CD95(Fas/APO-1)-mediated apoptosis. Mathematical modeling in combination with experimental data provided new insights into CD95-mediated apoptosis and allowed us to establish a threshold mechanism of life and death. Here, we further assessed the predictability of the model experimentally by a detailed analysis of the threshold behavior of CD95 signaling. Using the model predictions for the mechanism of the threshold behavior we found that the CD95 DISC (death-inducing signaling complex) is formed at the cell membrane upon stimulation with low concentrations of agonistic anti-APO-1 monoclonal antibodies; however, activation of procaspase-8 at the DISC is blocked due to high cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein recruitment into the DISC. Given that death signaling does not occur upon CD95 stimulation at low (threshold) anti-APO-1 concentrations, we also analyzed survival signaling, focusing on mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Interestingly, we found that mitogen-activated protein kinase activation takes place under threshold conditions. These findings show that triggering of CD95 can signal both life or death, depending on the strength of the stimulus.
