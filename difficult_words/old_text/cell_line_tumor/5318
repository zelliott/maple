Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal estrogen-receptor modulator widely used in the treatment of breast cancer. Apoptosis has been reported to be a major mechanism for its antitumor effect. In the current studies, an endeavor was made to investigate the efficacy of vesicularly encapsulated tamoxifen on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Phospholipid-based vesicular systems viz. conventional liposomes and elastic-membrane liposomes were employed to encapsulate the drug. The MTT colorimetric assay was used to determine the efficacy of the tested formulations. The results demonstrated composition-dependent strong inhibition in the viability of MCF-7 cells with encapsulated tamoxifen vis-Ã -vis free drug. The encouraging findings from the current work construe immense potential of the lipid-based vesicular systems in the treatment of breast cancer.
