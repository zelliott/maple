Silica/titania hollow nanoparticles (HNPs) with 50 nm were fabricated by using the dissolution and redeposition method and modified with anti-[human epidermal growth factor receptor 2] monoclonal antibody (herceptin), and their application as camptothecin (CPT) delivery agents to human breast cancer SK-BR-3 cells was investigated. Although the diameter of herceptin-modified HNPs (HER-HNP) is smaller than that of other reported mesoporous silica nanoparticles, the extensive hollow cavity of HNPs (ca. 30 nm) allowed the loading of a large amount of CPT. CPT-loaded HER-HNP (HER-HNP-CPT) did not release CPT in phosphate-buffered saline over a period of 24 h, however, HER-HNP-CPT in a hydrophobic solvent released its entire load of CPT. In addition, HER-HNPs were efficiently internalized owing to their herceptin conjugation and optimized size. To evaluate in vitro antitumor efficacy, apoptosis/necrosis and viability of HER-HNP-CPT-treated cells were investigated. When the cells were treated with HER-HNP-CPT for 30 min, a few apoptotic cells were observed. After 24 h, the viability of HER-HNP-CPT-treated SK-BR-3 decreased to 60 %, which revealed highly efficient chemotherapy. However, CPT loaded into HNP or HER-HNP had no significant effects on the viability of macrophages. Judging from these data, HER-HNPs are very suitable for application in anticancer therapy. A HER-HNP-CPT drug delivery system offers a new direction for a hydrophobic anticancer drug carrier and can be expanded to practical applications with further studies.
