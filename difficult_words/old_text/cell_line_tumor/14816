Gangliosides have been considered as potential targets for immunotherapy because they are overexpressed on the surface of melanoma cells. However, immunization with purified gangliosides results in a very poor immune response, usually mediated by IgM antibodies. To overcome this limitation, we immunized mice with R24, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes the most tumor-restricted ganglioside (GD3); our goal was to obtain anti-idiotype (Id) antibodies bearing the internal image of GD3. Animals produced anti-Id and anti-anti-Id antibodies. Both anti-Id and anti-anti-Id antibodies were able to inhibit mAb R24 binding to GD3. In addition, the anti-anti-Id antibodies were shown to recognize GD3 directly. Anti-Id and anti-anti-Id mAb were then selected from two fusion experiments for evaluation. The most interesting finding emerged from the characterization of the anti-anti-Id mAb 5.G8. It was shown to recognize two different GD3-expressing human melanoma cell lines in vitro and to mediate tumor cell cytotoxicity by complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The biological activity of the anti-anti-Id mAb was also tested in a mouse tumor model, in which it was shown to be a powerful growth inhibitor of melanoma cells. Thus, activity of the anti-anti-Id mAb 5.G8 matched that of the prototypic anti-GD3 mAb R24 both in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, our results indicate that the idiotype approach might produce high affinity, specific and very efficient antitumor immune responses.
