A multilayered keratinocyte sheet overexpressing human beta defensin-3 (HBD-3) gene was prepared by the magnetic force-based tissue engineering technique. The cell sheet demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity, indicating that the therapeutic introduction of HBD-3 gene into cell sheets may provide a new gene therapy strategy for infectious diseases.
