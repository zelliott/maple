A series of platinum(II) complexes with N-monocyclopentyl/cyclohexyl derivatives of 1R,2R-diaminocyclohexane as carrier ligands and dicarboxylate anions as leaving groups were synthesized and characterized. All complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, (1)H NMR, and (13)C NMR spectroscopy, as well as ESIMS. The in vitro antiproliferative activities were tested by MTT assay against four human cancer cell lines; breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and colon cancer (HCT-116) cells were particularly sensitive, especially to complexes 1f (IC(50) =9.81 and 1.49 μM) and 2f (IC(50) =4.59 and 0.36 μM). Flow cytometry indicated that representative compounds exert cytotoxicity toward MCF-7 and HCT-116 cells through induction of apoptosis and blockage of cell-cycle progression in the S phase, similar to cisplatin. The interaction between the platinum(II) complexes and pET22b plasmid DNA was observed by agarose gel electrophoresis, revealing that complex 2f has the capacity to distort plasmid DNA in a manner distinct from that of oxaliplatin.
