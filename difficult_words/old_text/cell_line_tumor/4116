Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and autophagy are two major regulators involved in both tumor initiation and progression. However, the association between these two signaling pathways still remains obscure. In this work, we demonstrate that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) stimulates the induction of autophagy in several cancer cell lines through repression of NF-κB activity. We also show that inhibiting NF-κB results in an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which participate in the stimulation of autophagy. These findings present a pathway by which DHA promotes autophagy in cancer cells and provide evidence for the DHA-induced sensitization effect of some chemotherapeutics.
