The ability of human postprandial triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), isolated after meals enriched in saturated fatty acids (SFAs), n-6 PUFAs, and MUFAs, to inhibit the uptake of 125I-labeled LDL by the LDL receptor was investigated in HepG2 cells. Addition of TRLs resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of heparin-releasable binding, cell-associated radioactivity, and degradation products of 125I-labeled LDL (P < 0.001). SFA-rich Svedberg flotation rate (Sf) 60-400 resulted in significantly greater inhibition of cell-associated radioactivity than PUFA-rich particles (P = 0.016) and total uptake of 125I-labeled LDL compared with PUFA- and MUFA-rich particles (P < 0.02). Normalization of the apolipoprotein (apo)E but not apoC-III content of the TRLs removed the effect of meal fatty acid composition, and addition of an anti-apoE antibody reversed the inhibitory effect of TRLs on the total uptake of 125I-labeled LDL. Real time RT-PCR showed that the SFA-rich Sf 60-400 increased the expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid synthesis (P < 0.05) and decreased the expression of the LDL receptor-related protein 1 compared with MUFAs (P = 0.008). In conclusion, these findings suggest an alternative or additional mechanism whereby acute fat ingestion can influence LDL clearance via competitive apoE-dependent effects of TRL on the LDL receptor.
