Helicobacter pylori infection is recognized as the major cause of gastritis and gastric cancer; however, its role in the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's adenocarcinoma is unclear. The expression of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and COX-2 may be important in inflammation and tumorigenesis in the esophagus. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of live H pylori or H pylori extract (HPE) on these factors in the esophageal epithelial cell lines SKGT-4 and OE33. NF-kappaB and AP-1 activity were assessed by gel shift assay and COX-2 by Western blotting. Coculture of SKGT-4 and OE33 with live H pylori and HPE induced NF-kappaB and AP-1 DNA-binding activity, and also decreased IkappaB-alpha levels. Treatment with the specific MEK1/2 MAPK inhibitor PD98059, but not the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, inhibited NF-kappaB and AP-1 activity. The antioxidant vitamin C inhibited H pylori-induced NF-kappaB activation, but increased AP-1 expression. Moreover, HPE induced COX-2 expression and IL-8 production, and PD98059 inhibited COX-2 expression, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and IL-8 production. These data demonstrate that both live H pylori and HPE induce NF-kappaB and AP-1 expression in esophageal epithelial cells. The induction of such transcription factors may play a role in the specific immune response within Barrett's mucosa and may indirectly cause inflammation of the gastric cardia and the distal esophagus.
