Recently, we were able to show that Helicobacter pylori-positive gastric cancer (GC) patients have a significantly better survival after the complete resection of their tumor compared to H. pylori-negative GC patients. H. pylori is known to polarize an immune response towards a type 1 cytokine profile and tumor-specific type 1 cytokine responses are associated with protection from tumor challenge and T-cell-mediated tumor regression. Therefore, we hypothesized that the improved survival in H. pylori-positive patients may be secondary to the induction of a GC-specific type 1 T cell response. To characterize the anti-tumor immune response in GC patients we analyzed tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) isolated from primary tumors. The CD3+ T cell population contained 50% CD4+ (range 0.4-81%) and 39% CD8+ cells (range 22-53%). The number of B cells (CD19+, P = 0.03) was significantly increased and the number of T cells (CD3+, P = 0.02) significantly decreased in intestinal compared to diffuse type of tumors. Four tumor cell lines were established from primary GCs and three from lymph node metastases. T cell cultures were established from isolated TIL from four H. pylori-positive and one H. pylori-negative GC patients and tested for tumor-specific cytokine secretion. Eight of ten T cell cultures derived from H. pylori-positive patients secreted both IFN-gamma and IL-5 after restimulation with autologous tumor cells. The only tumor-specific TIL line expressing a dominant IL-5 response was derived from an H. pylori-negative patient.
