This study describes the creation and characterization of drug carriers prepared using the polymer poly[aniline-co-N-(1-one-butyric acid) aniline] (SPAnH) coated on Fe(3)O(4) cores to form three types of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs); these particles were used to enhance the therapeutic capacity and improve the thermal stability of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), a compound used to treat brain tumors. The average hydrodynamic diameter of the MNPs was 89.2 ± 8.5 nm and all the MNPs displayed superparamagnetic properties. A maximum effective dose of 379.34 μg BCNU could be immobilized on 1 mg of MNP-3 (bound-BCNU-3). Bound-BCNU-3 was more stable than free-BCNU when stored at 4 °C, 25 °C or 37 °C. Bound-BCNU-3 could be concentrated at targeted sites in vitro and in vivo using an externally applied magnet. When applied to brain tumors, magnetic targeting increased the concentration and retention of bound-BCNU-3. This drug delivery system promises to provide more effective tumor treatment using lower therapeutic doses and potentially reducing the side effects of chemotherapy.
