One dodecahedral bismuth(III) complex [Bi(HL)(NO(3))(3)] (1) (HL = 2-acetylpyridine N(4)-pyridylthiosemicarbazone) has been synthesized and structurally characterized. The analytical data reveals the formation of 1 : 1 (metal : ligand) stoichiometry. The bismuth(III) ion is nine-coordinated by one electron pair (6s(2)) of the bismuth(III) atom, two nitrogen and one sulfur atoms from the N(2)S tridentate ligand and five oxygen atoms from three nitrate ions. Biological studies, carried out in vitro against eight selected bacteria, and four human cancer cells, respectively, have indicated that 1 shows better growth-inhibiting properties. Upon further investigation, 1 might produce cytotoxicity through apoptosis.
