To investigate the relationship between p16 expression and cell proliferation and prognosis in gastric cancer patients.

Gastric cancer cell lines SGC-7901, MKN45, MKN28, human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, human fibroblast cell line MRC-5, and surgical specimens of gastric carcinoma and adjacent normal gastric mucosa from 65 patients were included in this study. RT-PCR, MTT and FCM assays were used to detect p16 expression in gastric cancer cell lines and surgical specimens of gastric cancer. MTT assay was used to determine cancer cell viability and FCM to detect cell cycle. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Log-Rank statistics were used to analyze the relationship between p16 expression and survival of petients with gastric cancer.

Gastric cancer cell lines were mostly negative for p16 expression, and p16 was re-expressed after the cells transfected with p16 gene by adenovirus AdCMV-p16. p16 re-expression resulted in the decrease of cancer cell viability and cancer cell cycle arrest with increased G(1) phase and decreased S phase. p16 expression in cancer specimens was 32.3% (21/65), significantly lower than the 81.5% (53/65) in normal mucosa (Ï‡(2) = 32.124, P < 0.001). The disease-free survival was significantly shorter in p16-negative patients than that in p16-positive patients (P < 0.01), but not the overall survival (P > 0.05). p16 expression was significantly correlated with differentiation and lymph node metastasis, but not significantly correlated with sex, age, tumor size or invasion depth of the gastric cancer.

p16 gene is important for cancer cell proliferation. The inactivation gives cancer cells a high activity for proliferation and metastasis, and then influences the disease-free survival of gastric cancer patients.
