Fat droplets (FDs) have important roles in cellular energy regulation. Isolating FDs from either cells or tissue continues to be important for studying these organelles. Here, we describe a procedure wherein whole homogenates of cultured cells or tissue are fractionated with a single centrifugation step in a standard microcentrifuge. This procedure reproducibly yields three fractions highly enriched in either FDs, soluble cellular components, or sedimentable organelles/membranes.
