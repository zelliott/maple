Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors (PIs) have anti-MM activity in combination with dexamethasone or lenalidomide. However, no data exists on the anti-MM effects of combinations involving the PI delanzomib with dexamethasone and/or lenalidomide. Herein, we show that delanzomib in combination with dexamethasone and/or lenalidomide results in superior tumor reduction and extended tumor growth delays when compared to vehicle alone, these drugs alone, or the doublet of dexamethasone and lenalidomide. The favorable results obtained from the three xenograft studies suggest that delanzomib in combination with dexamethasone and lenalidomide should be explored for the treatment of MM.
