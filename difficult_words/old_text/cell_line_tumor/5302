Receptor internalization is recognized as an important mechanism for controlling numerous cell surface receptors. This event contributes not only to regulate signal transduction but also to adjust the amount of cell surface receptors. Frizzleds (Fzds) are seven-pass transmembrane receptor family proteins for Wnt ligands. Recent studies indicated that Fzd5 is internalized in response to Wnt stimulation to activate downstream signaling pathways. After internalization, it appears that Fzd5 is recycled back to the plasma membrane. However, whether internalized Fzd5 is sorted to lysosomes for protein degradation remains unclear. We here report that a coated vesicle-associated kinase of 104 kDa (CVAK104) selectively induces lysosomal degradation of Fzd5. We identify CVAK104 as a novel binding partner of Dishevelled (Dvl), a scaffold protein in the Wnt signaling pathway. Interestingly, we find that CVAK104 also interacts with Fzd5 but not with Fzd1 or Fzd4. CVAK104 selectively induces intracellular accumulation of Fzd5 via the clathrin-mediated pathway, which is suppressed by coexpression of a dominant negative form of Rab5. Fzd5 is subsequently degraded by a lysosomal pathway. Indeed, knockdown of endogenous CVAK104 by RNA interference results in an increase in the amount of Fzd5. In contrast, Wnt treatment induces Fzd5 internalization but does not stimulate its degradation. Overexpression or knockdown of CVAK104 results in a significant suppression or activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, respectively. These results suggest that CVAK104 regulates the amount of Fzd5 by inducing lysosomal degradation, which probably contributes to the suppression of the Wnt signaling pathway.
