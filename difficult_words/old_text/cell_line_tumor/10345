A marine Verrucosispora sp. isolated from the sponge Chondrilla caribensis f. caribensis was found to produce thiocoraline, a potent cytotoxic compound. Five new analogs of thiocoraline were isolated and represent the first analogs of thiocoraline. 22'-Deoxythiocoraline (2), thiochondrilline C (5), and 12'-sulfoxythiocoraline (6) demonstrated significant cytotoxicity against the A549 human cancer cell line with EC(50) values of 0.13, 2.86, and 1.26 Î¼M, respectively. The analogs provide insight into the SAR and biosynthesis of thiocoraline. The DP4 probability method was used to analyze ab initio NMR calculations to confirm stereochemical assignments.
