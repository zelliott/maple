Sec14p-like lipid-binding domain (SEC14 domain) is an evolutionarily conserved protein domain often found in secretory proteins, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphatidylinositol transfer protein Sec14p, and in lipid-regulated proteins, such as GTPase-activating proteins, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and neurofibromin. We have cloned a novel human gene, cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein-like (CRALBPL), containing SEC14 domain from the cDNA library of human fetal brain. The RT-PCR expression pattern of 16 adult human tissues indicated that CRALBPL was only expressed in brain, while it was expressed in all of seven human carcinoma cell lines we used, especially in human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, human rhabdomyoma cell line, human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line, and human prostatic carcinoma cell line. Further, we found that CRALBPL has a remarkably more abundant RT-PCR expression pattern in human HCC cell lines than in normal human liver cell line, and the same result was gained when RT-PCR expression patterns between human HCC specimens and normal human liver specimens were compared. We also found that CRALBPL is located mainly in cytoplasm in human liver cell line L-02, which is consistent with the common function of Sec14p-like domain family. Our results show that CRALBPL may be used as a marker for human HCCs.
