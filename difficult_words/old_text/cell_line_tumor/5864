Two unprecedented C,C-linked dimeric indolizidine alkaloids, flueggines A (1) and B (2), were isolated from the twigs and leaves of Flueggea virosa. The structures and absolute configurations were elucidated by means of NMR, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and CD analyses. Compound 1 is the first example of Securinega alkaloids bearing an isoxazolidine ring, the plausible biogenetic pathway of which is also proposed. Compound 2 exhibited growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.
