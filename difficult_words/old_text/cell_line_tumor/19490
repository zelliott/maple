A nonviral gene carrier, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle, was evaluated for efficient in vitro and in vivo delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C). The chemically synthesized CaCO3 nanoparticle has a 58 nm diameter and +28.6 mV positive surface charge. It is capable of forming a CaCO3 nanoparticle-DNA complex and transferring DNA into targeted cells with high transfection efficiency while effectively protecting the encapsulated DNA from degradation. Furthermore, the CaCO3 nanoparticle-DNA complex has no obvious cytotoxicity for SGC-7901 cells, while a liposome-DNA complex exhibited measurable cytotoxicity. SGC-7901 cells transfected with a VEGF-C-targeted siRNA via CaCO3 nanoparticle exhibit significantly reduced VEGF-C expression as measured by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; whereas no decrease in VEGF-C expression is observed in cells treated by control transfection. Transfection of SGC-7901 cells with VEGF-C siRNA via CaCO3 nanoparticle also dramatically suppresses tumor lymphangiogenesis, tumor growth and regional lymph-node metastasis in subcutaneous xenografts. Significant downregulation of VEGF-C messenger RNA expression in a subcutaneous xenograft derived from VEGF-C siRNA-treated SGC-7901 cells was confirmed by real-time PCR as compared to controls. We conclude that CaCO3 nanoparticle is a novel and nonviral system for effective delivery of siRNA for cancer gene therapy.
