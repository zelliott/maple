By the guidance of bioassay, one new cytotoxic triterpenoid saponin, 3-O-[beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl] quillaic acid 28-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->3)-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-[beta-D-fucopyranosyl-(1-->4)]-beta-D-fucopyranoside (1), and five known cytotoxic triterpenoid saponins, vaccaroside E (2), vaccaroside G (3), vaccaroside B (4), segetoside H (5) and segetoside I (6), were isolated from Vaccaria segetalis. Their structures were established on the basis of ESI-MS, IR, extensive NMR ((1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, TOCSY, (1)H-(1)H COSY, DEPT, HMQC, HMBC and ROESY) analyses, chemical degradation, and by comparing with previously reported data. Compounds 1-6 showed moderate cytotoxic activities against LNcap, P-388 and A-549 cell lines with IC(50) values in the range 0.1-12.9 microM.
