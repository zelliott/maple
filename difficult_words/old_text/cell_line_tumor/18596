Silica nanoparticles were prepared in a microemulsion system, using polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether/cyclohexane/ammonium hydroxide. The surface charge of the particle was modified with PLL [poly(L-lysine)]. PAGE demonstrated the ability of PMS-NP (PLL-modified silica nanoparticles) to bind and protect antisense ODNs (oligonucleotides). The intracellular localization of FITC-labelled ODN was investigated by fluorescence microscopy. The results demonstrated that ODN could be delivered to cytoplasm. Flow-cytometry analysis showed a 20-fold enhancement of ODN delivered by PMS-NP compared with free ODN for a serum-free medium. Blocking efficacy of c- myc antisense ODN, delivered by PMS-NP, was examined in HNE1 and HeLa cell lines. Significant down-regulation of c- myc mRNA levels was observed in both the cell lines. However, the cellular uptake efficiency and antisense effects on target gene decreased in the presence of serum-containing medium. The analysis of the filtration assay showed that PMS-NP interacted with serum proteins. These results indicated that PMS-NP was a suitable delivery vector for antisense ODN, although its delivery efficiency decreased in the presence of a serum-containing medium.
