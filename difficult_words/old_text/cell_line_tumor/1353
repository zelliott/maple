To investigate the effects of Z-ligustilide (LIG) on Abeta25-35-induced cytotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.

Cells were incubated with 0.1, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 microg/mL LIG and then were exposed to 50 micromol/L Abeta25-35 to induce cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cell to establish the AD model in vitro. Cell viability was test by MTT method. Pro- and anti-apoptosis protein levels were investigated by Western blot.

After exposure to Abeta25-35, the cell viability decreased significantly, and the expression of pro-apoptosis protein--Bax, cleaved caspase 3, cytochrome C, caspase 8 was up regulated while the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 was down regulated. However, the treatment of LIG (0.1, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 microg/mL) significantly restored these changes.

LIG has the protective effect against cytotoxicity induced by in SH-SY5Y cells via inhibit the apoptosis induced by Abeta25-35.
