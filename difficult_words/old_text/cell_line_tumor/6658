The antiproliferative activity, upon UVA irradiation, of two tetracyclic derivatives of benzo[b]thiophenes and pyridines, a benzo[b]thienopyridopyrimidone (1) and a thienocarboline (2), has been investigated in a panel of human tumor cell lines. The two compounds present a remarkable cytotoxicity after UVA irradiation (365 nm), reaching an IC50 of 0.1 microM in the leukaemia cell lines and 0.3-0.5 microM in the solid tumour cell lines. Their effect on the cell cycle was measured by flow cytometry in Jurkat cells. The compounds induce cell cycle perturbations and trigger a massive apoptosis as revealed by the externalisation of Annexin V-targeted residues at the outer plasmatic membrane. Furthermore the drugs induce, upon UVA irradiation significant variations of the mitochondrial potential (Deltapsi(mt)) measured by flow cytometry using the fluorochrome JC-1. In addition we characterized the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using the probe dihydroethidine (HE) and the oxidations of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin using the interacting probe nonyl acridine orange (NAO). Both compounds stimulate the production of ROS, and remarkably induce oxidation of cardiolipin. We have investigated the DNA-binding properties of these two compounds by means of UV-Vis spectroscopy and fluorescence. The two compounds exhibit a low affinity toward the macromolecule. The mode of binding was also investigated by means of flow linear dichroism (LD) which has revealed that the two compounds do not efficiently intercalate into DNA. Finally, the DNA-photocleavaging properties of the test compounds were studied on pBR322 plasmid DNA as a model. Only compound 1 is able to induce a significant production of single strand breaks only after digestion with the base excision repair enzyme Endo III. Altogether these data suggest that DNA is not a preferential target of these molecules and other subcellular structures may be responsible for their high phototoxic activity.
