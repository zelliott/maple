The aim of this work was to improve the cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effects of gemcitabine using a gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy approach. Murine Gl261, rat C6 and human U373 glioma cell lines were transduced with an adenoviral vector encoding the human deoxycytidine kinase gene (Ad-HudCK). Intracranial tumors were established in C57BL/6 mice and Wistar rats using either wild-type or Ad-HudCK-transduced Gl261 and C6 glioma cells. In vitro growing cells and established tumors were treated with gemcitabine and irradiation either alone or in combination. Deoxycytidine kinase overexpression substantially increased both the toxic and radiosensitizing effects of gemcitabine in each cell line, but the enhancement rate varied: it was mild in the Gl261 cells and much stronger in the C6 and U373 cells. In vivo experiments showed a mild radiosensitizing effect of dCK overexpression both in the Gl261 and C6 models. The combination of dCK overexpression, gemcitabine treatment and irradiation improved the survival rate of C6 bearing rats significantly. In conclusion, overexpression of the dCK gene can improve the cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effect of gemcitabine both in vitro and in vivo in a tumor-specific manner.
