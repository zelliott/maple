Animal tumor bioassays and in vitro cell culture systems have demonstrated that epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), the predominant catechin in green tea, possesses anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on various cancer cells and tumors. In this study, we investigated the effects of EGCG on cell growth, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis in human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells. The involvement of p53, Bcl-2, Bax, caspases, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) was examined as a mechanism for the anti-cancer activity of EGCG. Time-dependent intracellular trafficking of EGCG was also determined using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated EGCG (FITC-EGCG). Our data show that EGCG treatment caused dose-dependent cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase, and DNA fragmentation suggesting the induction of apoptosis in HT-1080 cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the expression of p53, caspase-7 and -9 as well as the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein increased significantly with higher EGCG concentrations and longer incubation times. Moreover, expression of phosphorylated NF-κB/p65 in HT-1080 cells was inhibited by EGCG treatment in a dose-dependent manner, while that of unphosphorylated NF-κB/p65 remained unaffected. Here we also reveal time-dependent internalization of FITC-EGCG into the cytosol of HT-1080 cells and its subsequent nuclear translocation. These results suggest that EGCG may interrupt exogenous signals directed towards genes involved in proliferation and cell cycle progression. Taken together, our data indicate that HT-1080 apoptosis may be mediated through the induction of p53 and caspases by the pro-oxidant activity of internalized EGCG, as well as suppression of Bcl-2 and phosphorylated NF-κB by the antioxidant activity of EGCG.
