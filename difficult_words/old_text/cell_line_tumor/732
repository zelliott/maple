To study the expression of RhoC in human gastric cancer cell lines and to construct and identify the RhoC-specific siRNA expressing vector.

The expression of RhoC in human gastric cancer cell lines was detected by Western blot. According to the computer aided design(CAD),RhoC-specific siRNA gene was synthesized and cloned into the expression vector mU6pro. The constructed RhoC-siRNA was transiently transfected into high-metastatic gastric cancer cell line AGS and the inhibition effect of RhoC-siRNA on expression of RhoC in AGS cells was detected using Western blot.

The expression level of RhoC was up-regulated in high metastatic cells lines. Double enzyme digestion analysis and DNA sequencing confirmed that the RhoC-specific siRNA expression vector was constructed successfully. RhoC expression in AGS cells was specifically suppressed after transfection of RhoC-siRNA.

The RhoC-specific siRNA expression vector has been successfully constructed, which may provide a novel applicable strategy for gene therapy of gastric cancer.
