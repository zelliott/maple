Substantial evidence suggests that peroxynitrite generated from the bi-radical reaction of nitric oxide and superoxide is critically involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. Reaction with sulfhydryl (SH)-containing molecules has been proposed to be a major detoxification pathway of peroxynitrite in biological systems. This study was undertaken to determine if chemically elevated intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH), a major SH-containing biomolecule, affords protection against peroxynitrite-mediated toxicity in cultured neuronal cells. Incubation of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with the unique chemoprotectant, 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T), led to a significant elevation of cellular GSH in a concentration-dependent fashion. To examine the protective effects of D3T-induced GSH on peroxynitrite-mediated toxicity, SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with D3T and then exposed to either the peroxynitrite generator, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), or the authentic peroxynitrite. We observed that D3T-pretreated cells showed a markedly increased resistance to SIN-1- or authentic peroxynitrite-induced cytotoxicity, as assessed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium reduction assay. Conversely, depletion of cellular GSH by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) caused a marked potentiation of SIN-1- or authentic peroxynitrite-mediated cytotoxicity. To further demonstrate the causal role for GSH induction in D3T-mediated cytoprotection, SH-SY5Y cells were co-treated with BSO to abolish D3T-induced GSH elevation. Co-treatment of the cells with BSO was found to significantly reverse the protective effects of D3T on SIN-1- or authentic peroxynitrite-elicited cytotoxicity. Taken together, this study demonstrates for the first time that D3T can induce GSH in cultured SH-SY5Y cells, and that the D3T-augmented cellular GSH defense affords a marked protection against peroxynitrite-induced toxicity in cultured human neuronal cells.
