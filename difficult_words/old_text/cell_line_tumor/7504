The hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR, c-Met or Met) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in embryogenesis, tissue regeneration and wound healing. Abnormal activation of this proto-oncogene product is implicated in the development, progression and metastasis of many cancers. Current therapies directed against Met, such as ligand- or, dimerization-blocking antibodies or kinase inhibitors, reduce tumor growth but hardly eradicate the tumor. In order to improve anti-Met therapy, we have designed a drug delivery system consisting of crosslinked albumin nanoparticles decorated with newly selected anti-Met nanobodies (anti-Met-NANAPs). The anti-Met NANAPs bound specifically to and were specifically taken up by Met-expressing cells and transported to lysosomes for degradation. Treatment of tumor cells with anti-Met NANAPs also resulted in downregulation of the total Met protein. This study shows that anti-Met NANAPs offer a potential system for lysosomal delivery of drugs into Met-positive tumor cells.
