Two new sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids rugosusines A and B (1 and 2), and thirty-one known compounds were isolated from the stems of Celastrus rugosus. The structures of new compounds were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis, including HR-ESI-MS and 2D NMR spectroscopic data. All the compounds were isolated from this plant for the first time. The cytotoxicities of these compounds were tested against SKOV3 and MGC-803 cell lines by CCK-8 method.
