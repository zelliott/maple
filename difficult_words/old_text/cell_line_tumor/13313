Claudin-4, a member of a tetra-transmembrane protein family that comprises 27 members, is a key functional and structural component of the tight junction-seal in mucosal epithelium. Modulation of the claudin-4-barrier for drug absorption is now of research interest. Disruption of the claudin-4-seal occurs during inflammation. Therefore, claudin-4 modulators (repressors and inducers) are promising candidates for drug development. However, claudin-4 modulators have never been fully developed. Here, we attempted to design a screening system for claudin-4 modulators by using a reporter assay. We prepared a plasmid vector coding a claudin-4 promoter-driven luciferase gene and established stable reporter gene-expressing cells. We identified thiabendazole, carotene and curcumin as claudin-4 inducers, and potassium carbonate as a claudin-4 repressor by using the reporter cells. They also increased or decreased, respectively, the integrity of the tight junction-seal in Caco-2 cells. This simple reporter system will be a powerful tool for the development of claudin-4 modulators.
