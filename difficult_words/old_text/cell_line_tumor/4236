Our understanding of human papillomavirus (HPV) is still evolving. To further study the field, our laboratory has focused on determining the role of integrins in the initial steps of viral endocytosis into HaCaT cells. Our and others' previous findings have shown that α6 is necessary for infection. Here we show that α3 and β1 were dispensable, and we identified integrin α6β4 complex as necessary for infection in HaCaTs. β4 knock down resulted in a significant decrease in HPV16 PsV infection and perhaps most importantly resulted in defective post-translational α6 processing. We showed that the unprocessed α6 does not localize to the cell surface. We propose that the α6β4 complex is necessary for the formation of an endocytic complex that results in the signaling transduction events necessary for initial endocytosis.
