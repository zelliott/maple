The SAM and SH3 domain containing 1 (SASH1) gene was originally identified             as a potential tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer, mapped on chromosome 6q24.3.             The expression of SASH1 plays a prognostic role in human colon cancer. Its expression             is frequently downregulated in several human malignancies. However, the biological             function of SASH1 in melanoma cells is yet to be determined. In this study, in             order to investigate the tumor suppressive effects of the SASH1 gene, an A-375             stable melanoma cell line was established, overexpressing the SASH1 gene. The             stable cell line was examined using proliferation assay, apoptosis assay, cell             cycle analysis and real-time PCR. The results indicated that the tumor suppressive             activity of SASH1 derived from G2/M arrest in A-375 cells, and that the phosphorylation             of Cdc2 or the disruption of cyclin B-Cdc2 binding may be responsible for the             G2/M arrest.
