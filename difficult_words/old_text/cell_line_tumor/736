To construct the melanoma antigen-1(MAGE-1) eukaryotic expression plasmid and express MAGE-1 in mouse melanoma B16 cells.

The MAGE-1 gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pIRES2-EGFP to construct the pIRES2-EGFP-MAGE-1 plasmid. The plasmid was transfected into the B16 cells. The EGFP expression was detected under fluoroscent microscope and the MAGE-1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry staining.

The eukaryotic expression vector pIRES2-EGFP-MAGE-1 was constructed and transfected successfully into B16 cells, and the EGFP and MAGE-1 genes were co-expressed in the B16 cells.

A mouse melanoma cell line B16 co-expressing MAGE-1 and EGFP genes has been established successfully, which lays the foundation for the research on application of MAGE-1 in the tumor immunotherapy.
