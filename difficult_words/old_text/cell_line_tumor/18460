The presence of circulating cell-free nucleic acids has been demonstrated both in disease and health. In the last decade, a burst of papers about Circulating Nucleic Acids in Plasma and Serum (CNAPS) have been found in the literature, showing the scientific interest raised by this phenomenon and their putative clinical interest, especially in the field of cancer. Today, the detection of extracellular tumor-derived DNA and/or RNA is considered by many authors as a new molecular marker for situations such as cancer diagnosis, monitoring the outcome of a disease and, even, as a treatment response indicator. Furthermore, in some studies it has been suggested a possible role of tumor CNAPS in the development of metastasis. Specifically, the hypothesis known as the "genometastasis hypothesis" proposes that stem cells might be naturally transfected with dominant oncogenes as a result of dissemination of such genes in the plasma. On the other hand, current studies concerned with the biology of metastatic cells are increasingly being focused on the striking similarities found between these cells and stem cells. In this review we intend to expound and integrate two theories about metastatization: the "genometastasis hypothesis" and the idea of stem cells as cancer stem cells.
