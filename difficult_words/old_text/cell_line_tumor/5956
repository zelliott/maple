Sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) catalyses the conversion of sphingosine to the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). We report here, the stereospecific synthesis of an analogue of FTY720 called (R)-FTY720-OMe, which we show is a competitive inhibitor of SK2. (R)-FTY720-OMe failed to inhibit sphingosine kinase 1 activity, thereby demonstrating specificity for SK2. Prolonged treatment of HEK 293 cells with (R)-FTY720-OMe also induced a reduction in SK2 expression. In addition, (R)-FTY720-OMe inhibited DNA synthesis and prevented S1P-stimulated rearrangement of actin in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. These findings demonstrate that SK2 functions as a pro-survival protein and is involved in promoting actin rearrangement into membrane ruffles/lamellipodia in response to S1P in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
