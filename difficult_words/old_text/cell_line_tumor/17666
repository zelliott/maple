Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive serosal tumor, strongly associated with former exposure to asbestos fibers and for which there is currently no effective treatment available. In human, MPM is characterized by a high local invasiveness, poor prognosis and therapeutic outcomes. In order to assess molecular changes that specify this phenotype, we performed a global gene expression profiling of human MPM. Using a 10,000-element microarray, we analyzed mRNA relative gene expression levels by comparing a mesothelioma cell line to either a pleural cell line or tumor specimens. To analyze these gene expression data, we used various bioinformatics softwares. Hierarchical clustering methods were used to group genes and samples with similar expression in an unsupervised mode. Genes of known function were further sorted by enzyme, function and pathway clusters using a supervised software (IncyteGenomics). Taken together, these data defined a molecular fingerprint of human MPM with more than 700 up- or down-regulated genes related to several traits of the malignant phenotype, specially associated with MPM invasiveness, protection and resistance to anticancer defenses. This portrait is meaningful in disease classification and management, and relevant in finding new specific markers of MPM. These molecular markers should improve the accuracy of mesothelioma diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.
