A series of novel 2-aliphatic cyclic amine-3-(arylsulfonyl)quinoxalines was synthesized based on the structural features of a previously identified lead, WR1. The 2-piperidinol-3-(arylsulfonyl)quinoxalines, which showed excellent antitumor activities against five human cell lines, with inhibitory activities ranging from 0.34 to 2.32 μM, proved to be a promising class of novel PI3Kα inhibitors. The most potent compound 10d (WR23) showed an inhibitory IC(50) value of 0.025μM against PI3Kα and significant pAkt suppression effect. Molecular docking analysis was performed to determine possible binding modes between PI3Kα and target compounds.
