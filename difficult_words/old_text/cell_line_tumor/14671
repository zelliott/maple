Ethyl pyruvate, an aliphatic ester derived from pyruvate, reportedly has anti-inflammatory actions through inhibition of the transcription mediated by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). It was suggested that ethyl pyruvate inhibited NF-κB/DNA-binding activity through the covalent modification of RelA. However, the interaction of ethyl pyruvate with RelA in vitro has not been reported. In the present study, we confirmed that treatment of cultured alveolar epithelial cells, A549 cells, with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) increased the NF-κB/DNA-binding activity. When the nuclear extract of the cells was incubated with ethyl pyruvate, the NF-κB/DNA-binding activity was strongly inhibited. Because we previously found that the NF-κB/DNA complex included RelA and p50, we bacterially expressed a deletion mutant of RelA, RelA (1-220), and a full-length form of p50. Incubation of RelA (1-220) or p50 with ethyl pyruvate induced dramatic changes in mobility in two types of nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that incubation of RelA (1-220) or p50 with ethyl pyruvate inhibited the DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, immunostaining of A549 cells revealed that ethyl pyruvate inhibited the nuclear association of RelA after TNFα treatment. These results suggest that ethyl pyruvate interacts with RelA and p50 to inhibit their functions at multiple points.
