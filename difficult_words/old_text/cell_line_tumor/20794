BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID) is a crucial element in death signaling pathways and is recognized as an intracellular link connecting the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic and extrinsic death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathways. Herein, we describe experiments conducted with a fusion protein, which was generated by fusing a human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-specific single-chain antibody with domain II of Pseudomonas exotoxin A and the truncated active BID (tBID). These experiments extend our previous work on several other immuno-proapoptotic proteins. Specifically, by excluding cells with undetectable HER2, we showed that the secreted immuno-tBID molecule selectively recognized and killed HER2-overexpressing tumor cells in vitro by attacking their mitochondria and inducing their apoptotic death. This apoptosis could only be inhibited partially by caspase pan-inhibitor zVAD and mitochondrial protector TAT-BH4. Subsequently, we transferred the immuno-tbid gene into BALB/c athymic mice bearing HER2-positive tumors together with other immuno-proapoptotic proteins using i.m. injections of liposome-encapsulated vectors. The expression of the immuno-tbid gene suppressed tumor growth and prolonged animal survival significantly. We also shortened the translocation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A II to only 10-amino acid sequence, which were crucial for furin cleavage. The new recombinant molecule retained the translocation efficiency and the ability of specific killing HER2-positive tumor cells. Our data showed that, compared with the toxins employed before, the chimeric immuno-tBID molecule can not only specifically recognize HER2-positive tumor cells but also certainly induce apoptosis even in the presence of zVAD and TAT-BH4, thereby suggesting an alternative approach to treating HER2/neu-positive tumors.
