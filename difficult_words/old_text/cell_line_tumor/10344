A novel dinuclear cobalt(III) complex with the condensation product of 2-acetylpyridine and malonic acid dihydrazide, N',N'(2)-bis[(1E)-1-(2-pyridyl)ethylidene]propanedihydrazide was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, spectroscopy (NMR and infrared), and X-ray crystal analysis. The complex showed a moderate activity towards Artemia salina. The highest cytotoxic potential of the complex was observed on the epithelial breast cancer (MDA-361) cell line. The investigated complex induced apoptosis, the early apoptotic cells comprising 28.18%, compared to 5.64% of control cells in the same phase. The interaction of the complex with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) was monitored by blue shift and hyperchromism in the UV-vis spectra. The observed intrinsic binding constant (K(b)=4.2Ã—10(5)M(-1)) together with structural analysis of the complex indicate the groove binding.
