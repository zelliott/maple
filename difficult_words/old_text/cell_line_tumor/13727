Radiotherapy is the principal therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)             at early stages. A number of chemotherapeutic methods have been used to inhibit             the progression of NPC at elevated stages. Suramin has been reported to inhibit             the growth of certain tumor cells via various pathways. In the present study,             we aimed to analyze the effects of suramin on the proliferation of NPC cells (CNE-2).             Suramin was proved to demonstrate NPC cell growth-inhibiting effects both in a             dose- and time-dependent manner. To determine the potential mechanisms of these             effects, western blotting and flow cytometric analysis were performed. Suramin             was found to have the potential to induce cell cycle arrest in S-phase CNE-2 cells.             Additionally, we found that the OPN level may decrease in suramin-treated CNE-2             cells. The changes of certain apoptosis- and p-AKT-associated proteins possibly             regulating the OPN expression were measured by western blotting. In conclusion,             suramin may function as a potential agent for the adjunctive therapy of NPC.
