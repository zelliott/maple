Ginsenosides, the major chemical composition of Chinese white ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer), can inhibit tumor, enhance body immune function, prevent neurodegeneration. In this paper, for the first time we reported that the amount of ginsenosides in the equivalent extraction of the nanoscale Chinese white ginseng particles (NWGP) was 2.5 times more than that of microscale Chinese white ginseng particles (WGP). And the extractions from NWGP (1000 microg/ml) reached a high tumor inhibition of 64% exposed to human lung carcinoma cells (A549) and 74% exposed to human cervical cancer cells (Hela) after 72 h. Our work shows that the nanoscale Chinese WGP greatly improves the bioavailability of ginsenosides.
