Excessive melanin production and accumulation are characteristics of a large number of skin diseases, including melasma, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. During our on-going search for new agents with an inhibitory effect on tyrosinase, we synthesized a new type of tyrosinase inhibitor, 4-(thiazolidin-2-yl)benzene-1,2-diol (MHY-794), which directly inhibits mushroom tyrosinase.

The inhibitory effect of MHY-794 on tyrosinase activity and nitric oxide (NO) scavenging activity was evaluated in cell free system. Additional experiments were performed using B16F10 melanoma cells to demonstrate the effects of MHY-794 in vitro. HRM2 hairless mice were used to evaluate anti-melanogenic effects of MHY-794 in vivo.

MHY-794 effectively inhibited mushroom tyrosinase activity in cell free system. In silico docking simulation also supported the inhibitory effects of MHY-794 on mushroom tyrosinase. MHY-794 also proved to be effective at scavenging nitric oxide (NO), which serves as an important modulator in the melanogenesis signaling pathway. In addition, MHY-794 effectively inhibited SNP (NO donor)-induced melanogenesis by directly inhibiting tyrosinase and diminishing NO-mediated melanogenesis signaling in B16 melanoma cells. The anti-melanogenic effects of MHY-794 were further confirmed in HRM2 hairless mice. Ultraviolet light (UV) significantly up-regulated NO-mediated melanogenesis signaling in HRM2 hairless mice, but MHY-794 effectively inhibited both melanogenesis and diminished UV-induced NO-signaling.

Our results indicate that MHY-794 is highly effective at inhibiting NO-mediated melanogenesis in vitro and in vivo by direct NO scavenging and directly inhibiting tyrosinase activity, and suggest that MHY-794 be considered a new developmental candidate for the treatment of hyper-pigmentation disorders.

MHY-794, which showed great efficacy on NO-mediated melanogenesis by direct NO scavenging as well as direct inhibition of tyrosinase catalytic activity, might be utilized for the development of a new candidate for treatment of the hyper-pigmentation disorders.
