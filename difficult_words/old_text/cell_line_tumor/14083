The syntheses of a series of dipyrrolo[3,4-a:3,4-c]carbazole-1,3,4,6-tetraones, substituted in 10-position with saturated and unsaturated side chains, via palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, are described. These compounds can be considered as granulatimide bis-imide analogues. Their inhibitory activity toward Chk1 kinase and their antiproliferative activities in vitro in four tumor cell lines are reported.
