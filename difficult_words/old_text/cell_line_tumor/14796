Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules are polymorphic heterodimers that present peptides to CD4+ T-cells. The HLA-DM molecule contributes to assemble HLA class II-peptide complexes. We investigated the effect of silencing either HLA-DR or HLA-DM expression in the allogeneic T-cell responses. The delivery of HLA-DR- or HLA-DM-specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in a monocytic cell line caused a decrease by up to 85% and 75% at the respective mRNA level. Allogeneic T-cells stimulated with HLA-DM-silenced monocytes decreased to 30% granzyme B mRNA and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in comparison with T-cells stimulated with monocytes expressing a non-specific shRNA. By contrast, HLA-DR-silenced monocytes did not induce proliferation, up-regulation of granzyme B mRNA levels or high IFN-γ secretion by allogeneic T-cells vs HLA-DR expressing cells. Direct targeting of HLA-DR expression prevented more efficiently an allogeneic T-cell response in comparison with the knockdown of the expression of HLA-DM molecules. Silencing the expression of HLA-DR molecules might contribute to the development of new allogeneic cell-based therapeutic approaches.
