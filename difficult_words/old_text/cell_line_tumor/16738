The present study aimed to investigate the influence of siRNA interference with a proliferation- inducing ligand (APRIL) gene on gastric carcinoma sgr-7901 cell apoptosis. Correlations between APRIL silencing and tyrosine kinase (trka) expression were also explored.

Two APRIL-silencing siRNA vectors were constructed, and transfected into human gastric carcinoma sgr-7901 cells, expression before and after transfection being detected using RT-PCR and western blot analyses. The expression of 15 trka genes was detected using RT- PCR and apoptotic rates of sgr-7901 were assessed by flow cytometry.

The expression levels of receptor trka genes were significantly decreased, and the apoptotic rate of sgr-7901 was significantly increased after transfection (P < 0.05).

APRIL gene silencing can increase the apoptotic rate of gastric carcinoma cells, and inhibit the expression of receptor trka genes. There is a correlation between the signaling pathways of APRIL and trka.
