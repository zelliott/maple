Bioactive secondary metabolites originating from dibromotyrosine are common in marine sponges, such as sponges of the Aplysina species. Verongiaquinol (1), 3,5-dibromo-1-hydroxy-4-oxocyclohexa-2,5-diene-1-acetamide, and aeroplysinin-1 are examples of such bioactive metabolites. Previous studies have shown the potent antimicrobial as well as cytotoxic properties of verongiaquinol and the anti-angiogenic activity of aeroplysinin-1. The work presented herein shows the design and synthesis of dibromotyrosine-inspired phenolic ester and ether analogues with anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative and anti-migratory properties and negligible cytotoxicity. Several analogues were synthesized based on docking experiments in the ATP binding site of VEGFR2 and their anti-angiogenic potential and ability to inhibit angiogenesis and prostate cancer proliferation, migration and invasion were evaluated using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, MTT, wound-healing, and CultrexÂ® BME cell invasion assay models, respectively. Analogues with high docking scores showed promising anti-angiogenic activity in the CAM assay. In general, ester analogues (5, 6, and 8-10) proved to be of higher anti-migratory activity whereas ether analogues (11-14) showed better anti-proliferative activity. These results demonstrate the potential of dibromotyrosines as promising inhibitory scaffolds for the control of metastatic prostate cancer proliferation and migration.
