Organically modified silica (ORMOSIL) nanoparticles, owing to the presence of lipophilic organic groups, can host active lipophilic molecules in their interior, as well as form electrostatic complex with therapeutic agents such as genes on their surface. Owing to this fact, they have numerous potential applications in diagnostic imaging, as well as drug, and gene delivery. Here we describe the synthesis, characterization, and biomedical applications of ORMOSIL nanoparticles encapsulated with either an anticancer drug (for cancer chemotherapy), or a photosensitizer drug (for photodynamic therapy), or complexed with a plasmid DNA (for gene therapy).
