As a more effective in vivo drug delivery system, several methods loading anti-cancer drugs to biodegradable and biocompatible nano-particles have been explored and developed. Supposedly due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, systemic administration of these nano-particles have been found to result in accumulation of nano-particles into solid tumors. In this study, we prepared nano-particles using polyethylene glycol (PEG)/poly-L-lactide (PLLA) diblock copolymer and loaded doxorubicin into these nano-particles (Nano-dox). The fabricated nano-particles exhibited sustained release kinetics of the drug in vitro. To follow the in vivo biodistribution of 200-350 nm sized nano-dox particles in tumor (syngenic renal cell adenocarcinoma: RENCA) bearing mouse, the carboxylfluorescenin diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) was loaded into the nano-particles. Nano-dox accumulated preferentially in tumors; however, in terms of its anti-tumor efficacy, it did not show any marked benefits, compared to freely-administered doxorubicin. This result suggests the need to re-consider and evaluate what type of anti-cancer reagents we to be used in the ongoing efforts of coupling drug delivery system with tumor EPR effects.
