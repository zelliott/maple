A series of 4-chloro-2-cyanoamino-6-fluoroalkylamino-5-phenylpyrimidines was prepared as a result of our efforts to modify a series of [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines that proved to be potent anticancer agents with a unique mechanism of tubulin inhibition. On the cyanoamino nitrogen, a methyl group is optimal for activity among alkyl groups introduced. The structure-activity relationship for the rest of the molecule resembles that of [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines. A lead compound (5) retained in vitro potency compared with TTI-237. In the mechanism of action studies, it behaved in the same manner as TTI-237. In addition, it is also capable of overcoming multidrug resistance due to P-gp. These findings strongly suggest that this series of 2-cyanoaminopyrimidines binds at the same site and in the same binding mode as TTI-237. Further modifications of the 2-cyanoamino group are underway.
