Endosomal escape and nuclear entry are the two main barriers for successful non-viral gene delivery. To overcome these barriers, polyethylenimine (PEI) with a molecular weight of 800, conjugated to cholesterol (PEI 800-Chol) was synthesized to prepare polycation liposomes (PCLs). The effect of cationic polymers on transfection was investigated by pre-condensing DNA with these before using PCLs. The complexes of PCLs and protamine/DNA nanoparticles (PLPD) were introduced as efficient gene transfer vectors, and displayed obviously higher transfection efficiency (approximately 39-fold) than PCLs/DNA complexes. Kinetics of transgene expression indicated PLPD complexes could be maintained at a relatively high level over 72Â h. The order of protamine addition affected the transfection of PLPD complexes. Pre-mixed and post-mixed PLPD complexes improved transfection, although the former was preferred. Distribution of FAM-labeled oligonucleotides (FAM-ODN) in cells mediated by PCLs were throughout the whole cell, while most FAM-ODN were nuclear when transfected with PLPD. These results suggest that the protonation of PEI and membrane destabilization of 1, 2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) increases the endosomal escape ability of vectors. The addition of protamine, containing nuclear localization signals, improved nuclear entry of DNA. The internalization pathways for PCLs involved multiple processes and were possibly dependent on cell lines.
