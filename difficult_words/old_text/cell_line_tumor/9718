The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of Patrinia scabra Bunge polysaccharide (PSB-P2) on cervical cancer cell (U14)-bearing mice. The tumor weight of mice treated with PSB-P2 (40, 80 mg/kg b.w.) was significantly lower than that of the control group and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was decreased, while serum alkaline phosphatase (AKP) level was only changed slightly. Meanwhile, the number of apoptotic tumor cells was significantly increased in the mice by the treatment of PSB-P2 (40, 80 mg/kg b.w.). At the same time, cell cycle analysis showed the accumulation of tumor cells in the G0/G1 phase and a relative decrease in the S phase. On the other hand, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, PSB-P2 (40, 80 mg/kg b.w.) showed the up-regulation of p53 and Bax, and significant inhibition of Bcl-2 in tumor tissues. It suggests a possible mechanism of the inhibitory effect of PSB-P2 on tumor growth.
