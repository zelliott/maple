To study the anti-tumor effect and acute toxicity in vitro of the separation compositions from qinglongyi.

The conventional acute toxicity experiments of mice, the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2 yl)-2,5-diphenylterazolium bromide, MTT] and the SRB (sulforhodamin B) were used to make preliminary selection to qinglongyi and its separation compositions.

The half-deadly dose (LD50, the half-lethiferous dose) of the chloroform separation composition in qinglongyi was 575.38 mg x kg(-1) (i.g.), and of the acetic ether separation compositions in qinglongyi was 1303.59 mg x kg(-1) (i.g.). From the other parts of separation compositions in qinglongyi, the LD50 were more than 5 g x kg(-1). When acetic ether separation composition of qinglongyi was at 100 microg x mL(-1) the growth inhibitory rate (GIR) was < 50% to the leukaemia cell HL-60 of human. When chloroform separation composition and the acetic ether separation compositions of qinglongyi was at 100 mg x mL(-1), GIR was 52% to the leukaemia cell HL-60, the gastric carcinoma cell BGC-823 and the cervical carcinoma cell Hela of human.

The separation composition of the chloroform and the acetic ether from qinglongyi have obvious, anti-tumor effect.
