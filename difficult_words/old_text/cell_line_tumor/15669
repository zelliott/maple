Preclinical trials have shown that sonochemotherapy is effective for human ovarian cancers. Therefore, the effects of sonochemotherapy on cell adhesion and motility were investigated in this study, considering their roles in cancer metastasis.

Cell lines, HO-8910 and its highly metastatic potential subline HO-8910PM, were subjected to cisplatin, paclitaxel and sonochemotherapy (anticancer drugs followed by insonation). Cytotoxicity was determined, and then cell adhesion, migration and invasion assays were performed.

Neither cisplatin (0.5 μg/ml) nor paclitaxel (6.0 μg/ml) alone led to cell death. The addition of ultrasound did not potentiate an anticancer drug, suggesting that there was a threshold dose for a cytotoxic agent employed in sonochemotherapy. The survival rate was decreased when combining cisplatin and paclitaxel followed by insonation. 6.0 μg/ml of paclitaxel completely suppressed cell adhesion and motility, thus the concentration was decreased to 1.2 μg/ml. Migration and invasion assays were only successfully performed in HO-8910PM cells. Cisplatin and paclitaxel inhibited adhesion, migration and invasion, resulting in lower rates, which were additionally decreased by insonation. No cell traveled through the membrane when cisplatin, paclitaxel and ultrasound were combined. Quantitative evaluations indicated that ultrasound enhanced anticancer agents via synergistic and/or additive effects.

Ultrasound synergized a combined regime and sonochemotherapy was a measure to suppress cancer spread.
