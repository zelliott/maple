The viability of cells cultured in microsystems for drug screening purposes is usually tested with a variety of colorimetric/fluorescent methods. In this work we propose an alternative way of assessing cell viability-flow-through sensor array that can be connected in series with cell microbioreactors as compatible detection system. It is shown, that the presented device is capable of cytotoxic effect detection and estimation of cell viability after treatment with 1,4-dioxane and 5-fluorouracil, which proves that it can be used for truly non-invasive, fast, reliable, continuous cell culture monitoring in microscale.
