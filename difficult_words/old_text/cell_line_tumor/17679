Expression profiling analyses were used to elucidate the functional relevance of RAS proteins in mediating the effect of TGFB1 on the transcriptional phenotype of the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1. Despite the presence of one mutated KRAS2 allele in parental PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells, RAS-dependent signal transduction remained susceptible to stimulation by EGF and TGFB1. To analyze the impact of RAS proteins on the TGFB1-induced transcriptional phenotype, we used PANC-1 cells stably transfected with a dominant negative HRAS(S17N) mutant or with a constitutively active KRAS2(G12V) mutant. TGFB1 treatment of mock-transfected PANC-1 cells led to an expression profile suggestive of epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT). Profiling of the HRAS(S17N)-expressing clone demonstrated that induction of endogenous RAS activity by TGFB1 is required for the development of the TGFB1-induced transcriptional phenotype of PANC-1 cells. The expression of the KRAS2(G12V) mutant by itself repressed transcription of markers of epithelial differentiation and induced transcription of several extracellular matrix-associated genes. This effect was not enhanced further by TGFB1 treatment. In contrast, transcript levels of genes associated with proliferation and cell cycle progression did not appear to be the primary targets of the synergism between the RAS- and TGFB1-dependent cascades. The introduction of the dominant negative and the constitutively active RAS mutants induced partly overlapping and partly inverse effects on the TGFB1-induced expression profile of PANC-1 cells. Additional mechanisms such as the induction of autocrine loops and the use of different RAS isoforms or alternate, ERK-independent signaling pathways may be involved in the interaction between the RAS- and the TGFB1-dependent signaling cascades.
