Aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is common in             human cervical cancers. However, the mechanisms of Wnt activation in cervical             cancer remain largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that Klotho,             a Wnt antagonist, is downregulated in invasive human cervical tumors and in a             cell line we analyzed. Our data demonstrated that in vivo Klotho expression was             not observed in invasive cervical carcinoma. In vitro restoration of Klotho expression             in SiHa cells resulted in a decreased cell motility and invasiveness through upregulation             of E-cadherin, downregulation of N-cadherin and reduced expression of MMP7 and             -9. Ectopic expression of Klotho also reduced the expression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal             transition (EMT) transcription factors Slug and Twist. Furthermore, Klotho causes             a significant inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in cervical cancer cells,             as supported by the expression of Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional target genes such             as c-Myc and cyclin D1. Consequently, our findings demonstrate for the first time             that Klotho regulates tumor invasion through the EMT process and provide novel             mechanistic insights into the role of Klotho in cervical cancer progression and             contribute to treatment for metastatic cervical cancer patients.
