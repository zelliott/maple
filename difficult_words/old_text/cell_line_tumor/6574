AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-untranslated region of mRNAs promote rapid decay of the mRNAs for certain cytokines, including that encoding granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We show that an RNA molecule based on the ARE of GM-CSF mRNA is cleaved between U and A residues in the presence of bovine serum albumin of which cleavage effect is attenuated by acetylation. Furthermore, the expression of RNA molecule containing the ARE of GM-CSF mRNA in human cell lines was increased by inhibition of histone deacetylase activity and attenuation of Dicer expression. These findings suggest that degradation of mRNAs containing an ARE might be regulated by positive charge of polypeptides and Dicer.
