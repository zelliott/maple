Tissue infiltration is different in desmoid and fibroma tumours. Both produce high levels of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), which is related to extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation which in turn regulates cell function and cell migration. Interactions between collagen, proteoglycans and cell surface fibronectin are involved in the assembly and functions of the ECM. As toremifene inhibits collagen and TGFbeta1 synthesis, we tested it in normal, desmoid and fibroma fibroblasts. We will report the changes in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen synthesis, TGFbeta1 activity, fibronectin mRNA expression and TGFbeta1 receptors after toremifene treatment in normal, fibroma and desmoid fibroblasts. We evaluated GAG and collagen synthesis with 3H-glucosamine and 3H-proline incorporation, TGFbeta1 activity with the ELISA method, TGFbeta1 receptor affinity with 125I-TGFbeta1 binding and total RNA with Northern blot analysis. GAG and collagen synthesis, TGFbeta1 activity and fibronectin levels were higher in fibroma and desmoid than normal fibroblasts. The increase was greater in desmoid than fibroma tumour cells. Toremifene treatment reduced GAG and collagen synthesis, TGFbeta1 activity and fibronectin levels in all cell cultures. The percentage reduction in GAG was similar in all cultures; the reduction in collagen synthesis and TGFbeta1 activity was the highest in desmoid fibroblasts. TGFbeta1 receptors were higher in fibroma and desmoid cells than controls. Toremifene reduced TGFbeta1 receptors only in desmoid fibroblasts, with no effect on the changes in type I, II, and III receptors. Our data show that toremifene modifies the ECM components that regulate cytokine activity and cell migration. The reduction in receptor number only in desmoid cells suggests that toremifene may reduce TGFbeta1's affinity for its receptors. Synthesis of a substance regulating protein kinase activity, which is directly involved in the link between TGFbeta1 and its receptors, cannot be excluded.
