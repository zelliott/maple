The phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) pathway has been shown to be involved in the development of melanoma. PI-103 is a kinase inhibitor blocking PI3K class IA and mTOR complex 1 and 2. Here, we studied the effect of targeting the PI3K/mTORC1/mTORC2 pathway by PI-103 and rapamycin in melanoma cells and in a melanoma mouse model. Dual targeting of PI3K and mTOR by PI-103 induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, and inhibited viability of melanoma cells in vitro. Combined treatment with PI-103 and the prototypic mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin led to the synergistic suppression of AKT and ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation and to the induction of apoptosis. In vivo, PI-103 and rapamycin displayed only modest single-agent activity, but the combination significantly reduced the tumor growth compared with both single agents. These data show that blocking the PI3K/mTORC1/mTORC2 pathway using the combination of two distinct small-molecule inhibitors ("vertical inhibition") leads to superior efficacy against malignant melanoma in vitro and in vivo.
