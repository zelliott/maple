Metastasis and invasion are among the main causes of death in patients with             malignant tumors. The aim of this study was to determine the anti-invasive activity             of frondoside A against human breast cancer cells. We investigated the inhibitory             effect of frondoside A on cell clonogenicity, invasion and migration in TPA-stimulated             human breast cancer cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Frondoside A significantly             attenuated TPA-induced colony formation, invasion and migration in MBA-MB-231             human breast cancer cells. Induction of MMP-9 is especially important for the             metastasis of many cancer tumor cell types. Additionally, we found that frondoside A             suppresses TPA-induced MMP-9 enzymatic activity, secretion and expression. This             effect was associated with reduced activation of AP-1 and NF-κB, and correlated             with enhanced expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Frondoside A significantly inhibited             the TPA-induced MMP-9 expression possibly via the suppression of AP-1 and NF-κB             signaling pathways. Frondoside A reduces the activation of the PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2             and p38 MAPK signals. These results suggest that the anti-metastatic effects of             frondoside A on human breast cancer cells might result from inhibited TPA activation             of AP-1 and NF-κB and reduced TPA activation of PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK             signals, ultimately leading to downregulation of MMP-9 expression. These results             indicate the role of frondoside A in metastasis and its underlying molecular mechanisms,             thus, suggesting frondoside A as a chemopreventive agent for metastatic breast             cancer.
