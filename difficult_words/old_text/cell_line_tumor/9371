Tetra-O-methyl nordihydroguaiaretic acid (M4N) was shown to induce G2 arrest and suppress human xenograft tumor growth by inhibiting Cdc2 and survivin. We examined the effect of M4N on leukemia and found that M4N inhibited growth and induced cell death in leukemic cell lines and blasts from AML patients. However, no significant changes in Cdc2 and survivin levels and G2 arrest were observed. Cell death and growth inhibition were dependent neither on XIAP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-X(L) levels nor on caspase-8. M4N did not promote cell differentiation in HL-60 cells. Interestingly, significant inhibition of AKT phosphorylation was observed in M4N treated OCI-AML3 cells. Collectively, our data showed that M4N inhibited cell growth and induced cell death in both leukemic cell lines and AML patient sample via a mechanism not mediated by Cdc2 and survivin inhibition and suggested that the extrinsic and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways are not essential.
