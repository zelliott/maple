Novel fatty acyl and phospholipid derivatives of pyrrole polyamide were synthesized. Their cytotoxicity against a cancer cell line of MT-4 cells and those infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was examined. Although no anti-HIV activity was found, their cytotoxicitty against the cancer cells was significantly enhanced by introducing a lipophilic group into the pyrrole polyamide.
