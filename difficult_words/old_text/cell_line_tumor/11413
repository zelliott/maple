It is well known that resveratrol (RSV) displayed cancer-preventing and anticancer properties but its clinical application is limited because of a low bioavailability and a rapid clearance from the circulation. Aim of this work was to synthesize pharmacologically active resveratrol analogs with an enhanced structural rigidity and bioavailability. In particular, we have synthesized a library of 2,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives in which a thiazolidinone nucleus connects two aromatic rings. Some of these compounds showed strong inhibitory effects on breast cancer cell growth. Our results indicate that some of thiazolidin-based resveratrol derivatives may become a new potent alternative tool for the treatment of human breast cancer.
