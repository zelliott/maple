Fractal methods were used to analyze quantitative differences in secretory membrane activities of two rat prostate cancer cell lines (Mat-LyLu and AT-2) of strong and weak metastatic potential, respectively. Each cell's endocytic activity was determined by horseradish peroxidase uptake. Digital images of the patterns of vesicular staining were evaluated by multifractal analyses: generalized fractal dimension (Dq) and its Legendre transform f(alpha), as well as partitioned iterated function system -- semifractal (PIFS-SF) analysis. These approaches revealed consistently that, under control conditions, all multifractal parameters and PIFS-SF codes determined had values greater for Mat-LyLu compared with AT-2 cells. This would agree generally with the endocytic/vesicular activity of the strongly metastatic Mat-LyLu cells being more developed than the corresponding weakly metastatic AT-2 cells. All the parameters studied were sensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX) pre-treatment of the cells, which blocked voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs). Some of the parameters had a "simple" dependence on VGSC activity, whereby pre-treatment with TTX reduced the values for the MAT-LyLu cells and eliminated the differences between the two cell lines. For other parameters, however, there was a "complex" dependence on VGSC activity. The possible physical/physiological meaning of the mathematical parameters studied and the nature of involvement of VGSC activity in control of endocytosis/secretion are discussed.
