Hedgehog (HH) pathway Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors are active against Gorlin             syndrome-associated basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma where Patched             (Ptch) mutations occur. We interrogated 705 epithelial cancer cell lines for growth             response to the Smo inhibitor cyclopamine and for expressed HH pathway-regulated             species in a linked genetic database. Ptch and Smo mutations that respectively             conferred Smo inhibitor response or resistance were undetected. Previous studies             revealed HH pathway activation in lung cancers. Therefore, findings were validated             using lung cancer cell lines, transgenic and transplantable murine lung cancer             models, and human normal-malignant lung tissue arrays in addition to testing other             Smo inhibitors. Cyclopamine sensitivity most significantly correlated with high             cyclin E (P=0.000009) and low insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6)             (P=0.000004) levels. Gli family members were associated with response. Cyclopamine             resistance occurred with high GILZ (P=0.002) expression. Newer Smo inhibitors             exhibited a pattern of sensitivity similar to cyclopamine. Gain of cyclin E or             loss of IGFBP6 in lung cancer cells significantly increased Smo inhibitor response.             Cyclin E-driven transgenic lung cancers expressed a gene profile implicating HH             pathway activation. Cyclopamine treatment significantly reduced proliferation             of murine and human lung cancers. Smo inhibition reduced lung cancer formation             in a syngeneic mouse model. In human normal-malignant lung tissue arrays cyclin             E, IGFBP6, Gli1 and GILZ were each differentially expressed. Together, these findings             indicate that Smo inhibitors should be considered in cancers beyond those with             activating HH pathway mutations. This includes tumors that express genes indicating             basal HH pathway activation.
