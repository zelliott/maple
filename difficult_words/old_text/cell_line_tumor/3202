Immunological and biochemical probes for viral genomes and products, growth in cell culture, co-culture methods to activate latent genomes, use of activating agents, and electron microscopy have been used in efforts to demonstrate RNA viruses in prostate cancer. Despite findings of C-type particles and p30 antigens, the role of RNA viruses appears to be secondary, with activation of the virogene being a relatively uncommon occurrence. No compelling evidence for Herpes II or cytomegalovirus as etiologic agents has emerged, despite their common presence in the urogenital tract. Though the search for integration of fragments of viral genome into host DNA is still in progress, it appears unlikely that these viruses would account for a significant number of prostate carcinomas. Progress has been achieved in developing simple, reliable, primary culture methods for human prostatic tissue, using explants or dispersed cells. Three cell lines, all from metastatic foci, have been established, are characterized, and are available for distribution. One neonatal cell strain retains many properties of normal prostate.
