Ischemia has been shown to induce a set of complex intracellular signaling events known as the unfolded protein response, which is mediated by endoplasmic reticulum-nuclei-1 sensing enzyme. We have studied the expression of several cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase genes which participate in the control of cell cycle and proliferation under ischemic conditions (glucose or glutamine deprivation) in endoplasmic reticulum-nuclei-1-deficient glioma cells. It was shown that blockade of endoplasmic reticulum-nuclei signaling enzyme-1, the key endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor, leads to an increase of the expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 and cyclin A2, D3, E2 and G2 genes but suppresses cyclin D1. Moreover, the expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 as well as cyclin A2, D3 and E2 mRNAs is significantly decreased under glucose or glutamine deprivation conditions both in control and endoplasmic reticulum-nuclei-1-deficient glioma cells. However, cyclin-dependent kinase-4 and -5 mRNA expressions is increased, but in glucose deprivation conditions only. Results of this study have shown that the expression of most tested genes of encoded cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases is dependent on endoplasmic reticulum-nuclei-1 signaling enzyme function both in normal and glutamine and glucose deprivation conditions and possibly participates in cell adaptive response to endoplasmic reticulum stress associated with ischemia.
