To explore the effects of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) on the cellular proliferation, cellular cycle and apoptosis of SW620 cells in vitro.

SW620 cells were exposed to 1,2-DCE at different concentrations for 0.5 and 1 h. MTT assay was used to detect the relative number and relative viability, the low cytometry (FCM) assay was utilized to measure the cell cycle and apoptosis.

The results of MTT assay showed that the cellular relative viability decreased with the 1,2-DCE's dose and exposure time. Compared with the DMSO group, the relative cellular viability of cells exposed to 1,2-DCE at the doses of 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200 µmol/L for 1 h decreased ( p<0.05 or  p<0.01). Compared with the groups exposed to 1,2-DCE for 0.5 h, the relative cellular viability of cells exposed to 175 µmol/L 1,2-DCE for 1 h decreased significantly ( p<0.01). IC(50) of cellular proliferation in cells exposed to 1,2-DCE for 0.5 h was 89.41 µmol/L, and 95% confidence interval was 85.23 to 93.79 µmol/L. IC(50) of cellular proliferation in cells exposed to 1,2-DCE for 1 h was 87.68 µmol/L, and 95% confidence interval was 83.71 to 91.82 µmol/L. The results of FCM indicated that compared with the control group, the G(0)/G(1) phase in groups exposed to 1,2-DCE at the doses of 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 µmol/L for 1 h decreased significantly ( p<0.05 or  p<0.01), the S phase in groups exposed to 1,2-DCE at the doses of 25, 50 and 100 µmol/L for 1 h reduced significantly ( p<0.05 or P < 0.01), the G(2)/M phase in groups exposed to 1,2-DCE at the doses of 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 µmol/L for 1 h increased significantly ( p<0.05 or  p<0.01). However, 1,2-DCE could not induce apoptosis of SW620 cells.

1,2-DCE could inhibit the proliferation of SW620 cells, and arrest SW620 cells at G(2)/M phase, but could not induce the apoptosis of SW620 cells in vitro.
