Urukthapelstatin A, a novel cyclic peptide, was isolated from the cultured mycelia of marine-derived Thermoactinomycetaceae bacterium Mechercharimyces asporophorigenens YM11-542. The peptide was purified by solvent extraction, silica gel chromatography, ODS flash chromatography, and finally by preparative HPLC. Urukthapelstatin A dose-dependently inhibited the growth of human lung cancer A549 cells with an IC(50) value of 12 nM. Urukthapelstatin A also showed potent cytotoxic activity against a human cancer cell line panel.
