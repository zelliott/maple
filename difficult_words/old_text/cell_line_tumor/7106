In order to examine the cyclic nucleotides (cGMP) role in carcinoma growth and invasivity. We analyzed two cell lines, LSHT29 and 17GT, and tissues in patients with carcinoma and malignant tissues with (N+) and without (N-) lymph node metastases. Higher cGMP levels in pathological samples suggest a strong correlation between intracellular cGMP concentration and carcinoma progression.
