To investigate the effect of RNA interference of the RelB gene on the radiosensitivity of the mouse prostate cancer cell line RM-1 and its mechanism.

We constructed RelB siRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors targeting the RelB gene with the molecular biological technique, and determined the expressions of RelB mRNA and protein on radiation after transfection with siRelB mediated by liposome using RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. We also detected the apoptosis of RM-1 cells by FCM assay and their radiosensitivity by clonogenic assay.

The expressions of RelB mRNA and protein were significantly lower in the RM-1 cells than in the control and negative interference groups after transfection with RelB siRNA (P < 0.05), while the apoptosis of RM-1 cells remarkably higher in the siRelB-RM-1 than in the control group after radiation treatment (P < 0.05). The activity of MnSOD was markedly decreased (P < 0.05), and the radiosensitization rate of the RM-1 cells in the RelB-RM-1 group was 5.13 after radiation treatment.

RNA interference of the RelB gene could enhance the radiosensitivity of the mouse prostate cancer cell line RM-1, which might be associated with its inhibition of Mn-SOD expression and induction of cell apoptosis.
