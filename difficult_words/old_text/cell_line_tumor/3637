To develop an immune-competent animal model for mucosally derived squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA).

Fifteen Fischer 344 rats were inoculated with 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 x 10(6) FAT7 cells in their flanks. The animals were observed for tumor growth and metastasis.

All animals developed tumors that grew exponentially. Pulmonary metastases developed in all animals and 13% developed lymph node metastases.

The FAT7 flank tumor in Fischer 344 rats is a new animal model that closely resembles the behavior of human mucosal head and neck cancer.

The existence of an immune-competent, mucosally derived, and reliable animal model of SCCA that somewhat resembles human head and neck SCCA gives the opportunity to perform immune-modulating experiments on head and neck cancer in these animals.
