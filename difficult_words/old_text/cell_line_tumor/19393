Four nucleoside analogues ( 1- 4) containing a common heterocyclic base, 4(7)-amino-6(5) H-imidazo[4,5- d]pyridazin-7(4)one, were screened against calf-intestine adenosine deaminase. Compounds 1 and 3 with K(i) values of 10-12 microM are more than four times as potent inhibitors of ADA compared with 2 and 4, with K(i) values of 51-52 microM. Also, 3 is not a substrate of ADA. Nucleosides 3 and 4 also exhibit moderate in vitro activity against breast cancer cell lines, while all four are only minimally or nontoxic to the normal cells.
