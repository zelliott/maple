Four novel spin-labelled combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) analogues were first synthesised in quantitative yield by reacting CA-4 with the corresponding nitroxyl radical. Their cytotoxic activities against A-549 (human lung cancer) and HePG-2 (human liver cancer) inÂ vitro were evaluated, and the results indicated that these derivatives were more cytotoxic than the clinical drug irinotecan.
