A series of new furoterpenyl-1,4-naphtho(anthra)quinones have been prepared via oxidative cyclization of the corresponding 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl-1,4-naphtho(anthra)quinones. Depending on the reaction conditions the 1,2-quinones or the 1,4-quinones were obtained. Several new furo-1,4-anthraquinones were also obtained by condensation of 2,3-dichloroquinones with 1,3-dicarbonyls. The compounds synthesized have been evaluated for their cytotoxicity against neoplastic cell lines, some of them being effective below the micromolar level.
