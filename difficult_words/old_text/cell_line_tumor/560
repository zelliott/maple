In contrast to extensive studies on tocopherols, very little is understood about tocotrienols (T3). We evaluated the antitumor activities of gamma-T3 and delta-T3 in murine hepatoma MH134 cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that delta-T3 inhibited the growth of MH134 cells more strongly than gamma-T3 by inducing apoptosis. In C3H/HeN mice implanted with MH134, it was found that gamma-T3 and delta-T3 feeding significantly delayed tumor growth. On the other hand, both T3 had no significant effect on body weight, normal-tissue weight and immunoglobulin levels. Intriguingly, we found that T3 was detected in tumor, but not in normal tissues. These results, to our knowledge, are the first demonstration of specific accumulation of gamma-T3 and delta-T3 in tumors and suggest that T3 accumulation is critical for the antitumor activities of T3.
