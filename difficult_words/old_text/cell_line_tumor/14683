Diaryltriazine inhibitors have highly potent and effective bioactivities for the wild type of HIV-1 reverse transcription. To design new drug of antimutant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, the mechanism of drug resistance for four types of mutants was revealed. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Lys101, Leu100, Lys103, Tyr181, and Tyr188 are key residues. Different mutants of key residues may have different interaction modes and lead to different drug resistances. Then, CoMFA and CoMSIA methods were employed to construct 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship models. These models were evaluated by test set compounds. These models can be used to make quantitative prediction of their bioactivities for lead compounds before resorting to in vitro and in vivo experimentation.
