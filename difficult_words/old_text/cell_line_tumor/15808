Corni Fructus has traditionally been used as herbal medicine for the treatment of tuberculosis, asthma, hepatitis, and chronic nephritis in Korea, Japan, and China. This research was carried out to evaluate the proliferative-inhibitory effect of CF extracts against cancer cells and to identify the new pro-substance from medicinal plants. Among these herbal extracts extracted from KCF (Korean Corni Fructus), JCF (Japanese Corni Fructus) and CCF (Chinese Corni Fructus), KCF extracts strongly induced anti-proliferation of cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner compared with other extracts. Moreover, after treatment with CM/F3 (fraction 3 obtained from KCF extracts) for 24 h, A549 cells were evaluated by several indicators such as cell viability, LDH release, DNA fragmentation, nuclear condensation, and apoptotic proteins in vitro. CM/F3 showed the tumor-selective growth inhibitory activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner in A549 cells. Consistently, CM/F3 effectively induced the activation of bax, cytochrome-c, caspase-3, -8, -9, p53, and p21 causing apoptosis, and caused the suppression of Cdk2, pRb, and E2F1 related to cell arrest in A549 cells. These results demonstrate that CM/F3 caused not only anti-proliferation but also cell death involving cell arrest through interaction between apoptotic proteins and the upregulation of p53 in A549 cells.
