Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are emerging new class of anticancer agents that act by inhibiting cell growth, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of various cancer cells. However, in some conditions, apoptosis can be blocked and non apoptotic cell death and irreversible growth arrest, namely senescence, can be activated as potential tumor-suppressor mechanism. Here we evaluated the dosage effects of HDAC inhibitors suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and valproic acid (VPA) in a series of human leukaemia cell lines. We investigated, what concentration of SAHA and VPA can optimally induce apoptosis, growth inhibition or stress-induced premature senescence. We have found that SAHA inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in concentration 1000x lower than VPA. The senescence phenotype was preferentially induced by lower dosage of HDACi and required longer incubation time (5 days) while apoptosis was induced by higher dosage and appeared already after 24h. The optimal doses for the induction of cell death are 2,5-5 Î¼M of SAHA and 2,5-5 mM of VPA. These doses of HDACi induce both apoptosis and senescence of studied leukemia cell lines.
