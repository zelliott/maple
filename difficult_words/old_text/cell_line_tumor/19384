Neuroblastoma (NB) and Ewing's sarcoma (ES) cell lines were analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) searching for new diagnostic/prognostic markers. Protein expression profiles displayed a high degree of similarity with the exception of marked heat shock protein (HSP) 27 and less marked HSP60 and HSP70 family up-modulations in NB cells. HSP27, which showed peculiar variability in different NB cell preparations, responded to all trans-retinoic acid treatment in NB cells but not in ES cells at gene and protein expression levels. Immunohistochemistry studies showed different behaviours of HSP27 and HSP70 expression in NB and ES biopsies. HSP27 was less expressed, whereas HSP70 was more expressed in the immature areas of NB. HSP27 expression showed positive and statistically significant correlation with favourable prognosis, and HSP27 expression also negatively correlated with increasing aggressiveness of histological type. In ES, both chaperones were expressed without characteristic patterns. Our results suggest that HSP27, after further clinical validations, could be used as a marker of neuronal differentiation in vivo for the assessment of the biological behaviour of NB and for the risk stratification of patients.
