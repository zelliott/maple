The cytotoxic effect of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is limited in many glioma cell lines. However, treatment with TRAIL in combination with subtoxic doses of roscovitine, a specific inhibitor of Cdc2 and Cdk2, induced rapid apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant glioma cells. Roscovitine could sensitize Bcl-2- or Bcl-xL-overexpressing glioma cells, but not human astrocytes, to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, offering an attractive strategy for safely treating resistant gliomas. Treatment with roscovitine significantly inhibited Cdc2 activity, and expression of a dominant-negative Cdc2 mutant sensitized glioma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. While the proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 by TRAIL was partially blocked in U87MG and T98 glioma cells, treatment with roscovitine recovered TRAIL-induced activation of caspases very efficiently in these cells. We found that treatment with roscovitine or expression of a dominant-negative Cdc2 mutant downregulated the protein levels of survivin and XIAP, two major caspase inhibitors. Overexpression of survivin or XIAP attenuated the apoptosis induced by roscovitine and TRAIL. Taken together, these results suggest that downregulation of survivin and XIAP by subtoxic doses of roscovitine contributes to the amplification of caspase cascades, thereby overcoming glioma cell resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
