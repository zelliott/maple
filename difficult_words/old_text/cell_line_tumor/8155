Biodegradable and biocompatible polymers that are engineered to nanostructures play a key role in providing solution for sustained chemotherapy. This study is focused on preparation, drug encapsulation efficiency, in-vitro drug release, in-vitro cellular uptake and cell viability of poly(caprolactone) grafted dextran (PGD) nanoparticles (NPs) formulation containing vinblastine as the anticancer drug. Drug-loaded PGD NPs were prepared by a modified oil/water emulsion method and characterized by laser light scattering, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and zeta potential. The drug encapsulation efficiency was determined spectrophotometrically and in-vitro drug release was estimated using dialysis bag. Breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) was used to image and measure the cellular uptake of fluorescent PGD NPs. Cancer cell viability was assessed by treating MCF-7 cells with vinblastine-loaded PGD NPs by crystal violet staining method. Result showed that the vinblastine-loaded PGD NPs were superior in properties such as drug encapsulation efficiency, the cellular uptake and the cancer cell mortality.
