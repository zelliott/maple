The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of Amblyomin-X, a serine protease Kunitz-type inhibitor. Amblyomin-X induced tumor mass regression and decreased number of metastatic events in a B16F10 murine melanoma model. Alterations on expression of several genes related to cell cycle were observed when two tumor cell lines were treated with Amblyomin-X. PSMB2, which encodes a proteasome subunit, was differentially expressed, in agreement to inhibition of proteasomal activity in both cell lines. In conclusion, our results indicate that Amblyomin-X selectively acts on tumor cells by inducing apoptotic cell death, possibly by targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
