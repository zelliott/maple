A series of novel aminosubstituted xantheno[1,2-d]imidazole derivatives have been designed and synthesized and their antiproliferative activity has been evaluated against human breast MDA-MB-231 cell line. Among the tested compounds those bearing two basic side chains at 2- and 5-positions exhibited a strong dose-dependent antiproliferative activity. Increase of the size and basicity of the N-alkyl substituent resulted in amplification of the inhibitory activity.
