The androgen receptor (AR) encoding gene can undergo mutations during the development and treatment of prostate cancer. Even in hormone-independent stages, mutations in the receptor paradoxically seem to result in an increased AR function. Two such point mutations have been described in the part of the AR involved in DNA binding and nuclear translocation, namely the hinge region. Despite a decreased nuclear translocation, these mutant ARs display increased transactivating potencies. Through detailed analysis of the hinge region, we found that deletion of residues 629 to 636 resulted in a stronger androgen response on different reporters, although this mutant displays an extremely low in vitro affinity for androgen response elements. This superactivity is independent of nuclear localization and can be inhibited by antiandrogens. Surprisingly, the AR activation functions, AF1 and AF2, are not dramatically affected when the inhibitory region (629-RKLKKLGN-636) is deleted, although cotransfected p160 coactivator TIF2 had a stronger potentiating effect in the absence of this motif. The ligand-dependent interaction between the amino-terminal domain and the ligand-binding domain (N/C interaction) plays an important role in transactivation by the AR. We found that this interaction is strongly enhanced by deletion of the inhibitory region. In conclusion, the description of prostate cancer mutations has led to the discovery of a complex role of the hinge region in nuclear localization, DNA binding, coactivator recruitment, and N/C interaction of the AR.
