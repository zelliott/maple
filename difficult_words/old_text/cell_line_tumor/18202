A range of N-phenethyl, N-phenacyl, and N-(1- and 2-naphthylmethyl) derivatives of 5,7-dibromoisatin 2 were prepared by N-alkylation reactions. Their activity against human monocyte-like histiocytic lymphoma (U937), leukemia (Jurkat), and breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231) cell lines was assessed. The results allowed further development of structure-activity relationships. The compound 5,7-dibromo-N-(1-naphthylmethyl)-1H-indole-2,3-dione 5a was the most potent against U937 cells with an IC(50) value of 0.19 microM.
