The aim of this study was to examine the expression and role of astrocyte             elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) in biological processes of T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma             (T-NHL). AEG-1 expression in T-NHL patients was characterized with immunohistochemistry.             The expression of AEG-1, survivin, Bcl-2 and Bax in Jurkat and Hut-78 cells was             detected by real-time PCR and western blotting. Cell proliferation, cell cycle             and apoptosis were measured by MTT and flow cytometry. MMP-2/-9 activity was detected             by gelatin zymography. Of the studied tumors, 104 (80.62%) exhibited cytoplasmic             AEG-1 immunostaining. AEG-1-siRNA in Jurkat and Hut-78 cells suppressed cell proliferation             and induced cell apoptosis, inhibited survivin and Bcl-2/Bax protein expression             as well as MMP-2/-9 activity. Downregulation of AEG-1 using siRNA could provide             a potential approach for gene therapy against T-NHL, and the antitumor effects             may be associated with inhibition of survivin and Bcl-2/Bax protein expression             and MMP-2/-9 activity.
