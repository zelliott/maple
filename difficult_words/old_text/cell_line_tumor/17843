The endothelium plays an important role in the exchange of molecules, but also of immune cells between blood and the underlying tissue. The endothelial molecule S-Endo 1 antigen (CD146) is preferentially located at endothelial junctions and has been claimed to support endothelial integrity. In this study we show that the monoclonal antibody ME-9F1 recognizes the extracellular portion of murine CD146. Making use of ME-9F1 we found CD146 highly expressed and widely spread on endothelial cells in the analyzed murine tissues. In contrast to humans that express CD146 also on T cells or follicular dendritic cells, murine CD146 albeit at low levels was only found on a subset of NK1.1+ cells. The antibody against murine CD146 is useful for immunomagnetic sorting of primary endothelial cells not only from the liver but from various other organs. In vitro, no evidence was seen that the formation and integrity of endothelial monolayers or the transendothelial migration of T cells was affected by antibody binding to CD146 or by crosslinking of the antigen. This makes the antibody ME-9F1 an excellent tool especially for the ex vivo isolation of murine endothelial cells intended to be used in functional studies.
