Characteristics for the up-regulated response in the concentration of intracellular calcium ion ([Ca(2+)]( i )) and in the sodium ion (Na(+)) current by serotonin (5-HT) were investigated in differentiated neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG108-15 (NG) cells. The results for the changes in [Ca(2+)]( i ) by 5-HT were as follows, (1) The 5-HT-induced Ca(2+) response was inhibited by 3 x 10(-9) M tropisetron (a 5-HT(3) receptor blocker), but not by other types of 5-HT receptor blockers; (2) The 5-HT-induced Ca(2+) response was mainly inhibited by calciseptine (a L-type Ca(2+) blocker), but not by other types of Ca(2+) channel blockers or 10(-7) M TTX (a voltage-sensitive Na(+) channel blocker); (3) When the extracellular Na(+) was removed by exchange with choline chloride or N-methyl-D-glucamine, the 5-HT-induced Ca(2+) response was extremely inhibited. The results for the 5-HT-induced Na(+) current by the whole cell patch-clamp technique were as follows, (1) The 5-HT-induced Na(+) current in differentiated cells was significantly larger than that in undifferentiated cells; (2) The ED(50) value for 5-HT-induced Na(+) current in undifferentiated and differentiated cells was almost the same, about 4 x 10(-6) M each other; (3) The 5-HT-induced Na(+) current was completely blocked by 3 x 10(-9) M tropisetron, but not by other 5-HT receptor antagonists and 10(-7) M TTX. These results suggested that 5-HT-induced Ca(2+) response in differentiated NG cells was mainly due to L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels allowing extracellular Na(+) to enter via 5-HT(3) receptors, but not through voltage-gated Na(+) channels.
