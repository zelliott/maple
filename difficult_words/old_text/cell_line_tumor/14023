To analyze three kinds of genotype hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein expressed in human hepatoma (Huh-7) cell line and to recognize HCV core proteins biological function and its pathogenic mechanism.

The Huh-7 cell expressed three kinds of core proteins were established respectively. Affymetrix human gene chip was used for identifying the gene expression dependently on Affymetrix's protocol. All genes changed by 3 or 1.5 folds between the transfected cells and a control cells were further analyzed, and annotated by using NetAffx analysis through Affymetrix website and were categorized based on their biological processes.

The HCV-1b core protein caused 16 genes up/down-regulated expression, of which the immune response genes of PF4V1 and SPP1 were up-regulated 3.4 or 4.4 folds respectively. The HCV-2a core protein had caused the immune response gene CXCL5 and apoptosis gene BTF a down-regulated expression of 3.4 and 3.1 folds respectively, but caused the apoptosis genes of HRK and LZTS1 an up-regulated expression of 3.2 and 3.4 folds respectively. As compared with HCV 1b or 2a core protein, HCV-4b core protein caused 111 genes expression changing and it had more obvious effects on gene expression. If we applied 1.5 fold change for a comparison gene expression, a few of the same gene expression profiles might be caused by these two core proteins.

The three kinds of HCV core protein should have its own expression character and be mainly shown in immune responses, signal transduction, apoptosis, etc. It should be helpful for our recognizing the HCV core protein biological function and its pathogenic mechanism.
