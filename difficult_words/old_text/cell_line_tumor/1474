We propose a mathematical model of tumor cell nutrient uptake governed by the presence of two key biomolecular fuels: glucose and lactate. The model allows us to describe, in a remarkably simple way, different in vitro scenarios previously reported in experiments of tumor cell metabolism using distinct energy sources. The predictions of our model show good agreement with all the examined tumor cell lines (cervix, colon, and glioma) and provide a first step toward the development of more comprehensive frameworks accounting for in vivo cancer dynamics under complex spatial heterogeneities.
