IL-4-induced Stat6 signaling is active in a variety of cell types and plays a role in cell proliferation/growth and resistance to apoptosis. Using EMSA, we identified differential IL-4/Stat6 activities in colorectal cancer cell lines, HT-29 being active Stat6(high) phenotype and Caco-2 being defective Stat6(null) phenotype, respectively. Active Stat6(high) HT-29 cells exhibited resistance to apoptosis by flowcytometry and aggressive metastasis by Transwell assay compared with defective Stat6(null) Caco-2 cells. Comparing one another using RT-PCR, Stat6(high) HT-29 cells expressed more mRNA of anti-apoptotic and pro-metastatic genes Survivin, MDM2, and TMPRSS4, while Stat6(null) Caco-2 cells expressed more mRNA of pro-apoptotic and anti-metastatic genes BAX, CAV1, and P53, respectively. This is the first study describing correlations of IL-4/Stat6 activities with apoptosis and metastasis in colon cancer. These findings, together with the observation of constitutive Stat6 activation in many human malignancies, suggest that Stat6 activities could be a biomarker for cancer cell's invasive/metastatic capability.
