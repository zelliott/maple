Designed novel imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine based inhibitors, synthesized by condensing α-aminopyrazines with α-halocarbonyl compounds followed by electrophilic substitutions. Cytotoxic effects on four cancer cell lines evaluated. Based on preliminary data, imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine template redesigned to improve activity.
