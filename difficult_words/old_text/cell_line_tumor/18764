The individual stereoisomers cis-PtCl(2)(dexrazoxane) and cis-PtCl(2)(levrazoxane) were synthesized and their structures were determined by X-ray crystallography. Dexrazoxane and levrazoxane inhibit cell growth because they are strong catalytic inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II, whereas cisplatin acts through the formation of DNA cross-links. It was hypothesized that platinum(II) complexes of dexrazoxane and levrazoxane would retain both activities and yield drugs with a dual mode of action. Both cis-PtCl(2)(dexrazoxane) and cis-PtCl(2)(levrazoxane) inhibited Chinese hamster ovary cell growth, but more weakly than dexrazoxane and levrazoxane did. Based on their weak topoisomerase II inhibitory activity, it was concluded that these compounds did not inhibit cell growth by targeting topoisomerase II. A comparison of the conformation of cis-PtCl(2)(dexrazoxane) to that of dexrazoxane bound to the dimer interface of topoisomerase II showed that the highly constrained cis-PtCl(2)(dexrazoxane) was in a highly unfavorable conformation for binding. Neither of the platinum complexes were able to cross-link DNA. Thus the cell growth inhibitory activity of these complexes was also not likely due to any cisplatin-type cross-linking activity.
