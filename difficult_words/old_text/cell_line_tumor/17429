New types of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) were synthesized and evaluated for their binding affinity and biological effect on reproductive cells. A proposed lead structure (B) was derivatized to provide compounds 30 and 44, which showed good estrogen-receptor binding affinity (K(i) values: 6.3 and 10 nM, respectively), as well as minimal impact on mammary and uterine carcinoma cells. Introduction of an alkyl group in the core structure considerably enhanced receptor-binding affinity of the compounds tested. Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of these compounds are described.
