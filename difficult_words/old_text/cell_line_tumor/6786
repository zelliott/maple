The studies of interaction with DNA and the cytotoxic activity of a new organometallic platinum(II) compound are presented. The ability of this new platinum complex to modify secondary DNA structure was explored by circular dichroism (CD). Electrophoretic mobility showed changes in tertiary DNA structure, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed morphological changes of plasmid DNA (pBR322). This compound breaks the traditional structure-activity rules for cis-platinum compounds, but it could be of interest because of its different kinetics. An organometallic bond normally shows a trans-effect higher than that of an amine ligand, and that fact, a priori, could contribute to a higher DNA binding rate. Several ovarian cancer cell lines, resistant and non-resistant to cisplatin, were exposed to increasing concentrations of cisplatin and complex 5 for 24 h, after which time the cell number/viability was determined by the colorimetric MTT assay. A lower cytotoxicity but also a lower resistant factor was observed for organometallic compound 5 than for cisplatin, against A2780 and A2780cisR cell lines. This result is consistent with the DNA interaction degree observed by the aforementioned techniques.
