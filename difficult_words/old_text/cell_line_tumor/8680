The MYC protooncogene is associated with the pathogenesis of most human neoplasia. Conversely, its experimental inactivation elicits oncogene addiction. Besides constituting a formidable therapeutic target, MYC also has an essential function in normal physiology, thus creating the need for context-specific targeting strategies. The analysis of post-translational MYC activity modulation yields novel targets for MYC inactivation. Specifically, following regulatory network analysis in human B-cells, we identify a novel role of the STK38 kinase as a regulator of MYC activity and a candidate target for abrogating tumorigenesis in MYC-addicted lymphoma. We found that STK38 regulates MYC protein stability and turnover in a kinase activity-dependent manner. STK38 kinase inactivation abrogates apoptosis following B-cell receptor activation, whereas its silencing significantly decreases MYC levels and increases apoptosis. Moreover, STK38 knockdown suppresses growth of MYC-addicted tumors in vivo, thus providing a novel viable target for treating these malignancies.
