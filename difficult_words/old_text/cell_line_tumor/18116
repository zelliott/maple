Tumor protein D52 (TPD52) is involved in transformation and metastasis and has been shown to be over-expressed in tumor cells compared to normal cells and tissues. Murine TPD52 (mD52) shares 86% protein identity with the human TPD52 orthologue (hD52). To study TPD52 protein as a target for active vaccination recombinant, mD52 was administered as a protein-based vaccine. Na√Øve mice were immunized with either mD52 protein and CpG/ODN as a molecular adjuvant or CpG/ODN alone. Two weeks following the final immunization, mice were challenged s.c. with syngeneic tumor cells that over-express mD52. Two distinct murine tumor cell lines were used for challenge in this model, mKSA and 3T3.mD52. Half of the mice immunized with mD52 and CpG/ODN rejected or delayed onset of mKSA s.c. tumor cell growth, and 40% of mice challenged with 3T3.mD52 rejected s.c. tumor growth, as well as the formation of spontaneous lethal lung metastases. Mice immunized with mD52 and CpG/ODN generated detectable mD52-specific IgG antibody responses indicating that mD52 protein vaccination induced an adaptive immune response. In addition, mice that rejected tumor challenge generated tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes' responses. Importantly, microscopic and gross evaluation of organs from mD52 immunized mice revealed no evidence of autoimmunity as assessed by absence of T cell infiltration and absence of microscopic pathology. Together, these data demonstrate that mD52 vaccination induces an immune response that is capable of rejecting tumors that over-express mD52 without the induction of harmful autoimmunity.
