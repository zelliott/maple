To investigate the effects of PsL5F (ent-11alpha-hydroxy-15-oxo-kaur-16-en-19-oic-acid, an extract from Pteris semipinnata L) on the expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (Nr1d1) in highly metastatic ovarian carcinoma HO-8910PM cells, and its mechanisms.

Microarray Chip was used to examine the level of Nr1d1 mRNA expression on HO-8910PM cells treated with PsL5F. Fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR assay and Western blot were performed to verify the effects of PsL5F on Nr1d1 mRNA and protein expression.

After 24 h treatment of 100 micromol x L(-1) PsL5F, the mRNA and protein levels of Nr1d1 in HO-8910PM cells were 35.34 +/- 1.07 and 7.71 +/- 0.43 times compared to those of control group (P < 0.01, P < 0.01), respectively.

PsL5F can up-regulate significantly the expression of Nr1d1 in HO-8910PM cells. Antitumor effects and its mechanisms of PsL5F in HO-8910PM cells may be involved in the up-regulation of Nr1d1 expression.
