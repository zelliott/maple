To study the expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) gene XIAP in prostate cancer and the relationship between its expression and its clinical stage or Gleason grade.

XIAP mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR in three prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, DU-145, LNCaP), neoplastic prostate tissues and normal prostate tissues. Immunohistochemical SP method was used to examine the expression of XIAP protein in 56 neoplastic prostate tissue specimens.

XIAP gene was not expressed in normal prostate tissues, but highly expressed in prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, DU-145, LNCaP. Thirty of the 56 (53.6%) tumor samples were positive XIAP protein, and only 12 (21.5%) paratumor samples were positive XIAP protein (P < 0.01), XIAP positivity not correlated with tumor stage or Gleason grade (P > 0.05).

XIAP may be involved in the development of prostate cancer and play an important role in human prostate carcinogenesis. It is likely to be used as a target of prostate cancer therapy.
