The biggest challenge for the treatment of multidrug resistance cancer is to deliver high concentration of anticancer drugs specifically to cancer cells for longer period of time. Poloxamers and D-alpha-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) are known inhibitors of P-glycoprotein. Mixed micelles prepared from Poloxamer 407 and TPGS may increases the therapeutic efficacy of drug by delivering high concentration of drug inside the cells and inhibition of P-gp. Curcumin (CUR) is a naturally derived novel anticancer agent but poor solubility limited its clinical use. In this study, we have developed Poloxamer 407 and TPGS mixed micelle encapsulating CUR for treatment of multidrug-resistant ovarian cancer. CUR-loaded Poloxamer 407/TPGS mixed micelles were prepared by thin film hydration method and their physicochemical properties were characterized. Cellular uptake and in vitro cytotoxicity of the CUR-loaded Poloxamer 407/TPGS mixed micelles were studied in multidrug-resistant ovarian cancer (NCI/ADR-RES) cells. The diameter of CUR-loaded Poloxamer 407/TPGS mixed micelles was about 21.4 +/- 0.3 nm and a zeta potential of -11.56 +/- 0.7 mV. The encapsulation efficiency of CUR was ranged from 95-86% with drug loading was about 1-9%. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction studies confirmed that CUR was encapsulated by the polymers. The in vitro release studies showed that mixed micelles sustained the release of CUR for more than 9 days. Results from cellular uptake studies indicated that CUR-loaded Poloxamer 407/TPGS mixed micelles had increased cellular uptake of CUR in NCI/ADR-RES cells. Cytotoxicity of CUR-loaded Poloxamer 407/TPGS mixed micelles was found to be 3 folds more than free CUR after 48 of incubations.

This study suggests that Poloxamer 407/TPGS mixed micelles might be a suitable nanocarrier for curcumin to treat multidrug resistant ovarian cancer.
