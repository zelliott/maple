The murine ortholog (Brms1) of human breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 shares 95% identity to the human metastasis suppressor, BRMS1, in amino acid structure. We tested Brms1 for suppression of metastasis of mouse mammary carcinoma cell line 4T1 in syngenic BALB/c mice, using orthotopic (mammary fat pad) injection as well as intravenous injection. As observed for BRMS1, transfection with Brms1 did not inhibit 4T1 primary tumor formation, but significantly suppressed lung colonization. We also show that Brms1 protein interacts with histone deacetylases, indicating involvement of Brms1 in murine Sin3-HDAC complex, like its human counterpart. Thus, because of similarities with its human ortholog, the results suggest that Brms1 will be useful as a model for studying mechanism of action of BRMS1.
