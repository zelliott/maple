One new cyclohexenone derivative (1) was isolated from Diaporthaceous fungus PSU-H2 together with six known compounds, dothiorelone A (2), dothiorelone C (3), 2,3-dihydromycoepoxydiene (4), (+)-mycoepoxydiene (5), deacetylmycoepoxydiene (6) and tyrosol (7). The structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods. Their cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, was evaluated.
