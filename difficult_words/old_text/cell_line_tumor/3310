Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a highly malignant pediatric cancer, which arises in various sites such as the kidney, brain, and soft tissues. Cytogenetic studies have revealed alterations of 22q11 in MRT. Recently, deletions and mutations of the SNF5/INI1 locus in 22q11.2 have been reported in MRT, suggesting that SNF5/INI1 is a tumor suppressor gene for MRT. Here we report our molecular cytogenetic study for a newly established cell line from extrarenal MRT with t(1;22)(p36;q11.2). Consequently, the reciprocal translocation was associated with the interstitial deletion of a small segment including SNF5/INI1, and another, chromosome 22, showed terminal deletion, the breakpoint of which was located 70-80 kb centromeric to SNF5/INI1, resulting in homozygous deletion of SNF5/INI1 in this cell line.
