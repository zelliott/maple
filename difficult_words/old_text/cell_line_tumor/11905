In this study, the effects of HMBA on the expression of G0/G1 phase arrest-associated genes in human hepatocarcinoma SMMC-7721 cells were investigated. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization assay revealed that the levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p16 proteins and the level of p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA were increased while the levels of CDK4 and Cyclin D1 proteins and c-myc mRNA were decreased in the cells treated with HMBA. These results showed that HMBA could up-regulate the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p16 genes, down-regulate the activity of Cyclin D1-CDK4 and the transcription of c-myc gene which were necessary for cells entering into S phase, and so arrest the cells in G0/G1 phase, and induce the differentiation of human hepatocarcinoma SMMC-7721 cells.
