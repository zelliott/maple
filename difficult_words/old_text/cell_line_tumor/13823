The aims of this study were to examine the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a pleiotropic peptide found at elevated levels in a number of malignancies and which has been shown to influence oral cancer cell behaviour via paracrine signalling pathways, on the phenotype of oral fibroblasts.

The effect of ET-1 on proliferation and migration of human primary oral fibroblasts was assessed using MTS and scratch assays, respectively. The ability of ET-1 to affect fibroblast contractility was analysed using type-I collagen gels. Changes in gene expression in oral fibroblasts exposed to ET-1 were examined using quantitative PCR. The invasiveness of oral cancer cells in the presence of conditioned media collected from ET-1 treated fibroblasts was determined using 2D Matrigel assays.

Here we provide evidence that ET-1 increases the migration of oral fibroblasts and induces a more contractile phenotype which is not associated with changes in gene expression indicative of myofibroblast transdifferentiation. In addition we provide evidence that conditioned medium of ET-1-stimulated oral fibroblasts promotes invasion of OSCC cells in vitro.

In oral squamous cell carcinoma, a frequently fatal and increasingly common epithelial malignancy of the oral cavity, ET-1 is known to contribute to pro-migratory paracrine signalling between stromal fibroblasts and cancer cells. The ability of ET-1 to modulate the phenotype of human oral stromal fibroblasts, however, has not previously been reported. The findings presented here suggest that targeting the stromal endothelin system may be a viable and novel therapeutic strategy for invasive oral cancer.
