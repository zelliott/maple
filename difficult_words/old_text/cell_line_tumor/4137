Two spiro paclitaxel-mimics consisting only of an oxetane D-ring and a C-13 side chain were designed and synthesized on the basis of analysis of structure-activity relationships (SAR) of paclitaxel. In vitro microtubule-stabilizing and antiproliferative assays indicated a moderate weaker activity of the mimics than paclitaxel, but which still represented the first example of simplified paclitaxel analogues with significant anti-tumor biological activity.
