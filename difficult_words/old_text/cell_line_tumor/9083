The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have come to be highlighted by their close relation to the cell invasion of gliomas. The inhibitors of MMPs have undergone extensive development because of its effectiveness against tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Therefore, a suitable animal model is necessary for searching new MMPs inhibitors against gliomas. In this study, we established an experimental model by implanting 9L glioma cells stereotactically into Fisher344 (F344) rat's brain, and the expression and enzymatic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in 9L glioma cells and in tumor tissue was determined by means of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) zymography, in situ film zymography and immunostaining. The results of RT-PCR showed that the mRNA level of MMP-2 in 9L glioma cells was higher than that of MMP-9, and the mRNA expression of MMP-9 was increased along with the growth of malignant gliomas. SDS-PAGE zymography revealed that the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly increased in tumor tissues, and the MMP-9 wasn't detected in normal tissue. The positive stain of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was enhanced with the growth of malignant gliomas, especially for MMP-9. The expression of active gelatinase was found in tumor tissue. In conclusion, the expression of active MMP-2 and MMP-9 was increased in 9L/F344 rat brain during the growth of malignant gliomas at different time intervals, which indicate that 9L/F344 animal model may be a prospective animal model to test new MMPs inhibitors.
