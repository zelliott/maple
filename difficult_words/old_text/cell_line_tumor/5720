Lapatinib (Tyverb, Tykerb) is an orally active, small molecule, reversible, dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (HER1) and type 2 (HER2). In the EU, lapatinib in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of women with HER2-overexpressing, advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after treatment with regimens that include anthracyclines, taxanes and, in the metastatic setting, trastuzumab. The orally administered combination of lapatinib and capecitabine was a more effective treatment than capecitabine alone, and was a generally well tolerated, conveniently administered combination for women with trastuzumab-refractory, HER2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer in a clinical trial. Lapatinib combined with capecitabine provides an effective therapeutic option for a group of patients who currently have few treatment choices.
