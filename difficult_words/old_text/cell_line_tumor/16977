Several 9H-carbazole derivatives are used for various pharmacological applications. Many of these compounds demonstrated cytotoxic and anticancer activities. In this work, we have investigated the cytotoxic activity of some substituted carbazoles against cancer cell lines (MCF-7, and ISK). The derivative 2a showed the highest inhibitory activity against both cell lines.
