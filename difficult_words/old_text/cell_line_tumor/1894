SNX-2112 is a selective heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor which can             exert a potent anticancer activity. In this study, we investigated the effects             of SNX-2112 on B16 melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. The 3-(4,5-dimetrylthiazol-2-yl)-2,             5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometric analysis demonstrated             that SNX-2112 dose-dependently inhibited the growth of B16 cells, and induced             G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blotting revealed that SNX-2112             lead to the degradation of Hsp90 client proteins including Akt, IKKα, NF-κB, B-Raf             and GSK3β. Furthermore, we assessed the antitumor effect of SNX-2112 in vivo,             using a xenograft model in C57BL/6 mice. Oral administration of SNX-2112 significantly             inhibited the growth of B16 tumors in mice, with a 47% inhibition observed at             dose of 80 mg/kg/day for 15 days, compared to control tumors. Hematoxylin-eosin             (H&E) staining of xenograft tissues showed that SNX-2112 also inhibited angiogenesis             and lead to a lower blood vessel density in the tumors, compared to the control             group. These findings demonstrate that SNX-2112 can exhibit a potent anticancer             activity against B16 melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo, by inhibiting cell             proliferation and inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a mechanism dependent             on the degradation of Hsp90 client proteins.
