To construct RegIα over-expression vector and to evaluate the effect of RegIα on the proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer MKN28 cells in vitro.

Full sequence of RegIα cDNA was amplified from normal gastric tissue samples by RT-PCR and cloned into pIRES2-EGFP vector. RT-PCR and Western blot were performed to detect expression levels of RegIα in MKN28 cells. The effects of over-expression RegIα on cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry.

RegIα cDNA over-expression vector of pIRES2-RegIα-EGFP was successfully constructed. The expressions of RegIα in MKN28 cells, including mRNA and protein levels, were significantly increased after stable transfection, which resulted in cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic effect induced by H(2)O(2).

The over-expression of RegIα can promote cell proliferation and reduce cell apoptosis when induced by H(2)O(2) in gastric cancer cells.
