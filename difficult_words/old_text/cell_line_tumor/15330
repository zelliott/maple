To discuss the relationship between inhibitory effect of different concentration ethanol extracts from Xuanfuguilian prescription on the growth of esophageal cells ECA9706 and its components.

The drug was extracted with anhydrous ethanol, 95%, 85%, 75%, 50%, 25% ethanol or water, the cell proliferation inhibitory rate of different solvent extracts were detected with MTT assay, and IC50 was calculated. The components of the drug were determined by LC/MS. Based on the inhibitory rate and the components peak area, the samples were hierarchy clustered respectively. The correlation of components peak area and inhibition rate was analyzed with Pearson Correlation. The components peak area and inhibition rate were analyzed using PLS.

The IC50 of the 7 extracts on esophageal carcinoma cell ECA9706 were respectively 46.361, 52.67, 58.11, 78.26, 93.10, 2579.43 and 3953.34 microg/ mL 22 stable peaks were determined by LC-MS. Based on the inhibition rate and the components peak area, the clustering results of the two samples were similar. The 10 peaks areaes were closely related to inhibition rate (P < 0.05) and the PLS between components peaks area and inhibition rate was constructed.

Extracts with different concentration ethanol have different effects, and their curative effects are closely related to components.
