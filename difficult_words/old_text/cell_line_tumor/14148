To explore novel cancer gene therapy by retrovirus-mediated RNAi technique to suppress the endogenous EphA2 oncogene expression in colon adenocarcinoma HCT-8 cells.

Sequence information of EphA2 mRNA was selected and two complementary oligonucleotides with hairpin loop were designed. Retrovirus-mediated RNAi expression vector (pSIREN-EphA2) was then constructed and transfected into the HCT-8 cells. Inhibition of EphA2 protein expression was quantitatively determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry assay (SP method).

The construction of pSIREN-EphA2 vector was successful and confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. The post-transfection level of EphA2 protein expressions was greatly reduced in HCT-8 cells transfected with pSIREN-EphA2, as compared with those of untransfected cells and the vector control (P < 0.001).

EphA2 protein expression in HCT-8 cell line can be suppressed using recombinant retrovirus-mediated RNAi technique. This approach may provide a novel gene therapy against colonic adenocarcinoma.
