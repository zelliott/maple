Survivin, an important inhibitor of apoptosis, has been found to play an important role in the initiation, progression, and chemoradioresistance of human malignancies. Previously, we have reported that upregulation of survivin in oral squamous cell carcinoma correlates with poor prognosis and chemoresistance. The aim of this study was to assess prognostic significance of survivin protein expression in RCC and analyze its correlation with radiosensitivity of RCC cells. RT-PCR and Western blot assays were performed to detect survivin mRNA and protein expression in normal human kidney epithelial cell line (HKEC) or RCC cell lines. The expression of survivin mRNA in RCC and corresponding nontumor kidney tissues was also detected by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine survivin protein expression in 75 cases of RCC tissue samples. Moreover, the association of survivin protein expression with clinicopathogical factors and prognosis of RCC patients was statistically analyzed. Small interfering RNA was used to knockdown the endogenous survivin expression in RCC cell line (ACHN) and evaluate the effects of survivin knockdown on proliferation, apoptosis, and radiosensitivity of RCC cell line. RCC cells showed sufficient expression of survivin mRNA and protein, but the expression of survivin gene was not detected in normal HKEC. Moreover, the expression level of survivin mRNA in RCC tissues was significantly higher than that in corresponding nontumor kidney tissues. The immunostaining of survivin protein was mainly located in cytoplasm of RCC tumor cells. Tumor pathological stage (P = 0.028), grade (P = 0.004), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.017) of RCC patients were significantly correlated with survivin protein expression. In addition, patients with high survivin levels had a significantly shorter overall survival than those with low levels (P < 0.001), and the expression of survivin protein was an independent prognostic factor for RCC patients (P = 0.008). The expression of survivin gene could be reduced in RCC cell line and survivin knockdown could inhibit growth and enhance in vivo radiosensitivity of RCC cell line by inducing apoptosis enhancement. Taken together, the status of survivin protein expression may be an independent factor for predicting the prognosis of RCC patients and tumor-specific survivin knockdown combined with radiotherapy will be a potential strategy for RCC therapy.
