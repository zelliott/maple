Tissue-/cancer-specific promoters for use in adenovirus vectors (AdVs) are valuable for elucidating specific gene functions and for use in gene therapy. However, low activity, non-specific expression and size limitations in the vector are always problems. Here, we developed a 'double-unit' AdV containing the Cre gene under the control of an Î±-fetoprotein promoter near the right end of its genome and bearing a compact 'excisional-expression' unit consisting of a target cDNA 'upstream' of a potent promoter between two loxPs near the left end of its genome. When Cre was expressed, the expression unit was excised as a circular molecule and strongly expressed. Undesired leak expression of Cre during virus preparation was completely suppressed by a dominant-negative Cre and a short-hairpin RNA against Cre. Using this novel construct, a very strict specificity was maintained while achieving a 40- to 90-fold higher expression level, compared with that attainable using a direct specific promoter. Therefore, the 'double-unit' AdV enabled us to produce a tissue-/cancer-specific promoter in an AdV with a high expression level and strict specificity.
