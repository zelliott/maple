miR-122, a liver-specific tumor suppressor microRNA, is frequently down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LNP-DP1, a cationic lipid nanoparticle formulation, was developed as a vehicle to restore deregulated gene expression in HCC cells by miR-122 delivery. LNP-DP1 consists of 2-dioleyloxy-N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropane (DODMA), egg phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and cholesterol-polyethylene glycol. In vitro, LNP-DP1-mediated transfection of a miR-122 mimic to HCC cells down-regulated miR-122 target genes by >95%. In vivo, siRNAs/miRNAs encapsulated in LNP-DP1 were preferentially taken up by hepatocytes and tumor cells in a mouse HCC model. The miR-122 mimic in LNP-DP1 was functional in HCC cells without causing systemic toxicity. To demonstrate its therapeutic potential, LNP-DP1 encapsulating miR-122 mimic was intratumorally injected and resulted in ~50% growth suppression of HCC xenografts within 30 days, which correlated well with suppression of target genes and impairment of angiogenesis. These data demonstrate the potential of LNP-DP1-mediated microRNA delivery as a novel strategy for HCC therapy.

In this study, LNP-DP1 -a cationic lipid nanoparticle formulation -is reported as a vehicle to restore deregulated gene expression in hepatic carcinoma cells by siRNA and miRNA delivery using a mouse model. Further expansions to this study may enable transition to clinical trials of this system.
