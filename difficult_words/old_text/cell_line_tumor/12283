Spindle cell squamous carcinoma (SCSC) is a rare and peculiar biphasic malignant neoplasm that occurs mainly in the upper aerodigestive tract. It consists of sarcomatoid proliferation of pleomorphic spindle-shaped cells and squamous cell carcinoma.

Here, we established a SCSC cell line from a tumour arisen in gingiva. We characterized the feature of a SCSC cell line by immunohistochemistry. To know the biological feature, we examined the cell growth, invasiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers of a SCSC cell line in comparison with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines.

By immunohistochemical analyses, the primary tumour expressed cytokeratin and vimentin, indicating carcinosarcoma-like characters. This tumour also showed overexpression of p53 protein. Cultured SCSC cells resulted in bypass of crisis and maintenance over passage 100. The established SCSC cell line was spindle-shaped and showed identical immunohistochemical characters to those of primary tumour cells. Similar to the primary tumour, the cell line showed p53 overexpression and had p53 mutation at codon 132: AAG (lys)-->AAT (asp). The SCSC cell line grew slower than two other OSCC cell lines (MSCC-1 and HSC-2), whereas SCSC cells had remarkable invasiveness in comparison with these cell lines. Moreover, SCSC cells expressed wnt-5a and vimentin mRNA at high levels, but did not express E-cadherin mRNA. This expression pattern of the markers was similar to that of mesenchymal cells, not of epithelial cells.

In the present study, we newly established a SCSC cell line with strong invasiveness. This is the first report on the establishment of SCSC cell line. The SCSC cell line can be a useful cell model for the study to know the cytodifferentiation and nature of SCSC.
