To investigate the effects of matrine on proliferation and telomerase activity of colon cancer SW1116 cells.

The proliferation inhibitory rate was evaluated by MTT assay. The telomerase activity was analyzed by TRAP-ELISA, and the expression of hTERT mRNA was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.

Matrine displayed strong proliferation inhibitory effect in a dose-and-time-dependent manner against SW1116 cells. Compared with control group, the telomerase activity and the expression of hTERT mRNA decreased significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in matrine group.

Matrine can inhibit the telomerase activity by depressing the expression of hTERT in SW1116 cells and inhibiting cell proliferation.
