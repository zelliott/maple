A novel class of acetylhydrazone derivatives (5a-x) containing 2-(phenylthiomethyl)-1H-benzo-[d]-imidazole moieties are synthesizer, and their antitumor activities against A549, HCT116, HepG2, PC-9, and A375 were determined by the MTT assay. Among them are N-(2,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)-2-(2-(phenylthiomethyl)-1H-benzo[d]-imidazol-1-yl)acetohydrazide (5a) and N-(5-bromo-2-hydroxy-benzylidene)-2-(2-(phenylthiomethyl)-1H-benzo[d]-imidazol-1-yl)acetohydrazide (5d) which displayed excellent cancer inhibitory activity against the tested cancer cells (IC(50) 4-17 Î¼M), compared with 5-FU and SU11248. The others have moderate to weak inhibitory activity against the tested cancer cell lines.
