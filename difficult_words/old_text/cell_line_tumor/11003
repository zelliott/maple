The dose-effect curves of most parameters in cancer cell lines in response to x-irradiation or toxic agents are usually nonlinear. Such a nature is demonstrated in this article with cell lines of the immune system. However, the shape of the nonlinear dose-effect curves was found to be different for lymphocytes (EL-4) and macrophages (J774A.1). The mechanisms and implications are briefly discussed.
