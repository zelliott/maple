The ectopically expressed and deregulated fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results from a t(4;14) chromosomal translocation that occurs in approximately 15% of multiple myeloma (MM) patients and confers a particularly poor prognosis. This study assesses the antimyeloma activity of CHIR-258, a small-molecule inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases that is currently in phase I trials, in a newly developed FGFR3-driven preclinical MM animal model.

We developed an orthotopic MM model in mice using a luciferase-expressing human KMS-11-luc line that expresses mutant FGFR3 (Y373C). The antimyeloma activity of CHIR-258 was evaluated at doses that inhibited FGFR3 signaling in vivo in this FGFR3-driven animal model.

Noninvasive bioluminescence imaging detected MM lesions in nearly all mice injected with KMS-11-luc cells, which were mainly localized in the spine, skull, and pelvis, resulting in frequent development of paralysis. Daily oral administration of CHIR-258 at doses that inhibited FGFR3 signaling in KMS-11-luc tumors in vivo resulted in a significant inhibition of KMS-11-luc tumor growth, which translated into a significant improvement in animal survival.

Our data provide a relevant preclinical basis for clinical trials of CHIR-258 in FGFR3-positive MM patients.
