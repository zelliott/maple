Three haloderivatives of noscapine 2-4 were synthesized chemoselectively and their in vitro cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay on U-87 human glioblastoma cell lines. At 50 microM concentration after 72 h, 9-chloronoscapine 2, 9-bromonoscapine 3 (EM011), and 9-iodonoscapine 4 killed 87.8%, 51.2%, and 56.8% cells, respectively, however noscapine kills only 40% of the cells; revealing 9-chloronoscapine as a potential cytotoxic agent than noscapine and 9-bromonoscapine (EM011). At low concentration (1 microM) 9-bromonoscapine (46.7%) and 9-chloronoscapine (45.7%) did not show any significant difference.
