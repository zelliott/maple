Uterine leiomyoma are the most common benign tumors of the myometrium. We previously identified endothelin (ET)-1 as a proliferative and antiapoptotic factor in Eker rat-derived leiomyoma (ELT3) cells. A major role of ETB receptor in the prosurvival effect was revealed. Here we investigated, in ELT3 and myometrial cells, the respective contribution of ETA and ETB in the proliferative effect of ET-1. In myometrial cells, binding experiments show that ETA is almost exclusively expressed and stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) activity and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and proliferation. In ELT3 cells, ETB is expressed at about the same level as ETA, and the two receptors are differently coupled to Gi protein. The ETB agonist, sarafotoxin S6c, stimulates PLC activity 60% less than ET-1 but is as potent as ET-1 to increase ERK1/2 phosphorylation and induce proliferation. However, the ability of ETA to activate ERK1/2 is observed after ETB desensitization. Although ETA and ETB antagonists partially reduce ET-1 stimulated PLC activity, they are without effect on ET-1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and proliferation. Only the simultaneous use of ETA and ETB antagonists reduces ET-1-triggered ERK1/2 activation. These unconventional properties of ETRs may reveal the existence of functional ETA-ETB heterodimers. Finally, treatment of ELT3 cells with ETB but not ETA-directed small interfering RNA reduces the proliferative effect of ET-1. All the data obtained in ELT3 cells strengthen the relation between ETB overexpression, which decreases the ETA to ETB ratio, and the ability of leiomyoma cells to highly proliferate and resist apoptosis.
