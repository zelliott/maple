This study investigated the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effect of flavonoids isolated from Korean Citrus aurantium L. using A549 lung cancer cells. Flavonoids potently inhibited of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas flavonoids had a weak inhibitory effect on proliferation of WI-38 cells. Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis showed that flavonoids induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint by controlling the proteins expression level of cyclin B1, cdc2, cdc25c and p21(WAF1/CIP1). Also, flavonoids induced apoptosis through the regulation of the expression of caspases, cleaved PARP and Bax/Bcl-xL ratio. The activity of caspase-3 on A549 cells increased in a dose-dependent manner. These results clearly indicated that the anti-cancer effect of flavonoids on A549 cells follows multiple cellular pathways through G2/M arrest and the induction of apoptosis.
