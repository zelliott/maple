The transcription factor NF-Y is a trimer with histone-like subunits that binds and activates CCAAT-containing promoters. NF-Y controls the expression of several key regulators of the cell cycle. In this study, we examined the functional and molecular effects of NF-YB knockdown. Cell cycle progression is affected with a G2/M-specific depletion. This is due to the inability of activation of G2/M-specific genes, as evidenced by expression profiling, RT-PCR and ChIP data. Surprisingly, apoptosis is also observed, with Caspase 3/7/8 cleavage. A role of p53 and Bcl-2 family members is important. NF-YB inactivation is sufficient to functionally activate p53, in the absence of DNA damage. Failure to maintain a physiologic level of CCAAT-dependent transcription of anti-apoptotic genes contributes to impairment of Bax/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-X(L) ratios. Our data highlight the importance of fine balancing the NF-Y-p53 duo for cell survival by (i) maintaining transcription of anti-apoptotic genes and (ii) preventing p53 activation that triggers the apoptotic cascade.
