MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important gene regulators, which are often deregulated in cancers. In this study, the authors analyzed the microRNAs profiles of 78 matched cancer/noncanerous liver tissues from HCC patients and 10 normal liver tissues and found that 69 miRNAs were differentially expressed between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and corresponding noncancerous liver tissues (N). Then the expressions of 8 differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by real time RT PCR. The set of differentially expressed miRNAs could distinctly classify HCC, N and normal liver tissues (NL). Moreover, some of these differentially expressed miRNAs were related to the clinical factors of HCC patients. Most importantly, Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank test showed that high expression of hsa-miR-125b was correlated with good survival of HCC patients (hazard ratio, 1.787, 95% confidence interval, 1.020-3.133, p = 0.043). The transfection assay showed that overexpression of miR-125b in HCC cell line could obviously suppress the cell growth and phosporylation of Akt. In conclusion, the authors have demonstrated the diagnostic miRNA profile for HCC, and for the first time, identified the miR-125b with predictive significance for HCC prognosis.
