A novel method for synthesis of anti-EGFR immunoliposomes using folate-folate binding protein (FBP) affinity is described. An anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab or C225) was covalently linked to FBP via a thioether bond. Liposomes incorporating a lipophilic folate derivative (folate-PEG-cholesterol) were prepared by polycarbonate membrane extrusion. Anti-EGFR immunoliposomes were then obtained by combining FBP-C225 and folate-liposomes and evaluated for uptake and cytotoxicity in EGFR-overexpressing U87 human glioblastoma cells. Anti-EGFR immunoliposomes constructed via folate-FBP affinity exhibited excellent stability under physiological pH, and quickly released the bound FBP-C225 upon low pH (pH 3.5) treatment. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy showed similar receptor-specific binding and internalization for both folate-FBP affinity-coupled and covalently coupled C225-immunoliposomes, but not for the non-targeted IgG-immunoliposomes. C225-immunoliposomes loaded with anticancer drug doxorubicin were more cytotoxic than non-targeted immunoliposomes in EGFR-overexpressing U87 glioma cells. Folate-FBP affinity is a potential method for construction of immunoliposomes and may have applications in synthesis of targeted drug carriers in general.
