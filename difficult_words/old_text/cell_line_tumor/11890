In this work, we provide experimental arguments in favor of the fact that components from Macrovipera lebetina and Cerastes cerastes venoms bind to IGR39 melanoma cells but not to HT29D4 cells that derive from carcinoma adenome. Furthermore, Macrovipera lebetina and Cerastes cerastes venoms inhibit the adherence of IGR39 and HT 29-D4 to various extracellular matrix proteins. Macrovipera lebetina and Cerastes cerastes venoms did not inhibit the non specific adherence of IGR 39 cells to polylysine. In addition, binding of components from Cerastes cerastes venom to IGR39 cells is inhibited by GRGDS peptide and by monoclonal antibidy anti-av, while these two components have no effect on the adherence of IGR39 to Macrovipera lebetina venom.
