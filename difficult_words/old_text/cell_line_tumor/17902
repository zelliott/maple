A beta-glucuronidase-activated prodrug approach was applied to 10-hydroxycamptothecin, a Camptotheca alkaloid with promising antitumor activity but poor water solubility. We synthesized a glucuronide prodrug of 10-hydroxycamptothecin ( 7) in which glucuronic acid is connected via a self-immolative 3-nitrobenzyl ether linker to the 10-OH group of 10-hydroxycamptothecin. Compound 7 was 80 times more soluble than 10-hydroxycamptothecin in aqueous solution at pH 4.0 and was stable in human plasma. Prodrug 7 was 10- to 15-fold less toxic than the parent drug to four human tumor cell lines. In the presence of beta-glucuronidase, prodrug 7 could be activated to elicit similar cytotoxicity to the parent drug in tumor cells. Enzyme kinetic studies showed that Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase had a quite low K m of 0.18 microM for compound 7 and exhibited 520 times higher catalytic efficiency for 7 than for 6 (a glucuronide prodrug of 9-aminocamptothecin). Molecular modeling studies predicted that compound 7 would have a higher binding affinity to human beta-glucuronidase than compound 6. Prodrug 7 may be useful for selective cancer chemotherapy by a prodrug monotherapy (PMT) or antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) strategy.
