To determine the effects of adenovirus-mediated transfer of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) on growth and apoptosis of human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines.

Pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, PC-7, PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 (p14(ARF)-/- and p16(INK4a)-/-), were used. PC-7 (p53 wt) and MIA PaCa-2 (p53 mt) cells infected with recombinant adenovirus vector expressing p14(ARF) gene (Adp14) showed significant inhibition of cell growth compared with control vector in vitro and in vivo, whereas PANC-1 cells (p53 mt) did not show such effects. Those three cell lines exhibited growth retardation and senescence phenotype after infected with the adenovirus vector containing p16(INK4a) gene (Adp16) in vivo and in vitro.

Adenovirus-mediated transfer of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) produces significant growth suppression of pancreatic carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. The effects of Adp14 partly depend on the status of p53 gene in those cells.
