The use of cell-based models has emerged as a promising means to discover and validate pharmacologic phenotype-genotype relationships. The availability of large-scale genome studies in both human and model systems is now allowing us an unprecedented opportunity to understand how well cell-based models identify clinically relevant genetic variants associated with drug response and toxicity. Here we review these studies and the emerging translational information.
