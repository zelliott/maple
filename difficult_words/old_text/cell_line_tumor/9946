Resistance to cisplatin (DDP) remains a major obstacle for the successful treatment of ovarian cancer. This study was to determine the reversal effect of Fe3O4-magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) on DDP-resistance of ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3/DDP, and to explore its correlation with apoptosis-associated genes.

SKOV3/DDP cells were divided into the DDP group, the Fe3O4-MNPs group, the combination (DDP plus Fe3O4-MNPs) group, and the control group. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). Intracellular DDP level was detected by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The expressions of apoptosis-associated genes, bcl-2, and survivin were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Fe3O4-MNPs reversed DDP-resistance of SKOV3/DDP cells by 2.259 folds. The cell apotosis rate and the intracellular DDP level were significantly higher in the combination group than in the DDP group ( p<0.05). Moreover, the mRNA levels of bcl-2 and survivin were significantly lower in the combination group than in the DDP group( p<0.05).

Fe3O4-MNPs can reverse the DDP resistance of ovarian carcinoma SKOV3/DDP cells, and the effect may be ascribed to the down-regulation of bcl-2 and survivin expression.
