The tyrosine kinase c-Src is upregulated in various human cancers, although the precise regulatory mechanism underlying this upregulation is unclear. We previously reported that a transmembrane adaptor Csk-binding protein (Cbp; PAG1) plays an important role in controlling the cell transformation that is induced by the activation of c-Src. To elucidate the in vivo role of Cbp, we examined the function of Cbp in lung cancer cell lines and tissues. In this study, we found that Cbp was markedly downregulated in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. The ectopic expression of Cbp suppressed the anchorage-independent growth of the NSCLC cell lines (A549 and Lu99) that had upregulated c-Src, whereas the Cbp expression had little effect on other NSCLC cell lines (PC9 and Lu65) that express normal levels of c-Src. The expression of Cbp suppressed the kinase activity of c-Src in A549 cells by recruiting c-Src and its negative regulator, C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), to lipid rafts. The treatment with Src inhibitors, such as PP2, dasatinib, and saracatinib, also suppressed the growth of A549 cells. Furthermore, Cbp expression attenuated the ability of A549 cells to form tumors in nude mice, invade in vitro, and metastasize in vivo. In addition, we found a significant inverse correlation between the level of Cbp expression and the extent of lymph node metastasis in human lung cancers. These results indicate that Cbp is required for the Csk-mediated inactivation of c-Src and may control the promotion of malignancy in NSCLC tumors that are characterized by c-Src upregulation.
