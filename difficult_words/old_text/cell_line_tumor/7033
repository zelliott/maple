Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), tenascin-C (TN-C) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been demonstrated independently to be associated with disease progression and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. The present study explored effects of TGF-beta and TN-C on MMP-9 expression and cancer invasion. An experimental study was designed to analyse MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, known for their high invasiveness, after stimulation with TGF-beta1 and/or TN-C. TGF-beta1 stimulated TN-C expression in the cells. Co-stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cells with TN-C and TGF-beta increased MMP-9 expression at both the gene (28-fold) and the protein levels. The in vitro invasion also increased (4-fold). GM6001 inhibited the invasion induced by the co-stimulation. The combined effect of TN-C and TGF-beta resulted in enhanced MMP-9 expression and cancer invasion in vitro.
