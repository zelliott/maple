A hierarchical theranostic nanostructure with carbon and Si nanocrystals respectively encapsulated in the mesopores and within the framework of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (CS-MSNs) was constructed by a bottom-up self-assembly strategy combining an in situ one-step carbonization/crystallization approach. CS-MSNs exhibited narrow size distribution, high payload of insoluble drugs and unique NIR-to-Vis luminescence imaging feature. The bio-conjugated CS-MSNs with a PEGylated phospholipid compound and hyaluronic acid showed excellent dispersivity and could specifically target cancer cells overexpressing CD44, deliver insoluble drugs into these cells and consequently kill them effectively, and also fluorescently image them simultaneously in a unique and attractive NIR-to-Vis luminescence imaging fashion, providing a promising opportunity for cancer theranostics.
