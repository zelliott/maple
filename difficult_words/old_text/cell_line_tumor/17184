Peritoneal dissemination is a common end-stage complication of pancreatic cancer for which novel therapeutic modalities are actively investigated, as there is no current effective therapy. Thus, we evaluated, in a mouse model of pancreatic peritoneal carcinomatosis, the therapeutic potential of a novel nonviral gene therapy approach consisting of bis-guanidinium-tren-cholesterol (BGTC)-mediated lipofection of a combined suicide gene system. Human BxPC-3 pancreatic cells secreting the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) tumor marker were injected into the peritoneal cavity of nude mice. After 8 days, intraperitoneal (i.p.) lipofection was performed using BGTC/DOPE cationic liposomes complexed with plasmids encoding the two prodrug-activating enzymes Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase and Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase, the latter being expressed from a bicistronic cassette also encoding E. coli uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. Administration of the lipoplexes was followed by treatment with the corresponding prodrugs ganciclovir and 5-fluorocytosine. The results presented herein demonstrate that BGTC/DOPE liposomes can efficiently mediate gene transfection into peritoneal tumor nodules. Indeed, HSV-TK mRNA was detected in tumor nodule tissues by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. In addition, green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence and X-gal staining were observed in the peritoneal tumor foci following lipofection of the corresponding EGFP and LacZ reporter genes. These expression analyses also showed that transgene expression lasted for about 2 weeks and was preferential for the tumor nodules, this tumor preference being in good agreement with the absence of obvious treatment-related toxicity. Most importantly, mice receiving the full treatment scheme (BGTC liposomes, suicide genes and prodrugs) had significantly lower serum CEA levels than those of the various control groups, a finding indicating that peritoneal carcinomatosis progression was strongly reduced in these mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the therapeutic efficiency of BGTC-mediated i.p. lipofection of a combined suicide gene system in a mouse peritoneal carcinomatosis model and suggest that BGTC-based prodrug-activating gene therapy approaches may constitute a potential treatment modality for patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis and minimal residual disease.
