A click-type entry into shortened curcuminoids of the diarylpentanoid type has been developed. The reaction is ideally suited to generate non-symmetrical analogues of curcumin, a class of natural products difficult to access but of growing biomedical relevance and special mechanistic interest to investigate the unique binding mode of curcumin to tubulin. Investigation of a series of click diarylpentane curcuminoids and their pyrazole adducts in various cellular tubulin functional assays validated this class of compounds as a novel type of anti-mitotic agents, evidencing structure-activity relationships, and identifying the pyrazole adduct 4k as a promising lead.
