One of the mechanisms that has been put forward for the development of the androgen-resistant status is neuroendocrine differentiation. Neuroendocrine cells secrete neuropeptides that may represent one of the possible molecular bases by which hormone-dependent prostate cancer cells could escape treatment. LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with either etoposide or neuropeptides. Morphological changes related to apoptosis and cell viability were assessed. Changes in intracellular ion content were quantitatively analyzed by electron probe X-ray microanalysis. Etoposide treatment consistently induces a decrease in K and an increase in Na, which are inhibited by bombesin or calcitonin. The Na/K ratio increased markedly after exposure to etoposide, and both bombesin and calcitonin blocked this increase. Etoposide also caused changes in the intracellular P and S concentrations that to a large extent could be blocked by neuropeptides. These results support the hypothesis that neuropeptides confer anti-apoptotic capabilities onto non-neuroendocrine cells in close proximity to neuroendocrine cells.
