Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) play an important role in the development of human cancers. In the present study, we observed that hMSCs promoted human prostate cancer (PCa) cell PC-3 growth in vivo and in vitro. The conditional medium of hMSCs promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC-3 cells. The expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in PC-3 was upregulated by conditional medium of hMSCs. In addition, blocking tumor transformation factor beta (TGFβ) blunted the pro-oncogenic function of hMSCs. These results suggest that hMSCs may play a pro-oncogenic role in the growth of human prostate caner by producing TGFβ.
