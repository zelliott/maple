To better understand the mechanisms of cytotoxicity and cell death induced by HDACI PCI-24781 in bone sarcoma cells.

Four bone sarcoma cell lines were treated with PCI-24781, and the cytotoxicity was investigated. Further, accumulation of acetylated histones, p21, and PARP cleavage were evaluated in PCI-24781-treated cells. The synergistic effect of PCI-24781 to doxorubicin and its mechanism was investigated in bone sarcoma cells.

MTT assay demonstrated that the growth of bone sarcoma cells was inhibited after treatment with PCI-24781. Accumulation of acetylated histones, p21, and PARP cleavage were found in PCI-24781-treated cells. Expression of DNA repair protein RAD51 was inhibited, and the expression of apoptosis protein GADD45Î± was induced by PCI-24781 in bone sarcoma cells. Bone sarcoma cells treated with PCI-24781 become more sensitive to doxorubicin. The caspase-3/7 activity was increased with doxorubicin and PCI-24781 treatment in these cells.

HDACI PCI-24781 has a synergistic effect on doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in bone sarcoma cells.
