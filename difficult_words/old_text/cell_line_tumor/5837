Human polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is involved in cell proliferation and overexpressed in a broad variety of different cancer types. Due to its crucial role in cancerogenesis Plk1 is a potential target for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Peptidic ligands can specifically interact with the polo-box domain (PBD) of Plk1, a C-terminal located phosphoepitope binding motif. Recently, phosphopeptide MQSpTPL has been identified as ligand with high binding affinity. However, a radiolabeled version of this peptide showed only insufficient cellular uptake. The present study investigated peptide dimers consisting of PBD-targeting phosphopeptide MQSpTPL and a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) moiety. The new constructs demonstrate superior uptake in different cancer cell-lines compared to the phosphopeptide alone. Furthermore, we could demonstrate binding of phosphopeptide-CPP dimers to PBD of Plk1 making the compounds interesting leads for the development of molecular probes for imaging Plk1 in cancer.
