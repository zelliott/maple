Rosamine derivative RC-1, bearing macrocyclic ligand [15]aneNO(2)S(2) as receptor, was synthesized as an enhanced fluorescent chemosensor for Ag(+) in absolute aqueous solution. The fluorescence images in living cells show the potential application of RC-1. The difference of fluorescence enhancement process after binding with Ag(+)/Hg(2+) in acetonitrile/water solution was first proved by theoretical calculations.
