Three known (1-3) and a novel (4) monoterpene indole alkaloids have been isolated from the methanol extract of leaves of Tabernaemontana elegans and their structures were elucidated by a series of spectroscopic experiments, involving NMR, MS, UV, and IR techniques. The isolated monoterpene indole alkaloids along with previously described beta-carbolines (5-7) from the same specimen were studied for their apoptosis induction activity in human hepatoma HuH-7 cells. Methodology for apoptosis induction studies included cell viability assays, nuclear morphology assessments, and general caspase-3-like activity assays. The monoterpene indole alkaloids, tabernaemontanine (1) and vobasine (3) showed the most promising apoptosis induction profile in HuH-7 cells.
