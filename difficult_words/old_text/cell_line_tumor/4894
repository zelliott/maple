Edotecarin (J-107088, formerly ED-749) is a potent indolocarbazole topoisomerase-I inhibitor that has the potential to treat solid tumors. The current studies evaluated the potency and antitumor activity of edotecarin, as a single agent and in combination with capecitabine or docetaxel.

Antiproliferative activity was tested in vitro in a panel of 13 mammary cell lines and antitumor efficacy was tested in vivo in various breast cancer models.

Edotecarin inhibited cellular proliferation in breast carcinoma cell lines: 50% inhibitory concentrations ranged from 8 nmol/L in SKBR-3 cells to approximately 30 micromol/L in BT20 cells. Single dose and weekly intravenous treatments with edotecarin 30 and 150 mg/kg produced significant antitumor activity in the SKBR-3 human breast carcinoma xenograft model, with no major toxicities, compared with vehicle solvent treatment. Daily administration of edotecarin 15 mg/kg for 10 days was not well tolerated, whereas the total dose of 150 mg/kg was safe when administered in a single injection. Edotecarin 3 and 30 mg/kg given after docetaxel in the nude mouse SKBR-3 xenograft model produced tumor growth delays that were greater than those observed with either agent alone and with no toxicity as evaluated on the basis of body weight reduction (<20%). Furthermore, edotecarin 3 mg/kg in combination with capecitabine produced more than additive effects and the combination was well tolerated. However, edotecarin at a dose of 30 mg/kg in combination with capecitabine was lethal. Edotecarin also exhibited potent antitumor activity against xenografted human MX-1 cells, MMTV-v-Ha-ras oncogene-driven mouse breast tumors, and chemically induced rat mammary tumors.

The data suggest that edotecarin may be useful as a single agent or a component of combination chemotherapy regimens for treating human breast cancer.
