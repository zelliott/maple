Photodynamic therapy (PDT) produces singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage tumor cells and the vasculature. The resulting effect is a balance between photo-oxidations through primary or secondary ROS and scavenging activity. Sensitizers are distributed in the extracellular space before and during cell sensitization, suggesting that PDT could act directly on cell structures and on extracellular compartments, including sera. In this study we endeavored to determine whether the application of PDT to culture medium could affect cell survival. Culture medium [RPMI 1640 supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS)] was incubated with Rose Bengal and irradiated before being added to cells for various contact times as a replacement for untreated medium. Cells were then kept in darkness until the survival assay. Treated medium reduced cell survival by up to 40% after 30 min of contact for 10 microg/ml of Rose Bengal and 20 J/cm(2). Rose Bengal or m-THPC alone or irradiated in water had no effect. This effect was dependent on the doses of Rose Bengal and light and decreased when FCS was replaced by human serum mixed with FCS. The reduction in survival observed with treated medium was more pronounced when the cell doubling time was shorter. Analysis of ROS or peroxide production in treated medium by DCFH added at the end of irradiation of Rose Bengal in serum-containing medium revealed a long-lasting oxidizing activity. Our findings support the hypothesis of an ROS- or peroxide-mediated, PDT-induced, long-lasting cell toxicity.
