We compared the acute effect of insulin on the human colonic intestinal epithelial cell line CaCo-2 and the transformed human hepatic cell line HepG2. Over 24 h, 100 nM and 10 microM insulin significantly inhibited the secretion of apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 from HepG2 cells to 63 and 49% of control, respectively. Insulin had no effect on the secretion of apoB-48 from CaCo-2 cells. There was no effect of insulin on the cholesterol ester or free cholesterol concentrations in HepG2 or CaCo-2 cells. HepG2 and CaCo-2 cells bound insulin with high affinity, leading to similar stimulation of insulin receptor protein tyrosine kinase activation. Protein kinase C or mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in the presence or absence of insulin was not correlated with apoB-48 production in CaCo-2 cells. Therefore, insulin acutely decreases the secretion of apoB-100 in hepatic HepG2 cells, but does not acutely modulate the production or secretion of apoB-48 from CaCo-2 intestinal cells.
