The cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ are two important factors in the growth and maintenance of living cells. The addition of Ca2+ to living cells can cause a change in the three-dimensional (3D) structure of calcium binding proteins. Therefore, we decided to study whether the addition of CaCl2 and MgCl2 to three in vitro growing lung cancer cell lines could cause changes that could be measured by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The addition of CaCl2 or MgCl2 to lung cancer cells caused an increase in absorbance of the trough at 1410 cm(-1). This translated into an inversion of the 1410/1395 cm(-1) ratio following the addition of CaCl2 or MgCl2 for all three lung cancer cell lines. Also, the amide I peak shifted from around 1631 cm(-1) to lower wavenumbers when CaCl2 or MgCl2 was added to cancer cells. Furthermore, the addition of these two substances caused a shift of the peak between 3290 and 3395 cm(-1). Finally, while the addition of CaCl2 to lung cancer cells was associated with an increased cell death, this was not the case following the addition of MgCl2. This would confirm that the changes seen in the spectra of all three cell lines are due to metabolic and ionic shifts rather than cell death.
