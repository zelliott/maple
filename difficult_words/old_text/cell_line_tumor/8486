In an attempt to discover new potent inhibitors for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a series of 2-(2-hydrazinyl)thiazole derivatives with a wide range of substitutions at 2-, 4- and 5-positions were designed by considering Lipinski rule. The designed compounds were synthesized, characterized and evaluated for their inhibitory potential against Mtb, H₃₇Rv, by in vitro assay. The compounds, ethyl-4-methyl-2-[(E)-2-[1-(pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene]hydrazin-1-yl]-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylate, 4d, and ethyl-2-[(E)-2-[(2-hydroxyphenyl)methylidene]hydrazin-1-yl]-4-methyl-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylate, 2i showed noticeable inhibitory activity against Mtb, H37Rv with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12.5 μM and 25 μM respectively. An attempt has been made to understand the mechanism of action by binding interactions of these molecules with β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase protein through docking studies. The inhibition constants for compounds 4d and 2i were found to be 1.46 μM and 0.177 μM respectively.
