it is important to find inhibitors for metastasis of ovarian cancer (OC). OC cells (OCC) produce Lysophosphophatidic acid (LPA), which promotes the OC development. Phospholipase A(2); (PLA(2);) is responsible for LPA production. This study is to investigate the effect of PLA(2); inhibitors on the metastasis of OC.

cell migration and adhesion were measured by Transwell assay. The expression and activation of PLA(2); were detected by Western blot. Invasion into the peritoneal monolayer was detected through ECIS. LPA concentration was measured by mass spectrum. Metastasis was detected through in vivo OC model.

(1) LPA promoted the migration and adhesion of SKOV3 in a dose-dependent manner in vitro; (2) iPLA(2); and cPLA(2); expressed highly and activated in SKOV3. (3)AACOCF3 and HELSS significantly inhibited LPA secretion from SKOV3; (4)AACOCF3 and HELSS significantly inhibited the distant metastasis of SKOV3 in mude mice model.

LPA significantly enhanced the migration, adhesion and invasion of SKOV3. AACOCF3 and HELSS significantly inhibited the LPA secretion, migration and invasion of SKOV3. They also inhibited the distant metastasis of SKOV3 in vivo. Our data suggest AACOCF3 and HELSS may be the potential inhibitors of metastasis of OC.
