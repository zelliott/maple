To establish an in vitro model of perineural invasion (PNI) with co-culture of human pancreatic cancer cells and rat root ganglion, to observe the neurite outgrowth and pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and migration, and to explore the molecular basis of perineural invasion (PNI) of pancreatic cancer.

Human pancreatic cancer cell line (MIA PaCa-2) and rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were co-cultured in Matrigel matrix to generate the PNI model. The neurite outgrowth, pancreatic cancer cell colony formation, neurite-colony contact and retrograde migration were observed under an inverted microscope. The data were analyzed with the Image-Pro Plus 5.0 system. The proliferative index (PI) was measured by immunohistochemical staining with the Ki-67 antibody. In order to determine the absorbance (A) of the pancreatic cancer cells, MTT assay was used. The apoptotic index (AI) was evaluated by flow cytometry.

Neurite outgrowth was stimulated in the presence of pancreatic cancer cells. After 72 hours of the co-culture, MIA PaCa colonies co-cultured with DRG exhibited a significantly larger colony area (242.83 ± 4.92) than that of the control (182.50 ± 5.39, P < 0.001). In the MIA PaCa-2/DRG co-culture system, the neurites exhibited a trend of growing towards the pancreatic cancer cell colony. However, the pancreatic cancer cells showed a trend of retrogradely migrating to the DRG along the neurite outgrowth, when MIA PaCa-2 colonies touched the DRG. The positive rate of Ki-67 nuclear antigen was significantly higher than in the co-culture group. The PI value was higher in the experimental group (12.80%) than that in the control group (6.81%, P < 0.01). The MTT assay showed that proliferation of the pancreatic cancer cells was more active than that in the control group. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the apoptosis rate of the pancreatic cancer cell was 2.46%, significantly lower than that of the control group (4.89%, P < 0.001).

An in vitro co-culture model of rat dorsal root ganglion and human pancreatic cancer cell line is successfully established in this study. This MIA PaCa-2/DRG co-culture system demonstrates that the neural-pancreatic carcinoma cell interaction is a mutually beneficial process for the growth of neurites and pancreatic carcinoma cells. The pancreatic cancer cells show a trend of migrating to the DRG along the neurite outgrowth.
