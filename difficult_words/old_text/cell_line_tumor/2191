The revival of interest in cancer cell metabolism in recent years has prompted the need for quantitative analytical platforms for studying metabolites from in vivo sources. We implemented a quantitative polar metabolomics profiling platform using selected reaction monitoring with a 5500 QTRAP hybrid triple quadrupole mass spectrometer that covers all major metabolic pathways. The platform uses hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with positive/negative ion switching to analyze 258 metabolites (289 Q1/Q3 transitions) from a single 15-min liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry acquisition with a 3-ms dwell time and a 1.55-s duty cycle time. Previous platforms use more than one experiment to profile this number of metabolites from different ionization modes. The platform is compatible with polar metabolites from any biological source, including fresh tissues, cancer cells, bodily fluids and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Relative quantification can be achieved without using internal standards, and integrated peak areas based on total ion current can be used for statistical analyses and pathway analyses across biological sample conditions. The procedure takes ∼12 h from metabolite extraction to peak integration for a data set containing 15 total samples (∼6 h for a single sample).
