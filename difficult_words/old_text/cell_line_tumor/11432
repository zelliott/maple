A novel series of N(1)-(3-fluoro-4-(6,7-disubstituted-quinolin-4-yloxy)phenyl)-N(4)-arylidenesemicarbazide derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their c-Met kinase inhibition and cytotoxicity against A549, HT-29, MKN-45 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell lines in vitro. Several potent compounds were further evaluated against three other cancer cell lines (U87MG, NCI-H460 and SMMC7721). Most of compounds tested exhibited moderate to excellent activity. The studies of SARs identified the most promising compound 28 (c-Met IC50=1.4nM) as a c-Met kinase inhibitor. In this study, a promising compound 28 was identified, which displayed 2.1-, 3.3-, 48.4- and 3.6-fold increase against A549, HT-29, U87MG and NCI-H460 cell lines, respectively, compared with that of Foretinib.
