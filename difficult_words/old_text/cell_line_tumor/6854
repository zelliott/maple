Several materials have been used as drug delivery systems to maintain a high concentration of anticancer drugs at localized sites. The feasibility of using doxorubicin-loaded calcium phosphate cement (CPC) as a new material, which can release the drug as well as fill a postoperative bony defect, was investigated. The mechanical strength of cylinders of doxorubicin-loaded CPC was not lower than that of CPC alone. Culture medium incubated with doxorubicin-loaded CPC from 1 to 7 days suppressed the proliferation of RMT-1 E4 rat breast cancer cells. In rabbits with doxorubicin-loaded CPC in their femurs, histological examinations showed diffuse edematous changes in the medullary space, but neither fracture nor skin necrosis occurred. Doxorubicin-loaded CPC markedly inhibited the proliferation of sarcoma 180 cells in the mouse air-pouch model. These results indicate that doxorubicin-loaded CPC may be useful in the local treatment of malignant bone and soft tissue tumors.
