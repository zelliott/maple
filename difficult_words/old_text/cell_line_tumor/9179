To investigate the effect that PPAR-gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, PPAR-gamma) ligand rosiglitazone (rosiglitazone, RGZ) inhibits the cell proliferation of cholangiocarcinoma.

The cell line QBC939 of cholangiocarcinoma was interfered with different concentration of RGZ, and then calculated for the rate of cell proliferation inhibited at different concentration. The change of cell cycle and the rate of cell apoptosis at each concentration were detected by FCM.

RGZ showed the significant effect on inhibiting the cell proliferation of cholangiocarcinoma, especially on the 1200 mg/L concentration group. The highest inhibited rate of QBC939 cell proliferation could be up to 83.66%. After RGZ used to treat the cultured QBC939 cell for 48 h and 72 h, the inhibited rates of QBC939 cell proliferations of 1200 mg/L, 600 mg/L,300 mg/ L,150 mg/L, 75 mg/L and 37.45 mg/L groups were compared to those of control group, and with the statistics result of P < 0.001. Meanwhile the cell cycles were controlled significantly as well, 62.77% of the cells were detained in stage G0/G1.

In vitro PPAR-gamma ligand rosiglitazone has the significant proliferation inhibition effect to cell lines QBC939 of cholangiocarcinoma.
