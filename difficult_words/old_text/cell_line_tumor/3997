Here we report a new strategy for the buildup reaction of active siRNA species from short RNA fragments in living cells using a chemical ligation reaction. This strategy could decrease undesired immune responses and provide more latitude for RNAi technology in the design and concentration of introduced RNA compared to traditional siRNA methods.
