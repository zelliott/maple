Nanoparticulate systems are widely used for site-specific drug and gene delivery as well as for medical imaging. The mode of nanoparticle-cell interaction may have a significant effect on the pathway of nanoparticle internalization and subsequent intracellular trafficking. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy allows for real-time monitoring of nanoparticle-membrane interaction events, which can provide vital information in relation to design and surface engineering of therapeutic nanoparticles for cell-specific targeting. In contrast to other microscopy techniques, the bleaching effect by lasers in TIRF microscopy is considerably less when using fluorescent nanoparticles and it reduces photo-induced cytotoxicity during visualization of live-cell events since it only illuminates the specific area near or at the plasma membrane.
