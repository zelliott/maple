The separation of intact proteins by means of Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC) was demonstrated with human apoA-I, recombinant human apoM, and equine cytochrome C. Five different commercially available HILIC columns were compared. Using one of these columns, different glycosylated isoforms of apoM were separated from each other and from the aglyco-form.
