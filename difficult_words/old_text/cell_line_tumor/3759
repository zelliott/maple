Tianeptine (Tian) possesses neuroprotective potential, however, little is known about the effect of this drug in models of neuronal apoptosis. In the present study, we aimed (1) to compare the neuroprotective capacities of some antidepressants (ADs) in the models of staurosporine (St)- and doxorubicin (Dox)-evoked cell death, activating the intracellular and the extracellular apoptotic pathway, respectively; (2) to identify the Tian-modulated steps underlying its neuroprotective action; (3) to test the effect of various ADs against Dox-evoked cell damage in glia cells. Primary neuronal and glia cell cultures and retinoic acid-differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y (RA-SH-SY5Y) cells were co-treated with imipramine, fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, mirtazapine or Tian and St or Dox. The data showed the predominant neuroprotective effect of Tian over other tested ADs against St- and Dox-induced cell damage in primary neurons and in RA-SH-SY5Y cells. This effect was shown to be caspase-3-independent but connected with attenuation of DNA fragmentation. Moreover, neuroprotection elicited by Tian was blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3-K/Akt signaling pathways as well by inhibitor of necroptosis, necrostatin-1. Interestingly, the protective effects of all tested ADs were demonstrated in primary glia cells against the Dox-evoked cell damage. The obtained data suggests the glial cells as a common target for protective action of various ADs whereas in relation to neuronal cells only Tian possesses such properties, at least against St- and Dox-induced cell damage. Moreover, this neuroprotective effect of Tian is caspase-3-independent and engages the regulation of survival pathways (MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3-K/Akt).
