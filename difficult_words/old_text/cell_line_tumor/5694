Biologically functional cationic phospholipid-gold nanoplasmonic carriers have been designed to simultaneously exhibit carrier capabilities, demonstrate improved colloidal stability, and show no cytotoxicity under physiological conditions. Cargo, such as RNA, DNA, proteins, or drugs, can be adsorbed onto or incorporated into the cationic phospholipid bilayer membrane. These carriers are able to retain their unique nanoscale optical properties under physiological conditions, making them particularly useful in a wide range of imaging, therapeutic, and gene delivery applications that utilize selective nanoplasmonic properties.
