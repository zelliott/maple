This study reports an initial analysis of an EBV-infected B cell line (TCC36B), established from an urothelial carcinoma (UC) lesion of the renal pelvis.

Cytofluorometric and G-banding analyses were performed for phenotyping and cytogenetics. PCR was used to detect EBV DNA, and sequence analysis to investigate mutations and deletions of the latent membrane protein (LMP)-1 gene of EBV.

TCC36B cells proliferated in vitro and showed positivity for surface CD19, CD20, HLA-DR and IgG(Î»), indicating that they belong to B-cells. Cytogenetic analysis showed 46,XX with a unique clonal abnormality of dup(2)(p13p25). EBV DNA was detected in TCC36B cells. Sequence analysis revealed a 30-bp deletion and 7 point mutations on the LMP-1 gene in TCC36B cells.

These results suggest the involvement of an EBV variant in the pathogenesis of UC. This cell line should thus facilitate further investigations on the aetiological role of EBV in urothelial cancer.
