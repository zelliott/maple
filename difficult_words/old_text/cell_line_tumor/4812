Antioxidants are substances that may protect cells from the damage caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals. Although many subsequent studies have been done on antioxidants and cancer, studies that specifically assess the relation with ovarian cancer are very limited. The goal of this study was to establish alternative treatment methodologies in the treatment of the aggressive behavioral activity of ovarian carcinogenesis through investigation of the effects of antioxidants. The specific aims of this study were to analyze the effect of low and high doses of EGCG, Selenium, and Thymoquinone on ES-2 ovarian cell line at 24, 48, and 72 hours as determined by morphology, cell count, and biochemical markers. During phase I, experimental groups were administered physiological doses of specific antioxidants. Upon administration of epigallecatechin-3-gallate, selenium, and thymoquinone, selenium exhibited the largest effect on biochemical assays in the study. Analysis of collected data showed that antioxidants suppress metabolic activity, alter behavioral responses, and cause molecular damage. However, it has not been shown that the antioxidants utilized result in total eradication of ES-2 ovarian cancer cell line.
