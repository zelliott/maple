To construct the co-culture models of salivarya denoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) cells and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of chickens and investigate the promotive effects of SACC on neural tissue.

Glass-base culture dish was adopted to construct co-culture model of SACC-83 cells and DRG. SACC-83 cells were seeded in the medium pore with DRG around them. Outgrowth of neuronal processes was observed. Then DRG was cultured in the conditioned medium of SACC-83, with the groups of conditioned medium of MC3T3-E1 and HGF, the group of cell lysis buffer, the groups of serum-free medium and serum-plus medium as the controls. Outgrowth of neuronal processes was also recorded and compared with control groups.

In the co-culture model of tumor and neuronal tissue, SACC-83 cells produced a suitable microenvironment in which neuronal processes remarkably grow. Neuronal processes of most DRG displayed growth tendency toward SACC. The group of conditioned medium from SACC-83 manifested obvious promotive effects on DRG.

Co-culture model of tumor and neuronal tissue was successfully constructed, with which the promotive effects of tumor on outgrowth of neuronal processes could be observed. So hypothesized that SACC could secrete some neurotrophic factors to guide peripheral nerves gemmating and to trigger the cascade of the neural invasion in succession.
