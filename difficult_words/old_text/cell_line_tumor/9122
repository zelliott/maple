To investigate the effects of Adp53 and F56 on the growth and lung metastasis of breast cancer.

The BICR-H1 cells were inoculated into the mammary fatty pad of BALB/C nude mice and NOD/SCID mice to establish breast cancer model. Then the nude mice with xenograft tumor were randomized into group Adp53+F56, Adp53, F56 and control. The NOD/SCID mice with xenograft tumor were randomized into group Adp53+F56, Adp53, F56, Adlacz and control. They were treated for 3 weeks according to the plan, diversity of the volume and histopathology of xenograft tumor of nude mice was observed and the expressions of p53 and VEGF gene, and microvessel density (MVD) were detected by immunohistochemistry. Lung metastasis of breast cancer in NOD/SCID mice was observed.

(1) Intratumoral injections of Adp53, F56, and their combination resulted in an inhibition on the growth of xenograft tumor of BICR-H1 cells. The ultimate relative growth volumes of groups Adp53+F56, Adp53, F56 and control were 2.47,4.37,4.69 and 12.49 respectively. (2) After treatment, P53 positive rate of group Adp53+F56, Adp53 increased 9.4%, 6.3% than before respectively, but compared with control group, the difference is not significant (P=0.693); VEGF protein of group Adp53+F56, Adp53 and F56 decreased 21.9%, 9.4% and 3.1% than before respectively, but compared with control group, the difference was not significant (P=0.284). Necrosis and decrease of vessel in the tumor and morphological change of endothelium were observed under light microscope in the groups Adp53+F56, Adp53 and F56. MVD estimated by FVIII-RA staining of group Adp53+F56, Adp53 and F56 were 14.50+/-2.54, 16.28+/-3.44 and 18.06+/-7.66, compared with control group(24.93+/-6.53), the difference is significant (P=0.000). (3) The average number of lung metastasis of NOD/SCID mice in group Adp53+F56, Adp53 and F56 were 1.143+/-0.378, 2.750+/-0.886 and 3.375+/-0.518 respectively, lower than Adlacz group(5.000+/-0.816) and control group (5.670+/-0.817) obviously (P=0.000).

Adp53 combined with F56 can greatly inhibit growth and metastasis of breast cancer in vivo. The mechanism of anti-tumor effects of Adp53 and F56 may be related to the anti-angiogenesis effect on malignant tumor through inhibiting the expression and activity of VEGF.
