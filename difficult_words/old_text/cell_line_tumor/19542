To investigate the mechanisms of tumor inhibiting and immunoloregulation of Mylabris Mixture on H22 cancer-bearing mice.

H22 cancer-bearing mice were chosen to observe the effects of tumor inhibiting and detect the proliferation function of T lymphocytes, the toxicity function of NK cells, the changes of T lymphocytes and the contents of interferon-gamma and interleukin-4.

Mylabris Mixture could obviously inhibit the growth of H22 cancer in mice, and the tumor inhibition rat was 65.76%. The stimulation index of T lymphocyte transformation and percentage of NK cells in Mylabris Mixture-treated group were obviously higher than those in the normal control group. The subpopulation proportion of T lymphocytes in Mylabris Mixture-treated group was changed more than the normal control group. The production of interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 by T lymphocytes obviously increased in Mylabris Mixture-treated group ( p<0.05,  p<0.001).

Mylabris Mixture has the effect of inhibiting the growth of tumor constitution, and regulating immunological function on mice with tumor. Its mechanisms include the reinforcement of T lymphocyte immune function, NK cell killing function and humoral immune function.
