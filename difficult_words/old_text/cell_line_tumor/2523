Increasing evidence suggest that epigenetic mechanisms (e.g. histone modification by histone deacetylases) play a major role in the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). We treated HL cell lines with the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat and investigated the gene expression profile of these cells by using DNA microarrays. Vorinostat inhibited cell proliferation and induced chances in the gene expression profile of HL cells, including down regulation of interleukin-26 and CD30. Vorinostat also increased sensitivity for cisplatin. Our data suggest that the combination of vorinostat and chemotherapy might be an interesting option for patients with chemoresistant HL.
