Androgens have been implicated in increasing ovarian cancer risk. Most ovarian cancer cells have high telomerase activity which is effective in inducing ovarian carcinogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of testosterone and androstenedione on the viability of an ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line, the activity and expression of telomerase, and the phosphorylation status of its catalytic subunit in these cells. Results showed that androgens significantly increased the viability of ovarian cancer cells and that these hormones induced the expression, activity and phosphorylation of telomerase. This upregulation was blocked by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway inhibitors. These findings might have implications for understanding the role of androgens in ovarian carcinogenesis.
