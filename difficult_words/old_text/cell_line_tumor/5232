To explore the effect of Rac1 siRNA on the expression of Rac1 and the biological behaviors of gastrointestinal cancer cells.

Rac1 siRNA was transfected into human gastric cancer cell line SGC803 and colorectal cancer cell line Lovo by lipofectamine 2000. The expression of Rac1 in these cell lines were detected by Western blot and RT-PCR after 48 hours of the transfection. The effect of Rac1 on the proliferation of human gastric cancer cell line SGC803 and colorectal cancer cell line Lovo were tested by CCK8 kit. The motility of the transfected and the control cancer cells were assessed by Wound-healing assay and invasion assay. The apoptotic index was evaluated by Hoechst 33258 staining and FCM.

Rac1 siRNA can down-regulated the expression of Rac1 on human gastric cancer cell line SGC803 and colorectal cancer cell line Lovo remarkably, and Rac1 siRNA can inhibit both the proliferation and motility of the transfectants. Analysis of apoptosis demonstrated that Rac1 siRNA can promote apoptosis of the gastric cancer cells and colorectal cancer cells.

Rac1 play an important role in the regulation of biological behaviors of human gastric cancer and colorectal cancer cells, and the interference of Rac1 expression could provide a novel path in reversing the malignant phenotypes of these malignancies.
