Bone sialoprotein (BSP), a phosphorylated and sulphated glycoprotein that is expressed by mineralized connective tissues is also produced in tumors that metastasize to bone. To facilitate studies of BSP expression in normal and pathological human tissues a monoclonal antibody (BSP 1.2 mab) was raised against human bone BSP. BSP 1.2 mab was shown by ELISA assays to recognize the epitope "DEYSY" (amino acids 279-283) that is conserved in mammalian BSP sequences. However, whereas the antibody recognized recombinant BSPs expressed in bacteria, it did not recognize native forms of rat or pig BSP in which the first tyrosine of the DEYSY peptide sequence appears to be modified. Immunostaining of embryonic human tibiae and calvariae with BSP 1.2 mab showed strong reaction in osteoblasts and osteocytes with relatively weak staining of the bone matrix, suggesting that the BSP 1.2 mab epitope is partially masked in the bone matrix. BSP 1.2 mab also stained osteosarcoma cells and normal trophoblastic cells in the placenta in areas of microcrystalline deposits. Cancer cells in primary breast tumors, lymph nodes, and secondary bone metastases from individual patients were stained strongly by BSP 1.2 mab. Although BSP 1.2 mab also stained breast cancer carcinoma cell lines and SaOS2 osteosarcoma cells, biosynthesis of radiolabelled BSP could not be demonstrated in breast cancer cells. Notably, the staining of BSP in the breast cancer cells was diffuse contrasting the punctate staining, typical of secreted proteins, in SaOS2 cells. These studies, therefore, have identified a unique epitope in human BSP recognized by a monoclonal antibody, BSP 1.2 mab, which can be used for the unequivocal identification of BSP in normal and pathological human tissues.
