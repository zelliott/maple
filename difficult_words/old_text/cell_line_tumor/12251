We evaluated the changes of metallothionein induction and cellular zinc distribution in HepG2 cells by interferonbeta treatment. Immunohistochemical staining of metallothionein was observed in the cytoplasm and nuclei of hepatocytes; which was observed predominantly in the cells treated with interferon and zinc compared to those with zinc alone, interferon alone or the no-treated control. The cellular zinc level was higher in order of the interferon- and zinc-treated cells, the zinc-alone-treated cells, and the interferon-alone-treated cells. Flow cytometry showed that S-phase population increased in interferon-alone-treated cells and interferon- and zinc-treated cells, but not in zinc-alone-treated ones. Cellular elemental distribution was analyzed using in-air micro-particle induced X-ray emission. In zinc-alone-treated sample, X-ray spectra showed good consistency between the enhanced cellular zinc distribution and the phosphorous map. Localizations of bromine followed by interferon treatment were found accompanying a spatial correlation with the phosphorous map. The samples treated with interferon and zinc showed the marked accumulation of zinc and bromine. Discrete bromine accumulation sites were clearly visible with a strong spatial correlation followed by zinc accumulation. These findings suggest that interferonbeta in combination with zinc predominantly induces metallothionein expression in HepG2 cells. In addition, interferonbeta may promote the translocation of metallothionein-bound zinc from cytoplasm to S-phase nuclei.
