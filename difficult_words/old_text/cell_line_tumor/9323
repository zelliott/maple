The cellular models used usually to study hepatitis C virus replication involve coupling between translation and replication. Because this linkage makes detailed analyses difficult a new cellular model was developed where replication is rendered independent of translation. The RNA replication was studied using RNA minigenomes where the reporter gene was flanked by the two untranslated regions of HCV. It was shown that these RNA minigenomes could be stably replicated into Huh7 cells expressing the HCV replication complex. This was obtained either by constitutively expressing the non-structural proteins into Huh7 hepatoma cells or by using Huh7 cells harboring replicons.
