Industrial and municipal processes may produce and release endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) into the environment, but the exact nature of their effects is difficult to investigate. EDCs typically exert their effect by affecting gene expression aberrantly. To determine if gene expression profiles could be used to detect and distinguish estrogenic EDCs, an estrogen receptor positive human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) was exposed to known estrogenic compounds, suspected EDCs, and extracts from three effluent samples. A set of specifically estrogen-regulated genes was identified by microarray analysis. Nine estrogen up-regulated genes (IGFBP4, HSPA8, B4GALT1, XBP1, KRT8, GTPBP4, HNRPAB, SLC2A1, and CALM1) and two estrogen down-regulated genes (ID2 and ZNF217) were consistently detectable in response to estrogen and other estrogenic compounds. Gene expression patterns in cells that were exposed to effluent sample extracts were compared to gene expression patterns in cells that were exposed to known endocrines. Using this technique, two of the effluent samples were shown to have estrogenic activity. This approach could easily be extended to screen for other types of receptor-mediated endocrine disruption. For example, cells expressing androgen or aryl hydrocarbon receptors could be used in gene expression profiling assays to detect androgenic effects or for the presence of bioactive aromatic hydrocarbons. Gene expression profiling is emerging as a sensitive and specific method to screen complex samples for endocrine disrupting activity.
