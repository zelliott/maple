Epigenetic alterations, known as epimutations, act by deregulating gene expression. These epimutations are reversible through the action of chromatin modifiers such as DNA methylation (DNA-met) and histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors. The present study evaluated the effect of 5-azacitidine (5-aza) and sodium butyrate (NaBu) as inhibitors of DNA-met and HDAC, respectively, in the expression of genes involved in apoptosis.

D54-MG, U373-MG, and T98G cell lines were exposed to 8 mM of NaBu and 12 μM of 5-aza, as well as a combination of both, for 24 h. The expression of the Bcl-2, Bak-1, Bax, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9 genes was assessed by RT-PCR.

They show that the Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9 genes were not expressed by the U373-MG and T98G lines, and that the D54-MG line did not express Bak-1. After treatment, however, these cell lines expressed all of the genes due to the effect of 5-aza on Bak-1 in D54-MG and Caspase-9 in T98G, which suggests repression by DNA-met. Meanwhile, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9 were in the U373-MG and T98G lines expressed after NaBu treatment. The effect of 5-aza induced an increase in the expression of Bax and Bcl-2, while NaBu produced a similar effect on the Bak-1 and Bax genes.

Results reveal that histone deacetylation is the principle mechanism for repressing these genes and that their basal expression is regulated primarily by this form of histone modification.
