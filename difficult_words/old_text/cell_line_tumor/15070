Six new triterpenoid saponins, psychotrianosides A-F (1-6), and two known triterpenoid saponins, psychotrianoside G (7) and ardisianoside D (8), were isolated from Psychotria sp. Their structures were determined mainly by spectroscopic methods. The cytotoxic activities of 1-8 against five human cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, MCF-7/ADM, HepG2, and HepG2/ADM) are reported for the first time. Psychotrianoside C (3) showed the most potent antiproliferative activity among these saponins, and the IC50 value of 3 against MDA-MB-231 was 2.391 ± 0.161 µM. Compound 3 was also found to induce apoptosis.
