Ipaf has been associated with apoptosis, cytokine processing, and nuclear factor-kappaB activation. Here, we describe that Ipaf is highly expressed in myelomonocytic cells and that the mRNA levels of Ipaf progressively increase during differentiation of CD34(+) progenitors to granulocytes and monocytes. Additionally, treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and exposure to UV radiation induced the transcriptional activation of Ipaf in human leukemia HL-60 cells. Thus, Ipaf may contribute to modulate the response of myeloid cells to genotoxic and pro-inflammatory stimuli.
