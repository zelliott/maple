In this study, we showed that curcumin treatment resulted in activation of Chk1-mediated G2 checkpoint, which was associated with the induction of G2/M arrest and the resistance of cancer cells to curcumin-induced apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that inhibition of Chk1 significantly abrogated G2/M arrest and sensitized curcumin-resistant cells to apoptosis via upregulation of Bad and in turn the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. These results indicate that Chk1-mediated G2/M arrest may serve as a mechanism for curcumin resistance and Chk1 represents a potential target for the reversal of this resistance. Our findings should be helpful for clinical application of curcumin.
