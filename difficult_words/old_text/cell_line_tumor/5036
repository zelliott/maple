A high-throughput screening system for analyzing small molecule-induced coactivator (CoA) recruitment by the vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been developed. The vitamin D-induced protein-protein interactions between VDR and fluorophore (Cy3 or Cy5)-labeled TIF2 or SRC-1 were successfully detected by using a new HCHO fixing method of the protein complex on microplates. The results obtained from this screening of our synthetic vitamin D analogues suggest that the CoA-recruiting activities play an important role in determining the biological activity of various vitamin D analogues and explain the discrepancies between the VDR binding affinity and their biological activity.
