High interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression in tumors has been reported to be a favorable prognostic marker. Continuous exposure of ovarian cancer cells to IFN-γ was previously shown to result in significant growth inhibition and apoptosis. Our goal in this study was to evaluate the effect of plasmid-mediated stable IFN-γ expression on the SKOV-3 human ovarian carcinoma cell line.

SKOV-3 cells were stably transfected with the pEGFP-IFN-γ plasmid. IFN-γ mRNA was detected by RT-PCR and IFN-γ protein expression was measured by ELISA. Proliferation and cell death in transfected SKOV-3 cells were measured by methyl-thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and Hoechst 33258 staining, respectively and compared with untransfected and empty vector-transfected cells.

pEGFP-IFN-γ SKOV-3 cells efficiently expressed and secreted IFN-γ. They exhibited significantly decreased cellular proliferation when compared with control untransfected or empty vector-transfected cells (p < 0.05). The mode of cell death was primarily apoptosis.

Stable expression of IFN-γ significantly inhibits the proliferation of ovarian carcinoma cells and has the potential to be used in clinical applications to treat ovarian carcinoma in the future.
