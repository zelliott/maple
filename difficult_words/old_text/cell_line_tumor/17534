Resveratrol, which is found in grapes and wine, has been reported to have a variety of important pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet, and anti-carcinogenetic properties. In this study, using the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, we have analyzed a possible mechanism by which resveratrol could interfere with cell cycle control and induce cell death. Resveratrol treatment of MCF-7 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the cell growth and the cells accumulated at the S phase transition of the cell cycle at low concentrations, but high concentrations do not induce S phase accumulation. The anti-proliferative effects of resveratrol were associated with a marked inhibition of cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 4 proteins, and induction of p53 and Cdk inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP. Growth suppression by resveratrol was also due to apoptosis, as seen by the appearance of a sub-G1 fraction and chromatin condensation. In addition, the apoptotic process involves activation of caspase-9, a decrease of Bcl-2 as well as Bcl-XL levels, and an increase of Bax levels.
