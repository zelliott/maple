BRCA1 plays an important role in DNA damage and repair, homologous recombination, cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis. BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer often presents at an advanced stage, however, tend to have better response to platinum-based chemotherapy as compared with sporadic cases of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In spite of this, most patients will develop a recurrence and eventually succumb to the disease. Preclinical studies are currently investigating natural compounds and their analogs for tumor-directed targets in ovarian cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the STAT3 inhibitor HO-3867, a novel curcumin analog, has a therapeutic effect on BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer. Our novel agent, HO-3867 and a commercial STAT3 inhibitor, STATTIC, significantly inhibited BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer cells in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner. BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer cells treated with HO-3867 exhibited a significant degree of apoptosis with elevated levels of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7 and PARP. HO-3867 treatment induced more reactive oxygen species (ROS) in BRCA-mutated cells compared with wild-type cells, however, there was no increased ROS when benign ovarian surface epithelial cells were treated with HO-3867. BRCA1-mutated cancer cells had higher expression of Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 (pTyr705) as compared with other STAT proteins. Furthermore, treatment of these cells with HO-3867 resulted in decreased expression of pTyr705 and its downstream targets cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and survivin. In addition, overexpression of STAT3 cDNA provided resistance to HO-3867-induced apoptosis. Our results show that HO-3867, a potent STAT3 inhibitor, may have a role as a biologically targeted agent for BRCA1-mutated cancers either as an adjunct to cytotoxic chemotherapy or as a single agent.
