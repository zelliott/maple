To examine the differential gene expression among adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC-M, low metastasis ACC-2 and low differentiated mucoepidermoid carcinoma MEC-1 with gene array, and detect three important genes with real-time quantitative PCR.

Gene array was used to screen the differential genes, then three important genes were selected and detected by real-time quantitative PCR.

The gene contents of MDR-1, MRP-1 and CCD1 were MEC-1 > ACC-M > ACC-2, MEC-1 > ACC-M > ACC-2 and MEC-1 > ACC-M > ACC-2 respectively.

Drug resistance of MEC-1 is related with high content of MDR-1. High metastasis of ACC-M is concerned with high content of MRP-1 and low content of CCD-1. Low metastasis of ACC-2 has a relationship with low content of MRP1.
