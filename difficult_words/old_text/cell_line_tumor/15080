To evaluate the expression levels of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in human urothelial cancer of the bladder and to assess the therapeutic effects of treatment with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting HSP70 on human bladder cancer KoTCC-1 cells.

HSP70 expression in bladder cancer specimens obtained from 235 patients were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. We then analyzed changes in the growth and chemosensitivity of KoTCC-1 cells following treatment with HSP70 siRNA.

Expression levels of HSP70 protein in bladder cancer specimens were significantly related to major prognostic indicators, including pathologic stage and tumor grade. Treatment of KoTCC-1 with HSP70 siRNA resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of HSP70 expression. HSP70 siRNA significantly inhibited the growth of KoTCC-1 compared with that after treatment with scrambled control siRNA. Among several chemotherapeutic agents, the most powerful synergistic cytotoxic effect was observed when KoTCC-1 was treated with gemcitabine plus HSP70 siRNA, which induced more than 50% reduction in the IC50 of gemcitabine. Furthermore, a significant increase in the subG0-G1 fraction of KoTCC-1 and the DNA fragmentation was observed only after combined treatment with HSP70 siRNA and sublethal doses of gemcitabine, but not after treatment with either agent alone. Similarly, caspase-3 and caspase-9, but not caspase-8, in KoTCC-1 were synergistically activated by combined treatment with gemcitabine and HSP70 siRNA.

Silencing of HSP70 expression using siRNA could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer by inducing inhibition of tumor growth as well as enhancing chemosensitivity.
