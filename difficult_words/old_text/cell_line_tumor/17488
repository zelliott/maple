Interleukin (IL) 7 is a growth factor able to induce the growth and development of certain haematopoietic malignancies including lymphoma and leukaemia. Its effects on solid tumours, including breast cancer, are unknown. This report concerns the effect of IL-7 on the growth of breast cancer cells.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunoprecipitation were used to detect to detect IL-7 and its receptor (IL-7R) in breast cancer cell lines MDA MB-231 and MCF-7. These cells were treated with various concentrations of human recombinant IL-7 over specified intervals. Changes in growth were assessed using colorimetric and fluorescence-based technologies. Selective IL-7 downstream signalling inhibitors (wortmannin, JAK-3 inhibitor 1, piceatanol and AG 490) were use to clarify the pathways through which IL-7 may affect breast cancer growth.

IL-7 significantly accelerated the growth of MDA MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells (P = 0.004 and P = 0.012, respectively, in PicoGreenassay). The maximum effects were observed after incubation for 72 h. The stimulatory effect of IL-7 on cell growth was completely eliminated in the presence of wortmannin (P = 0.001 and P = 0.003 versus no inhibitor in MDA MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, respectively) and JAK-3 inhibitor 1 (P < 0.001 versus no inhibitor in both cell lines), but not in the presence of piceatanol and AG 490.

IL-7 induced the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro through a wortmannin-sensitive pathway. This may have an important impact on research into breast cancer development and progression.
