The use of Gaussia luciferase in a multiplex assay can have several advantages over the singleplex method for an experimental setup. Issues such as intersample variability, screening purposes, efficiency, and in vivo applications can be addressed using a multiplex assay. Here we describe a functional reporter multiplex method using Gaussia luciferase fused to epitope tags to identify the different reporters that are expressed. Tag specific antibodies are used to bind and separate the tagged luciferase reporters.
