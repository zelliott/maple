The present work evaluated the anticancer activity of methanol extracts from 24 plants used in Yemeni traditional medicine. To evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic potency of the investigated extracts, an established microtiter plate assay based on cellular staining with crystal violet was used with 5 human cancer cell lines: two lung cancer (A-427 and LCLC-103H), two urinary bladder carcinoma (5637 and RT-112) and one breast cancer (MCF-7) line. The methanolic extracts of Dendrosicyos socotrana, Withanina aduensis, Withania riebeckii, Dracena cinnabari and Buxus hildebrandtii exhibited the highest toxicity on all tumor cell lines with IC50 values ranging between 0.29 and 5.54 microg/ml. The extracts of Jatropha unicostata and Punica protopunica showed a moderate potency on the most tumor cell lines.
