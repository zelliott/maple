The damage induced by end products of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in astrocytoma tumors leads to cytotoxicity and cell death. Chromatin modifiers such as sodium butyrate (NaB) induce several genes involved in apoptosis, among others. The PDT improvement was evaluated by the measurement of its effectiveness in the treatment of U373-MG and D54-MG astrocytoma cell lines exposed to NaB. Cells exposed to 80 microg mL(-1) of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) as precursor of endogenous photosensitizer (PS), protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), induced 16.67% and 28.9% of mortality in U373-MG and D54-MG, respectively. The mortality increased to 70.62% and 96.7%, respectively, when U373-MG and D54-MG cells were exposed for 24 h to 8 mm NaB prior to ALA-induction. In this condition, re-expression of some genes related to apoptosis in U373-MG, and differentiation in D54-MG were induced. PpIX accumulation was higher than ALA-induction and the acetylation of histone H4 induced by NaB was verified by immunocytochemistry in both cells. It can be concluded that modified chromatin and genes induced by NaB increment the cellular death induced by PDT in astrocytoma cells using PpIX as endogenous PS.
