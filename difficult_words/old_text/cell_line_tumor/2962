Myxochelin A (1) is an inhibitor of tumor cell invasion produced by the bacterium belonging to the genus Nonomuraea. In order to obtain more potent inhibitors, a series of myxochelin analogues [2 and (S)-3-17] were synthesized through the coupling of lysine or diaminoalkane derivatives and appropriately protected hydroxybenzoate, followed by modification of functional groups and deprotection. These compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against invasion of murine colon 26-L5 carcinoma cells. Among the synthetic analogues tested, compound (S)-6 which possesses carbamoyl group at C-1 was found to be the most potent antiinvasive agent and is considered to be a promising lead molecule for the antimetastasis. Compound (S)-6 was also shown to inhibit gelatinase activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and in vivo lung metastasis in mice.
