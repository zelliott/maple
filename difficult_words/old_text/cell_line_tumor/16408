To generate an oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) permissive mouse melanoma cell line B16RHSV, preserving the tumorigenic ability in syngeneic mice.

The herpes simplex virus entry mediator (HVEM) gene was amplified by PCR from human melanoma cell line A375, and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector for sequencing. The HVEM gene was then cloned into pcDNA3 vector to generate pcDNA3-HVEM for transfection of mouse melanoma cell line B16-F10 cells. After that, the putative transfected cells were selected in full growth medium containing G418. The HVEM-expressing cells were isolated by immunomagnetic bead separation. The mouse melanoma cell line expressing oHSV receptor-HVEM, designated as B16RHSV, was generated. The permissibility of B16RHSV cells to oHSV infection was examined with green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing oHSV (oHSVGFP). To investigate the tumorigenic ability of both cells in vivo, 2×10(5) cells in 100 µl were subcutaneously inoculated into the right flanks of C57/BL mice.

In vitro, the B16RHSV mouse melanoma cells were shown by fluorescence microscopy capable of being infected by oHSVGFP. In vivo, the B16RHSV cells, like their wild type counterpart, grew to form melanoma in syngeneic mice.

A herpes simplex virus-permissive mouse melanoma cell line was established. Its tumorigenicity remained unchanged.
