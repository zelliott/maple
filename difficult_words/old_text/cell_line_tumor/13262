The antitumor activities of DOX-loaded alginic acid/poly[2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (ALG-PDEA) nanoparticles are evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. TEM imaging shows that the ALG-PDEA NPs have a spherical morphology with a size of about 120 nm. CLSM observations reveal that the negatively charged ALG-PDEA NPs can be taken up well by cells. In vivo NIR fluorescence imaging shows that the ALG-PDEA NPs can passively target the tumor area because of the EPR effect in the H22 tumor-bearing mouse. In vivo antitumor efficacy examinations indicate that DOX-loaded ALG-PDEA NPs have significantly superior efficacy in impeding tumor growth compared to free DOX and low toxicity to living mice.
