To establish differential proteomics profiles of glioblastoma cell lines from Chinese, and to provide reference for future basic studies.

Total protein was extracted from 3 glioblastoma cell lines, CHG-5, TJ899 and TJ905. After normalization, the total protein was presented by two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis, scanned and analyzed. Some of the identified protein spots were verified by immunocytochemistry of cell lines and immunohistochemistry of solid tumors. The glia cells were used as the control throughout the study.

A total of 13 differential protein spots were selected, and eventually 10 were identified as unique proteins. These 10 proteins were involved in cytoskeleton forming, cellular metabolism, tumor migration, stress and inflammatory reaction. Immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry further confirmed these proteins present in the solid tumors.

Distinct differential proteomics profiles exist in glioblastoma cell lines and normal glia cells, likely related to the transformation of normal glia to glioma.
