Cys-(Pro)3-Glu-Leu hexapeptide markedly stimulated activity of human natural killers during the cytotoxic test in the presence of autologous serum, but not fetal calf serum. This effect of hexapeptide on natural killer activity was physiological. Conditions are determined under which hexapeptide stimulates the cytotoxicity in a mode ensuring protection of the microenvironment from damage inflicted by own natural killer cytotoxic factors.
