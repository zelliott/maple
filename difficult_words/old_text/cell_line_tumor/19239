(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the principal polyphenol in green tea, has been shown to be a potent chemopreventive agent. Recently, 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) has been identified as a cell surface receptor for EGCG that mediates the anticancer activity of EGCG. Indeed, expression of 67LR confers EGCG responsiveness to tumor cells; however, the molecular basis for the anticancer activity of EGCG in vivo is not entirely understood. Here we show that (i) using a direct genetic screen, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) is identified as a component responsible for the anticancer activity of EGCG; (ii) through both eEF1A and 67LR, EGCG induces the dephosphorylation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) at Thr-696 and activates myosin phosphatase; and (iii) silencing of 67LR, eEF1A, or MYPT1 in tumor cells results in abrogation of EGCG-induced tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Additionally, we found that eEF1A is up-regulated by EGCG through 67LR. Overall, these findings implicate both eEF1A and MYPT1 in EGCG signaling for cancer prevention through 67LR.
