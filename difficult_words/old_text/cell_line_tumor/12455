Accelerations of bone-like apatite deposition and cell growth on an electrically polarized ceramic hydroxyapatite have been reported. A relationship between these phenomena was investigated in a previous report, and then it was suggested that osteoblast-like cell's (MC3T3-E1) growth had relevance to the mineral growth. The effect of the formed apatite layer especially appeared to be on the cell adhesion. The acceleration of cell proliferation on the polarized HAp has been shown using fibroblastic cell (L929) and nerve cell (SK-N-SH) lines, therefore the effect of the layer on L929 and SK-N-SH was investigated to support the mechanism of acceleration of cell proliferation by polarization of HAp. In this study, the effect of the bone-like apatite layer was not confirmed on L929 cell's growth. On the other hand, the acceleration of nerve cell's proliferation was confirmed on the formed apatite layer. However, the remarkable improvement of the cell adhesion of SK-N-SH was not confirmed on the apatite layer. Consequently, it was considered that the bone-like apatite containing serum protein obtained by the coprecipitation of bone-like apatite and serum protein has a pronounced role only in the activity of osteoblast-like cells.
