Three (1,2,4) and one known (3) triterpenoid saponins were isolated from the bark of Albizia procera. The saponins were characterized as 3-O-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1-->6)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl] echinocystic acid (1), 3-O-[alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-fucopyranosyl-(1-->6)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl] echinocystic acid (2) and 3-O-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1-->6)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl] acacic acid lactone (4). Their structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR experiments, FABMS as well as chemical means. Saponins 1 and 3 exhibited cytotoxicity against HEPG2 cell line with IC50 9.13 microg/ml and 10 microg/ml, respectively.
