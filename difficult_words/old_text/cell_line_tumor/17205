In the present study the molecular mechanisms underlying tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) mediated regulation of the human gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) gene were examined. TPA challenge of HeLa cells resulted in an increase of GGT mRNA and enzyme activity. Deletion analysis of the promoter revealed that the -348 to +60 fragment was able to mediate TPA induced expression. Gel shift and supershift analyses showed that TPA treatment increased nuclear protein binding to a putative AP-1 site (-225 to -214) and that c-Jun was part of the complex. This AP-1 element, when cloned either in its native arrangement or as tandem repeat 5' of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter, mediated a significant increase of luciferase activity after TPA treatment of transfected HeLa cells, while its mutated counterpart abolished the induction. The same AP-1 element was able to mediate TPA induced expression in HepG2 cells. Collectively these results indicate that like other GSH metabolising enzymes, GGT too is a target for AP-1 mediated regulation.
