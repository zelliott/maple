Water-soluble carborane functionalized nanoparticles also co-functionalized with targeting antibodies have been prepared. We demonstrate tumour cell targeting with anti-EGFR antibodies and delivery of a high concentration of boron using SERS imaging. This suggests these materials have a therapeutic potential in addition to multimodal imaging capabilities.
