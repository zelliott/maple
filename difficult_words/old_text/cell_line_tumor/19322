A series of novel platinum(II) complexes involving a physiologically active carrier histamine as the carrier, cis-[Pt(histamine)X2] (X2=2Cl-, oxalate, malonate, 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylate (CBDCA), 3-hydroxy-1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylate (HO-CBDCA)), have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic data along with X-ray crystal structure for a representative complex cis-[Pt(histamine)Cl2]. The cytotoxicity of the complexes has also been assessed in the human cancer cell lines A549/ATCC, HT-29, and LNcap. One complex, cis-[Pt(histamine)Cl2], is more active than carboplatin against both the sensitive and resistant cells.
