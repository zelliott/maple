A pharmacophore mapping approach, derived from previous experience of PIKK family enzymes, was used to identify a hit series of selective inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Subsequent refinement of the SAR around this hit series based on a tri-substituted triazine scaffold has led to the discovery of potent and selective inhibitors of mTOR.
