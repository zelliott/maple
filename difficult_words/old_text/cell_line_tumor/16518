Cisplatin is the major agent in the standard first-line chemotherapy for NSCLC. However, only a small portion of patients achieve a tumor response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and eventually develop acquired resistance. The aim of this study was to identify potential biomarkers that could predict the efficacy of cisplatin.

Human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 was exposed to cisplatin for development of a resistant cell line, A549/DDP, and cisplatin-sensitivity was tested through the MTT assay. The global protein profiles from A549 and A549/DDP were compared using a proteomic approach. Western blot, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry validated the expression of DDH2 in cell lines and tumor xenografts. Serum levels of DDH2 were measured by ELISA in 105 NSCLC patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

The resistance of A549/DDP to cisplatin was 8.07-fold higher than that of A549 cells. Proteomic approach identified eight differentially (>5-fold) expressed proteins. Among them, secreted protein DDH2 was further investigated and it was found overexpressed through the method of Western blot, real-time PCR in cell lines, consistent with immunohistochemistry validation in xenograft. Clinical research showed that baseline serum DDH2 level in the patients with a progression disease was significantly higher than the patients of response or stable disease (9.036 vs. 3.529 and 3.982 ng/mL,  p<0.001) and serum DDH2 levels were significantly increased after cisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy (5.515 vs. 12.935 vs. 18.406 ng/mL  p<0.001, respectively).

DDH2 expression might be a potential predictor and monitor of cisplatin efficacy in advanced NSCLC patients.
