Recent studies have demonstrated that angiostatin, a newly discovered specific inhibitor of endothelial cells, may significantly suppress the growth of a variety of tumors. We constructed an eukaryotic expression vector containing angiostatin (pAG3 ). To study the effect of pAG3, we intramuscularly injected pAG3 into B16 melanoma bearing C57 mice, we found that pAG3 could obviously inhibit tumor growth and reduce the size of tumors in B16 melanoma bearing C57 mice compared to the untreated control mice. In addition, we also investigated whether pre-treatment of pAG3 can prevent the tumor formation in mice treated with B16 melanoma. Normal C57 mice which received 5 days of treatment of pAG3 prior to implanting tumors resulted in the inhibitory effect when compared to control mice. No promotive effect was observed when pAG3 was combined with DTIC (Dacarbazine). These findings provide a basis for the further development of nonviral delivery of angiogenic gene therapy.
