The hypoxic environment in solid tumors results from oxygen consumption by rapid proliferation of tumor cells. Hypoxia has been shown to facilitate the survival of tumor cells and to be a cause of malignant transformation. Hypoxia also is well known to attenuate the therapeutic activity of various therapies in cancer management. These observations indicate that hypoxia plays a critical role in tumor biology. However, little is known about the effects of hypoxia on apoptosis, especially on apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a potent apoptosis inducer that has been shown to specifically limit tumor growth without damaging normal cells and tissues in vivo. To address the effects of hypoxia on TRAIL-induced apoptosis, HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells were exposed to hypoxic or normoxic conditions and treated with soluble TRAIL protein. Hypoxia dramatically inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells, which are highly susceptible to TRAIL in normoxia. Hypoxia increased antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member proteins and inhibitors of apoptosis proteins. Interestingly, these hypoxia-increased antiapoptotic molecules were decreased by TRAIL treatment to the levels lower than those of the untreated conditions, suggesting that hypoxia inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis via other mechanisms rather than up-regulation of these antiapoptotic molecules. Additional characterization revealed that hypoxia significantly inhibits TRAIL-induced translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria in HCT116 and A549 cells, with the concomitant inhibition of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Bax-deficient HCT116 cells were completely resistant to TRAIL regardless of oxygen content, demonstrating a pivotal role of Bax in TRAIL-induced apoptotic signaling. Thus, our data indicate that hypoxia inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis by blocking Bax translocation to the mitochondria, thereby converting cells to a Bax-deficient state.
