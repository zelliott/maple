Many tumors have large homozygous deletions of the CDKN2A locus (encoding p14(ARF) and p16) and of CDKN2B (p15). Our aim was to determine which gene is the major target in bladder cancer. We used quantitative real-time PCR (RTQ-PCR) to determine copy number of p15, of p14(ARF) exon 1beta, and p16 exon 2 in 22 tumor cell lines and 83 bladder tumors, some of which had been assessed previously by duplex PCR. Titration experiments showed that homozygous deletion could be detected in the presence of up to 30% normal DNA. Results for cell lines were compatible with previous cytogenetic analyses. Ten cell lines and 32 tumors (38.5%) had homozygous deletion of at least one target. Thirteen tumors (15.7%) had deletion of all three targets. Two tumors had deletion of p14(ARF) exon 1beta alone and four of p16 exon 2 alone. RTQ-PCR detected more homozygous deletions than duplex PCR. Finally we used a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification kit to provide independent confirmation of results. We conclude that with appropriate controls RTQ-PCR is a sensitive and robust method to detect copy number changes in tumors even in the presence of contaminating normal cell DNA.
