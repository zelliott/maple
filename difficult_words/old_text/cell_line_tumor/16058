A series of ethacrynic acid analogues, lacking the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl unit, was synthesized and subsequently evaluated for their ability to inhibit the migration of human breast cancer cells, Hs578Ts(i)8 as well as of human prostate cancer cells, C4-2B. These cell lines provide a good model system to study migration and invasion, since they represent metastatic cancer. Our studies show that ethacrynic acid analogues with methyl substituents at the aromatic ring demonstrate no inhibitory effect on the migration of both cancer cell lines, whereas a precursor in the synthesis of these ethacrynic acid analogues (II-1, a para-acylated m-cresol) is an excellent inhibitor of the migration of both cancer cell lines.
