Endometrial carcinoma is a common malignancy of the genital tract. In the present study, we examined the expression of human steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450 scc), 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-desmolase (P45017alpha) and aromatase (P450 arom) in endometrial carcinoma cells to clarify the ability of these cells to produce steroid hormones. The results of RT-PCR analysis showed that StAR, P450 scc and P45017alpha genes were expressed in endometrial carcinoma cells. To examine the protein expression of StAR and P450 scc, we performed Western blotting using extracts from carcinoma cells. StAR protein and P450 scc were detected in both HHUA and HOUA-1 cells. The production of pregnenolone in HHUA cells increased 2.4-fold with transfection of a StAR expression vector and 4.3-fold with transfection of an F2 side-chain cleavage system. The RT-PCR product of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was present in endometrial carcinoma cells. In endometrial carcinoma cells, the production of progesterone also increased with over-expression of StAR and the F2 system. Results of steroid metabolic assays showed that endometrial carcinoma cells produced not only 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone but also androstenedione. Endometrial carcinoma cells express enzymes that are associated with the production of steroid hormones. Locally produced steroid hormones may have effects on tumor proliferation and tumorigenesis.
