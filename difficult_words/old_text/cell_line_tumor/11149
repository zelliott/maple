TNFalpha has been associated with both, tumor survival and apoptosis. This cytokine is also involved in promoting cell migration during wound healing and tumorigenesis. SW756 is a HPV18-positive cervical carcinoma cell line, which has been used to study different mechanisms of cervical cancer progression. An in vitro assay of scratch wound healing onto monolayers of SW756 cells was used to assess the effect of TNFalpha on cell migration into a wound space. It was found that SW756 cells have the ability to migrate, but not proliferate in response to scratch wounding in a serum-free medium supplemented with TNFalpha. RT-PCR analysis showed that SW756 cells express TNFalpha mRNA when incubated in medium with and without serum. Wound closure and migration rate of SW756 cells were significantly increased in the presence of serum-free media supplemented with TNFalpha (10 ng/mL) as compared to serum-free media, and media supplemented with either anti-TNFalpha antibody or both TNFalpha and anti-TNFalpha antibody (p < 0.05). The results showed a stimulatory effect of TNFalpha on the migration of SW756 cervical carcinoma cells, suggesting a novel and important role for TNFalpha in cervical cancer progression.
