Radioresistance is one of the main determinants of treatment outcome in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and treatment of radioresistant OSCC is difficult due to cross resistance to other conventional treatments. We aimed to identify whether genetically modified oncolytic adenovirus expressing relaxin (RLX), which affects collagen metabolism, can effectively inhibit growth of the radioresistant OSCC. Therapeutic effect of oncolytic adenovirus was compared between radiosensitive and radioresistant OSCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo, and spread of adenovirus throughout the tumor mass was verified by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Oncolytic adenovirus effectively killed cancer cells and there was no significant difference in the cytotoxic effect between radiosensitive and radioresistant OSCC cell lines. In animal experiments, the adenovirus significantly reduced the size of tumor, and there was no significant difference between radiosensitive and radioresistant OSCC. In IHC, RLX expressing adenovirus showed better proliferation and eliminated collagens more effectively compared to RLX nonexpressing adenovirus. These findings suggested that genetically modified oncolytic adenovirus can effectively inhibit growth of the radioresistant OSCC and might be a new therapeutic option in radioresistant OSCC.
