Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid crucial for the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer. Identification of LPA-induced biomarkers is necessary for predicting prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. Here we report periostin, an extracellular matrix protein, as an LPA-induced protein in stromal cells and as a prognostic marker in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In human EOC tissues, periostin was mainly expressed in cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts, but not in cancer cells. The expression levels of periostin highly correlated with poor survival and tumor recurrence of ovarian cancer patients. Treatment of human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells with LPA or conditioned media from human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines, such as SK-OV-3 and OVCAR-3, induced expression of periostin. The periostin expression induced by cancer-conditioned media was abrogated by silencing of the LPA receptor 1 expression using small hairpin RNA lentivirus. Recombinant periostin stimulated adhesion and invasion of SK-OV-3 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells and induced expression of matrix metalloprotease-2 in the cancer cells. These results suggest that LPA is associated with the expression of periostin in cancer-associated fibroblasts of EOC.
