Lx2-32c, a novel taxane derivative, is a semisynthetic analogue from cephalomannine. Its antitumor activity in vivo and in vitro was investigated in this study. Lx2-32c was cytotoxic (IC50=1.7+/-1.6nM) to various human tumor cell lines after 72h incubation. In vitro it enhanced the rate of tubulin polymerization in a dose-dependent manner and induced the bundling of microtubule in BGC-823 cells with the mode similar to that of paclitaxel. As determined by flow cytometry, after either 12 or 24h exposure, Lx2-32c caused BGC-823 cells G2/M phase arrest in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, we demonstrated that Lx2-32c had significant antitumor activity on BGC-823 (human gastric carcinoma) and A549 (human non-small cell lung carcinoma) xenograft in nude mice. These data suggest that Lx2-32c is a microtubule-stabilizing agent, which has significant antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo.
