Benzophenones and its analogues are known for wide range of biological properties. Synthetic benzophenone analogue 2-benzoyl -phenoxy acetamide (BP-1) is proven to be potent antitumor and proapoptotic activity against EAT cells in-vivo. In the present report, we studied the antiangiogenic effect of BP-1 in EAT cells induced angiogenesis. Treatment with BP-1 in-vivo was demonstrated by the down regulation of the secretion of VEGF from EAT cells and inhibition of blood vessels formation indicating the potential angioinhibitory effect of BP-1 in EAT cells. HIF-1alpha protein, a transcription factor known to be key a regulator in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis was also down regulated by BP-1. Our findings indicated that, HIF-1alpha nuclear sequestration is repressed by BP-1 through inhibition of nuclear translocation. We postulate that diminished HIF-1alpha nuclear presence and activity in BP-1 treated EAT cells could be responsible for decreased VEGF expression and antiangiogenic effects.
