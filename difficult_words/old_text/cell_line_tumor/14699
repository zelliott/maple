It is known that two cytoskeleton components, microtubules and actins filaments, are required for efficient endocytosis. The relative importance of these two components in the cellular uptake of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA)-DNA polyplexes was investigated in this study by applying microtubule depolymerising agent, colchicine, and actin polymerising inhibitor, cytochalasin D, in a cell transfection study. The effect of colchicine on transfection efficiency of polyplexes was found to be a time-dependent phenomenon, whereby the level of gene expression was inhibited at early stage, presumably to the disruption of a transport of vesicles along microtubules by colchicine. As time progressed, the level of gene expression was significantly enhanced relative to the control, possibly due to the failure in transport of vesicles from endosomes to late lysosomes, or due to the breakdown of nuclear membrane when mitosis was arrested at metaphase by colchicine. On the other hand, transfection efficiency was significantly reduced at all time points by cytochalasin D, which is considered to primarily affects invagination of vesicles at the early stage of endocytosis by inhibiting actin polymerisation. Further investigation to identify the endocytotic route of DMAEMA polyplexes was conducted applying clathrin- and caveolae- pathways inhibitors in cell transfection study. The results indicate that DMAEMA polyplexes were internalized primarily through clathrin-mediated pathway, with a minor fraction possibly entering cells via a caveolae-mediated pathway.
