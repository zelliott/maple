DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are two epigenetic mechanisms involved in the lack of estrogen receptor (ER) expression. Our previous studies demonstrated that mutant p53 along with repression complex proteins including DNMT1, HDAC1 and MeCP2 is associated with ER-negative promoter in MDA-MB-468 cells. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene silencing in these cells, we down-regulated DNMT1 and HDAC1 expression using siRNAs and studied the ability of DNMT1, HDAC1, MeCP2 and p53 in binding to ESR1 promoter CpG island. Our results showed that DNMT1 or HDAC1 down-regulation disassembled the repression complex proteins and mutant p53 from ER-negative promoter. The partial demethylation of ESR1 promoter and ER re-expression in down-regulated cells supports these findings. In vivo binding studies demonstrated that mutation of p53 protein in this cell line did not affect its binding capacity to DNMT1, HDAC1 and MeCP2 proteins. Our observations suggest that not only histone deacetylase activity of HDAC1 contributes to inactivation of methylated ESR1 gene but also HDAC1 presence on ESR1 promoter is important for assembly of DNMT1 in repression complex. In addition, our data revealed that mutant p53 protein binds to the promoter of ESR1 through direct interaction with HDAC1 and indirect interaction with DNMT1, MeCP2 proteins in the ER-negative MDA-MB-468 cells.
