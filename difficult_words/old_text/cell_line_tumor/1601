The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) heterodimerizes with hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), followed by upregulation of genes that are essential for carcinogenesis. We utilized a novel peptide (Ainp1) to address whether the HIF-1α signaling could be suppressed by an ARNT-mediated mechanism. Ainp1 suppresses the HIF-1α-dependent luciferase expression in Hep3B cells and this suppression can be reversed by ARNT. Ainp1 reduces the interaction between ARNT and HIF-1α, suppresses the formation of the HIF-1 gel shift complex, and suppresses the ARNT recruitment to the vegf promoter. These effects are partly mediated by redistribution of the nuclear ARNT contents to the cytoplasm.
