In the mouse embryo and differentiating embryonic stem cells, the hematopoietic, endothelial, and cardiomyocyte lineages are derived from Flk1+ mesodermal progenitors. Here, we report that surface expression of Podocalyxin (Podxl), a member of the CD34 family of sialomucins, can be used to subdivide the Flk1+ cells in differentiating embryoid bodies at day 4.75 into populations that develop into distinct mesodermal lineages. Definitive hematopoietic potential was restricted to the Flk1+Podxl+ population, while the Flk1-negative Podxl+ population displayed only primitive erythroid potential. The Flk1+Podxl-negative population contained endothelial cells and cardiomyocyte potential. Podxl expression distinguishes Flk1+ mesoderm populations in mouse embryos at days 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5 and is a marker of progenitor stage primitive erythroblasts. These findings identify Podxl as a useful tool for separating distinct mesodermal lineages.
