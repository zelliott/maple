To study the effect of short haipin RNA (shRNA) on expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and proliferation and invasion behavior of human breast cancer cell MCF-7.

The recombinant vector (pSIREN-VEGF-C) was transfected into the human breast cancer cell MCF-7 by liposome and the positive transfected cell clones were screened with puromycin. Expression of VEGF-C in MCF-7 cells after gene transfer was detected by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot assay, respectively. Proliferation and invasion ability of transfected cells were analyzed by MTT and Transwell filter.

The expressions of VEGF-C mRNA and protein were decreased markedly compared with the control group after the transfection and the inhibitive ratio was 95% and 100% respectively ( p<0.05). The proliferation of MCF-7 cells transfected by pSIREN-VEGF-C, measured with MTT assays, was significantly decended ( p<0.05). The invasion ability of passing through the Transwell filter of MCF-7 cells transfected by pSIREN-VEGF-C were declined evidently ( p<0.05).

The recombinant vector (pSIREN-VEGF-C) have been proved not only to be effective and specific for down-regulation of VEGF-C, but also can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of MCF-7 cells significantly.
