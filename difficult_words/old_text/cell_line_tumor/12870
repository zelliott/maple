Two of the hallmark features of melanoma are its development as a result of chronic UV radiation exposure and the limited efficacy of cisplatin in the disease treatment. Both of these DNA-damaging agents result in large helix-distorting DNA damage that is recognized and repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER). The aim of this study was to examine the expression of NER gene transcripts, p53, and p21 in melanoma cell lines treated with cisplatin compared with melanocytes. Basal expression of all genes was greater in the melanoma cell lines compared with melanocytes. Global genome repair (GGR) transcripts showed significantly decreased relative expression (RE) in melanoma cell lines 24 hours after cisplatin treatment. The basal RE of p53 was significantly higher in the melanoma cell lines compared with the melanocytes. However, induction of p53 was only significant in the melanocytes at 6 and 24 hours after cisplatin treatment. Inhibition of p53 expression significantly decreased the expression of all the GGR transcripts in melanocytes at 6 and 24 hours after cisplatin treatment. Although the RE levels were lower with p53 inhibition, the induction of the GGR genes was very similar to that in the control melanocytes and increased significantly across the time points. The findings from this study revealed reduced GGR transcript levels in melanoma cells 24 hours after cisplatin treatment. Our findings suggest a possible mechanistic explanation for the limited efficacy of cisplatin treatment and the possible role of UV light in melanoma.
