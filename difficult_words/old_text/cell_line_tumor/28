Cytotoxic activity of saponins and phenolic compounds have been described in the literature, but no reports were found on their multidrug resistance (MDR)-modulating effects on human mdr1 gene-transfected mouse lymphoma cell line.

Methylprototribestin, structurally related compounds and a mixture of 3 acetylated isomers of methylprotodioscin were investigated for antiproliferative effect and modulation of drug accumulation.

The growth inhibitory dose (ID50) of the compounds ranged from 12.64 to 20.62 mug/ml. Methylprototribestin was the most effective resistance modifier. However, methylprotodioscin, pseudoprotodioscin, prosapogenin A of dioscin, tribestin and 5-O-caffeoylshikimic acid showed moderate MDR reversal activity. In a checkerboard method, methyloprototribestin and the mixture of the 3 acetylated isomers enhanced the antiproliferative effects on MDR cells in combination with doxorubicin.

Based on these results, methylprototribestin and the mixture of the 3 acetylated isomers can be recommended for further in vivo experiments in combination with anthracyclines in human MDR-cancer xenograft transplanted mice.
