The largest energy consumer in the cell is the ribosome biogenesis whose aberrancy elicits various diseases in humans. It has been recently revealed that p53 induction, along with cell cycle arrest, is related with abnormal ribosome biogenesis, but the exact mechanism still remains unknown. In this study, we have found that aberrant ribosome biogenesis activates two parallel cellular pathways, c-Myc and ASK1/p38, which result in p53 induction and G1 arrest. The c-Myc stabilizes p53 by rpL11-mediated HDM2 inhibition, and ASK1/p38 activates p53 by phosphorylation on serine 15 and 33. Our studies demonstrate the relationship between these two pathways and p53 induction. The changes caused by impaired ribosomal stress, such as p53 induction and G1 arrest, were completely disappeared by inhibition of either pathway. These findings suggest a monitoring mechanism of c-Myc and ASK1/p38 against abnormal ribosome biogenesis through controlling the stability and activity of p53 protein.
