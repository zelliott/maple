To explore the role of tissue factor/activated factor VII (TF/FVIIa) complex in human ovarian cancer invasion and metastasis.

(1) Constructed an expression vector of TF, pcDNA3-TF and established a human ovarian cell line A2780/TF expressing high level TF by using molecular cloning and gene transfection techniques. (2) By Boyden chamber assay to count the numbers of A2780 and A2780/TF cells that penetrated the matrigel to the back of PVPF membrane after FVIIa stimulation. (3) BALB/c nude mice were used to establish experimental model of metastasis with A2780 or A2780/TF and the lung tissue sections were examined by microscopy for cancer metastasis.

(1) Compared with their parental A2780 cells, A2780/TF cells expressed high level of TF mRNA (3.99 +/- 0.15 vs 0.97 +/- 0.23, P < 0.01) and TF antigen on cell surface \[(48.56 +/- 9.53)% vs (2.73 +/- 1.15)%, P < 0.01\]. (2) After stimulation, the A2780/TF cell number on the back of PVPF membrane increased from basal level 157.3 +/- 19.2 to 447.7 +/- 39.4 (P < 0.01), which could decreased to basal level when coincubated with anti-TF antibody. (3) Cancer metastasis was found in 22.2% of nude mice transplanted with A2780 cells, while in 88.9% of those transplanted with A2780/TF cells.

TF could promote the invasion and metastasis of human ovarian cancer cells through TF/FVIIa pathway.
