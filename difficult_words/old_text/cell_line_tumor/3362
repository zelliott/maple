Prodrugs of potent aldehyde analogues of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) were synthesized. These prodrugs were efficiently activated by antibody 93F3 and no drug formation was observed in the absence of 93F3 in either phosphate buffered saline or cell culture media. In the presence of antibody 93F3, these prodrugs were activated and decreased the proliferation of human cancer cells in in vitro proliferation assays.
