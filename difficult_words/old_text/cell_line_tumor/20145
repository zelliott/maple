We aimed to investigate the relationship between miRNA-146a and latent membrane             protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).             The expression levels of LMP1 in 40 cases of NPC, 28 cases of chronic nasopharyngitis             and NPC cell lines CNE1 and CNE1-GL (in which LMP1 was stably transfected) were             detected by immunohistochemical staining. The expression of miRNA-146a in 16 cases             of NPC, 13 cases of chronic nasopharyngitis and cell lines was determined by quantitative             reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. A plasmid             containing the luciferase gene under the control of miRNA-146a promoter (pri-miRNA-146a)             was constructed and transfected into NPC cells, and the luciferase activity was             detected. LMP1 was positive in 17.9% (5/28) of chronic nasopharyngitis cases and             62.5% (25/40) of NPC cases ( p<0.01). The miRNA-146a levels in NPC were significantly             higher than that in chronic nasopharyngitis ( p<0.01), and were higher in CNE1-GL             cells than those in CNE1 cells ( p<0.01). The expression of miRNA-146a in human             NPC was elevated by EBV-associated antigen LMP1, probably through the activation             of the miRNA-146a promoter.
