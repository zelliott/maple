To investigate the effect of B7-H1 blockade on proliferation, activation, and antitumor immunity of CD3AK cells.

CD3AK cells were induced by stimulation of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes with CD3 mAbs. Then the cells were cultured with anti-B7-H1 mAbs to block B7-H1 pathway. The proliferation efficiency of CD3AK cells was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation assay and the concentrations of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-10 were measured by ELISA method. Meanwhile the killing activity of CD3AK cells on bladder cancer cell line BIU-87 was measured by MTT method.

Blockade of B7-H1 greatly promoted the proliferation of CD3AK cells and extended the survival time of CD3AK cells in vitro. It also enhanced IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha secretion but suppressed IL-10 secretion. And the cytotoxic effect of CD3AK cells on BIU-87 cells were significantly enhanced.

Blockade of B7-H1 can promote and retain the proliferation and activation of CD3AK cells. It can also improve the antitumor immunity mediated by CD3AK cells. The manipulation of B7-H1 may become a beneficial target for immunotherapy in tumors.
