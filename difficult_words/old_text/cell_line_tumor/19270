Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-activated gene (NAG-1), a divergent member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, was previously identified as a gene induced by several anti-tumorigenic compounds, including NSAIDs and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands in humans. In this study, canine NAG-1 was characterised from a canine genomic database. Gene induction by some NSAIDs and PPARgamma ligands was demonstrated in canine osteosarcoma cell lines. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that canine NAG-1 is more homologous with the corresponding mouse and rat genes than with human NAG-1. Expression of canine NAG-1 was increased by treatment with piroxicam and SC-560 (NSAIDs) and the PPARgamma ligand rosiglitazone. This study demonstrates that canine NAG-1 is up-regulated by some anti-tumorigenic compounds in osteosarcoma cell lines and may provide an important target of chemotherapy in canine cancer.
