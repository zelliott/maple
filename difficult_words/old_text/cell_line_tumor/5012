Synthesis and cytotoxic activity of a series of 4-methyl-1,2,3-selenadiazole-5-carboxylic acid amides on human fibrosarcoma HT-1080, mouse hepatoma MG-22A, and mouse fibroblasts 3T3 cell lines are described. The correlation between compound LD(50) and 3T3 fibroblast cell line morphology was shown. In vivo evaluation of amides on mouse sarcoma S-180 confirms high antitumor activity (58-85%).
