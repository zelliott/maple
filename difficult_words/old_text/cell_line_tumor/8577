Vaccination with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-derived dendritic cells (DCs) is a promising immunotherapeutic approach to prevent relapse of AML. However, in clinical practice AML-derived DC culture is unfeasible in 40% of cases. Here, we demonstrate that AML cells can be expanded in vitro prior to differentiation with cocktails of cytokines with known myeloid growth-promoting effects.

Nine out of 13 initially CD14(-) samples gain de novo CD14 (>10%) expression (69% increment; p = 0.01) after in vitro expansion. These expanded CD14(+) leukemic cells displayed a high probability (six out of six initially CD14(-) samples tested) to differentiate into DCs upon culture with GM-CSF, TNF-Î± and IL-4.

Induction of CD14 on initially CD14(-) AML cells potentially increases the number of patients eligible for DC-based immunotherapy.
