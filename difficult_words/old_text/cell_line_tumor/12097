Glucocorticoids are one component of combined treatment regimens for many types of lymphoma due to their ability to induce apoptosis in lymphoid cells. In WEHI7.2 murine thymic lymphoma cells, altering catalase and glutathione peroxidase activity by transfection or the use of chemical agents modulates the ability of glucocorticoids to induce apoptosis. This suggests that the oxidative stress response is important in determining the glucocorticoid sensitivity of the cells. For glutathione peroxidase and catalase to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing equivalents in the form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form (NADPH) are ultimately required. The major source of NADPH in the cell is glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Therefore, we created G6PDH-overexpressing WEHI7.2 variants to test whether G6PDH activity is a key determinant of glucocorticoid sensitivity in WEHI7.2 cells. G6PDH-overexpressing WEHI7.2 cells were more sensitive to oxidative stress and glucocorticoids. The G6PDH-overexpressing WEHI7.2 variants appeared similar to cells undergoing glucose deprivation with decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by the mitochondria and increased basal levels of ROS. Overexpression of G6PDH also sensitized the cells to other standard lymphoma chemotherapeutics including cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine. The decreased ATP and elevated ROS due to G6PDH overexpression may be key factors in increasing the sensitivity of the WEHI7.2 cells to lymphoma chemotherapeutics.
