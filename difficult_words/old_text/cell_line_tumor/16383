Two new aporphine alkaloids: 8-hydroxy-9-methoxy-1,2-methylenedioxyaporphine (1) and 8-hydroxy-3,9-dimethoxy-1,2-methylenedioxyaporphine (2) were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of Fissistigma poilanei along with five known compounds: oxocrebanine (3), kuafumine (4), (2R,3R)-3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxydihydroflavonol-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (5), (+)-catechin 3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (6) and quercetine 3,7-dimethoxy-3'-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-β-D-glucopyranoside (7). These two new aporphine alkaloids exhibited a moderate cytotoxic activity against four human cancer cell lines (KB, Hep-G2, MCF-7, LU) as well as antimicrobial activity against Lactobacillus fermentum, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtillis.
