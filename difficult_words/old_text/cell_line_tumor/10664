The Pluronic nanoparticles (NPs) composed of Pluronic (F-68) and liquid polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular wt: 400) containing docetaxel (DTX) were stabilized with the vesicle fusion. When DTX-loaded Pluronic NPs were mixed with vesicles in the aqueous medium, DTX-loaded Pluronic NPs were incorporated into vesicles to form multi-core vesicle NPs. The morphology and size distribution of multi-core vesicle NPs were observed using FE-SEM, cryo-TEM and a particle size analyzer. To apply multi-core vesicle NPs as a delivery system for DTX, a model anti-cancer drug, the release pattern of DTX was observed and the tumor growth was monitored by injecting the DTX-loaded multi-core vesicle NPs into the tail veins of tumor-bearing mice. We also evaluated the time-dependent excretion profile, inÂ vivo biodistribution, circulation time, and tumor targeting capability of multi-core vesicle NPs using a non-invasive live animal imaging technology.
