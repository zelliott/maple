A series of new histone deacetylase inhibitors were designed and synthesized based on hybridization between SAHA or oxamflatin and 5-phenyl-1,4-benzodiazepines. The compounds were tested for their enzyme inhibitory activity on HeLa nuclear extracts, and on human recombinant HDAC1 and HDAC6. Antiproliferative activity was tested on different cancer cells types, while proapoptotic activity was primarily tested on NB4 cells. The compounds showed IC50 values similar to those of SAHA. Compound (S)-8 displayed interesting activity against hematological and solid malignancies.
