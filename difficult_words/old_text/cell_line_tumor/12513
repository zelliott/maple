This work reports the preparation of several amino alcohols condensed with d-arabinose, d-glucose, and d-galactose derivatives. These compounds were evaluated in vitro for their cytotoxicity and ability to decrease nitric oxide production in J774A.1 cells. Arabinofuranoside derivatives 5a, 5b and 5c showed a significant inhibition of nitric oxide production (>80% at 5 μg/mL), while the galactopyranoside derivative 8d showed a notable nitric oxide inhibitory activity (126% at 0.5 μg/mL).
