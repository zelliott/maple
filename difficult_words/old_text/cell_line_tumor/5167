To study expression of proteins previously connected to radiotherapy response in rectal cancer patients, namely, p53, TAp73, DeltaNp73, survivin and PRL-3, after irradiation in colon cancer cells to gain standing ground for further studies of pathways and mechanisms.

Three colon cancer cell lines (KM12C, KM12SM and KM12L4a) with one origin were radiated with gamma-radiation. Radiosensitivity was determined with cell cycle, survival fraction at 5 Gy (SF5) and apoptosis analysis and protein expression by Western blot.

Following irradiation, KM12C showed no cell cycle arrest, and low SF5 and apoptosis, whilst KM12L4a showed high SF5 and apoptosis. KM12SM had moderate radiosensitivity. After irradiation, the anti-apoptotic DeltaNp73 and mitosis-factor PRL-3 increased in KM12C and the radioresistance factor survivin increased in KM12L4a.

The cell lines seem to have evolved different protein patterns regarding the studied proteins and partly therefore developed different resistance mechanisms, less apoptosis for KM12C and continued proliferation for KM12L4a, after gamma-irradiation.
