Quercetin (a natural polyphenolic compound) is a polyphenolic flavonoid compound found in a variety of plants. It has been demonstrated to exert cytostatic activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines, including the human osteosarcoma cell line, MG-63. However, its effects on osteosarcoma cell apoptosis are still undefined. The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of quercetin on cell viability, apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential, and to determine the molecular mechanism of quercetin-induced apoptosis by investigating the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bax), cytochrome C, caspase-9 and caspase-3 in MG-63 cells. We found that quercetin suppressed the viability of MG-63 cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed that quercetin induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, upregulated the expression of the proapoptotic proteins, Bax and cytochrome C, and activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, and downregulated the expression of antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2. These data suggest that quercetin may induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial-dependent pathway in MG-63 cells.
