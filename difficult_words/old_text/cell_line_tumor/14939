Structure based drug design of a series of novel 1,4-benzoxazin-3-one derived PARP-1 inhibitors are described. The synthesis, enzymatic & cellular activities and pharmacodynamic effects are described. Optimized analogs demonstrated inhibition of poly-ADP-ribosylation in SW620 tumor bearing nude mice through 24h following a single dose.
