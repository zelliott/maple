To try to find a correlation between the antiproliferative activity of a series of [M(I)(P)4](+) complexes (M = Cu, Ag and Au; P = tertiary phosphine) and their stability at micromolar concentration under mass spectrometric conditions.

[M(I)(P)4](+) complexes were investigated by positive ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with multiple collisional experiments using an ion trap mass spectrometer.

The displacement of P from native [M(I)(P)4](+), previously described for the copper derivative, is common for the triad complexes leading to the formation of [M(P)3](+) and [M(P)2](+) adducts. Further dissociation of [M(P)2](+) depends on the nature of the metal (Cu ~ Ag > Au). More labile [Cu(P)2](+) and [Ag(P)2](+) are more cytotoxic against HCT-15 human colon carcinoma cells compared to less labile [Au(P)2](+) species.

The dissociation of P ligand(s) from the [M(I)(P)4](+) complexes is the driving force for the triggering of the antiproliferative activity. The more favored is the displacement of P from the [M(P)2](+) active form, the more favored is in turn the possibility for the metal to interact with biological substrates related to cancer proliferation.
