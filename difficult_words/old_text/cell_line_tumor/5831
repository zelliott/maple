The design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel series of isoindoline-based hydroxamates is described. Several analogs were shown to inhibit HDAC1 with IC(50) values in the low nanomolar range and inhibit cellular proliferation of HCT116 human colon cancer cells in the sub-micromolar range. The cellular potency of compound 17e was found to have greater in vitro anti-proliferative activity than several compounds in late stage clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. The in vitro safety profiles of selected compounds were assessed and shown to be suitable for further lead optimization.
