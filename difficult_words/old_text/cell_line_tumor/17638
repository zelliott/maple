Binding of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) to pro-MMP-2 and mature membrane type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP) on the cell surface is required for activation of MMP-2. It has been reported that following binding to cell surface receptors, TIMP-2 undergoes endocytosis and extensive degradation in lysosomes. The purpose of this study was to reexamine the fate of TIMP-2 following binding to transfected HT1080 cell surface MT1-MMP at 4 degrees C. Following 37 degrees C incubation, 125I-TIMP-2 release, endocytosis, and degradation were characterized under varying conditions. More than 85% of the total 125I-TIMP-2 bound to cells was released as intact functional molecules; <15% was degraded. Transfection of HT1080 cells with dominant negative mutant dynamin cDNA resulted in delayed endocytosis and release of 125I-TIMP-2 from cells. Pharmacologic agents that induce clustering of cell surface receptors (concanavalin A) and interfere with endosomal/lysosomal function (bafilomycin A(1)) resulted in enhanced binding of 125I-TIMP-2 to cell surface receptors. Abrogation of activation of proMT1-MMP with a furin inhibitor prevented binding and endocytosis of 125I-TIMP-2. Biotinylation of cell surface MT1-MMP followed by Western blotting confirmed the presence of mature MT1-MMP on the cell surface and degraded MT1-MMP in the intracellular compartment. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that TIMP-2 is released from cells primarily as an intact functional molecule following binding to MT1-MMP on the cell surface.
