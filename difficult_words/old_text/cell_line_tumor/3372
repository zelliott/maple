Activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is suggested to be required for neuronal apoptosis. We investigated the role of JNK on phosphorylation of c-Jun, Bcl-2, and apoptotic translocation of cytochrome c (cyt c) in UV-induced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. We confirm that UV irradiation induces both apoptosis and necrosis in SH-SY5Y cells and that phosphorylation of JNK at Thr183/Tyr185 in SH-SY5Y cells treated with UV is an early event preceding apoptosis. We also demonstrate that phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63 is an early event coinciding with JNK activation, and that the phosphorylation of c-Jun is partially prevented by the JNK inhibitor SP600125. Despite the use of SP600125, the amount of cyt c released into the cytoplasm is not diminished and SP600125 is also unable to decrease the extent of UV-induced apoptosis. These data support the hypothesis that in this system, UV-induced apoptosis is not dependent exclusively on JNK activation. Possible involvement of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63 was excluded by pretreating UV-irradiated SH-SY5Y cells with the CDK1/2/5 inhibitor roscovitine.
