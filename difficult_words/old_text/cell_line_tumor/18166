Several studies of DNA vaccination against HER2/neu showed the effectiveness of immunization protocols in models of transplantable or spontaneous tumors. The DNA delivery system plays a crucial role in the success of DNA vaccination. In particular, our studies of DNA vaccination against HER2/neu tumor antigen showed that intramuscular injection of the vaccine followed by electroporation elicits an optimal protection against the development of spontaneous HER2/neu- tumors occurring in transgenic mice.
