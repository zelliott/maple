In our effort to find new whitening agents, we evaluated the effects of representative chalcones [4-hydroxyderricin (1), xanthoangelol (2), xanthoangelol H (3), deoxyxanthoangelol H (4), and deoxydihydroxanthoangelol H (5)] contained in the stem of Angelica keiskei on tyrosinase and melanin formation in B16 melanoma cells. In addition, the antioxidant effects of these chalcones in ORAC and DPPH assays were also determined. Interestingly, all chalcones (1-5) inhibit melanin formation in B16 melanoma cells, with low cytotoxicity.
