This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of action of WEB-2170, an inverse agonist of platelet-activating factor receptor, capable of inducing apoptosis in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells.

Gene expression profiling followed by cytofluorimetric, morphologic, and biologic analyses were used to monitor WEB-2170 effects in AML cell lines (ie, NB4, KG1, NB4-MR4, THP1, and U937) and blasts from patients with different AML (M0-M5) subtypes. PTEN silencing with small interfering RNA was also performed.

We have demonstrated that drug-mediated cytostasis/apoptosis in NB4 cells is characterized by upregulation of cyclin G2, p21/WAF1, NIX, TNF-alpha, and PTEN expression, and downregulation of cyclin D2 and BCL2 expression. We observed an increase in PTEN protein accompanied by a decrease in phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and phospho-AKT, and by forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation; the mitochondrial cytochrome C release and PARP cleavage marked the late apoptotic steps. We have found that WEB-2170 triggered apoptosis in NB4, KG1, and NB4-MR4 cells where PTEN was expressed, but not in THP1 and U937 cells where PTEN was absent. Finally, we show that PTEN silencing in NB4 cells by PTEN-specific small interfering RNA resulted in a significant reduction of drug-induced apoptosis.

We demonstrated that WEB-2170 is a powerful antileukemic agent with interesting translational opportunities to treat AML and described mechanisms of drug-induced intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis both in AML cell lines and blasts from AML patients by addressing PTEN as the master regulator of the whole process.
