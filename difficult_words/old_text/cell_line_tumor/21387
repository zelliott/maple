To investigate the effects of 50% ethyl alcohol (EtOH) extracts from Danzhi Xiaoyao Pill (, DXP) on the proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and potential mechanisms.

ATP-Lite assay was performed to test the proliferation of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line; and antioxidant activity was measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). The effects of DXP on nitric oxide (NO) production were tested by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages using the Griess reaction.

The 50% EtOH DXP extracts displayed a cytotoxic response on MCF-7 cells at 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/mL dose-dependently with the proliferation inhibited by more than 85%. The ORAC value of the DXP was 820 micro moL Trolox equivalent/g, about 40% of the vitamin C value. DXP extracts had significant inhibitory effect on NO production at the concentration from 0.0625 mg/mL to 0.5 mg/mL ( p<0.05,  p<0.01).

The extracts of DXP could significantly inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7 cells, with the effect possibly related to its antioxidant activity and the inhibition of NO production.
