Cisplatin is one of the most effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agents against several types of human cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms of action are not fully understood. We aimed to investigate the possible molecular mechanism(s) of acquired chemoresistance observed in prostate cancer cells treated with cisplatin. Human LNCaP cells (bearing wild-type p53) and PC-3 cells (lacking p53) were used. The expression levels of protein were determined by western blotting, and the mRNA levels were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cell viability was measured by MTT assay, and the transcriptional effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) was measured by luciferase reporter gene. We showed that cisplatin treatment increased JNK-1 and JNK-2 activity and expression in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells. In addition, the knockdown of JNK-1 expression by siRNA-JNK-1 or siRNA-JNK-2 significantly impaired the upregulation of AP-1 luciferase reporter gene, but failed to decrease the levels of AP-1 reporter gene expression induced by TPA treatment. Our observations indicate that JNK-1 and JNK-2 may be involved in the chemoresistance observed in prostate cancer cells treated with cisplatin and that blocking the stimulation of Jun kinase (JNK) signaling may be important for regulating the susceptibility to cisplatin of prostate cancer.
