Fagaronine and nitidine are natural benzo[c] phenanthridinium alkaloids, which display antileukemic activity. Both act as topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II inhibitors. The objective of the present study was to prepare noncharged isosters of these compounds, with replacement of the aromatic A ring by a pyridine ring, present in other topoisomerase I inhibitors. Various 7,8- and 8,9-dimethoxy and metylenedioxy benzo[c][1,7] and [1,8]phenanthrolines were readily synthesized by benzyne-mediated cyclization of the corresponding substituted N-(2-halobenzyl)-5-quinolinamines or 5-isoquinolinamines. In both series, compounds bearing oxygenated substituents at positions 8 and 9 exhibited cytotoxic properties towards L1210 murine leukemia cells, which may result from their capacities to intercalate into DNA. Topoisomerase I inhibition was observed for all active compounds.
