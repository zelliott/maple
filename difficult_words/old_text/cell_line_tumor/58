The main objectives of our study were to determine the bioavailability of omega-3 (omega-3) to the tumor, to understand its mechanisms, and to determine the feasibility of targeting the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) metabolizing 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LO-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathways. Nude mice injected subcutaneously with LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells were randomly divided into three different isocaloric (and same percent [%] of total fat) diet groups: high omega-6 linoleic acid (LA), high omega-3 stearidonic acid (SDA) PUFAs, and normal (control) diets. Tumor growth and apoptosis were examined as end points after administration of short-term (5 weeks) omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid diets. Tumor tissue membranes were examined for growth, lipids, enzyme activities, apoptosis, and proliferation. Tumors from the LA diet-fed mice exhibited the most rapid growth compared with tumors from the control and SDA diet-fed mice. Moreover, a diet switch from LA to SDA caused a dramatic decrease in the growth of tumors in 5 weeks, whereas tumors grew more aggressively when mice were switched from an SDA to an LA diet. Evaluating tumor proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (caspase-3) in mice fed the LA and SDA diets suggested increased percentage proliferation index from the omega-6 diet-fed mice compared with the tumors from the omega-3 SDA-fed mice. Further, increased apoptosis was observed in tumors from omega-3 SDA diet-fed mice versus tumors from omega-6 diet-fed mice. Levels of membrane phospholipids of red blood cells reflected dietary changes and correlated with the levels observed in tumors. Linoleic or arachidonic acid and metabolites (eicosanoid/prostaglandins) were analyzed for 15-LO-1 and COX-2 activities by high-performance liquid chromatography. We also examined the percent unsaturated or saturated fatty acids in the total phospholipids, PUFA omega-6/omega-3 ratios, and other major enzymes (elongase, Delta [Delta]-5-desaturase, and Delta-6-desaturase) of omega-6 catabolic pathways from the tumors. We observed a 2.7-fold increase in the omega-6/omega-3 ratio in tumors from LA diet-fed mice and a 4.2-fold decrease in the ratio in tumors from the SDA diet-fed mice. There was an increased Delta-6-desaturase and Delta-9 desaturase enzyme activities and reduced estimated Delta-5-desaturase activity in tumors from mice fed the SDA diet. Opposite effects were observed in tumors from mice fed the LA diet. Together, these observations provide mechanistic roles of omega-3 fatty acids in slowing prostate cancer growth by altering omega-6/omega-3 ratios through diet and by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation in tumors by directly competing with omega-6 fatty acids for 15-LO-1 and COX-2 activities.
