Cryptosporidium is a significant cause of diarrheal illness worldwide, especially among children and immunocompromised patients. Currently used diagnostic techniques are time-consuming, require skilled technicians, and are not useful for quantification of oocysts in fecal and environmental samples. In this study, we examined the use of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detecting and quantifying Cryptosporidium parvum in three distinct and progressively more complex matrices: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), HCT-8 cells (human ileocecal carcinoma), and human fecal specimens. A reliable standard curve was generated using the PBS samples spiked with pure oocysts, and oocyst starting quantities were calculated for the infected HCT-8 cell and spiked fecal samples. The assay detected Cryptosporidium in samples infected/spiked with > or =10(3) oocysts/sample and detected both C. hominis and C. parvum in clinical specimens. This assay is useful in a variety of samples in the research laboratory and will likely prove to be a useful tool in the clinical laboratory.
