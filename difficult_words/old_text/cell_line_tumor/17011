In order to eliminate common side effects to cancer patients and resistance from chemotherapy, a genetic protein TmSm(T34A) was investigated as a sensitizer to doxorubicin. The results indicated TmSm(T34A) enhanced the sensitivity of three breast cancer cell lines to doxorubicin with low dose, and reduced the dose of doxorubicin significantly in contrast to common effective dose. As a synergistic therapy, the TmSm(T34A) also caused strongest apoptotic activity in MCF-7, and the possible molecular mechanisms were explored primarily. The research showed the TmSm(T34A) is promising to be a potential drug in strengthening therapy effects of breast cancer chemotherapy.
