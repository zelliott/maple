To ask whether highly metastatic sublines show more marked low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) response than poorly metastatic ones.

The progressive (PRO) subline showing tumourigenicity and metastatic potential and the regressive (REG) subline showing neither tumourigenicity nor metastatic potential were both isolated from a parental rat colon tumour. Clonogenic survival, micronuclei and apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, DNA single- (SSB) and double-strand breaks (DSB) induction and repair were examined.

HRS phenomenon was demonstrated in PRO subline. Before irradiation, PRO cells show more spontaneous damage than REG cells. After 0.1 Gy, PRO cells displayed: (i) More DNA SSB 15 min post-irradiation, (ii) more unrepaired DNA DSB processed by the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and by the RAD51-dependent recombination pathways, (iii) more micronuclei, than REG cells while neither apoptosis nor p53 phosphorylation nor cell cycle arrest was observed in both sublines.

HRS response of PRO subline may be induced by impairments in NHEJ repair that targets G(1) cells and RAD51-dependent repair that targets S-G(2)/M cells. The cellular consequences of such impairments are a failure to arrest in cell cycle, the propagation of damage through cell cycle, mitotic death but not p53-dependent apoptosis. Tumourigenic cells with high metastatic potential may preferentially show HRS response.
