The etiology of breast cancer is still unclear. The well-known risk factors, including reproductive and other factors affecting circulating sex hormones, and genetic susceptibility, explain only about 50% of all breast cancer incidence. More and more studies have shown interest in the possibility that breast cancer may be caused by viral infection. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is one of the candidate viruses, but the association of EBV with breast cancer remains controversial. Here we reviewed the studies on EBV biology and the association of EBV with breast cancer, including EBV detection in breast cancer tissues, serological tests, cytologic experiments and clinical analyses, and described the limitations of current studies and future directions.
