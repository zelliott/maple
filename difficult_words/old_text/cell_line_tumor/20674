The anticancer effect of a new pyrazole derivative, KI-10F (2-(4-(2-(4-(dimethylamino)             phenyl)pyridin-4-yl)-5-(3-methoxy-5-methylphenyl)-1H-pyrazol‑1-yl) acetonitrile)•3.5HCl)             was evaluated in human colon cancer cells. KI-10F strongly suppressed the growth             of human colon cancer cells and induced apoptosis by increasing the proportion             of sub-G1 presenting apoptotic cells as well as causing cell cycle arrest at the             G2/M phase. Apoptosis by KI-10F was confirmed by observation of an increase in             the expression of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 and Bax, and the decrease             of Bcl-2. Decreased expression of HIF-1α and VEGF, and the inhibition of HUVEC             tube formation and migration showed that KI-10F effectively inhibited the angiogenesis             process. Furthermore, in vivo study in a mouse xenograft model showed that KI-10F             produced a stronger antitumor activity than 5-FU, a conventional anticancer drug             prescribed for the treatment of colon cancer. The effects of KI-10F on tumor proliferation             (PCNA), angiogenesis (CD34) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) were evaluated by             immunohistochemistry using isolated tumor tissue samples. Taken together, our             results demonstrated that KI-10F induces apoptosis and inhibits cell growth and             angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that KI-10F is an effective             chemotherapeutic candidate for use against colon cancer.
