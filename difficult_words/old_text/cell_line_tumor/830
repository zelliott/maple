We used a selective EP4 receptor agonist, ONO-4819, and a human leukemic T cell line MOLT-3 cells, which express all four prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptors (EP1-EP4), to investigate whether the EP4 PGE2 receptor subtype is involved in regulating lymphocytic cholinergic activity. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a T cell activator, significantly enhanced the expression of EP4 receptor mRNA during the first 3-6 h of exposure, after which, expression gradually declined. Furthermore, PHA stimulation slightly but significantly up-regulated the expression of EP2 mRNA after 12 h and of EP3 mRNA after 6 h. By contrast, expression level of EP1 receptor mRNA was not affected by PHA. ONO-4819 (1 microM), which was added to cultures after 3 h of PHA stimulation, significantly increased cellular ACh content and release, and up-regulated ChAT mRNA expression and activity but inhibited MOLT-3 cell proliferation. These findings suggest that the activation of T lymphocytes up-regulates EP4 receptor mRNA expression and, to a lesser extent, EP2 and EP3 receptors and that PGE2 enhances nonneuronal lymphocytic cholinergic transmission in activated T cells, at least in part, via EP4 receptor-mediated pathways.
