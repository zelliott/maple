Five new 2(5H)-furanone-type derivatives, pestalafuranones F-J (compounds 3-7), together with two known compounds, pestalafuranones A (1) and B (2), were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract from the fermentation broth of the endophytic fungus Nigrospora sp. BM-2 in a hypersaline medium. The structures of these metabolites were elucidated by EIMS, HREIMS and NMR spectroscopic data. Compounds 1-7 exhibited no cytotoxic activities against the MDA-MB-231 and Caski cancer cell lines.
