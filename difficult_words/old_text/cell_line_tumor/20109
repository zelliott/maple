Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is one of the most important components             of bovine colostrum. It exhibits antiapoptotic and antioxidative activities. Prion             diseases are neurodegenerative disorders caused by cell death through mitochondrial             dysfunction and increasing generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study             examined the protective effect of IGF-1 on residues 106-126 of the cellular prion             protein [PrP (106-126)]-mediated mitochondrial neurotoxicity and oxidative stress.             In SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells, treatment with PrP (106-126) decreased the cell             viability and IGF-1 pretreatment markedly blocked the PrP (106-126)-induced neuronal             cell death. IGF-1 inhibited PrP (106-126)-induced intracellular ROS generation             and mitochondrial oxidative stress. In addition, IGF-1 blocked the translocation             of the Bax protein to the mitochondria induced by PrP (106-126). These results             demonstrate that IGF-1 protects neuronal cells against PrP (106-126)-mediated             neurotoxicity through an antioxidative effect and blockage of mitochondrial Bax             translocation. The results also suggest that regulation of IGF-1 secretion may             have a therapeutic potential in the management of mitochondrial dysfunction and             oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration.
