Three new sesquiterpene lactones, (4betaH)-5alpha-hydroxy-8alpha-(2-methylbut-2-enoyloxy)-2-oxo-1(10),11(13)-guaiadien-12,6alpha-olide (1), (4betaH)-8alpha-(2-methylbut-2-enoyloxy)-2-oxo-1(5),10(14),11(13)-guaiatrien-12,6alpha-olide (2) and 2,5-epoxy-2beta-hydroxy-4alpha-methoxy-8alpha-(2-methylbut-2-enoyloxy)-4(15),10(14),11(13)-germacratrien-12,6alpha-olide (3), have been isolated from roots and stems of Elephantopus mollis together with two known sesquiterpene lactones (4, 5). The identification of the isolates was accomplished by spectroscopic methods. Compounds (1-5) exhibited significant cytotoxic activities against mouse neuroblastoma B104 cells.
