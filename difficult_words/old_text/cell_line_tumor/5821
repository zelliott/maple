Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that is well-known as a positive mediator of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Previous reports have shown that DAPK and Fas are expressed in human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells. In this study, we examined the effects of specific downregulation of DAPK expression on Fas-mediated apoptosis in the human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line, HHUA.

Transfection of DAPK small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into the HHUA cells reduced DAPK protein expression, and enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis, in a dose-dependent manner.

These results indicate that, in contrast to cases with other malignant tumor cells, DAPK negatively regulates Fas-mediated apoptosis in these human differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma cells.
