Kruppel-like factor 6 splice variant 1 (KLF6-SV1) is an oncogenic splice variant of the KLF6 tumor suppressor gene that is specifically overexpressed in a number of human cancers. Previously, we have demonstrated that increased expression of KLF6-SV1 is associated with decreased survival in lung adenocarcinoma patient samples and that targeted reduction of KLF6-SV1 using siRNA induced apoptosis both alone and in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. Here, we demonstrate that chemoresistant lung cancer cells express increased levels of KLF6-SV1. Furthermore, targeted reduction of KLF6-SV1 using RNA interference restores chemotherapy sensitivity to lung cancer cells both in culture and in vivo through induction of apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of KLF6-SV1 resulted in a marked reduction in chemotherapy sensitivity in a tumor xenograft model. Combined, these findings highlight a functional role for the KLF6-SV1 splice variant in the regulation of chemotherapy response in lung cancer and could provide novel insight into lung cancer therapy.
