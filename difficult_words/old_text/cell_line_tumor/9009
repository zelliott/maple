Neuroinflammation mediated by the activated microglia is suggested to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypoxic brain injury; however, the underlying mechanism of microglia activation remains unclear. Here, we show that the canonical Notch signaling orchestrates microglia activation after hypoxic exposure which is closely associated with multiple pathological situations of the brain. Notch-1 and Delta-1 expression in primary microglia and BV-2 microglial cells was significantly elevated after hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced activation of Notch signaling was further confirmed by the concomitant increase in the expression and translocation of intracellular Notch receptor domain (NICD), together with RBP-Jκ and target gene Hes-1 expression. Chemical inhibition of Notch signaling with N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-1-alany1- S-phenyglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), a γ-secretase inhibitor, effectively reduced hypoxia-induced upregulated expression of most inflammatory mediators. Notch inhibition also reduced NF-κB/p65 expression and translocation. Remarkably, Notch inhibition suppressed expression of TLR4/MyD88/TRAF6 pathways. In vivo, Notch signaling expression and activation in microglia were observed in the cerebrum of postnatal rats after hypoxic injury. Most interestingly, hypoxia-induced upregulation of NF-κB immunoexpression in microglia was prevented when the rats were given DAPT pretreatment underscoring the interrelationship between Notch signaling and NF-κB pathways. Taken together, we conclude that Notch signaling is involved in regulating microglia activation after hypoxia partly through the cross talk between TLR4/MyD88/TRAF6/NF-κB pathways. Therefore, Notch signaling may serve as a prospective target for inhibition of microglia activation known to be implicated in brain damage in the developing brain.
