A small molecule inhibitor of MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) was effective against human breast cancer cells with a basal-like gene expression signature. Antitumor activity was limited by both feedback upregulation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT upon inhibition of MEK as well as loss of the phosphatase PTEN. Therefore, MEK inhibitors should preferably be investigated in combination with PI3K inhibitors in basal-like breast cancers.
