This present article demonstrates the strategy to prepare photoresponsive reduced graphene oxide with mussel inspired adhesive material dopamine (DN) and photochromic dye spiropyran (SP) conjugated to the backbone of the targeting ligand hyaluronic acid (HA; HA-SP). Graphene oxide (GO) was reduced by prepared HA-SP accepting the advantages of catechol chemistry under mildly alkaline condition enabling to achieve functionalized graphene (rGO/HA-SP) as fluorescent nanoparticles. Due to containing HA, rGO/HA-SP can bind to the CD44 cell receptors. The prepared rGO/HA-SP is able to retain its photochromic features and can be converted to merocyanine (MC) form upon irradiation with UV light (wavelength: 365 nm) displaying purple color. Photochromic behavior of rGO/HA-SP was monitored by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. In vitro fluorescence behavior, examined by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM), of rGO/HA-SP in cancerous A549 cell lines assured that efficient delivery of rGO/HA-SP was gained due to HA as targeting ligand. In this work, we have shown that in vivo fluorescence image of spiropyran is possible by administrating MC form solution of rGO/HA-SP using Balb/C mice as in vivo modal. Accumulation of rGO/HA-SP in tumor tissue from biodistribution analysis strongly supports the specific delivery of prepared graphene to the target destination. The well tuned drug release manner from the surface of rGO/HA-SP strongly recommends the developed material not only as fluorescent probe for diagnosis but also as a drug carrier in drug delivery system.
