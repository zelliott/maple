To overcome multi-drug resistance (MDR) of cancer cells, paclitaxel (PTX) and doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) were prepared by solvent diffusion method using monostearin as solid lipid and oleic acid as liquid lipid matrix. The cytotoxicities and reversal activity of drug-loaded NLC were tested against human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells, human ovarian cancer (SKOV3) cells and their multi-drug resistant (MCF-7/ADR and SKOV3-TR30) cells. The chemical conjugant of folic acid and stearic acid (FA-SA) was further synthesized to prepare folated NLC. Comparing with taxol and doxorubicin solution, the NLC loading PTX exhibited high cytotoxicities in MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells, while the NLC loading DOX only indicated high cytotoxicity in MCF-7/ADR cells. The reversal powers of the NLC loading PTX and DOX were 34.3 and 6.4 folds, respectively. The NLC loading PTX and DOX showed the same trends of enhanced cytotoxicity against SKOV3 and SKOV3-TR30 cells. The reversal powers were 31.3 and 2.2 folds for the NLC loading PTX and DOX, respectively. The modification of NLC with FA-SA could further enhance the cytotoxicities of drug in drug sensitive and drug resistant cells.
