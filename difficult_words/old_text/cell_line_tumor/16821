To validate those obtained immunogenic membrane antigens candidate of human pancreatic cancer in the performed research.

In the pre-studies, serum IgG purified from clinically collected sera of pancreatic cancer patients underwent immunoblot with human pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 membrane protein, totally obtained 9 positive protein spots. Number 5 and 6 positive dots of immunoblot were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting matching. The candidate membrane antigens were further validated in cell lines by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. RNA of human normal pancreatic tissue and pancreatic cancer tissue was extracted respectively, different gene expression level of prohibitin 2 was studied by real-time PCR.

Number 5 and 6 positive dots were identified as prohibitin 2 and prohibitin. RT-PCR and real-time PCR all showed that gene of prohibitin 2 and prohibitin were expressed in the human pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990, AsPc and P3 respectively, especially in P3 cell with highest expression (t = 7.442, P < 0.01). In addition, gene expression level of prohibitin 2 was significant higher in human pancreatic cancer than that of normal pancreatic tissue (t = 0.893, P < 0.01).

Prohibitin 2 and prohibitin are both differently expressed in the pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990, AsPc and P3. Prohibitin 2 is obvious highly expressed in human pancreatic cancer tissue. Prohibitin 2 and prohibitin might be the candidate immunogenic membrane antigens of human pancreatic cancer.
