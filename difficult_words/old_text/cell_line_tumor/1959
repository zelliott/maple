Artificial enzymes: half-sandwich arene ruthenium(II) and cyclopentadienyl iridium(III) complexes containing N,N-chelated ligands can use NADH as a source of hydride for the reduction of ketones. Moreover, cyclopentadienyl phenanthroline iridium(III) derivatives at micromolar concentrations are robust catalysts for the production of H(2) from NADH in water and can raise the NAD(+)/NADH ratio in cancer cells.
