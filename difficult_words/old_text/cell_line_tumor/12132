Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c is a key regulator of fatty acid metabolism and plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional regulation of different lipogenic genes mediating lipid synthesis. In previous studies, the regulation of SREBP-1c mRNA levels by thyroid hormone has remained controversial. In this study, we examined whether T3 regulates the mouse SREBP-1c mRNA expression. We found that T3 negatively regulates the mouse SREBP-1c gene expression in the liver, as shown by ribonuclease protection assays and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Promoter analysis with luciferase assays using HepG2 and Hepa1-6 cells revealed that T3 negatively regulates the mouse SREBP-1c gene promoter (-574 to +42) and that Site2 (GCCTGACAGGTGAAATCGGC) located around the transcriptional start site is responsible for the negative regulation by T3. Gel shift assays showed that retinoid X receptor-alpha/thyroid hormone receptor-beta heterodimer bound to Site2, but retinoid X receptor-alpha/liver X receptor- heterodimer could not bind to the site. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that T3 induced thyroid hormone receptor-beta recruitment to Site2. Thus, we demonstrated that mouse SREBP-1c mRNA is down-regulated by T3 in vivo and that T3 negatively regulates mouse SREBP-1c gene transcription via a novel negative thyroid hormone response element: Site2.
