To investigate the effects of Radix notoginseng extracts drug-containing serum on the expressions of apoptosis-regulating proteins including Bax, bcl-2 and p21WAF1 in precancerous gastric cells.

The N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine (MNNG) transformed eternalized human gastric mucosa epithelium GES-1 cell line (MC cell) was used in vitro as a model of gastric precancerous lesion. The medicated canine serum was prepared by feeding to the adult Beagle dog with Radix notoginseng extracts and obtaining the serum after 2-hour medication. MC cells were cultured with medicated canine serum (medicated serum group) or non-medicated canine serum (normal control group) for 72 hours. Expressions of Bax, bcl-2 and p21WAF1 proteins were detected by immunocytochemical assay and the average optical density of the cells was determined by an image analysis system.

Compared with those of the normal control group, Bax and p21WAF1 expressions in medicated serum group were significantly enhanced ( p<0.01), while the expression of bcl-2 was significantly reduced ( p<0.01).

Radix notoginseng extracts may inhibit the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of precancerous gastric cells through altering expressions of the bcl-2, Bax and p21WAF1 genes.
