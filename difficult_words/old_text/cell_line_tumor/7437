The adenoviral protein E1A associates with multiple anticancer activities, including stabilization of p53 tumor suppressor, and has been tested through gene therapy approaches in clinical trials. To identify potential E1A-binding proteins involved in E1A's anticancer activities, we screened a yeast two-hybrid library and identified Mdm4, an Mdm2-related p53-binding protein, as a novel E1A-binding protein. The NH(2)-terminal region of Mdm4 and the CR1 domain of E1A were required for the interaction between E1A and Mdm4. E1A preferentially bound to Mdm4 rather than Mdm2 and formed a complex with p53 in the presence of Mdm4, resulting in the stabilization of p53 in a p14(ARF)-independent manner. E1A failed to stabilize p53 in the absence of Mdm4, showing that Mdm4 was required for p53 stabilization by E1A. Moreover, E1A-mediated stabilization of p53 occurred in nucleus. Although it had no effect on the p53-Mdm2 interaction, E1A facilitated Mdm4 binding to p53 and inhibited Mdm2 binding to Mdm4, resulting in decreased nuclear exportation of p53. Thus, our findings highlighted a novel mechanism, whereby E1A stabilized the p53 tumor suppressor through Mdm4.
