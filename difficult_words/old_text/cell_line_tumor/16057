A series of novel ribonucleosides with C-5 OH replaced by a diaminopyrimidinyl group were synthesized by successively nucleophilic substitutions of 5'-deoxy-5'-amino-ribonucleosides with 2,4-dichloropyrimidine and then with various fatty amines under microwave irradiation. Their anticancer activities in vitro were preliminarily evaluated. Compounds 7a and 8a only exhibited anticancer activity against A549 cell line with the IC(50) values of 10.73 and 10.99 μM, respectively. In addition, 7h and 8h showed potent activities against both A549 and Hela cell lines with the IC(50) values of 12.71, 8.55 and 8.44, 5.55 μM, respectively.
