To investigate the possible biological function and mechanism of miR-143 in the metastasis of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

Using bioinformatics to predict the target gene of miR-143, the 3'UTR and mutant 3'UTR of GLI3 gene was cloned into psiCHECK-2 vector. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to examine the repression of the GLI3 gene. miR-143 and GLI3 expression levels in 5-8F cells transfected with miR-143 mimics, inhibitor, or siGLI3 were examined, and the changes in the cell migration ability was assessed by Transwell invasion assay.

Bioinformatics prediction indicated the Hh pathway transcription gene GLI3 as a target gene of miR-143, and dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-143 directly combined with the 3'UTR of GLI3. qRT-PCR and Western blotting demonstrated that the expression of miR-143 in 5-8F cells was negatively correlated to GLI3 and suppressed the migration of 5-8F cells.

MiR-143 can inhibit the invasion of NPC cells by negative regulation of GLI3 gene, which sheds light on the role of miR-143 and Hh pathway in NPC.
