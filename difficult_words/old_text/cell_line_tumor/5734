The nuclear protein methyl-transferase Retinoblastoma-interacting zinc-finger protein 1 (RIZ1) is considered to be a downstream effector of estrogen action in target tissues. Silencing of RIZ1 expression is common in many tumors. We analyzed RIZ1 expression in normal and malignant prostate tissue and evaluated whether estradiol (E2) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment modulated RIZ1 in cultured prostate epithelial cells (PEC). Moreover, we studied the possible involvement of RIZ1 in estrogen action on the EPN prostate cell line, constitutively expressing both estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and beta. RIZ1 protein, found in the nucleus of normal PECs by immunohistochemistry, was progressively lost in cancer tissues as the Gleason score increased and was only detected in the cytoplasmic compartment. RIZ1 transcript levels, as assayed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in primary PEC cultures, were significantly reduced in cancer cells (P < 0.05). In EPN DHT treatment significantly increased RIZ1 transcript and protein levels (P < 0.05); E2 induced a reduction of S phase without significant changes of RIZ1 expression. In E2-treated EPN cell extracts RIZ co-immunoprecipitated with ERbeta and ERalpha. Our data demonstrate that RIZ1 is expressed in normal PECs and down-regulated in cancer cells, with a switch of its sub-cellular localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm upon cancer grade progression. RIZ1 expression levels in the PECs were modulated by DHT or E2 treatment in vitro. Furthermore, the E2 effects on ER-expressing prostate cells involve RIZ1, which confirms a possible role for ER-mediated pathways in a non-classic E(2)-target tissue.
