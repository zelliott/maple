Lentiviral vectors encoding antigens are promising vaccine candidates because they transduce dendritic cells (DC) in vivo and prime CTL responses. Here we examine their stimulation of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells, critical for protective immunity against tumors or infectious disease. We constructed lentiviral vectors (lentivectors) expressing ovalbumin, which was secreted (OVA), cytoplasmic (OVAcyt), or fused to either invariant chain (Ii-OVA) or transferrin receptor (TfR-OVA) sequences, targeting the MHC class II presentation pathway. Murine DC infected with the various lentivectors could stimulate OT-I (CD8(+), OVA TCR transgenic) T cells and all except OVAcyt could also stimulate OT-II (CD4(+), OVA TCR transgenic) T cells in vitro. Direct injection of the OVA-, Ii-OVA-, or TfR-OVA-expressing vectors into mice resulted in a CD4(+) T cell response, as shown by expansion of adoptively transferred OT-II T cells and upregulation of CD44 on these cells. The Ii-OVA vector was the most potent inducer of IFN-gamma-secreting CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and was the only vector to protect mice completely from challenge with OVA-expressing tumor cells. Therefore directly injected lentivectors can stimulate CD4(+) T cells; both CD4(+) and CD8(+) responses can be enhanced by targeting the antigen to the MHC class II pathway.
