Chromatographic separation of the methanolic extract of the leaves of Azadirachta indica led to the isolation of a sulfonoglycolipid characterized as a sulfonoquinovosyldiacylglyceride (SQDG), by extensive 2D NMR and mass spectral analysis. SQDG induces apoptosis in a dose dependent manner with IC(50) 8.3 Î¼M against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) MOLT-4 cell lines. The compound showed significant DNA binding properties as evidenced by the enhancement of melting temperature and perturbation of the characteristic B-form in CD evidence of calf thymus DNA. The DNA binding was also characterized by isothermal calorimetry where a predominantly enthalpy driven binding to CT DNA was revealed.
