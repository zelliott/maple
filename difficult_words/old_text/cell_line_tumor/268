We investigated taurolidine (TRD) against various human bladder cell lines and the AY-27 rat bladder carcinoma cells. In vitro we tested the effect of TRD in ascending concentrations depending on different incubation times on cell proliferation by the XTT-test. Taurolidine had an inhibitory effect on all tested cell lines. Increasing concentrations and longer incubation times decreased the proliferation depending on the primary quantities of cells. For in vivo studies, an orthotopic rat bladder carcinoma was used. The animals were treated intravenously or intravesically and the tumors were harvested and weighted after the study. In contrast to other authors we could not find any anti-proliferative effect, we actually showed that instillation into the rat urinary bladder enhanced tumor growth.
