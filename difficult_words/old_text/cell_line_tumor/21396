In a departure from conventional strategies to improve treatment outcome for myeloid malignancies, we report the isolation of leukemia-specific peptides using a phage display library screened with freshly obtained human myeloid leukemia cells.

A phage display library was screened by 5 rounds of biopanning with freshly isolated human AML cells. Individual colonies were randomly picked and after purification, biologic activity (growth and differentiation) on fresh AML cells was profiled. Ten peptides were synthesized for further biological studies. Multiple peptides were found to selectively bind to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The peptides bound to leukemia cells, were internalized and could induce proliferation and/or differentiation in the target patient cells. Two of the peptides, HP-A2 and HP-G7, appeared to have a novel mechanism of inducing differentiation since they did not cause G1 arrest in cycling cells even as the expression of the differentiation marker CD11b increased.

Peptide induced differentiation of leukemia cells offers a novel treatment strategy for myeloid malignancies, whereas their ability to induce proliferation could be harnessed to make cells more sensitive to chemotherapy. Conceptually, these leukemia specific peptides can also be used to refine diagnosis, document minimal residual disease, and selectively deliver toxins to malignant cells.
