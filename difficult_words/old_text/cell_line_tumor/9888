We have cloned the arginine deiminase (ADI) gene from Mycoplasma hominis PG21 genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction, and changed four TGA tryptophan codons (stop codon in E. coli) to TGG codons in the coding region by site-directed mutagenesis in order to express in E. coli. The recombinant ADI (rADI) was purified to apparent homogeneity by Ni-affinity chromatography after extraction from inclusion bodies followed by refolding. The rADI expressed in E. coli was estimated to be 50 kDa. Dimeric forms of rADI exerted enzymatic activity. We found that high concentration of potassium dihydrogenphosphate (PDP) and L-arginine addition in refolding reaction increases the enzyme activity. The specific activity of rADl was calculated as 0.618 U/mg. In addition, the enzyme activity of purified rADI remained for at least one month in 100 mM PDP solution (pH 6.5), but diminished within one week in 100 mM PDP solution (pH 7.4). Anti-tumor activity of the purified rADI was estimated to be 0.036 U/ml as 50% growth inhibitory activity against human melanoma cell line G-361.
