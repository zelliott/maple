Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a highly malignant and often fatal disease of the kidney. Chmp1A is a member of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT-III) family, and plays a role in the cytoplasm in sorting proteins to the multivesicular body (MVB). Chmp1A functions as a tumor suppressor gene and has been reported in pancreatic tumor cells. Here, we examined the expression level of Chmp1A in human RCC tissues and renal tumor cells by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. We found that the expression level of Chmp1A is significantly lower in RCC tissues and renal tumor cells compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues and normal renal cells. Additionally, inhibition of Chmp1A expression by shRNA induced tumor formation in normal renal cells. However, inhibition of Chmp1A did not significantly affect tumor cell proliferation in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. Interestingly, overexpression of Chmp1A using a eukaryotic plasmid inhibited the proliferation of renal tumor cells in vitro and the growth of renal tumor in vivo. Thus, our results demonstrate that Chmp1A functions as a tumor suppressor gene in renal cells and may be a useful target for treatment of RCC.
