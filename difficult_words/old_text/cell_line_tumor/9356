Genetic immunization (GI), which is primarily used for vaccine purposes, is a method for producing antibodies to a protein by delivering the gene encoding the protein as a eukaryotic expression vector instead of the protein itself. The mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) is one of the most likely candidates for involvement in pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma and probably of multiple myelomas. In the present work we describe the production and characterization of a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against MALT1 and the study of MALT1 protein expression in a large series of lymphomas and myeloma cell lines. The full-length coding sequence of human MALT1 was inserted into pcDNA3 vector and delivered into mouse skin using a helium gene gun. Six new mAbs against the MALT1 molecule were produced. In order to characterize and confirm the specificity of these mAbs, Western blot (WB) and immunoprecipitation (IP) analyses were performed. A new anti-MALT1 mAb was selected and tested in a large series of cell lines. These results confirm that GI is a reliable and effective alternative method for production of mAbs, allowing accurate and sensitive detection and screening of proteins by WB.
