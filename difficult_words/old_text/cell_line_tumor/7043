To investigate the mechanism of peplomycin (PEP)-induced apoptosis in liver carcinoma cell line (Bel-7402).

Growth inhibition by PEP was analyzed using 3- 4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptotic cells were detected using Hoechest 33258 staining, and confirmed by flow cytometric analysis and DNA fragmentation analysis. The expression of cyclin A and B1 were determined by flow cytometry and Western blot. Annexin V assay was measured by flow cytometric analysis.

PEP induced apoptosis and then inhibited cell proliferation in liver carcinoma cell line Bel-7402. Cells treated with PEP 50 mumol/L for 15 h were arrested in G2-phase with dramatical expression of cyclin A and a little change in cyclin B1. Almost all the apoptosis occurred in cells undergoing the G1-phase after treatment for 24 h.

Peplomycin induced G1-phase specific apoptosis in Bel-7402 involving G2-phase arrest.
