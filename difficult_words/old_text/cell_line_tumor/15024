The present study was designed to investigate the anti-allergic effects of ethanolic extract of Alternanthera sessilis (AS-1) in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. It significantly reduced the β-hexosaminidase release from anti-DNP-IgE sensitized RBL-2H3 cells. AS-1also inhibited the IgE antibody-induced increase in Interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-α, IL-13 and IL-4 production in these cells. The inhibitory effect of AS-1 on these cytokine was found to be nuclear factor-KB (NF-kB) dependent, as it attenuated the degradation of IKBa and nuclear translocation of NFkB. In addition, AS-1 significantly attenuated the DNP HAS-induced intracellular Ca(2+) release from these cells, which makes us speculate strongly that the decreased intracellular Ca(2+) is involved in the inhibitory effect of AS-1 on β-hexoaminidase release. Taken together, anti-allergic effects of AS-1 suggest possible therapeutic application of this extract in allergic diseases.
