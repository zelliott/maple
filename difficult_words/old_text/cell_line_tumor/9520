We aimed to induce three different immune cell subsets from a single blood sample from cancer patients to target different biological characters of cancer cells. In the presence of 6000 IU/ml IL-2, natural killer (NK) cells adhere to plastic. By using this ability, we could separate dendritic cells, T cells, and NK cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The cultured NK cells demonstrated higher nonspecific cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines than did the T cells. Furthermore, adherent NK cells demonstrated higher cytotoxicity than nonadherent NK cells, although there was no difference between adherent and nonadherent NK cells in natural cytotoxicity receptors (NKp30, NKp44, NKp46) and NKG2D expression. With these results, we confirmed that we could induce dendritic cell, T cell, and higher cytotoxic NK cells from a single blood draw, and this methodology facilitates to the use of these cells for clinical grade conditions.
