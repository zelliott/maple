Cytotoxicity-guided phytochemical analysis on the extract of Lysimachia heterogenea Klatt led to the isolation of 3beta,16beta-12-oleanene-3,16,23,28-tetrol (1) and its four new oligosaccharidic derivatives heterogenosides A, B, C, and D (2-5). Their structural elucidation was mainly based on NMR and mass spectral data. The time course experimental results indicated that unlike the likely lysis activity of heterogenosides B-D, heterogenoside A showed a significantly time-dependent cytotoxicity.
