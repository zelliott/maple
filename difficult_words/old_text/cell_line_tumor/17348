Local invasiveness is a characteristic feature of glioblastoma that makes surgical resection nearly impossible and accounts in large part for its poor prognosis. To identify mechanisms underlying glioblastoma invasion and motility, we used Transwell invasion chambers to select for a more potently invasive subpopulation of U87MG human glioblastoma cells. The stable population of tumor cells (U87-C1) obtained through this in vitro selection process were three times more invasive than parental U87MG cells and demonstrated faster monolayer wound healing and enhanced radial motility from cell spheroids. This enhanced invasiveness was associated with an 80% increase in matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) activation. No differences in expression levels of pro-MMP-2, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase I (MT1-MMP), or integrin alphavbeta3 (mediators of MMP-2 activation) were detected. However, U87-C1 cells exhibited two-fold elevation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2 mRNA and protein relative to parental cells. Exogenous addition of comparable levels of purified TIMP-2 to parental U87MG cells increased MMP-2 activation and invasion. Similarly, U87MG cells engineered to overexpress TIMP-2 at the same levels as U87-C1 cells also demonstrated increased MMP-2 activation, indicating that an increase in physiological levels of TIMP-2 can promote MMP-2 activation and invasion in glioblastoma cells. However, exogenous administration or recombinant overexpression of higher amounts of TIMP-2 in U87MG cells resulted in inhibition of MMP-2 activation. These results demonstrate that the complex balance between TIMP-2 and MMP-2 is a critical determinant of glioblastoma invasion, and indicate that increasing TIMP-2 in glioblastoma patients may potentially cause adverse effects, particularly in tumors containing high levels of MT1-MMP and MMP-2.
