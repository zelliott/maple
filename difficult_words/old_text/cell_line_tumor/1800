Primer-independent cDNA synthesis during reverse transcription hinders quantitative analysis of bidirectional mRNA synthesis in eukaryotes as well as in cells infected with RNA viruses. We report a simple RT-PCR-based assay for strand-specific gene-expression analysis. By modifying the cDNA sequence during reverse transcription, the opposite strands of target sequences can be simultaneously detected by postamplification melting curve analysis and primer-initiated transcripts are readily distinguished from nonspecifically primed cDNA. We have utilized this technique to optimize the specificity of reverse transcription on a panel of 15 target genes. Primer-independent reverse transcription occurred for all target sequences when reverse transcription was performed at 42°C and accounted for 11%-57% of the final PCR amplification products. By raising the reaction temperature to 55°C, the specificity of reverse transcription could be increased without significant loss of sensitivity. We have also demonstrated the utility of this technique for analysis of (+) and (-) RNA synthesis of influenza A virus in infected cells. Thus, this technique represents a powerful tool for analysis of bidirectional RNA synthesis.
