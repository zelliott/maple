The modification of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) using biological molecules is important in the field of chemical biology, as the CNPs have the potential to deliver the drugs directly to the targeted cells and tissues. We have modified the CNPs by coating bovine serum albumin (BSA) on their surfaces and loaded with methotrexate (Mtx). Infrared spectra have revealed the coating of BSA and Mtx on CNP (CBM). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) pictures have exhibited the spherical nature of the composite and coating of the proteins on CNPs. The prepared CBM biocomposite has exhibited a sustained release of drug. MTT assay using A549 lung cancer cell lines has revealed 83% cell death at 150 Î¼g/ml concentration of CBM. These results indicate that CNPs based biocomposites may be tried as therapeutic agents in treatment of cancer like diseases.
