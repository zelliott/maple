Gambogic acid (2), a natural product isolated from the resin of Garcinia hurburyi tree, was discovered to be a potent apoptosis inducer using our cell- and caspase-based high-throughput screening assays. Gambogic acid was found to have an EC(50) of 0.78 microM in the caspase activation assay in T47D breast cancer cells. The apoptosis-inducing activity of gambogic acid was further characterized by a nuclear fragmentation assay and flow cytometry analysis in human breast tumor cells T47D. Gambogic acid was found to induce apoptosis independent of cell cycle, which is different from paclitaxel that arrests cells in the G2/M phase. To understand the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of gambogic acid, derivatives of 2 with modifications to different function groups were prepared. SAR studies of gambogic acid, as measured by the caspase activation assay, showed that the 9,10 carbon-carbon double bond of the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone is important for biological activity, while the 6-hydroxy and 30-carboxy group can tolerate a variety of modifications. The importance of the 9,10 carbon-carbon double bond was confirmed by the traditional growth inhibition assay. The high potency of 2 as an inducer of apoptosis, its novel mechanism of action, easy isolation and abundant supply, as well as the fact that it is amenable to chemical modification, makes gambogic acid an attractive molecule for the development of anticancer agents.
