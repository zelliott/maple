Macrocyclization is a commonly used strategy to preorganize HCV NS3 protease inhibitors in their bioactive conformation. Moreover, macrocyclization generally leads to greater stability and improved pharmacokinetic properties. In HCV NS3 protease inhibitors, it has been shown to be beneficial to include a vinylated phenylglycine in the P2 position in combination with alkenylic P1' substituents. A series of 14-, 15- and 16-membered macrocyclic HCV NS3 protease inhibitors with the linker connecting the P2 phenylglycine and the alkenylic P1' were synthesized by ring-closing metathesis, using both microwave and conventional heating. Besides formation of the expected macrocycles in cis and trans configuration as major products, both ring-contracted and double-bond migrated isomers were obtained, in particular during formation of the smaller rings (14- and 15-membered rings). All inhibitors had K(i)-values in the nanomolar range, but only one inhibitor type was improved by rigidification. The loss in inhibitory effect can be attributed to a disruption of the beneficial π-π interaction between the P2 fragment and H57, which proved to be especially deleterious for the d-phenylglycine epimers.
