Novel proapoptotic Smac mimics/IAPs inhibitors have been designed, synthesized and characterized. Computational models and structural studies (crystallography, NMR) have elucidated the SAR of this class of inhibitors, and have permitted further optimization of their properties. In vitro characterization (XIAP BIR3 and linker-BIR2-BIR3 binding, cytotox assays, early ADMET profiling) of the compounds has been performed, identifying one lead for further in vitro and in vivo evaluation.
