Galectin-1 (Gal-1) is a widely expressed beta-galactoside-binding protein that exerts pleiotropic biological functions. To gain insight into the potential role of Gal-1 as a novel modulator of Leydig cells, we investigated its effect on the growth and death of MA-10 tumor Leydig cells. In this study, we identified cytoplasmic Gal-1 expression in these tumor cells by cytofluorometry. DNA fragmentation, caspase-3, -8, and -9 activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), cytochrome c (Cyt c) release, and FasL expression suggested that relatively high concentrations of exogenously added recombinant Gal-1 (rGal-1) induced apoptosis by the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. These pathways were independently activated, as the presence of the inhibitor of caspase-8 or -9 only partially prevented Gal-1-effect. On the contrary, low concentrations of Gal-1 significantly promoted cell proliferation, without inducing cell death. Importantly, the presence of the disaccharide lactose prevented Gal-1 effects, suggesting the involvement of the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). This study provides strong evidence that Gal-1 is a novel biphasic regulator of Leydig tumor cell number, suggesting a novel role for Gal-1 in the reproductive physiopathology.
