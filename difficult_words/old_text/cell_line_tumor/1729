Thiourea derivatives (6a-e) were developed and screened for antitumor and anti-inflammatory activity. Most of the compounds exhibited growth inhibitory effects comparable to 5-fluorouracil in vitro against mammary (MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231) as well as colon (HT-29) carcinoma cells. They also showed stronger anti-inflammatory activity than ibuprofen in vivo in the xylene-induced ear swelling assay in mice.
