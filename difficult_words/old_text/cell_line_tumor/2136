A monoclonal antibody (mAb) to P-glycoprotein (Pgp), UIC2, is used as a targeting moiety for N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer/drug [(meso chlorin e(6) mono(N-2-aminoethylamide) (Mce(6)) or doxorubicin (DOX)] conjugates to investigate their cytotoxicity towards the Pgp-expressing human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780/AD. The binding, internalization, and subcellular trafficking of a fluorescein labeled UIC2 targeted HPMA copolymer are studied and show localization to the plasma membrane with limited internalization. The specificity of the UIC2-targeted HPMA copolymer/drug conjugates are confirmed using the sensitive cell line A2780 that does not express Pgp.
