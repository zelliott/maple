Expression of prolactin (PRL) or prolactin-like hormone has been reported in invertebrates. We investigated the larval phase of Trichinella spiralis: (a) to express 23 kDa PRL, (b) to define its localization and (c) to test its possible biological activity. Immunostaining in isolated larvae demonstrated positive material to 23 kDa PRL by all along the stichosome, specifically in the stichocytes. Homogenized immunoblot larvae showed a 23 kDa protein band. To assess PRL release and its biological activity, larvae were incubated in culture medium and the excretory/secretory products were analyzed by the Nb2 cells bioassay. A cellular growth equivalent until 10 nM PRL and using antibody against 23 kDa PRL, the growth was blocked. In conclusion our result provides evidence that PRL-like hormone is expressed and secreted by the larvae of T. spiralis.
