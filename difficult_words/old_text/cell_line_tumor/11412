A straightforward route is proposed for the multi-gram scale synthesis of heterobifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) oligomers containing combination of triethyloxysilane extremity for surface modification of metal oxides and amino or azido active end groups for further functionalization. The suitability of these PEG derivatives to be conjugated to nanomaterials was shown by pegylation of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles (NPs), followed by functionalization with small peptide ligands for biomedical applications.
