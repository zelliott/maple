The majority of human endometrial, ovarian and breast cancers express receptors for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Their proliferation is time- and dose-dependently reduced by GnRH and its agonistic analogs. GnRH agonists inhibit the mitogenic signal transduction of growth factor receptors via activation of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase, resulting in downregulation of cancer cell proliferation. Induction of apoptosis is not involved. Recently we showed that the GnRH agonist triptorelin induces activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) and thus reduces the apoptosis induced by the cytotoxic agent doxorubicin in human endometrial and ovarian cancer cells. The triptorelin-induced reduction of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was blocked by inhibition of NFkappaB translocation into the nucleus. The present study was conducted to investigate whether knock-down of GnRH receptor expression reduces GnRH agonist-induced anti-apoptotic action. We show that knock-down of GnRH receptor expression results in an increase of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in human endometrial and ovarian cancers and in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. These data further demonstrate that GnRH agonists suppress chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis via activation of the GnRH receptor in these cancers. The situation is different with T-47-D breast cancer cells. After knock-down of GnRH receptor expression doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was decreased, indicating that GnRH agonists do not suppress chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in T-47-D breast cancer cells.
