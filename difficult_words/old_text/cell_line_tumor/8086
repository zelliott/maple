A novel series of indoline-based acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors with a methanesulfonamide group at the 5-position were synthesized and their lipophilicity and biological activities were evaluated. Hepatic ACAT inhibitory and anti-foam cell formation activity increased dependent on lipophilicity of derivatives with various alkyl chains at the 1-position. The logD(7.0)-biological activity curve of the derivatives with a methanesulfonamide group shifted leftward compared to that of Pactimibe derivatives with a carboxymethyl group, and derivatives with no substituent, suggesting that a methanesulfonamide group plays an important role in the interaction with ACAT protein. Among derivatives, N-(1-ethyl-5-methanesulfonylamino-4,6-dimethylindolin-7-yl)-2,2-dimethylpropanamide (1b) had about twofold lower logD(7.0) than Pactimibe, while it showed twofold higher hepatic ACAT inhibition than and the same anti-foam cell formation as Pactimibe, respectively. The C(max) of 1b (10mg/kg, po) was higher than that of Pactimibe in rats. The plasma protein binding ratio of 1b was lower than that of Pactimibe: 64.8% and 97.9%, respectively. Compound 1b showed greater inhibitory effects on hepatic cholesterol secretion in mice than Pactimibe. In conclusion, the introduction of a methanesulfonamide group is effective to design less lipophilic, more efficacious and more bioavailable indoline-based ACAT inhibitors than previous indoline-based inhibitors.
