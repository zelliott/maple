MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides that can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in human cancer. Down-regulation of the miRNA miR-133a in many type of cancers, and a reduction of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion upon over-expression, suggests that miR-133a is a tumor suppressor. In this study, genome-wide gene expression analysis of HNSCC cells that over-express miR-133a showed that caveolin-1 (CAV1), a multifunctional scaffolding protein, is down-regulated, a result that was confirmed by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. A luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-133a is directly bound to CAV1 mRNA. Cancer cell migration and invasion were significantly inhibited in HNSCC cells transfected with si-CAV1. Therefore, CAV1 functions as an oncogene in HNSCC. The identification of tumor suppressive miRNAs and their target genes could provide new insights into potential mechanism of HNSCC carcinogenesis.
