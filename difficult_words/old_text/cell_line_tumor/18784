Transfection of sense cDNA of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnTV) into H7721 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells resulted in the decreased expression of surface sialyl Lewis X (SLe(x)), a sialylated fucose-containing antigen. The enzymatic mechanisms were speculated to be the concomitantly decreased expression of alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase (FucT)-III, -VI, -VII and the branching enzyme of O-glycans, core 2-beta1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT)-I, -II. These two glycosyltransferase families were suggested to be the key enzymes in the synthesis of SLe(x). The expression of alpha2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3)-IV, but not ST3-I, -II and -III was elevated by sense GnTV. However, it did not cause the increase of SLe(x) synthesis. Transfection of antisense GnTV into H7721 cells showed entirely opposite effects on the expression of above-mentioned SLe(x) and glycosyltransferases as the sense GnTV.
