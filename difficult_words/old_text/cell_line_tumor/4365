The present study describes a flexible nanoplatform based on electrostatic assembly of conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) and carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (cMWNTs). It is demonstrated that the obtained nanocomposites inherit intrinsic optical properties of CPEs and characteristic Raman vibration modes of MWNTs, providing a fluorescence-Raman dual-imaging method for intracellular tracking and locating of MWNTs. We suggest that the cellular internalization of the CPE-cMWNT nanocomposites is a surface charge-dependent process. The strengths of this nanoplatform include satisfying biocompatibility, enhanced protein-repellent property, and ease of implementation, making it available for both in vitro and in vivo applications.
