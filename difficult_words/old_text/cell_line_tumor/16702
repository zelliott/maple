Medulloblastoma (MB) is one of the most common malignant brain tumors of             childhood and is associated with a poor prognosis. Gap-junctional intercellular             communication (GJIC) is an important mode for cell-to-cell communication. Dysfunctional             GJIC is exhibited in most cancer cells. There is significant evidence that GJIC             is important in at least some prodrug/suicide gene systems by augmenting the bystander             effect (BE). GJIC is made up of connexins (Cxs), among which Cx43 is present in             most tissues. Bcl-2, an important apoptosis blocker, is closely associated with             the sensitivity to anticancer drugs. Our study showed that dibutyryl cyclic adenosine             monophosphate (db-cAMP) upregulated the Cx43 expression and GJIC function in Daoy             medulloblastoma cells. It directly enhanced the BE using a herpes simplex virus             thymidine kinase (HSVâ€‘tk)/ganciclovir (GCV) system, which was blocked by a Cx43             inhibitor. In addition, db-cAMP increased the cytotoxicity of temozolomide and             teniposide, possibly by downregulating the Bcl-2 expression and inducing apoptosis.             Taken together, we demonstrated the beneficial effect of db-cAMP in treating medulloblastoma             depending on the upregulation of BE and chemosensitivity through Cx43 and Bcl-2-mediated             pathways.
