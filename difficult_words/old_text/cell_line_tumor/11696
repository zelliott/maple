Lumican, a member of the class II small leucine-rich proteoglycan family, regulates the assembly and diameter of collagen fibers in the extracellular matrix of various tissues. We previously reported that lumican expression in the stromal tissues of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) correlates with tumor invasion, and tends to correlate with poor prognosis. Lumican stimulates growth and inhibits the invasion of a PDAC cell line. In the present study, we performed a global shotgun proteomic analysis using lumican-overexpressing PANC‑1 cells and lumican downregulated PANC‑1 cells to identify candidate proteins that are regulated by lumican and related to cell growth and invasion in PDAC cells. A total of 448 proteins were identified from lumican-overexpressing PANC‑1 and control cells. Additionally, 451 proteins were identified from lumican-downregulated PANC‑1 cells and control cells. As a result of semi-quantification based on spectral counting, 174 differentially expressed proteins were identified by lumican upregulation, and 143 differentially expressed proteins were identified by lumican downregulation. The expression levels of 24 proteins, including apoptosis- and invasion-related proteins correlated with lumican expression levels. It is likely that the expression of these proteins is regulated by lumican, and that they are involved in apoptosis and invasion in PDAC. These findings suggest that lumican may be involved in cell growth and invasion through the regulation of these 24 proteins expressed in PDAC.
