We examined the in vivo effects of agonists for prostaglandin E2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) on mucus hypersecretion. We also examined the in vitro effects of EP agonists on airway epithelial cells.

For the in vivo study, we induced hypertrophic and metaplastic changes of goblet cells in rat nasal epithelium by intranasal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instillation. For the in vitro study, we used NCI-H292 cells and cultured human nasal epithelial cells.

Subcutaneous injection of the EP4 agonist (1 to 100 microg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced mucus production and neutrophil infiltration. The EP3 agonist (100 microg/kg) also had some inhibitory effects on mucus production, whereas the EP1 and EP2 agonists showed no effect. The LPS-induced mucus secretion was significantly inhibited by the EP3 and EP4 agonists at 10(-6) mol/L in cultured epithelial cells. The LPS-induced interleukin-8 secretion was also inhibited by the EP3 and EP4 agonists.

These results indicate that the EP4 agonist inhibited LPS-induced airway mucus hypersecretion directly or indirectly through the suppression of interleukin-8 secretion and neutrophil infiltration.
