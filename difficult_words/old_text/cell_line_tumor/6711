Stress-inducible Hsp70i and constitutively expressed Hsc70 are highly related heat shock proteins. Aberrant expression levels and intracellular localization of these proteins has been suggested as a potential marker in certain tumors. The aim of our study was to work out a reliable, immunohistochemical detection of the stress-inducible Hsp70i protein and enabling discrimination between Hsp70i and Hsc70 proteins in paraffin-embedded human tissues. We tested the effect of several fixative procedures and antigen retrieval on the effectiveness of the Hsp70i detection in murine cells cultured in vitro and in liver of rats subjected to heat shock. For cells grown in vitro, specific Hsp70i immunoreactivity was obtained with all fixatives used. However, samples fixed in 10% formalin and 4% paraformaldehyde required antigen retrieval. In liver tissue embedded in paraffin, regardless the fixative used, positive Hsp70i staining could be visible only if antigen retrieval was applied. We applied this procedure for detection of Hsp70i in routine sections of breast and lung cancers fixed with 10% formalin and found that the application of thermal antigen retrieval significantly enhanced the SPA810 immunoreactivity and reduced background staining. This procedure enabled also the differential detection of Hsp70i and Hsc70 in routine histopathological preparations.
