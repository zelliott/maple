To explore the relationship of p53 and the cytotoxicity mediated by TM-TNF-alpha and S-TNF-alpha.

P53 mutation in tumor cell was detected by PCR-SSCP. Wide type p53 expression plasmid was transfected to tumor cells with mutant p53 gene, while the mutant type p53 plasmid to tumor cell with wide type p53 gene.Then,the effects of transfection on the cytotoxicity of two types of TNF were detected.

Mutation in the p53 gene were found in most of tumor cells (Raji, HL-60, K562) which were resistant to S-TNF-alpha. The tumor cells transfected with wild type p53 plasmid were more sensitive to S-TNF-alpha while the tumor cells transfected with mutant type p53 plasmid were less sensitive to S-TNF-alpha. But the cytotoxicity of TM-TNF-alpha was not affected by the transfection.

The cytotoxicity mediated by TM-TNF-alpha is not dependent on wide type p53, which may account for the broader tumorcidal spectrum of TM-TNF-alpha than that of S-TNF-alpha.
