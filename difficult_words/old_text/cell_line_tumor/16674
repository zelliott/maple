Schwann cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of several neuropathies, such as those linked to an excess of d-glucose. Indeed, hyperglicemic condition can often result in the production of high reactive/nitrosative oxygen species concentration and possible damage of several cell structures. In the present work attention has been focused on the possible nitrosative effect of hyperglycemia on RT4 Schwannoma cell lines.

Cells were cultured for 72hrs in the presence of 180 mM D-glucose. Morphology, growth rate, cell viability, catalase evaluation and Western blot were performed.

In D-glucose-exposed cells, 3-Nitrotyrosine increase and subsequent modifications in cell morphology, growth rate, viability and catalase activity were found.

Our findings suggested a possible primary role played by Schwann cells in the hyperglicemic neuropathy pathogenesis, through the excessive production of RNS and a decrease in antioxidant defense systems, bearing out the importance of the "nitrosative hypothesis" in the hyperglicemic-induced nervous system complications.
