PSM-E is a newly discovered alternatively spliced variant of prostate-specific             membrane antigen (PSMA). In the current study, its role on the proliferation,             invasiveness and migration in prostate cancer cell lines was analyzed. PSM-E and             PSMA (as a comparison) eukaryotic expression vectors pcDNA3.0/PSM-E and pcDNA3.0/PSMA             were constructed, validated by RT-PCR and Western blotting, and PSMA/PSM-E overexpression             PC-3 cell models were built. Gene interference was used to block PSMA and the             expression of its splice variants in LNCap cells. Three shRNA fragments were synthesized             against PSMA, cloned into the vector pSilencer 2.1-U6-neo, their interference             effect was evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blotting, and pSilencer 2.1-U6-neo‑shRNA3             (named p‑shRNA3) was chosen in further analyses. Growth curves were drawn to observe             the proliferation change, which showed that PSM-E had the potential to suppress             proliferation ( p<0.05), but no significant change was observed in PSMA/PC-3             cells and in PSMA/PSM-E interfering LNCap cells (p>0.05). Cross-river test             showed that the migration speeds of PSM-E/PC-3 and PSMA/PC-3 were both significantly             slower than the vector negative control, and faster in p-shRNA3 interfering LNCap             cells compared with its vector negative control ( p<0.05), and no significant             difference existed between PSM-E/PC-3 and PSMA/PC-3 (p>0.05). Transwell assay             showed that the invasive cells of both PSMA/PC-3 and PSM-E/PC-3 were fewer compared             to the vector negative control ( p<0.05), and the invasive suppression effect             of PSM-E was weaker than PSMA ( p<0.05), and accordingly, invasiveness of interfering             LNCaP cells was enhanced compared with the vector negative control ( p<0.05).             These results showed that PSM-E could suppress proliferation, migration and invasiveness             of prostate cancer cells. Its suppression effect on cell proliferation is stronger             compared to PSMA and the suppression effect on invasiveness is weaker than that             of PSMA.
