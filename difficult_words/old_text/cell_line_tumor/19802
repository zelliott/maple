The expression of kappa opioid receptor (KOR) is subjected to both transcriptional and posttranscriptional controls. We report that KOR translation is regulated by netrin-1 in primary neurons of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Without stimulation, a significant portion of KOR mRNA is maintained in a dormant state and partitions in the translationally inactive, post-polysomal fraction. During netrin-1 stimulation, which activates its downstream target focal adhesion kinase (FAK), KOR mRNA rapidly partitions to the translationally active polysomal fraction. Functionally, the newly synthesized KOR proteins in DRG neurons are able to bind to specific ligands. This report describes the first example of netrin-1 signaling in the translational control of a drug receptor KOR, which involves the mediator of netrin-1, FAK, and a novel mechanism that enhances the association of target mRNA with polysomes for translational activation.
