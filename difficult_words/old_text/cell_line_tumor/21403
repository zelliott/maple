Fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is based on cell capability to take-up glucose. While a significantly higher expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 has been reported in thyroid tumors only few data are available on the expression of other GLUT isoforms. We studied several GLUT isoforms expression in thyroid tumor cell lines deriving from anaplastic (ARO, FRO), papillary (NPA), follicular (WRO) and medullary (TT) human thyroid carcinoma. GLUT1 and GLUT3 were also studied in 157 human thyroid malignant and benign tissues. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that GLUT1 mRNA levels were higher in less-differentiated cells (ARO, FRO) while GLUT3 mRNA levels were prevalent in well-differentiated cells (NPA, WRO). Accordingly, Western blot showed high expression and correct membrane targeting of GLUT1 protein in ARO and FRO and of GLUT3 protein in NPA and WRO. All cell lines were able to take-up different rates of (3)H-deoxy-glucose. The analysis of GLUT1 and GLUT3 mRNA expression in human thyroid tissues showed the prevalence of GLUT1, but not of GLUT3, in malignant with respect to normal tissues. Finally, both GLUT1 and GLUT3 showed a slightly higher expression in anaplastic than in well-differentiated tumors. In conclusion, we showed that GLUT1 and GLUT3 were the most important glucose transporters in the thyroid tumoral cells. In particular GLUT1 was the most prevalent in less-differentiated cells (ARO and FRO) while GLUT3 was the most prevalent in well-differentiated cells (NPA and WRO). A similar pattern of expression was found for GLUT1 but not for GLUT3 in human thyroid tumors.
