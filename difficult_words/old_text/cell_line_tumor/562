Maspin, a 42-kDa protein, belongs to the serpin family of protease inhibitors and is known to have tumor-suppressor function. In this study, we investigated the interrelationship between clinicopathologic findings and maspin expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).

Using immunohistochemical techniques to examine the expression levels of maspin in OSCC, maspin expression in OSCC was detected in 46 (64.8%) of 71 cases. We also compared the clonicopathologic features of OSCC cases with maspin expression levels. Moreover, we examined expression of maspin in eight cell lines derived from OSCC using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting.

There was a significant correlation between decreased maspin expression and T-category (P < 0.01), lymph metastasis (P < 0.0001), and mode of invasion (P < 0.0001). Patients with positive maspin expression had a significantly better prognosis (P < 0.001). Lower expression of maspin was also seen in cell lines derived from grade 4D, which shows stronger invasive potential than other grades of OSCC.

Maspin may be a useful marker to identify the potential for progression in OSCC.
