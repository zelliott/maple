Eight novel single amino acid (6-11) and dipeptide (12, 13) tyrosine P-O esters of cyclic cidofovir ((S)-cHPMPC, 4) and its cyclic adenine analogue ((S)-cHPMPA, 3) were synthesized and evaluated as prodrugs. In vitro IC(50) values for the prodrugs (<0.1-50 μM) vs vaccinia, cowpox, human cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex type 1 virus were compared to those for the parent drugs ((S)-HPMPC, 2; (S)-HPMPA, 1; IC(50) 0.3-35 μM); there was no cytoxicity with KB or HFF cells at ≤100 μM. The prodrugs exhibited a wide range of half-lives in rat intestinal homogenate at pH 6.5 (<30-1732 min) with differences of 3-10× between phostonate diastereomers. The tyrosine alkylamide derivatives of 3 and 4 were the most stable. (l)-Tyr-NH-i-Bu cHPMPA (11) was converted in rat or mouse plasma solely to two active metabolites and had significantly enhanced oral bioavailability vs parent drug 1 in a mouse model (39% vs <5%).
