Recently, local chemotherapy proved its efficacy against malignant gliomas. Under the hypothesis that local delivery of chemotherapeutic agents into the brain parenchyma induce opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we evaluated the opening of BBB after convection-enhanced delivery of nimustine hydrochloride into the brain parenchyma. Local convection-enhanced delivery of nimustine hydrochloride transiently opened the BBB from about 7-12 days after delivery in normal rodent brain. Systemic chemotherapy during this period of BBB disruption had synergistic effects resulting in prolonged survival of tumor-bearing rats. The present strategy may provide a new approach for glioma chemotherapy.
