Laminin-5 is a major structural element of epithelial tissue basement membranes. In the matrix of cultured epithelial cells, laminin-5 is arranged into intricate patterns. Here we tested a hypothesis that myosin II-mediated actin contraction is necessary for the proper assembly of a laminin-5 matrix by cultured SCC12 epithelial cells. To do so, the cells were treated with ML-7, a myosin II light chain kinase inhibitor, or Y-27632, an inhibitor of Rho-kinase (ROCK), both of which block actomyosin contraction. Under these conditions, laminin-5 shows an aberrant localization in dense patches at the cell periphery. Since ROCK activity is regulated by the small GTPase Rho, this suggests that members of the Rho family of GTPases may also be important for laminin-5 matrix assembly by SCC12 cells. We confirmed this hypothesis since SCC12 cells expressing mutant proteins that inhibit RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 assemble the same aberrant laminin-5 protein arrays as drug-treated cells. We have also evaluated the organization of the laminin-5 receptors alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 integrin and hemidesmosome proteins in ML-7- and Y-27632-treated cells or in cells in which RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 activity were inhibited. In all instances, alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 integrin heterodimers, as well as hemidesmosome proteins, localize precisely with laminin-5 in the matrix of the cells. In summary, our results provide evidence that myosin II-mediated actin contraction and the activity of Rho GTPases are necessary for the proper organization of a laminin-5 matrix and localization of hemidesmosome protein arrays in epithelial cells.
