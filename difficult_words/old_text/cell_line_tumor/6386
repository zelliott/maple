To study the chemical constituents of Coleus forskohlii.

Isolation and purification were carried out by silica gel column chromatographic and Toyopearl HW-40F. Compounds were identified and elucidated by spectral and chemical methods.

Seven compounds were obtained from ethyl acetate extract fraction. Their structures were identified as lupeol (1), oleanolic acid (2), uvalo(3), beta-sitosterol (4), colonic acid (5), demethylcryptojaponol (6), coleolic acid (7). Compounds 1, 2, 6, 7 showed obviously antitumor activity.

Compound 1 and 3 are isolated from the genus for the first time. Moreover, compound 1 is firstly found to have antitumor activity from the plants.
