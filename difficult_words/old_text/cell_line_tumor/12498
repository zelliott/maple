In this work we have examined the ability of various lipopolyplexes to deliver genes into liver cancer cells. We evaluated different parameters such as the protocol of preparation, the lipid/DNA molar ratio, and the molecular weight and type of PEI, to optimize the formulation to achieve high transfection activity. Our hypothesis was that the association of PEI with cationic liposomes (lipopolyplexes) would increase luciferase expression compared to lipoplexes (cationic lipid and DNA) and polyplexes (cationic polymer and DNA) alone.
