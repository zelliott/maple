Uterine papillary serous carcinoma is an uncommon histologic subtype of endometrial cancer that behaves aggressively and has a poor prognosis. We successfully established a uterine papillary serous carcinoma cell line. The population-doubling time was approximately 16 h. Although loss of p53 function is considered critical for the molecular pathogenesis of uterine papillary serous carcinoma, p53 was not only mutated but functionally active in this cell line. This newly established cell line should be useful for investigating the characteristics of uterine papillary serous carcinoma.
