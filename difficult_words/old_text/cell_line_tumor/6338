Peritoneal spread is an adverse outcome in ovarian cancer. Despite clinical efficiency, intraperitoneal (i.p.) chemotherapy after cytoreductive surgery is associated with high systemic and local toxicity. Two polymer-drug delivery systems (P-HYD1-DOX and P-HYD2-DOX) were developed for i.p. administration by conjugating doxorubicin (DOX) to a poly(l-Lysine citramide) polymer carrier with a hydrazone-based degradable spacer. The aim of this study was to assess the antitumoral efficacy of these two conjugates in a xenograft model of human ovarian carcinomatosis.

Peritoneal carcinomatosis was generated in athymic mice by i.p. injection of SKOV3-Luc cells. Free DOX, P-HYD1-DOX and P-HYD2-DOX solutions were administered i.p. at the same dose of 10 mg/kg (DOX eq.). For each treatment, tumor load and therapeutic efficacy were compared to untreated mice and assessed by bioluminescence imaging and survival rates. Toxicity profiles in each group and biodistribution of P-HYD2-DOX after i.p. administration were also determined.

P-HYD-1-DOX and P-HYD-2-DOX demonstrated significant antitumoral efficacy against peritoneal carcinomatosis. Compared to untreated group, P-HYD1-DOX improved median survival times from 58 to 105 days. For P-HYD2-DOX, median survival was not reached after a follow-up of 120 days. Bioluminescence showed high efficacy of P-HYD-2-DOX compared to free DOX but the difference was not significant. Biodistribution study confirmed that free and active DOX were successively released from P-HYD2-DOX in vivo. P-HYD-DOX conjugates were well tolerated by mice after i.p. injection.

P-HYD-DOX conjugates demonstrated significant activity against peritoneal carcinomatosis in a xenograft model of ovarian carcinomatosis and their ability to release active DOX in i.p. deposits and tumor. These features are of clinical interest for i.p. administration in the treatment of ovarian peritoneal carcinomatosis after cytoreductive surgery.
