Activation of the NPFF(2) receptor reduces the inhibitory effect of opioids on the N-type Ca(2+) channel. Although this anti-opioid effect is specific for opioid receptors in neurons and tissues, it also affects NPY Y2 and alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors in undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing the NPFF(2) receptor. To test whether this difference could be due to the immaturity of these cells, they were differentiated to a noradrenergic neuronal phenotype with staurosporine. The differentiated cells ceased to divide and grew long, thin neurites. The inhibition of the depolarization-triggered Ca(2+) transient by activation of G(i)-coupled receptors was either unaffected (micro-opioid), increased (NPY), reduced (NPFF(2)) or lost (alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors). Following a 20 min incubation with 1DMe, the effect of DAMGO was reduced, as in undifferentiated cells, but the effect of NPY was no longer affected. Staurosporine differentiation did not modify the coupling of the micro-opioid and NPFF(2) receptors to the G(i/o) proteins. We suggest that the specificity of the effect of NPFF may not reside in the molecular mechanism of its anti-opioid activity itself but in the organization of receptors within the membrane.
