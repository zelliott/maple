Paracoccidioidomycosis is a prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America which requires prolonged treatment with highly toxic antifungals. Baccharis dracunculifolia is a medicinal plant in Brazil that is a candidate in the search for new drugs. Fractions of the hexanic extracts were obtained using chromatographic procedures and assessed using an antifungal assay with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb18), tumor cell lines and amastigote forms of Leishmania, L. amazonensis. Four compounds were isolated, i.e., ursolic acid (1), methyl linolenate (2), caryophyllene oxide (3), and trans-nerolidol (4). Compounds 2, 3 and 4 displayed antifungal activity against four isolates of Paracocci dioides with MIC values ranging from 3.9-250 Î¼g/ml. Only caryophyllene oxide showed differences in the MIC values against Pb18 when the medium was supplemented with ergosterol, which suggested that the compound interacts with ergosterol. Ursolic acid was active in the cytotoxic assays and showed leishmanicidal activity. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that compounds 2, 3 and 4 decreased the cell size and produced an irregular cell wall surface on P. brasiliensis cells. The present results showed the biological activities of the isolated compounds and revealed that these compounds may affect the cell surface and growth of P. brasiliensis isolates.
