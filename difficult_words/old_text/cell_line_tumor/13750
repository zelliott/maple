Cyclin G1 protein is expressed in normal endometrial epithelial cells in a progesterone-dependent manner. It is an important mediator of the inhibiting effect of progesterone on cell proliferation. Moreover, the expression of cyclin G1 is also found to be decreased in human endometrial carcinoma cells (ECCs). To study the mechanism of decrease in the expression levels of cyclin G1, 3 ECC cell lines, Ishikawa, HEC-1-B, and KLE cells were treated with progesterone (P(4)). The KLE cells, in which progesterone receptor (PR) expression was absent, were transfected with PR-expressing plasmid before treatment with P(4). The results showed that cyclin G1 expression increased in Ishikawa and HEC-1-B cells after treatment with P(4), additionally the cell proliferation was suppressed but not in KLE cells. When the PR-expressing plasmid was transfected into KLE cells, the effect of P(4) was restored. Our data suggest that the deficiency of progesterone and its receptors is an important cause of the decreased expression of cyclin G1 in endometrial carcinoma, which may account for carcinogenesis and development of endometrial carcinomas.
