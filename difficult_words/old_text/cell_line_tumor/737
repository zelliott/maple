To investigate the effect of polyporus umbellatus polysaccharide (PUPS) on the immunosuppression property of tumor cell line S180 culture supernatant.

The inhibitory effects of the culture supernatant of S180 cells in the presence or absence of PUPS on the ConA-induced mouse splenocyte proliferation, IL-2 production, killer activity and the reactivity of CTLL-2 cells to IL-2 were detected by MTT colorimetry. The effect of the culture supernatant on the IL-2Ralpha expression on murine splenocytes was detected by flow cytometry.

The culture supernatant of S180 cells could strongly inhibit immunity in terms of the above five indexes, while PUPS could reverse the immunosuppression.

PUPS can offset the immunosuppression of the supernatant from S180 cell culture, which may be mediated by down-regulating the synthesis and/or secretion of immunosuppressive substance by S180 cells.
