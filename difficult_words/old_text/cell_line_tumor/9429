We have investigated the efficacy of modifying gene-specific antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxyribonucleotides (PS-ODNs) by the addition of 5' and 3' hairpin extensions. As a model system, we have targeted the Mycobacterium tuberculosis 30/32-kDa mycolyl transferase protein complex genes encoding three highly related enzymes (antigens 85 A, B, and C). Whereas the addition of a hairpin extension at only one end of the PS-ODNs did not improve their inhibitory capacity, the addition of hairpin extensions at both ends enhanced their capacity to inhibit M. tuberculosis multiplication in comparison with unmodified PS-ODNs. A combination of three 5'-, 3'-hairpin-modified PS-ODNs (HPS-ODNs) targeting each of the three mycolyl transferase transcripts inhibited bacterial growth in broth culture by approximately 1.75 log units (P < 0.0001) and in human THP-1 macrophages by approximately 0.4 log units (P < 0.0001), which to our knowledge has not previously been demonstrated for any PS-ODN; reduced target gene transcription by > or =90%; caused approximately 90% reduction in mycolyl transferase expression; and increased bacterial sensitivity to isoniazid by 8-fold. The growth-inhibitory effect of the HPS-ODNs was gene-specific. Mismatched HPS-ODNs had no growth-inhibitory capacity. This study demonstrates that 5'- and 3'-HPS-ODNs are highly efficacious against M. tuberculosis and supports the further development of antisense technology as a therapeutic modality against tuberculosis.
