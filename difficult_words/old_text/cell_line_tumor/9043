The objective of this work was to substantially review all preclinical and clinical data on phytochemicals, such as genistein, lycopene, curcumin, epigallocatechin-gallate, and resveratrol, in terms of their effects as a potential treatment of prostate cancer. It is known, that prostate cancer patients increasingly use complementary and alternative medicines in the hope of preventing or curing cancer. The preclinical data for the phytochemicals presented in this review show a remarkable efficacy against prostate cancer cells in vitro, with molecular targets ranging from cell cycle regulation to induction of apoptosis. In addition, well-conducted animal experiments support the belief that these substances might have a clinical activity on human cancer. However, it is impossible to make definite statements or conclusions on the clinical efficacy in cancer patients because of the great variability and differences of the study designs, small patient numbers, short treatment duration and lack of a standardised drug formulation. Although some results from these clinical studies seem encouraging, reliable or long-term data on tumor recurrence, disease progression and survival are unknown. At present, there is no convincing clinical proof or evidence that the cited phythochemicals might be used in an attempt to cure cancer of the prostate.
