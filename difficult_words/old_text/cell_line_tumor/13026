The rhizome of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (SM, family Labiatae), which contains tanshinones as main constituents, has been used as a cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory agent in Chinese medicine.

This study aimed to elucidate anti-allergic effects of the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (SM, family Labiatae) and its main constituents, tanshinones, against passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction.

PCA reaction was induced by IgE-antigen complex (IAC) in ICR mice. Protein expression of IL-4 and TNF-α in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and NF-κB and c-jun (AP-1) activation assayed by immunoblot.

Tanshinones inhibited the PCA reaction and reduced IL-4 and TNF-α production in mice as well as in IAC-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. Tanshinones also inhibited NF-κB and AP-1 activation in RBL-2H3 cells stimulated with IAC. Among tested tanshinones, tanshinone I exhibited the most potent inhibition, followed by 15,16-dihydrotanshinone I, tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone.

SM and tanshinones may ameliorate the PCA reaction by inhibiting the allergic cytokines IL-4 and TNF-α via NF-κB and AP-1 pathways.
