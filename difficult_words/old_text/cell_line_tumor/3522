The solution behaviour of some novel organogold(III) compounds was investigated, and their cytotoxic properties evaluated against a few human tumour cell lines (A2780/S, A2780/R, MCF7, HT29 and A549). Specifically, the following compounds were considered: [Au(bipy(dmb)-H)(2,6-xylidine-H)][PF(6)] (AuXyl) and [Au(bipy(dmb)-H)(p-toluidine-H)][PF(6)] (AuTol) (in which bipy(dmb)=6-(1,1-dimethylbenzyl)-2,2'-bipyridine), [Au(py(dmb)-H)(AcO)(2)] (AuPyAcO) (in which py(dmb)=2-(1,1-dimethylbenzyl)-pyridine) and [Au(pz(Ph)-H)Cl(3)]K (AuPzCl) (in which pz(Ph)=1-phenylpyrazole). The solution chemistry of these compounds, under physiological-like conditions, was investigated through UV-vis absorption and (1)H NMR spectroscopies. Significant cytotoxic effects in vitro were observed in selected cases.
