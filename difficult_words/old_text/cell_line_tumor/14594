Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent, highly malignant, invasive and difficult-to-treat primary brain tumor in adults. At the genetic level, it is characterized by a high degree of chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. It has been shown that defects in the mitotic spindle checkpoint could lead to the development of aneuploidy as well as tumorigenesis. Additional proteins regulating sister chromatid cohesion could also be involved in maintaining the fidelity of chromosome segregation. One such protein is the precocious dissociation of sisters 5A (Pds5A), also known as sister chromatid cohesion protein 112. It is a nuclear protein, expressed from the S right through to the mitotic phase. It is highly conserved from yeast to man and plays a role in the establishment, maintenance and dissolution of sister chromatid cohesion. The mutation of Pds5A orthologs in lower organisms results in chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy and DNA repair defects. It is considered that such defects can cause either cell death or contribute to the development of cancer cells. Indeed, altered expression levels of Pds5A have been observed in tumors of the breast, kidney, oesophagus, stomach, liver and colon. Malignant gliomas, however, have not been analysed so far. Herein, we report on the cloning of Rattus norvegicus Pds5A and on the analysis of its expression pattern in rat tissue. We also show that Pds5A is significantly overexpressed at both the mRNA and protein level and that this overexpression correlates positively with the WHO grade of human gliomas. However, functional assays show that the siRNA-mediated knockdown of Pds5A affects sister chromatid cohesion but does not influence mitotic checkpoint function or the proliferation and survival of GBM cells. Although the mechanism by which Pds5A functions in GBM cells remains unclear, its overexpression in high grade gliomas implies that it could play a pivotal role during the development and progression of astrocytic tumors.
