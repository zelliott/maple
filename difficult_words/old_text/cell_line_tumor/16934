To establish the inner blood-retinal barrier (BRB) model in vitro by co-culturing RF/6A cells and C6 cells and to investigate the effects of EMP (200 kV/m, 200 pulses) exposure on the permeability of the inner BRB model in vitro.

RF/6A cells and C6 cells were co-cultured on transwell, and the characteristic of the inner BRB model was assessed by detecting transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the permeability of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The co-cultured model was exposed or sham exposed to the EMP (200 kV/m 200 pulses) for 0.5, 3, 6, 12, 24 h in vitro, then TEER and the permeability of HRP were measured for studying the effects of EMP on the permeability of inner BRB model in vitro.

TEER value (145 Î©cm(2)) of the co-culturing inner BRB model significantly increased, as compared to that of RF/6A cells alone model (P < 0.05) on the 6th day after inoculation. There was significant difference of permeability of HRP between the co-culturing inner BRB model and RF/6A cells alone model (P < 0.05). The ability of inhibiting large molecular materials in the co-culturing inner BRB model enhanced. The TEER value decreased and the permeability of HRP increased as compared to the sham group at 0.5, 3, 6 h after the exposure.

The inner BRB model by co-culturing RF/6A cells and C6 cells in vitro is efficient and suitable to study the alterations of the restricted permeability function of the inner BRB. EMP (200 kV/m for 200 pulses) could induce the enhanced permeability of the inner BRB model in vitro.
