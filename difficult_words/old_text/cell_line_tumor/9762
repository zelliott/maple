One of the crucial roles of tumor extracellular matrix is to act as a barrier to drug delivery. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the formation of tumor extracellular matrix and the efficiency of intracellular uptake of oligonucleotides in human osteosarcoma cell lines, HOS, and MG-63. Oligonucleotides used in this study were nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) decoy, which might be a therapeutic tool for neoplasms. Pericellular matrix formation was examined by particle exclusion assay. Cellular uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled NF-kappaB decoy was evaluated by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. Effects of NF-kappaB decoy on cell viability and cell cycle arrest in MG-63 cells were determined by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. MG-63 cells exhibited abundant pericellular matrix with time compared with HOS cells. Uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled NF-kappaB decoy decreased in MG-63 cells with time but not in HOS cells in both monolayer and three-dimensional culture using matrigel. However, after enzymatic removal of pericellular matrix, the uptake markedly recovered in MG-63 cells. NF-kappaB decoy inhibited cell proliferation and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in MG-63 cells. These results suggest that abundant pericellular matrix might disturb the uptake of NF-kappaB decoy, and modification of pericellular matrix composition would increase the efficacy of exogenous oligonucleotides treatment for neoplasms.
