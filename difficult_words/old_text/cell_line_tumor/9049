The green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) possesses anti-carcinogenic properties and was found to induce terminal differentiation in epidermal keratinocytes. Caspase-14, a member of the caspase family associated with epithelial cell differentiation, planned cell death, and barrier formation, is induced by EGCG in normal human epidermal keratinocytes but not in cancer cells.

A human epidermoid cancer cell line, A431, was co-transfected with a caspase-14-expressing pCMV vector and a GFP/neo-etpressingpCMVvector. Cell growth and tumorigenicity of the stable transfectant were determined in comparison to cells transfected with the control GFP/neo-expressing pCMV vector.

Expression of exogenous caspase-14 led to growth inhibition and reduced the tumorigenicity of A431 cells.

Pending future studies, caspase-14 could be used as a novel approach to skin cancer therapy via gene delivery systems.
