Investigating the biology of oligodendroglioma and its characteristic combined deletion of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q, mediated by an unbalanced translocation, t(1;19)(q10;p10), has been hampered by the lack of cell lines that harbor these traits. We grew cells from 2 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas in serum-free conditions. Serial propagation and expansion led to the establishment of permanent cell lines that maintained the genetic signature of the parent oligodendrogliomas and displayed features of brain tumor stem cells in vitro. One line was established from a treatment-na√Øve tumor and the other from a temozolomide resistant recurrent tumor. These lines may be important tools for understanding the biology of oligodendrogliomas and the function of their defining genetic traits.
