This study has developed a chitosan-based delivery system to locally administer ellagic acid for brain cancer treatment. We fabricated chitosan/ellagic acid composite films with various concentrations of ellagic acid. In vitro release study was performed by using a UV spectrophotometer, and enzymatic degradation rate was determined by analyzing the increased free amino groups. Viability of brain cancer cells (human U87 glioblastomas and rat C6 glioma cells) was measured via direct and indirect cell culture on the films by MTS assay. Caspase-3 activation, Western blot for p53, and anti-angiogenesis assays were also examined. In the in vivo study, GFP-tagged rat C6 glioma cells were implanted subcutaneously at the right flank region of nude mice and treatments were initiated by implanting the films subcutaneously. Tumor growth was evaluated by measuring tumor volume using a caliper, an ultrasound machine, and an optical imaging system. The chitosan/ellagic acid composite films were enzymatically degradable and exhibited a sustained slow release of ellagic acid. These materials could inhibit the cancer cell growth in an ellagic acid concentration-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis of cancer cells as well as suppressing angiogenesis. These materials also significantly suppressed tumor tissue growth in vivo.
