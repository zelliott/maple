Based on fourth generation diaminobutane poly(propylene imine) dendrimer, a novel targeted drug nanocarrier was prepared, bearing protective PEG chains and a folate targeting ligand. As a control a PEGylated derivative without folate was also synthesized. The encapsulation and release properties of these PEGylated derivatives were investigated employing etoposide, an anticancer hydrophobic drug. Enhanced solubility of etoposide was achieved inside the dendrimeric scaffold which was subsequently released in a controlled manner. These properties coupled with specificity towards the folate receptor and the low toxicity render folate functionalized PEGylated poly(propylene imine) dendrimer promising candidate for targeted drug delivery.
