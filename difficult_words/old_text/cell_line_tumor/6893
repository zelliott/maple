Mithramycin A (MMA, trade name Plicamycin) can facilitate TNFalpha- (Tumor Necrosis Factor) and Fas ligand-induced apoptosis. Besides, several drugs play their anticancer effect through Fas apoptotic pathway. So we investigated the effect of MMA on Fas signaling. In this study we show that MMA induces apoptosis in Fas sensitive Jurkat cells and Fas resistant KG1a cells. This effect involves Fas apoptotic pathway: cell exposure to MMA leads to Fas clustering at the cell surface, DISC (Death Inducing Signaling Complex) formation and caspase cleavage. This phenomenon is independent of Fas ligand/Fas interaction and blockade of Fas death pathway partially inhibits MMA-induced apoptosis. Moreover the activation of Fas apoptotic pathway by MMA is correlated to the modulation of c-Flip(L) expression. Finally, pre-treatment with sub-lethal doses of MMA sensitizes KG1a cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Thus all these results may have important implications to improve clinical treatments.
