A new phytosphingosine-type ceramide, suillumide (1), was isolated from the EtOH extract of the basidiomycete Suillus luteus (L.) S. F. Gray, along with ten known compounds: ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one, ergosterol, ergosterol peroxide, suillin, (E)-3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic alcohol, 5 alpha,6 alpha-epoxyergosta-8,22-diene-3beta,7 beta-diol, (R)-1-palmitoylglycerol, ergosta-7,9(11),22-triene-3beta,5 alpha,6 beta-triol, cerevisterol, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. The structure of 1 was determined on the basis of spectroscopic and mass-spectrometric analyses, as well as by chemical methods. Compound 1 and its synthetic diacetyl derivative 2 were tested for their cytotoxic activities against the human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-1. Both drugs showed IC(50) values of ca. 10 microM after 72 h of exposure.
