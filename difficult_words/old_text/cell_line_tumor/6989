Exposure of MDA-MB-468 cells to ionizing radiation (IR) caused biphasic activation of ERK as indicated by its phosphorylation at Thr202/Tyr204. Specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor AG1478 and specific Src inhibitor PP2 inhibited IR-induced ERK1/2 activation but phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin did not. IR caused EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas it did not induce EGFR autophosphorylation at Tyr992, Tyr1045, and Tyr1068 or Src-dependent EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr845. SHP-2, which positively regulates EGFR/Ras/ERK signaling cascade, became activated by IR as indicated by its phosphorylation at Tyr542. This activation was inhibited by PP2 not by AG1478, which suggests Src-dependent activation of SHP-2. Src and PTPalpha, which positively regulates Src, became activated as indicated by phosphorylation at Tyr416 and Tyr789, respectively. These data suggest that IR-induced ERK1/2 activation involves EGFR through a Src-dependent pathway that is distinct from EGFR ligand activation.
