The present study focuses on the expression pattern of the stem cell markers CD133 and Musashi-1 in precancerous and cancerous tissues of oral epithelium. The study also aims to investigate the correlation of CD133 and Musashi-1 expression with clinicopathological factors.

Immunohistochemical analysis was done to investigate the expression pattern of CD133 and Musashi-1, whereas, the coexpression of CD133 and Musashi-1 was studied using immunofluorescence analysis.

A gradual increase in the expression of CD133 and Musashi-1 was observed from normal to dysplasia to carcinoma. In addition, the expression of CD133 and Musashi-1 shows significant difference between the stages and histological types of oral carcinoma. Interestingly, coexpression of CD133 and Musashi-1 was observed in oral carcinoma and CAL27 cells.

A gradual increase in the expression of CD133 and Musashi-1 from normal to dysplasia to carcinoma suggests the possible involvement of these 2 proteins in oral carcinogenesis. The overexpression of CD133 and Musashi-1 in advanced stages and also in poorly differentiated tumors reveals their relationship with invasion and differentiation status of oral carcinoma cells. Moreover, the significant positive correlation between CD133 and Musashi-1 expression suggests that they might have a functional relationship in oral carcinoma cells, which needs further investigation.
