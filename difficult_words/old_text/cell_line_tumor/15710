A novel series of exomethylene- and keto-exomethylene-d-glucopyranonucleosides with thymine, uracil, and 5-fluorouracil as heterocyclic bases have been designed and synthesized. Wittig condensation of the 3-keto glucoside 1 gave the corresponding 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-3-deoxy-3-methylene-d-glucofuranose (2), which after hydrolysis and acetylation led to the precursor 1,2,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-methylene-d-glucopyranose (4). Compound 4 was condensed with silylated thymine, uracil, and 5-fluorouracil, respectively, deacetylated and acetalated to afford 1-(3'-deoxy-4',6'-O-isopropylidene-3'-methylene-β-d-glucopyranosyl)pyrimidines 7a-c. Oxidation of the free hydroxyl group in the 2'-position of the sugar moiety led to the formation of the labile 1-(3'-deoxy-4',6'-O-isopropylidene-3'-methylene-β-d-glucopyranosyl-2'-ulose)pyrimidines 8a-c. Finally, deisopropylidenation of the resulted derivatives 8a-c afforded the diol nucleosides 9a-c. The target keto-exomethylene analogs 9a-c were more cytostatic against a variety of tumor cell lines than the corresponding saturated-hydroxy-exomethylene derivatives 6. In particular, the 5-fluorouracil derivative 9c was highly cytostatic at an IC(50) (50% inhibitory concentration) ranging between 0.56 and 9.4 microg/mL, which was comparable to the free parental 5-fluorouracil base.
