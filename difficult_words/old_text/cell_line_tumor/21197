The medicinal plant, Nothapodytes foetida contains a number of important alkaloids like camptothecin (an anticancer drug molecule) but its concentration is less to meet the existing demand of this important molecule, so in an effort for accessible availability of camptothecin. An endophyte (designated ZP5SE) was isolated from the seed of Nothapodytes foetida and was examined as potential source of anticancer drug lead compound i.e. camptothecin, when grown in Sabouraud liquid culture media under shake flask conditions. The presence of anticancer compound (camptothecin) in this fungus was confirmed by chromatographic and spectroscopic methods in comparison with authentic camptothecin. Isolated endophyte (Neurospora crassa) producing camptothecin may become an easily accessible source for the production of precursor anticancer drug molecule in future at large scale.
