Biocompatibility has long been associated with surface microtopography, microtexture, and microchemistry. The surface topography eventually affects the nature and the intensity of the interactions that occur at biomaterial-biological interface (cell adhesion, mobility, spreading, and proliferation). Therefore, it is necessary to produce and work with controlled microtopographical surfaces that present reproducible microdomains of a dimension similar to that of the biological elements of interest (in this case, osteoblasts). There are a number of substrates that already have been studied in terms of surface topography; however, few studies are related to hydroxyapatite (HA) substrates. As it is well established, HA is a well-known ceramic that is extremely used in medical applications, namely implants and coatings. In this work, the surface topography of dense HA substrates was altered by using KFr excimer laser. The surface was characterized by atomic force microscopy and contact angle measurements, while the cell distribution and morphology was assessed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results revealed that the surface is characterized by a homogeneous columnar structure with high specific area. Moreover, cells were able to attach and spread on the surface of the samples, and gradually grow into nearly confluent monolayers.
