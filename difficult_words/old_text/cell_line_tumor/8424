Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) colonizes the gastric mucosa of over 50% of the world population, causing several pathologies, such as gastric ulcers and gastric cancer. Since current antibiotic treatments are inefficient in 20% of cases alternative therapies are needed. This work reports the ability of chitosan microspheres to adhere to H. pylori and prevent/remove H. pylori colonization. Adhesion of H. pylori strains with different functional adhesins (BabA and/or SabA) to chitosan microspheres (diameter 167 ± 27 μm) occurs at both pH 2.6 and 6.0, but is higher at pH 6.0. Bacterial adhesion to a gastric cell line expressing sialylated carbohydrates (SabA receptors) was performed at the same pH values using H. pylori strains with and without SabA. At both pH values addition of microspheres to gastric cells before and after pre-incubation with H. pylori decreased bacterial adhesion to cells. Furthermore, the chitosan microspheres were non-cytotoxic. These findings reveal the potential of chitosan microspheres as an alternative or complementary treatment for H. pylori gastric eradication or prevention of H. pylori colonization.
