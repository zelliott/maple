The apoptotic ligand TRAIL is believed to have promise as a cancer gene therapy, yet many types of cancer, including gliomas, have exhibited resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here, we show that therapeutic combination of the lipoxygenase inhibitor MK886 and TRAIL-secreting human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-TRAIL) provide targeted and prolonged delivery of TRAIL both in vitro and in orthotopic mouse models of glioma. Treatment of either TRAIL-sensitive or TRAIL-resistant human glioma cells with MK886 and MSC-TRAIL resulted in significantly enhanced apoptosis compared with each agent alone. MK886 effectively increased the sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis via upregulation of the death receptor 5 and downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein survivin in human glioma cell lines and in primary glioma cells. This regulation was accompanied by a substantial increase in caspase activation after combined treatment. Furthermore, in vivo survival experiments and imaging analysis in orthotopic xenografted mice showed that MSC-based TRAIL gene delivery combined with MK886 into the tumors had greater therapeutic efficacy than single-agent treatment. Together, our findings indicate that MK886 combined with MSC-based TRAIL gene delivery may represent a novel strategy for improving the treatment of malignant gliomas.
