Angiogenesis plays an essential role in tumor growth and metastasis and is a promising target for cancer therapy. We characterized the effects of selective CIAPIN1 inhibition on the angiogenesis gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 by stable transfection of CIAPIN1 siRNA. Our study has been shown that CIAPIN1 play the determined role in tumor growth and multidrug resistance. The conditioned media obtained from SGC7901 treated with CIAPIN1 siRNA suppressed in vitro the proliferation, migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells compared with untransfected cells or cells transfected with control vector alone. Furthermore, the stable transfection of CIAPIN1 siRNA inhibited in vivo tumorigenicity and angiogenesis. Our findings support that selective inhibition of CIAPIN1 alone plays an instrumental role on gastric cancer associated angiogenesis.
