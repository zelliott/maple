N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a precursor of L-cysteine, not only elevates the level of glutathione in both astrocytoma and astrocyte cultures, but also affects the cellular level of sulfane sulfur. Astrocytoma cells were investigated using the stable U373 human cell line. In the U373 cells, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, depending on the concentration in the culture medium and culture duration, either elevated or diminished the level of sulfane sulfur, and this was respectively accompanied by decreased or increased cellular proliferation. In murine astrocytes, in turn, NAC was capable of lowering the level of sulfane sulfur and in this way decreased cellular proliferation. It seems that normal (astrocyte) and transformed (astrocytoma) cells differed in their reaction to NAC in the culture medium. The effect of N-acetyl-L-cysteine on astrocytoma cells was advantageous in that it inhibited their proliferation through the elevation of the level of sulfane sulfur.
