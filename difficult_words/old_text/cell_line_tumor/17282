Mina53 is a novel Myc target gene that we previously demonstrated to be involved in cell proliferation. We studied, here, the expression of Mina53 in colon cancer to examine its possible role in carcinogenesis. We generated a specific monoclonal anti-human Mina53 antibody and found that colon tumor cell lines expressed Mina53 highly. We also found that expression of Mina53 was elevated in colon tumor tissues by immunoblotting analysis. Tissue sections of 23 surgical cases of adenocarcinoma and 1 case of adenoma were stained immunohistochemically, and the expression of Mina53 was found to be elevated in all of the adenocarcinomas compared to adjacent nonneoplastic tissues, which showed little staining. Deeply invading tumors as well as tumors that have invaded lymphatic vessels showed strong immunoreactivity against anti-Mina53 antibody. Mina53 was expressed in all pathological grades of cancer as well as in the adenoma. Staining patterns of Ki-67, a biomarker for cell proliferation, were similar to those of Mina53 in most cases, but the percentage of tumor cells stained by anti-Mina53 was higher. Although anti-Ki-67 antibody strongly stained some well-proliferating nonneoplastic cells including cells in the deeper part of the crypts and in lymphoid germinal centers, antibody to Mina53 rarely stained those cells. Suppression of mina53 expression severely suppressed proliferation of colon tumor cells in vitro. Together, our results indicate that the elevated expression of Mina53 is a characteristic feature in colon cancer, one that may have therapeutic applications.
