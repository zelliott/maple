In bone tissue engineering, scaffolds with controlled porosity are required to allow cell ingrowth, nutrient diffusion and sufficient formation of vascular networks. The physical properties of synthetic scaffolds are known to be dependent on the biomaterial type and its processing technique. In this study, we demonstrate that the separation phase technique is a useful method to process poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (PCL) into a desired shape and size. Moreover, using poly(ethylene glycol), sucrose, fructose and Ca2+ alginate as porogen agents, we obtained PCL scaffolds with three-dimensional porous structures characterized by different pore size and geometry. Scanning electron microscopy and porosity analysis indicated that PCL scaffolds prepared with Ca2+ alginate threads resemble the porosity and the homogeneous pore size distribution of native bone. In parallel, MicroCT analysis confirmed the presence of interconnected void spaces suitable to guarantee a biological environment for cellular growth, as demonstrated by a biocompatibility test with MC3T3-E1 murine preosteoblastic cells. In particular, scaffolds prepared with Ca2+ alginate threads increased adhesion and proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells under basal culture conditions, and upon stimulation with a specific differentiation culture medium they enhanced the early and later differentiated cell functions, including alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralized extracellular matrix production. These results suggest that PCL scaffolds, obtained by separation phase technique and prepared with alginate threads, could be considered as candidates for bone tissue engineering applications, possessing the required physical and biological properties.
