To study the expression of integrin alpha 6 beta 4 in human laryngeal carcinoma cell lines Hep-2 and AMC-HN8. To explore the mechanism and the effects of integrin alpha 6 beta 4 in human laryngeal carcinoma cell lines.

Flowcytometry was used to exame the surface expression of integrin alpha 6 beta 4 in human laryngeal carcinoma cell lines. Anti-alpha 6 and anti-beta 4 specific monoclonal antibody were used in adherence inhibition assay and in vitro invasion assay.

Overexpression of integrin alpha 6 beta 4 were present in both Hep-2 and AMC-HN8 cell lines. Anti-alpha 6 and anti-beta 4 specific monoclonal antibody together blocked the alpha 6 beta 4 on the surface of the cells resulting in low adherence on the extracellular matrix and weak invasion through the extracellular matrix.

Integrin alpha 6 beta 4 play a vitral role in the adhension and invasion of laryngeal carcinoma. Anti-alpha 6 and anti-beta 4 specific monoclonal antibody together can block the function of integrin alpha 6 beta 4. So treatment with anti-alpha 6 and anti-beta 4 specific monoclonal antibody may reduce the development of laryngeal carcinoma.
