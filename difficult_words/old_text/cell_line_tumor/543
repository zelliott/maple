Recent progress in molecular biology has revealed many genetic and epigenetic alterations that are involved in the development and progression of esophageal cancer. Microarray analysis has also revealed several genetic networks that are involved in esophageal cancer. However, clinical application of microarray techniques and use of microarray data have not yet occurred. In this review, we focus on the recent developments and problems with microarray analysis of esophageal cancer.
