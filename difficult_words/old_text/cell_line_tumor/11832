Mesenchymal transformation is a hallmark of aggressive glioblastoma (GBM). Here, we report the development of an unbiased method for computational integration of copy number variation, expression, and mutation data from large datasets. Using this method, we identified rhophilin 2 (RHPN2) as a central genetic determinant of the mesenchymal phenotype of human GBM. Notably, amplification of the human RHPN2 gene on chromosome 19 correlates with a dramatic decrease in the survival of patients with glioma. Ectopic expression of RHPN2 in neural stem cells and astrocytes triggered the expression of mesenchymal genes and promoted an invasive phenotype without impacting cell proliferation. Mechanistically, these effects were implemented through RHPN2-mediated activation of RhoA, a master regulator of cell migration and invasion. Our results define RHPN2 amplification as a central genetic determinant of a highly aggressive phenotype that directs the worst clinical outcomes in patients with GBM.
