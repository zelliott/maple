To investigate the expression of multidrug resistance gene ABCB1 and ABCG2 in FaDu cells (human hypopharyngeal carcinoma cell line) and the multidrug resistance (MDR) cell lines FaDu/T transformed from FaDu cells by taxol and underlying mechanisms of MDR.

The multidrug resistance sensitivities of FaDu and FaDu/T to cisplatin (DDP), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin (Dox), and vincristine (VCR) were examined by methyl-thiazolyl-tetrazolium (MTT) assay. The mRNA and protein expressions of multidrug resistance genes ABCB1 and ABCG2 were analysed with RT-PCR, Western blot and laser confocal microscopy. JNK signal proteins were detected through Western blot.

The multidrug resistance of FaDu/T cells to Taxol, DDP, 5-FU, ADM and VCR was more than that of FaDu cells. The expression of ABCB1 in FaDu/T cells was significantly higher than that in FaDu cells (t = 22.42, P < 0.05), but the expression of ABCG2 in FaDu/T cells was significantly lower than that in FaDu cells (t = 10.06, P < 0.05). JNK signal was inhibited in FaDu or FaDu/T cells and the inhibited JNK was reactivated by taxol or anisomycin (an activator for MAPK signal transduction pathways). Anisomycin down-regulated the expression of ABCB1 (F = 33.72, P < 0.05) and up-regulated the expression of ABCG2 (F = 220.16, P < 0.05) in FaDu/T cells, but not in FaDu/T cells pretreated by JNK inhibitor SP600125 (P > 0.05).

The overexpression of ABCB1 and the down-regulation of ABCG2 in FaDu/T cells were the main features of MDR in hypopharyngeal carcinomas, in which JNK signal transduction pathways could play an important role.
