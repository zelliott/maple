In our ongoing screening culture fluid extracts of Gloeoporus (Caloporus) dichrous strain 83065 inhibited the germination of Magnaporthe grisea and Fusarium graminearum spores. While isolating the active metabolites two new caloporosides, caloporoside G and caloporoside H, in addition to the known caloporoside derivatives F-16438G, caloporoside A, and 2-hydroxy-6-(16-hydroxyheptadecyl)benzoic acid were obtained.
