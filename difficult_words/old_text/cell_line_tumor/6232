Chemical investigation of a collection of the fungus Neosartorya glabra from Thailand furnished sartoryglabins A-C (1a, 1b and 2) which are analogs of the reverse prenylated indole alkaloids known as (-) ardeemins. Structures of these compounds were established by NMR spectrometry and an X-ray analysis. Sartoryglabins A-C were evaluated for their in vitro growth inhibitory activity on three human tumor cell lines: MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer) and A375-C5 (melanoma). All the compounds exhibited strong to moderate activity against the MCF-7 cell line but weak or no activity against the NCI-H460 and A375-C5 cell lines. Sartoryglabin B was found to exhibit selectivity towards the MCF-7 cell line.
