To investigate the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK-2) gene in SH-SY5Y cells.

The expression of CDK-2 gene was examined with reverse transcriptional (RT)-PCR, and the PCR products underwent electrophoresis on non-denaturing poly-acrylamide gel (PAG) followed by silver staining. The separated and purified DNAs were ligated into pMD18-T vector, and the positive clones identified by sequence analysis.

Two DNA bands were displayed on PAG, and the one with smaller molecular weight was less intensively stained. The sequences of the two clones indicated that both were products of CDK-2 gene.

Two kinds of CDK-2 gene products are co-expressed in the SH-SY5Y cells, one of which lacks the fifth exon and is expressed at a low level.
