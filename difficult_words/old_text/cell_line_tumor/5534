A series of alkanediamide-linked bisbenzamidines was synthesized and tested in vitro against a drug-sensitive strain of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, a drug-resistant strain of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Pneumocystiscarinii. Bisbenzamidines linked with longer alkanediamide chains were potent inhibitors of both strains of T. brucei. However, bisbenzamidines linked with shorter alkanediamide chains were the most potent compounds against P. carinii. N,N'-Bis[4-(aminoiminomethyl)phenyl] hexanediamide, 4 displayed potent inhibition (IC50=2-3 nM) against T. brucei and P. carinii, and was non-cytotoxic in the A549 human lung carcinoma cell line. The inhibitory bioactivity was significantly reduced when the amidine groups in 4 were moved from the para to the meta positions or replaced with amides.
