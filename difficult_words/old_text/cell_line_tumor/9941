To study the chemical constituents in herbs of Paris verticillata.

The compounds were isolated by column chromatography with silica gel and purified by Sephadex LH-20 and RP-HPLC. The structures were identified by means of NMR analysis.

Nine compounds were isolated from the EtOAc extract and the n-BuOH extract of P. verticillata. Their structures were identified as beta-sitosterol (1), stigmasterol (2), daucosterol (3), beta-ecdysterone (4), 4-hydroxymethyl-gamma-butyrolactone (5), diosgenin-3-O-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl (1-->4)-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1-->2)]-beta-D-glycopyranoside (6), pennogenin-3-O-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-glycopyranoside (7), pennogenin-3-O-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl (1-->4)-[alpha-L-rhamnopy-ranosyl (1-->2)]-beta-D-glycopyranoside (8), and pennogenin-3-O-alpha-L-rhamno-pyranosyl (1-->4)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1--4)-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1-->2)]-beta-D-glycopyranoside (9).

Compounds 1-9 are isolated from P. verticillata for the first time, and compounds 3, 5 are isolated from the genus Paris for the first time. The compounds 6-9 showed certain inhibition activeness of LA-795 cells, especially, the effects of compounds 6, 8 and 9 were more significant.
