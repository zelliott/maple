Novel tricyclic derivatives containing an oxazepine, thiazepine, or diazepine ring were studied for their EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. While the oxazepines were in general more potent than thiazepines, the diazepines displayed somewhat different structure-activity relationships. Moreover, the diazepines, in contrast to the oxazepines, showed appreciable inhibitory activity against the KDR tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, both oxazepines and diazepines demonstrated significant ability to inhibit autophosphorylation of EGFR in DiFi cells (generally, IC(50) values in the single-digit micromolar to submicromolar range).
