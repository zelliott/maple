Phytochemical investigation of the ethanol extract from the roots of Toddalia asiatica resulted in the isolation of eight new alkaloids, 8-methoxynorchelerythrine (1), 11-demethylrhoifoline B (2), 8-methoxynitidine (3), 8-acetylnorchelerythrine (4), 8,9,10,12-tetramethoxynorchelerythrine (5), isointegriamide (6), 1-demethyl dicentrinone (7), and 11-hydroxy-10-methoxy-(2,3)-methylenedioxytetrahydroprotoberberine (8), together with 10 known alkaloids. Their structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analyses, including 1D-NMR, 2D-NMR, and HR-ESI-MS. The isolated components were evaluated in vitro for cytotoxic activities against eight tumor cell lines, antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria and five Gram-negative bacteria, and antifungal activities against five pathogens. Benzo[c]phenanthridine and secobenzo[c]phenantridine alkaloids exhibited significant cytotoxic, antimicrobial and antifungal properties.
