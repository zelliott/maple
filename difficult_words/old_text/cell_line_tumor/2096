To explore the expression of cyclinD1 in ovarian carcinoma cell 3AO and analyze its relationship with the proliferation of ovarian cancer cell.

Human ovarian epithelium and ovarian cancer cells 3AO were cultured in vitro. CyclinD1 genes and proteins were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry before and after the activation of cell 3AO by cis-platinum. Also the cell activity and cell cycle were observed.

Abnormal gene amplification and over-expressions of cyclinD1 were found in ovarian cancer cell while the expression of cyclinD1 was negative in normal ovarian epithelium. Under cis-platinum, different expressions of cyclinD1 genes were found in 3AO by RT-PCR. The higher the concentrations of cisplatin, the lower expressions of cyclinD1 genes. By flow cytometry, it was also found that there were lower expressions of cyclinD1 protein in 3AO under cisplatin than without it. With the rising concentrations of cisplatin, the low expressions of cyclinD1 protein in 3AO were detected. The mean numbers were 105.9, 15.42 and 8.59, the cell apoptotic rates 0.63%, 9.08% and 27.41% and the proliferation index (PI) numbers 38.83%, 44.54%, 37.31%. The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.01).

The up-regulation of cyclinD1 is detected in ovarian cancer cell. A positive correlation is found between the lower expressions of cyclinD1 and the concentration of cisplatin. There is a close relationship between the expressions of cyclinD1 and ovarian cancer cell activity.
