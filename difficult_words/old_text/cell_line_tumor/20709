The present investigation was to evaluate the effects of essential oils of Wedelia chinensis (Osbeck) on free radicals and in vivo antioxidant properties.

Essential oils were extracted using hydro-distillation and compound analysis was performed by GC-MS analysis. Screening for inhibitory activity was conducted by DPPH and OH-scavenging assays. In addition an in vivo study was carried out in cell line implanted cancer bearing mice with assessment of levels of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide and reduced glutathione. Finally, lungs were dissected out for histopathology study of metastasis.

GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of carvocrol and trans-caryophyllene as the major compounds with 96% comparison with the Wilily and NBS libraries. The essential oil exhibited significant inhibition in DPPH free radical formation. Whereas reducing power and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity are dose dependent. When compared with the standard, it was found that the essential oil has more or less equal activity in scavenging free radicals produced. In the animal studies, the level of antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, as well as glutathione, were found to be increased in treated groups whereas lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide were reduced. Histopathology report also shows that the essential oil has a significant combating effect against cancer development.

In all the in vitro assays, a significant correlation existed between the concentrations of the essential oil and percentage inhibition of free radicals. The in vivo studies also has shown a very good antioxidant property for the essential oil during cancer development. From, these results the essential oil can be recommended for treating disease related to free radicals and to prevent cancer development.
