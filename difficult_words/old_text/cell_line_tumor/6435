N-myc downstream regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) is involved in invasion and metastasis of cancer, furthermore it is frequently down-regulated in prostate cancer. Herein we evaluated the effect of NDRG2 overexpression on invasiveness and bone destruction in prostate cancer. The human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 and DU145 were infected with Ad-NDRG2 or Ad-LacZ. Overexpression of NDRG2 not only inhibited the growth of the cells, but also suppressed invasiveness of the cells in an in vitro assay. PC-3 cells infected with Ad-NDRG2 or Ad-LacZ were injected into the tibias of nude mice. Four weeks later, we found the mice injected with PC-3 cells overexpressing NDRG2 had smaller tumors and less bone destruction. These results demonstrate that NDRG2 overexpression can inhibit tumor growth and invasion, furthermore, it can decrease bone destruction caused by prostate cancer bone metastasis.
