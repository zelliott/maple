Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma mainly seen in children. Despite considerable progress within the last few years, therapeutic approaches for this type of tumor are still limited. The respective tumor cells originate from myogenic precursor cells and are characterized by a blockade in their differentiation program. Interestingly, there is a direct inverse correlation between the differentiation status of a specific rhabdomyosarcoma cell and its metastatic potential. Thus, here, we tested whether the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-κB, which regulates myogenic differentiation and is also a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of other types of tumors, might be an interesting candidate for the development of novel rhabdomyosarcoma treatment strategies. For this purpose, we analyzed NF-κB activity (classical pathway) in myoblasts with different differentiation potential, specifically in three different rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. In addition, we inhibited NF-κB activity in these cells and analyzed the effects on myogenic differentiation. We show that after the induction of differentiation, NF-κB activity declines rapidly in normal myoblasts, but only slightly in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. However, after treatment of the cells with two different small-molecule NF-κB-inhibiting compounds, the IKK inhibitor curcumin and the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, we found that neither curcumin nor lactacystin promoted myogenic differentiation in either normal myoblasts or rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Taken together, our data suggest that treatment with curcumin or lactacystin might not be a suitable approach in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma.
