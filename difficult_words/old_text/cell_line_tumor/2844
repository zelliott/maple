Lung cancer is 1 of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide, and the high mortality from this disease is caused mainly by the lack of efficient diagnostic strategies for early-stage lung cancer. The objective of the current study was to investigate the expression pattern and clinicopathologic significance of centromere protein H (CENP-H) in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The expression profile of CENP-H in normal lung epithelial cells, NSCLC cell lines, NSCLC tissues, and adjacent noncancerous lung tissues were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis. The expression level of CENP-H in 223 NSCLC tissues was measured by immunohistochemistry staining. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the clinicopathologic significance of CENP-H.

The expression level of CENP-H was much higher in cancer cell lines and lung cancer tissues than that in normal cells and adjacent noncancerous lung tissues, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive CENP-H expression in 118 of 223 NSCLC tissues (52.9%). Statistical analysis revealed that CENP-H expression was correlated strongly with clinical stage (P=.018), tumor classification (P=.03), and Ki-67 expression (P < .001). Patients with lower CENP-H expression had better overall survival than patients with higher CENP-H expression. Further analysis suggested that CENP-H could predict prognosis only in patients with early-stage disease. Multivariate analysis suggested that CENP-H expression was an independent prognostic marker for survival in patients with NSCLC.

The current results demonstrated that high CENP-H protein expression was related to poor outcome in patients with NSCLC. CENP-H may be used as a prognostic biomarker for patients lung patients, especially those with early-stage NSCLC.
