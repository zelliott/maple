A bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethyl acetate soluble fraction from the stem bark of Styrax japonica S. et Z. (Styracaceae) yielded two new lignan compounds, styraxjaponoside A (1) and styraxjaponoside B (2), along with three known compounds, matairesinoside (3), egonol glucoside (4), and dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol 9'-O-glucoside (5). The structures of compounds 1-5 were determined by spectroscopic method, as well as 1D- and 2D-NMR (HSQC, 1H-1H COSY, and HMBC) spectroscopy. Among them, compound 2 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, and prevented the UV-induced changes in the MMP-1 expression. In addition, compounds 3 and 5 were isolated from this plant for the first time.
