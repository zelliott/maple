Multiple myeloma, the second most common haematological malignancy in the U.S., is currently incurable. Disruption of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by BCL2 and MCL1 upregulation is observed in >80% of myeloma cases and is associated with an aggressive clinical course. Remarkably, there is no approved drug with the ability to target BCL2 or MCL1. Thus, we investigated the anti-tumour effects of a pan-BCL2 inhibitor, AT-101, which has high binding specificity for BCL2 and MCL1 in preclinical models of plasma cell cancers (Multiple myeloma and Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinaemia). Gene expression and immunoblot analysis of six plasma cell cancer models showed upregulation of BCL2 family members. AT-101 was able to downregulate BCL2 and MCL1 in all plasma cell cancer models and induced apoptotic cell death in a caspase-dependent manner by altering mitochondrial membrane permeability. This cytotoxic effect and BCL2 downregulation were further potentiated when AT-101 was combined with lenalidomide/dexamethasone (LDA). NanoString nCounter mRNA quantification and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis revealed differential changes in the CCNA2, FRZB, FYN, IRF1, PTPN11 genes in LDA-treated cells. In summary, we describe for the first time the cellular and molecular events associated with the use of AT-101 in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone in preclinical models of plasma cell malignancy.
