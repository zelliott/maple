Grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance imaging (GCSPRI) is a method for the accurate assessment of both cell phenotype and function. In GCSPRI, cells and/or proteins of interest are flowed across antibodies immobilized on a gold-coated sensor chip. The surface of the chip is illuminated with monochromatic light that couples with surface plasmons in the gold. At a specific angle of incidence, the GCSPR angle, the maximum amount of coupling occurs. Shifts in the GCSPR angle can be correlated with refractive index changes following cell or analyte capture by the immobilized antibodies. In addition, GCSPRI can image the cells as they are being captured. GCSPRI's multiplexed format allows for the parallel assessment of up to 400 individual antibody regions. In this paper, we demonstrate GCSPRI's ability to identify cells and proteins of interest and compare results to a traditional flow cytometry system. This technology represents a fast and powerful method for the simultaneous assessment of cell phenotype and function.
