To determine the presence of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), and to investigate the expression kinetics of HBV DNA, HBsAg and HBeAg in 2.2.15 cell.

HBV cccDNA was assessed by polymerase chain reaction, HBV DNA was measured by Taqman quantitative PCR and HBsAg and HBeAg was measured by EIA.

HBV cccDNA was found in both intracellular and extracellular space. There was a good correlation between HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA in the supernatant of 2.2.15 cell (r= 0.833, P < 0.05 and r= 0.939, P < 0.01 for HBsAg and HBeAg, respectively), whereas there was no significant correlation between intracellular HBV DNA levels and virus antigen levels (r= 0.024, P= 0.955 and r= 0.177; P= 0.625 for HBsAg and HBeAg, respectively).

HBV cccDNA was detectable in the culture medium and intracellularly in 2.2.15 cells, and these data provided an indication of HBV replication in 2.2.15 cell.
