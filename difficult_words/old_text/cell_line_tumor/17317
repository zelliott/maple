Clotrimazole (CLT) 1, a synthetic anti-fungal imidazole derivative, inhibits tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. In the current study, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the decrease in tumor cell growth by CLT 1 was associated with inhibition of cell cycle progression at the G(1)-S phase transition, resulting in G(0)-G(1) arrest. A series of CLT 1 analogues has been generated in order to develop CLT 1 derivatives that are devoid of the imidazole moiety which is responsible for the hepatoxicity associated with CLT 1 while retaining CLT 1 efficacy. The majority of these analogues demonstrate in vitro antiproliferative activity ranging from submicromolar to micromolar concentrations.
