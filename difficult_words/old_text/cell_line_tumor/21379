Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the major obstacles to successful chemotherapy of human malignancies. Although many strategies have been explored to overcome MDR, none of them have been proven to be clinically useful until now. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a novel therapeutic ultrasound (US) approach would have useful effects on the reversal of MDR in cancer cells. Wild-type and MDR phenotype (HepG2/ADM) cells of the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 were exposed to 0.8 MHz US at an intensity of 0.43 W/cm(2) for a 9s exposure (total energy density: 3.87 J/cm(2)). After US exposure, cell number and viability were counted immediately, and flow cytometry was performed to measure retention of rhodamine 123 and adriamycin in HepG2 and HepG2/MDR cells. Both cell lines were then incubated in suspension with adriamycin, vincristine, etoposide, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, respectively, and the MTT assay was used to determine cytotoxicity. The results showed that US exposure could significantly increase the uptake of Rh123 and ADM by HepG2/ADM tumor cells. The resistant index for the chemotherapeutic drugs was significantly lower in the US-exposed HepG2/ADM cells than in those not exposed to US. It was therefore concluded that US exposure could enhance the sensitivity of HepG2/ADM tumor cells to these chemotherapeutic agents, and the functional and structural changes induced by previous US exposure in MDR tumor cells may be responsible for it. However, further study is needed to investigate the mechanism behind US-mediated reversal of MDR.
