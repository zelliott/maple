Four new sesquiterpene lactones, (1 S,5 R,6 S,7 S,8 R,9 R,10 S,11 S)-6-acetoxy-9-hydroxy-4-oxo-pseudoguai-2(3)-en-12,8-olide, (1 S,2 R,5 R,6 S,7 R,8 S,10 R)-6-acetoxy-2-ethoxy-4-oxo-pseudoguai-11(13)-en-12,8-olide, (1 S,2 R,5 R,6 S,7 R,8 S,10 R)-6-acetoxy-2-hydroxy-4-oxo-pseudoguai-11(13)-en-12,8-olide, and 14-acetoxy-1 β,5 α,7 αH-4 β-hydroxy-guai-9(10),11(13)-dien-12,8 α-olide, along with 26 known sesquiterpene lactones, were isolated from the whole plants of Inula hookeri C. B. Clarke. Their structures were established based on spectroscopic methods including HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, and CD techniques. All compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against HepG2, HeLa, PC-3, and MGC-803 cell lines by CCK-8 assay. Some of the isolates, especiallly pseudoguaianolides and guaianolides, exhibited significant cytotoxicities against these four examined cell lines.
