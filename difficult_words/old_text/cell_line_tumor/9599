HSCO (hepatoma subtracted-cDNA library clone one, also called ETHE1) was originally identified by its frequent overexpression in hepatocellular carcinomas. HSCO inhibits function of NF-kappaB by binding to RelA and accelerating its export from the nucleus. We show here that HSCO exhibits anti-apoptotic activity in cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents by suppressing transcriptional activity of p53. Induction of pro-apoptotic genes, Noxa, Perp, PIG3, and Bax were suppressed in cells over-expressing HSCO. By increasing ubiquitylation and degradation of p53, HSCO reduces p53 protein levels. HSCO specifically associates with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) independently of Mdm2 and facilitates deacetylation of p53 at Lys-373/382 by HDAC1. The metallo-beta-lactamase family consensus sequence in HSCO is important for its effect on p53 deacetylation. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies suggested that HSCO, HDAC1, and p53 form a complex in the nucleus. Thus, HSCO is a cofactor that increases the deacetylase activity of HDAC1 toward p53, leading to suppression of apoptosis. Treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas that retain wild-type p53 and overexpress HSCO with anti-HSCO agents might re-establish the p53 response and revert chemoresistance.
