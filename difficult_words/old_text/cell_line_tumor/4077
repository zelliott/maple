To investigate the molecular mechanism of pancreatic cancer cell resistance to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor RAD001, and explore a feasible therapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance in patients with pancreatic cancer.

Western blotting was conducted to find out whether RAD001 induced c-Raf-ERK feedback activation and to identify whether RAD001 in combination with c-Raf inhibitor sorafenib could effectively block the feedback activation of c-Raf and downstream proteins. Sulphorhodamine B (SRB) colorimetric assay and colony formation were used to detect the effect of the combination treatment on cell growth and proliferation; finally, the effect on mouse subcutaneous xenografts was examined to confirm the efficacy of the combination treatment in vivo.

RAD001 effectively inhibited the expressions of mTORC1 and its downstream proteins, and induced the feedback activation of c-Raf. Whereas, RAD001 combined with c-Raf inhibitor sorafenib eliminated RAD001-induced activation of c-Raf-ERK pathway and reversed pancreatic cancer cell resistance to RAD001; compared with the RAD001 alone, sorafenib had a synergistical inhibitory effect with RAD001. And the tumor growth inhibitory effect of the combination was also proved in mouse subcutaneous xenografts in vivo.

RAD001-induced c-Raf-ERK feedback activation contributes to pancreatic cancer cell resistance to RAD001. Targeting of c-Raf may improve the therapeutic efficacy of RAD001 in patients with pancreatic cancer.
