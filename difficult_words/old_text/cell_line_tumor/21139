The x(c)(-) cystine transporter enhances biosynthesis of glutathione, a tripeptide thiol important in drug resistance and cellular defense against oxidative stress, by enabling cellular uptake of cystine, a rate-limiting precursor. Because it is known to regulate glutathione levels and growth of various cancer cell types, and is expressed in the pancreas, we postulate that it is involved in growth and drug resistance of pancreatic cancer. To examine this, we characterised expression of the x(c)(-) transporter in pancreatic cancer cell lines, MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1 and BxPC-3, as subjected to cystine-depletion and oxidative stress. The results indicate that these cell lines depend on x(c)(-)-mediated cystine uptake for growth, as well as survival in oxidative stress conditions, and can modulate x(c)(-) expression to accommodate growth needs. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the transporter was differentially expressed in normal pancreatic tissues and overexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissues from two patients. Furthermore, gemcitabine resistance of cells was associated with elevated x(c)(-) expression and specific x(c)(-) inhibition by monosodium glutamate led to growth arrest. The results suggest that the x(c)(-) transporter by enhancing glutathione biosynthesis plays a major role in pancreatic cancer growth, therapy resistance and represents a potential therapeutic target for the disease.
