Because channels of intracellular organelles are not directly accessible to the patch-clamp technique, the activity (open probability) of intracellular ion channels in intact cells has so far eluded direct examination. Here, we present strong evidence that the ratio F380/F440 of the quercetin-specific cellular fluorescence emitted at 540 nm upon excitation at 380/440 nm reflects the open probability of an endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release channel, the ryanodine receptor (RyR), in both intact and permeabilized Jurkat cells. The time course of the Ca(2+) release signal induced by high levels of quercetin in intact cells and that of F380/F440 were strongly correlated. The RyR specific inhibitor, ryanodine, the RyR type 3 and 1 but not type 2 specific inhibitor, dantrolene, as well as the non-specific RyR inhibitor, ruthenium red, depressed consistently the quercetin-induced Ca(2+) transient. Confocal microscopy confirmed that the dual fluorescent signal emitted by quercetin colocalizes with the endoplasmic reticulum, not the mitochondria. A novel regulatory mechanism was identified whereby RyR activity under physiological conditions is partially suppressed (hindered channel), whereas the channel becomes nearly fully activated after exposure to millimolar concentrations of bulk cytosolic Ca(2+) and subsequent chelation of Ca(2+) (rectified channel). Upon rectification, the dependence of F380/F440 on the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration was remarkably similar to that of the open probability of the RyR type 3, not 1 or 2, reported from bilayer experiments. So, quercetin appears to be a semi-specific fluorescent probe for the activity of ryanodine receptors, which in our Jurkat (clone E6.1) cell preparations probably reports the type 3 RyR activity.
