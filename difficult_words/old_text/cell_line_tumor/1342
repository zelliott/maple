Manipulation of alternative splicing is a unique way of regulating gene expression. Here, a detailed protocol is presented for modification of HER2 pre-mRNA alternative splicing. A 20-mer splice switching oligonucleotide (SSO) targeting exon 15 in HER2 pre-mRNA induced skipping of exon 15, resulted in significant downregulation of full-length HER2 mRNA and protein expression in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3.
