Malignant gliomas manifest frequent tumor recurrence after surgical resection and/or other treatment because of their nature of invasiveness and dissemination. The recognized brain tumor-tracking property of neural progenitor/stem cells opened the possibility of targeting malignant brain tumors using neural progenitor/stem cells. We and others have previously shown that fetal neural progenitor/stem cells can be used to deliver therapeutic molecules to brain tumors. Our recent work has further shown that gene delivery by bone marrow-derived neural progenitor/stem cells achieves therapeutic effects in a glioma model. In this study, we isolate and characterize bone marrow-derived neural progenitor/stem cells, which also express the chemokine receptor chemokine CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4). We show that CXCR4 is required for their chemotaxis and extracellular matrix invasion against a gradient of glioma soluble factors. Furthermore, beta-galactosidase-labeled bone marrow-derived neural progenitor/stem cells implanted in the contralateral side of the brain were shown to track gliomas as early as day 1 and increased through days 3 and 7. Intracranial glioma tracking by bone marrow-derived neural progenitor/stem cells is significantly inhibited by preincubation of bone marrow-derived neural progenitor/stem cells with a blocking anti-CXCR4 antibody, suggesting a CXCR4-dependent tracking mechanism. Glioma tracking bone marrow-derived neural progenitor/stem cells were found to express progenitor/stem cell markers, as well as CXCR4. Although bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays and proliferating antigen staining indicated that tumor tracking bone marrow-derived neural progenitor/stem cells were mostly nonproliferating, these cells survive in the local tumor environment with little apoptosis. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of brain tumor tracking by adult source stem cells may provide basis for the development of future targeted therapy for malignant brain tumors.
