Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors such as 3-aminobenzamide (3-ABA) enhance the in vitro cytotoxicity of DNA mono-functional alkylating agents such as radiation or chemotherapeutic agents. The aim of this study was to test an approach combining the PARP inhibitor 3-ABA with standard gemcitabine therapy in human pancreatic cancer cells.

Cell viability was determined by proliferation assay (XTT). Cell-cycle analysis (FACS), ELISA (M30 Apoptosense), Western blot for caspase 8 and PARP, and electron microscopy were used to identify apoptosis. Tumor growth and survival was assessed in nude mice by subcutaneously injected Capan-1 cells. In addition, Ki67 staining was performed on tumors for cell proliferation and in vivo apoptosis induction was measured by TUNEL assay and ELISA.

Combination therapy of gemcitabine and 3-ABA suppressed tumor cell growth more than gemcitabine alone in XTT, FACS and ELISA analysis.

This in vivo study demonstrated a significantly reduced tumor weight and increased survival up to 40 days after cell inoculation with combination therapy compared to animals treated with PBS, gemcitabine or 3-ABA alone. Furthermore, TUNEL assay revealed a significant apoptosis induction and reduced proliferation in the combination group.
