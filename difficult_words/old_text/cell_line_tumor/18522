The 6,11-dihydro-pyridazo[2,3-b]phenazine-6,11-dione and 6,11-dihydro-pyrido[2,3-b]phenazine-6,11-dione derivatives were synthesized from 6,7-dichloro-5,8-phthalazinedione and 6,7-dichloro-5,8-quinolinedione, respectively, producing a series of new anticancer drugs. The cytotoxic activities of the prepared compounds were evaluated by a SRB (Sulforhodamine B) assay against the following tumor cell lines: A459 (human lung), SK-OV-3 (human ovarian), SK-MEL-2 (human melanoma), XF498 (human CNS), and HCT 15 (human colon). Almost all the derivatives of the 6,11-dihydro-pyridazo[2[,3-b]phenazine-6,11-dione and 6,11-dihydro-pyrido[2,3-b]phenazine-6,11-dione, tetracyclic heteroquinone analogues with four or three nitrogen atoms, exhibited excellent cytotoxicity on almost all the human tumor cell lines tested. Specifically, 6,11-dihydro-pyridazo[2,3-b]phenazine-6,11-dione (4a) exhibited potent activity against all the tumor cell lines, and in particular, its cytotoxic effect against HCT 15 (ED(50)=0.004 microg/mL) was 25 times greater than that of doxorubicin (ED(50)=0.093 microg/mL).
