Histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) was recently shown to enhance proliferation and self-renewal of normal hematopoietic stem cells, raising the possibility that VPA may also support growth of leukemic progenitor cells (LPC). Here, VPA maintains a significantly higher proportion of CD34+ LPC and colony forming units compared to control cultures in six AML samples, but selectively reduces leukemic cell numbers in another AML sample with expression of AML1/ETO. Our data suggest a differential effect of VPA on the small population of AML progenitor cells and the bulk of aberrantly differentiated blasts in the majority of AML samples tested.
