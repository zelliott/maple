In the previous study, we found that Annexin A2 was significantly up-regulated in lung cancer and could induce related-antigen in lung cancer patients' serum. To further study the function of Annexin A2, the short hairpin RNA plasmid targeting Annexin A2 was constructed in vitro and transfected into human lung adencarcinoma A549 cells. Knocking down Annexin A2 expression by shRNA, the mRNA level of Annexin A2 was investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of Annexin A2 protein was examined by Western Blotting and Immuocytochemistry. MTT assay and Transwell chamber model were used to evaluate proliferation and invasion of A549 cells in vitro. The concentration of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and cathepsin B (CB) in the supernatant was evaluated by ELISA. At 48 h after transfection, the expression of Annexin A2 mRNA and protein was down-regulated significantly, respectively (p < 0.05).The proliferation and invasion capability of A549 cells also decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The concentration of MMP-2 and CB was down-regulated obviously, respectively (p < 0.05). This study implies that Annexin A2 might play an important role in the progression and invasion of human lung cancer cells, and could promote progression of lung cancer by regulating the expression of MMP-2 and CB.
