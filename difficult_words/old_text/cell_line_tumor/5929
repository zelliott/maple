RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionary conserved mechanism for specific gene silencing. There are currently numerous cancer therapy clinical trials based on RNAi technology. Using an adenoviral system as a delivery mediator of RNAi, we investigated the therapeutic effects of targeting three genes simultaneously in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we constructed an recombinant adenoviral shRNA expression system as Adv-pEGFP-shVEGF-shTERT-shBcl-xl for multi-genes silencing. Our results showed that the adenoviral vector can achieve above 90% of transfection efficiency and induced obvious apoptosis in CNE-2 cell both in vitro and in vivo compared with targeting the TERT alone or controlled group.
