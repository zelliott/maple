Poly (glycerol-sebacate) (PGS) is an elastomeric biodegradable polymer which possesses the ideal properties of drug carriers. In the present study, we prepared a series of PGS implants (5-FU-PGSs) loaded with different weight percent of 5-fluorouracil (2, 5, 7.5 and 10%). We studied the infrared spectrum properties, in vitro degradation and drug release, in vivo degradation and tissue biocompatibility of 5-FU-PGSs, in order to provide detailed information for the application of PGS as biodegradable drug carrier in cancer therapy. Macroscopically, all 5-FU-PGS wafers in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) kept their geometries during the degradation period of 30 days. The in vitro degradation rates of 5-FU-PGSs were accelerated when higher concentration of 5-FU was doped. Scanning electron microscopy observation showed that the surfaces of 5-FU-PGSs with higher concentration of 5-FU had irregular pits. The cumulative drug release profiles of 5-FU-PGSs exhibited a biphasic release with an initial burst release in the first day. After 7 days, almost 100% cumulative release of 5-FU was found for all 5-FU-PGSs.The degradation rate of 5-FU-PGSs in vivo was much quicker than that in vitro. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that no remarkable inflammations were observed in the tissue surrounding 5-FU-PGS implants, suggesting 5-FU-PGSs had good biocompatibility and no tissue toxicity. In vitro anti-tumor activity assay suggested that 5-FU-PGSs exhibited anti-tumor activity through sustained-release drug mode. These results demonstrate that PGS is a candidate of biodegradable drug carriers.
