Oxidative stress plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Nerve cells are incessantly exposed to environmental stresses leading to overproduction of some harmful species like reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS including hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion are potent inducers of various signaling pathways encompassing MAPKs and JAK-STAT pathways. In the current study, we scrutinized the effects of hydrogen peroxide and/or menadione (superoxide anion generator) on JNK/p38-MAPKs and JAK2-STAT3 pathways to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which each oxidant modulated the above-mentioned pathways leading to SK-N-MC cell death. Our results delineated that hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radical induced distinct responses as we showed that STAT3 and p38 were activated in response to hydrogen peroxide, but not superoxide anion radicals indicating the specificity in ROS-induced signaling pathways activations and behaviors. We also observed that menadione induced JNK-dependent p53 expression and apoptotic death in SK-N-MC cells while H2O2-induced JNK activation was p53 independent. Thus, we declare that ROS type has a key role in selective instigation of JNK/p38-MAPKs and JAK2-STAT3 pathways in SK-N-MC cells. Identifying these differential behaviors and mechanisms of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion functions illuminates the possible therapeutic targets in the prevention or treatment of ROS-induced neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
