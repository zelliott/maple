We sought to investigate the role and diagnostic value of microRNA 155 (miR-155) in OSCC patients.

Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, miR-155 expression levels were assessed in OSCC cell lines and a cancerous HB cell line. The correlation between miR-155 expression level and clinical parameters was analyzed in 46 patients with OSCC. In addition, the effects of miR-155 on OSCC cell proliferation were evaluated by modulating its expression using an miR-155 mimic and antisense miR-155.

Significant upregulation of miR-155 was found in OSCC cell lines and in tissues of patients with OSCC. The receiver operator characteristic analysis indicated fair-to-good predictability. Overexpression of miR-155 correlated with the histologic grade (P = .033), and the upregulation of miR-155 enhanced OSCC cell proliferation.

In OSSC, upregulation of miR-155 correlated with the histologic grade and can be used as a potential prognostic biomarker.
