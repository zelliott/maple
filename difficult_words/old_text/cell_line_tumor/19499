Chromatographic separation of the MeOH extract from the stems and rhizomes of Sinomemium acutum led to the isolation of nine alkaloids and a lignan. Their structures were determined to be dauriporphine (1), bianfugecine (2), dauriporphinoline (3), menisporphine (4), (-)-syringaresinol (5), N-feruloyltyramine (6), acutumine (7), dauricumine (8), sinomenine (9), and magnoflorine (10) by spectroscopic means. These compounds were examined for their P-gp mediated MDR reversal activity in human cancer cells. Compound 1 showed the most potent P-gp MDR inhibition activity with an ED50 value 0.03 microg/mL and 0.00010 microg/mL in the MES-SA/DX5 and HCT15 cells, respectively.
