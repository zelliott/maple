The oncogenic latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is involved in the pathogenesis of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and lymphoma. We and other authors have shown earlier that LMP1 induces apoptosis and inhibits xenograft tumor growth in mice, but the mechanism underlying these processes has not been investigated so far. In the present study, we show that knockdown of LMP1 renders the EBV-positive NPC cell line CG-1 resistant to various genotoxic drugs (cisplatin, etoposide, and adriamycin). LMP1 inhibits the expression of Cabin1, a Ca(2+) regulated protein shown earlier to inhibit calcineurin. Knockdown of calcineurin binding protein (Cabin1) with small hairpin RNA sensitizes CG-1 cells to genotoxic drugs. In contrast, LMP1 overexpression reduces Cabin1 level and renders both CG-1 cells and EBV-negative NPC cell lines sensitive to cisplatin. The c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and ERK pathways are required for LMP1-induced suppression of Cabin1 at the transcriptional level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further confirm that the JNK-activated transcription factor AP-1 mediates the LMP1-induced down-regulation of Cabin1 gene expression. LMP1 knockdown also increases the resistance of xenograph tumors to cisplatin in mice, therefore confirming the relevance of our findings in vivo. This study reveals the molecular mechanism underlying the pro-apoptotic activity of LMP1 during cisplatin-based NPC chemotherapy.
