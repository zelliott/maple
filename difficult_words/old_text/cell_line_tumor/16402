To explore the effects of nevirapine on the proliferation and expression of sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) mRNA in FRO cells in vitro.

The cells were incubated in different concentrations of nevirapine to evaluate the cell growth rate. And the expressions of NIS mRNA and TSHR mRNA were determined by real-time quantitative reverse polymerase chain reaction.

Cell proliferation was inhibited after a 96 h nevirapine treatment. After incubating in the presence of 200 and 350 µmol/L nevirapine, the expression of NIS mRNA was (1.39 ± 0.04) and (1.85 ± 0.28) times versus the control cells (P < 0.01) while the expressions of TSHR mRNA was (2.23 ± 1.47) and (2.83 ± 0.78) times versus the control cells respectively (both P < 0.05).

Nevirapine inhibits cell proliferation in FRO cell line. More importantly, the cells exposed to nevirapine may induce the up-regulations of NIS mRNA and TSHR mRNA.
