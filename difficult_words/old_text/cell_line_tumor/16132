CD-1 (cytoplasmic dynein-1) is a multisubunit motor protein complex involved in intracellular trafficking and mitosis. The dynein LIC (light intermediate chain) subunits, LIC1 (DLIC-1, gene symbol DYNC1LI1) and LIC2 (DLIC-2, gene symbol DYNC1LI2), associate with the dynein HC (heavy chain) in a mutually exclusive manner and thus define distinct functional CD-1 complexes. Here, we analysed the mitotic distribution of LIC1 and LIC2. We found that from metaphase through anaphase, LIC1 localizes to the mitotic spindle and concentrates within the midbody during the abscission step of cytokinesis. Conversely, LIC2 strongly localizes to the spindle poles from prophase through telophase. These data suggest distinct functions for LIC1 and LIC2-containing CD-1 complexes during cell division.
