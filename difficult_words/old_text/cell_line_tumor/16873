MicroRNAs are a class of small endogenous noncoding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional regulators. Tumor protein p53-induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1) is a p53 target gene and is a major player in the stress response. Here, we identified TP53INP1 as a target of miR-17-5p. miR-17-5p suppressed cell growth and promoted apoptosis of cervical cancer cells, whereas the effects of TP53INP1 were opposite, and ectopic expression of TP53INP1 counteracted the suppression of cell growth caused by miR-17-5p. The same correlations between miR-17-5p and TP53INP1 were observed in cervical cancer tissues. Together, these results indicated that miR-17-5p functions as a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer cells by targeting TP53INP1.
