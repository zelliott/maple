We determined the expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), PDGF-receptor (PDGF-R), and phosphorylated PDGF-R (p-PDGF-R) on tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells in clinical specimens of human ovarian carcinoma and human ovarian cancer cells growing in culture and in the peritoneal cavity of nude mice.

Ten specimens of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma were analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC was used to detect ligand and receptor expression in the human ovarian cancer cells from Hey A8 and SKOV3ip1 growing in culture. Cells from these lines were also implanted orthotopically into the peritoneal cavity of nude mice. IHC was used to determine ligand and receptor expression in tumors that formed in the peritoneal cavity.

All 10 evaluable samples expressed both PDGF AA and BB on tumor cells. Tumor cells were positive for PDGF-Ralpha in 10/10 samples, PDGF-Rbeta in 8/10 samples, p-PDGF-Ralpha in 6/10 samples, and p-PDGF-Rbeta in 4/10 samples. p-PDGF-Ralpha was positive in 4/10 tumor-associated endothelial cell samples and p-PDGF-Rbeta was positive in 3/10 samples. Human ovarian cancer cells expressed PDGF, PDGF-R, and p-PDGF-R when growing in culture or in the peritoneal cavity of nude mice. PDGF-R and p-PDGF-R were also present on tumor-associated endothelial cells as demonstrated by simultaneous staining with CD31 antibody.

PDGF and the corresponding receptors were expressed in autochthonous human ovarian cancer lesions on both tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells. The ligand and receptor were also present on Hey A8 and SKOV3ip1 human ovarian cancer cells growing in vitro and in the peritoneal cavity of nude mice.
