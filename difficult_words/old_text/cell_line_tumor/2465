Human Parathyroid hormone 1-34 (PTH1-34) loaded chitosan nanoparticles (PTH 1-34 chitosan nanoparticles) via simple ionic gelation technique were prepared which can improve the bioavailability and half-life of the peptide. Chitosan nanoparticles and PTH 1-34 chitosan nanoparticles were synthesised and characterized by DLS, SEM, AFM, FT-IR and TG/DTA. Chitosan nanoparticles (40-60 nm) and PTH 1-34 chitosan nanoparticles (60-80 nm) with zeta potential of +60 and +40 mV respectively were subjected to haemolysis assay and tested for agglomeration in blood. MTT and LDH was performed assay using Saos-2, UMR 106, L929, NIH3T3. The in vitro peptide release profile at pH 7.5 for 144 h was quantified using PTH 1-34 ELISA Kit. Effect of released PTH 1-34 on Saos-2 was determined with ALP and BCA assay. These preliminary results pave way for the prospective use of such a carrier for the delivery of PTH 1-34 by multiple routes for the benefit of patients undergoing treatment for osteoporosis.
