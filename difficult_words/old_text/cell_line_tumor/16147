Two new abietane diterpenoids, ramentoxide (1) and ramentoxidone (2) and a new icetexane diterpenoid, amentonone (3) were isolated from the barks of Amentotaxus formosana. The structures of 1-3 were determined by spectroscopic methods. Known compounds brevitaxin (4), and (+)-ferruginol (5) and ent-kaur-16-en-15-one (6) isolated from this plant revealed potent cytotoxic activity against human breast adenocarcinoma cells, MCF-7 cells with an IC(50) value of 0.08 ± 0.05 μg/mL, and significant anti-inflammatory activities, respectively.
