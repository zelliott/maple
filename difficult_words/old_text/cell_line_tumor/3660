Early studies of the inhibitor of growth 1 ( ING1) gene, the founding member of the ING tumor suppressor family, demonstrated that this gene plays an important role in apoptosis and cellular senescence. Four other related genes have since been identified and found to be involved in various biological activities, including cell cycle arrest, regulation of gene transcription, DNA repair and apoptosis. The biochemical functions of ING proteins as histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylase co-factors ties this new tumor suppressor family to the regulation of transcription, cell cycle check-points, DNA repair and apoptosis. This review is aimed at summarizing the known biological functions of the ING tumor suppressors and the signalling pathways that they involve.
