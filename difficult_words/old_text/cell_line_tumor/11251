Owing to the convenience and minimal invasiveness, phototherapy, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), is emerging as a powerful technique for cancer treatment. To date, however, few examples of combination PDT and PTT have been reported. Phthalocyanine (Pc) is a class of traditional photosensitizer for PDT, but its bioapplication is limited by high hydrophobicity. In this present study, hollow silica nanospheres (HSNs) were employed to endow the hydrophobic phthalocyanine with water-dispersity, and the as-prepared hollow silica nanoparticles loaded with hydrophobic phthalocyanine (Pc@HSNs) exhibits highly efficient dual PDT and PTT effects. In vitro and in vivo experimental results clearly indicated that the dual phototherapeutic effect of Pc@HSNs can kill cancer cells or eradicate tumor tissues. This multifunctional nanomedicine may be useful for PTT/PDT treatment of cancer.
