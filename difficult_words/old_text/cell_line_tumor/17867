The presence of TASK-3 channels has been described in a number of healthy and malignantly transformed cells, showing mainly intracellular distribution with relatively insignificant labelling of the cell surface membrane. In this work, immunochemical and molecular biology methods were utilised to establish the intracellular organelle whose TASK-3 expression accounts for this strong intracellular labelling using cultured melanoma and HaCaT cells. Before the immunocytochemical experiments, the presence of TASK-3 mRNA was also confirmed in melanoma cells. Comparison of the results of the TASK-3- and mitochondrion-specific labelling indicated that the TASK-3 channel subunits were strongly expressed by mitochondria in both investigated cell types. Moreover, prominent TASK-3 expression of keratinocytes could also be demonstrated in histological sections excised from the human skin. These results indicate that TASK-3 channels are present in the mitochondria in both malignantly transformed and healthy cells, suggesting that they might have roles in ensuring mitochondrial functions.
