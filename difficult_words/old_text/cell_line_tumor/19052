Although imatinib mesylate (IM) has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), some patients develop resistance with progression of leukemia. Alternative or additional targeting of signaling pathways deregulated in bcr-abl-driven CML cells may provide a feasible option for improving clinical response and overcoming resistance. In this study, we show that carboxyamidotriazole (CAI), an orally bioavailable calcium influx and signal transduction inhibitor, is equally effective in inhibiting the proliferation and bcr-abl dependent- and independent-signaling pathways in imatinib-resistant CML cells. CAI inhibits phosphorylation of cellular proteins including STAT5 and CrkL at concentrations that induce apoptosis in IM-resistant CML cells. The combination of imatinib and CAI also down-regulated bcr-abl protein levels. Since CAI is already available for clinical use, these results suggest that it may be an effective addition to the armamentarium of drugs for the treatment of CML.
