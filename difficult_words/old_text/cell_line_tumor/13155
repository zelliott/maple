Suppression of human tumor cell resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in confluent cultures, using molecular target drugs (sorafenib and SAHA) at non-toxic concentrations was studied. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, and SAHA, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, effectively suppressed resistance of confluent human cells derived from the skin carcinoma (A431 cell line) and fibrosarcoma (HT-1080 cell line). The effectiveness of suppression of confluent resistance with these inhibitors for human carcinoma A431 cells was significantly higher than that for the human ovarian carcinoma OVCAR-3 cells. For all cell lines studied, suppression of confluent resistance with SAHA was more effective than when sorafenib was used. The possible reason for increasing tumor cell resistance in confluent cultures and the importance of this phenomenon for understanding drug resistance of cells in the tumor tissue are discussed.
