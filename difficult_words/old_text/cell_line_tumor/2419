The preparation of steroidal[17,16-d][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines and their biological evaluation as potential anticancer agents are herein reported. These novel heterosteroids (2, 4) were prepared through the condensation reaction of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole with 16-arylidene-17-ketosteroids (1, 3). All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anticancer activity in vitro against PC-3 (human prostatic carcinoma), MCF-7 (human breast carcinoma) and EC9706 (human esophageal carcinoma) cell lines. Among the screened compounds, 2i, 2n and 4f showed significant inhibitory activity against all the three human cell lines.
