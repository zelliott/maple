To evaluate the effects of selective and non-selective cyclooxygenase-2 on the growth and apoptosis of colon cancer cell lines in vitro.

The proliferation of colon cancer cells was determined by MTT assay, and the cell cycle progression was analyzed by flow cytometric assay. Annexin V/PI staining in combination with flow cytometric assay was used to detect apoptosis induced by NSAIDs.

It was found that celecoxib, meloxicam and aspirin could inhibit the growth of HT-29 or SW480 cell and showed a concentration dependent pattern. COX-2 protein was expressed in HT-29 and LS174-T, but not in SW480 cells. In addition, PCNA levels in both HT-29 cell and SW480 cells were reduced by aspirin and celecoxib. Both aspirin (10 mmol/ L) and celecoxib (50 micromol/L) induced apoptosis of HT-29 and SW480 colon cancer cells, the apoptosis rates were 4.8%, 17.7% and 5.1%, 20.4% respectively.

Both COX-2 selective and non-selective inhibitors can potentially inhibit the growth of colon cell lines and such inhibitory effect on COX-2 negative colon cancer cells is also evident.
