Gastric cancer remains a worldwide burden as the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Drug resistance of chemotherapy looms as a major clinical obstacle to successful treatment. Recent evidence indicated that miRNA-200c can restore the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to cisplatin and cetuximab. The expression of miRNA-200c and RhoE were investigated in gastric cancer tissues and cells (SGC7901 and SGC7901/DDP) by qRT-PCR. A luciferase reporter assay was done to understand the potential correlation between miRNA-200c and RhoE. Pre-miR-200c was transfected in SGC7901/DDP cells to confirm whether miRNA-200c could regulate RhoE expression. RhoE was knocked down to explore the role of RhoE on sensitivity of chemotherapy in gastric cancer by MTT. Western blot analysis was performed to further explore the mechanism of RhoE in regulating drug resistance. The results showed that miRNA-200c was significantly lower in cancerous tissues than those in the paired normal tissues, whereas the expression of RhoE was just the opposite. The significant difference of miRNA-200c and RhoE were observed between SGC7901 cells and SGC7901/DDP cells. miRNA-200c has target sites in the 3'-UTR of RhoE mRNA by luciferase reporter assay. Transfection of pre-miR-200c reduces RhoE expression. Meanwhile, the knockdown of RhoE enhanced the sensitivity of SGC7901/DDP cells and changed expression of some genes. These suggested that miRNA-200c regulated the sensitivity of chemotherapy to cisplatin (DDP) in gastric cancer by possibly targeting RhoE.
