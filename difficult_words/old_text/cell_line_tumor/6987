In human MG63 osteosarcoma cells, the effect of flurbiprofen on intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) and proliferation was explored. The proliferation was enhanced by 20-120 microM flurbiprofen, and was decreased by 140-200 microM flurbiprofen. The effect of flurbiprofen on the increases in cytosolic free Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) induced by ATP, bradykinin, histamine and thapsigargin (an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase), was examined. In cell preincubated with 20 or 80 microM flurbiprofen, the [Ca(2+)](i) increases induced by all agonists were attenuated. In the presence of 20 microM flurbiprofen, the decreased [Ca(2+)](i) responses with the agonists were attributed to a defective Ca(2+) influx because this decrease was unobserved in agonists-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increases in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+). In the presence of 80 microM flurbiprofen, both the Ca(2+) influx component and the Ca(2+) releasing (from organelles) component were defective. These results suggest that flurbiprofen could alter proliferation and inhibit [Ca(2+)](i) increases.
