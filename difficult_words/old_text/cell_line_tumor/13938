We investigated the effects of 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one, isolated from the medicinal plant Ailanthus altissima Swingle, on apoptosis in human leukemia (Jurkat), thyroid carcinoma (ARO and NPA), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HuH7) cell lines. Cultures incubated with the compound showed >50% of sub-G1 (hypodiploid) elements in flow cytometry analysis; the apoptosis-inducing activity was evident at <10 micromol/L and half-maximal at about 40 micromol/L 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one. The appearance of hypodiploid elements was preceded by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, and Smac/DIABLO and procaspase-3 cleavage. We subsequently investigated the effect of 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one in combination with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in the four cell lines. Suboptimal concentrations (10 micromol/L 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one and 0.25 ng/mL TRAIL, respectively) of the two agents, unable to elicit apoptosis when used alone, induced mitochondrial depolarization, activation of caspase-3, and 45% to 85% of sub-G1 elements when added together to the cells. The synergism seemed to rely partly on the enhanced expression of TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1; DR4), analyzed by immunofluorescence, by 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one. Cell incubation with 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one resulted in activating c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), as revealed by Western blotting; induction of apoptosis and TRAIL-R1 up-regulation by 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one were >80% prevented by the addition of the JNK inhibitor (JNKI) SP600125JNKI, indicating that both effects were almost completely mediated by JNK activity. On the other hand, synergism with TRAIL was reduced by about 50%, suggesting that besides up-regulating TRAIL-R1, 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one could influence other factor(s) that participated in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one can represent a candidate for in vivo studies of monotherapies or combined antineoplastic therapies.
