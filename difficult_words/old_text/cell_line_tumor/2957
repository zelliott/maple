The first total synthesis of 9-membered macrolide, stagonolide-F (3), starting from commercially available 1,5-pentane diol is reported. A combination of Jacobsen's hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) and Sharpless epoxidation is used for the creation of two stereogenic centers, while ring-closing metathesis (RCM) strategy was used for the construction of the lactone ring. The molecule synthesized exhibited potent antifungal, antibacterial and cytotoxic activities against all the tested strains.
