Prostate cancer cells produce a large amount of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is widely used as a marker for this cancer. Even though it is widely used in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, many aspects of the pathophysiologic role of PSA in bone metastasis remain obscure. The receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) is essential for the activation of osteoclasts, while osteoprotegerin (OPG) neutralizes the action of RANKL. Various substances that act on bone have been shown to modulate the production of RANKL and OPG by osteoblasts.

In this study, we investigated the effect of PSA on the expression of OPG and RANKL mRNA and on protein production in human osteoblast-like cells.

After addition of PSA and culture for 72 h, OPG mRNA expression and protein secretion by MG-63 and SaOS-2 cells showed a concentration-dependent increase. When osteoblasts were incubated with PSA (100 ng/ml), OPG mRNA expression and protein secretion increased with the passage of time. alpha1 -antichymotrypsin (ACT), which inactivates the serine protease activity of PSA, inhibited the increase of OPG mRNA expression and protein production in response to PSA, and this effect of PSA was also inhibited by anti-transforming growth factor-beta antibody.

Based on our findings, PSA acts on human osteoblast-like cells via its own serine protease activity and promotes osteoblast differentiation. In addition, PSA stimulates OPG production and inhibits RANKL expression of osteoblasts, and inhibits bone resorption by osteoclasts, suggesting that it contributes to the characteristic osteoblastic features of bone metastases of prostate cancer.
