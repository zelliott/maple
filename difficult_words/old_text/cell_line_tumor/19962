Food components influence the physiology by modulating gene expression and biochemical pathways within the human body. The disease-preventive roles of several fruit and vegetable components have been related to such properties. Polyphenolic components such as flavonoids are strong antioxidants and induce the expression of several xenobiotic-detoxifying enzymes. The mechanism of selective cytotoxicity induced by red grape wine polyphenols against MCF-7 breast cancer cells was investigated in relation to their interference with calcium homeostasis. MCF-7 cells showed an increase in cytosolic calcium levels within 10 min of treatment with the polyphenols. Immunohistochemical localization of calmodulin with secondary gold-labeled antibodies showed similar levels of gold labeling in both MCF-7 cells and the spontaneously immortalized, normal MCF-10A cell line. MCF-7 cells treated with the red wine polyphenol fraction (RWPF) showed swelling of endoplasmic reticulum, dissolution of the nucleus, and loss of plasma membrane integrity as well as reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. These cells were arrested at the G2/M interphase. By contrast, MCF-10A cells did not show such changes after RWPF treatment. The results suggest that polyphenol-induced calcium release may disrupt mitochondrial function and cause membrane damage, resulting in selective cytotoxicity toward MCF-7 cells. This property could further be developed toward breast cancer prevention strategies either independently or in conjunction with conventional prevention therapies where a positive drug-nutrient interaction can be demonstrated.
