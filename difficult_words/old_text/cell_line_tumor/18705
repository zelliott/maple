Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) may be useful as biomarkers of joint disease or inflammation. However, activity of both MMPs and TNF-alpha in synovial fluid (SF) may be influenced by nonpathological factors such as arthrocentesis or exercise.

To investigate the influence of repeated arthrocentesis and exercise on MMP and TNF-alpha activities in SF from normal equine joints.

SF was collected from the left metacarpophalangeal, radiocarpal and tarsocrural joints of 16 horses. Eight of these horses were subsequently subjected to an exercise programme on a treadmill and 8 were box-rested as controls. Arthrocentesis was repeated 14, 145, 17 and 24 days after the start of the exercise programme. General MMP and TNF-alpha activities were determined in SF.

Repeated arthrocentesis caused a gradual increase but the exercise regimen no significant increase in MMP activity. There was a significant increase in TNF-alpha activity in SF collected from horses 2 h after cessation of the exercise programme.

When using MMPs as biomarkers for joint disease, at least 14 days should elapse after previous arthrocentesis before subsequent SF collection. Moderate exercise does not increase MMP activity in SF from normal joints and it may be possible to ignore this as a source of error in evaluating MMP activity in diseased joints.
