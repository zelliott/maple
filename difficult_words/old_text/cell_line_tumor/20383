The anticancer activities of alkyl esters and NO-donors of ferulic acid (FA) and caffeic acid (CA) were assessed by a high-throughout screening (HTS) method, and the structure-activity relationships were described. CA alkyl esters had better anticancer activities than FA alkyl esters with the same alkyl substituent. Mono-nitrates and phenylfuroxan nitrates were more potent than the dual nitrates. Phenylsulfonylfuroxan nitrates of FA, especially compounds 8b-8d, exhibited more potent activities in anticancer.
