A facile green chemistry approach for the synthesis of sub-5 nm silver and gold nanoparticles is reported. The synthesis was achieved by a photochemical method using tyrosine as the photoreducing agent. The size of the gold and silver nanoparticles was about 3 and 4 nm, respectively. The nanoparticles were characterized using x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Both silver and gold nanoparticles synthesized by this method exhibited fluorescence properties and their use for cell imaging applications has been demonstrated.
