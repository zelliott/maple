Neuropilins (NRP) are receptors of angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Their overexpression was correlated with tumor angiogenesis and growth suggesting that their specific targeting could provide a new marker of tumor progression. Here, we observed in vitro that new (99m)Tc-labeled derivative of anti-VEGF heptapeptide, ATWLPPR, binds to NRP1 but not to NRP2. Our radiotracer is stable up to 24 h in human serum and in cysteine challenge. But, its too low affinity and too fast extraction indicate further improvement to give a successful imaging of tumor in vivo.
