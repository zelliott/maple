This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of graded concentrations (10(-8), 10(-7) and 10(-6) M) of progesterone receptor (PR) modulator CDB-2914 on the protein contents of PR, of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), adrenomedullin (ADM) and their receptors in cultured human uterine leiomyoma and matching myometrial cells.

PR-A, PR-B, VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, ADM and ADM receptor (ADMR) contents were assessed by Western blot analysis.

Treatment with 100 ng/ml progesterone increased VEGF-A, VEGF-B and ADM contents in cultured leiomyoma cells and normal myometrial cells. The concomitant treatment with 10(-6) M CDB-2914 significantly decreased the progesterone-induced VEGF-A, VEGF-B and ADM contents in cultured leiomyoma cells but not in normal myometrial cells. CDB-2914 treatment alone decreased VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and ADMR contents in cultured leiomyoma cells but not in normal myometrial cells. CDB-2914 treatment increased PR-A and decreased PR-B contents in cultured leiomyoma cells in a dose-dependent manner compared with untreated cultures, whereas no significant changes in PR isoform contents were observed in normal myometrial cells.

These results suggest that CDB-2914 down-regulates VEGF, ADM and their receptor contents and modulates PR isoform contents in cultured leiomyoma cells in a cell-type-specific manner.
