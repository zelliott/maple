1-(3-C-ethynyl-beta-D-ribo-pentofuranosyl)cytosine (ECyd, TAS-106), is a new antitumor cytidine analogue, inhibiting RNA synthesis. In this study we investigated the cellular growth inhibition, intracellular metabolism, cell cycle phase specificity, and RNA synthesis of TAS-106 compared with those of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), known to possess both DNA- (inhibition of thymidylate synthase activity) and RNA-synthesis-inhibiting activity (inhibition of RNA function). The IC50 values of TAS-106 and 5-FU ranged from 0.0173 to 3.11 microM, and from 6.80 to >1,000 microM, respectively, in a panel of 10 human tumor cells, indicating that TAS-106 possesses greater cytotoxicity than 5-FU. Using excess thymidine-synchronized cells, TAS-106 and 5-FU appeared to exert their cytotoxic effects independently of the cell cycle. The intracellular metabolism and the effect on pre-rRNA processing of TAS-106 differed from those of 5-FU. More than 50% of 5-FU incorporated into the cells was in the unchanged form, while 5-FU incorporated into RNA was approximately 20%. On the other hand, TAS-106 was incorporated in a time-dependent manner into the cells and rapidly converted to its mono-, di- and tri-phosphate form, however, the amount incorporated into RNA fraction was very small. 5-FU incorporated into RNA was confirmed to impair the normal processing of ribosomal RNA (formation of 34/32S RNA from 45S RNA), however, TAS-106 did not affect pre-rRNA processing and may be involved in the inhibition of the synthesis of ribosomal RNA. We concluded that intracellular accumulation and retention of the active metabolite of TAS-106, 3'-ethynylcytidine 5'-triphosphate (ECTP), may contribute to its potent cytotoxicity. The unique mechanism of antitumor activity and intensive cellular metabolism of TAS-106 could contribute to cancer chemotherapy through the pathways different from those of 5-FU or other antitumor nucleosides.
