Estrogen-stimulated growth of the malignant human endometrium can be balanced by the differentiating properties of progesterone. To study the molecular basis behind this, gene expression profiling was performed using complementary DNA microarray analysis. In this study, the human endometrial cancer cell lines ECC-1 and PRAB-36 were used as models. The ECC-1 cell line, which expresses high levels of estrogen receptor alpha and is stimulated in growth by estrogens, was used to study estrogen regulation of gene expression. The Ishikawa sub-cell line PRAB-36, expressing both PRA and PRB, progesterone receptor isoforms, and inhibited in growth by progestagens, was used to study progesterone regulation of gene expression. Using these two well-differentiated human endometrial cancer cell lines, 148 estrogen- and 148 progesterone-regulated genes were identified. After functional classification, the estrogen- and progesterone-regulated genes could be categorized in different biologically relevant groups. Within the group of "cell growth and/or maintenance," 81 genes were clustered, from which a number of genes could be involved in arranging the cross talk that exists between estrogen and progesterone signaling. On the basis of analysis of the current findings, it is hypothesized that cross talk between estrogen and progestagen signaling does not occur by counterregulation of single genes, but rather at the level of differential regulation of different genes within the same functional families.
