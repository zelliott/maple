Four novel iridium(III) complexes with enantiopure C2-symmetrical vicinal diamine ligands were designed, synthesized, and characterized by FT-IR, NMR, and MS. The cytotoxicities of all of the complexes against the human solid tumor cell lines A2780, A549, KB, and MDA-MB-231 were evaluated. Both R,R-configured complexes (R,R)-5a and (R,R)-5b exhibited more potent or similar activity compared with oxaliplatin, whereas their corresponding (S,S)-isomers (S,S)-5a and (S,S)-5b were found to be mostly inactive. As indicated by the activation of caspase-3, the cleavage of PARP, and the upregulation of p53, the preliminary mechanism studies revealed that the mode of cell death initiated by (R,R)-5a in A2780 cells was predominantly p53-mediated apoptosis. In addition, the structure of (R,R)-5a was unambiguously confirmed through single crystal X-ray structure determination.
