Recognition of viral nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors initiates type I IFN induction and innate antiviral immune response. Here we show that LSm14A, a member of the LSm family involved in RNA processing in the processing bodies, binds to synthetic or viral RNA and DNA and mediates IRF3 activation and IFN-β induction. Knockdown of LSm14A inhibits cytosolic RNA- and DNA-trigger type I IFN production and cellular antiviral response. Moreover, LSm14A is essential for early-phase induction of IFN-β after either RNA or DNA virus infection. We further found that LSm14A-mediated IFN-β induction requires RIG-I-VISA or MITA after RNA or DNA virus infection, respectively, and viral infection causes translocation of LSm14A to peroxisomes, where RIG-I, VISA, and MITA are located. These findings suggest that LSm14A is a sensor for both viral RNA and DNA and plays an important role in initiating IFN-β induction in the early phase of viral infection.
