Two monoterpene glycosides, conjugated with gallic acid [globulusin A (1) and B (2)], together with four known compounds, cypellocarpin A (3), eucaglobulin (4), cuniloside (5) and (1S, 2S, 4R)-trans-2-hydroxy-1,8-cineole beta-d-glucopyranoside (6), were isolated from hot-water extracts of the leaves of Eucalyptus globulus. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were determined by 1D, 2D NMR and MS spectroscopic analyses. The absolute stereochemistry of 1 was determined by correlating the spectroscopic data with those of synthetic compound 6 with a known configuration. Globulusin A (1) and B (2), cypellocarpin A (3) and eucaglobulin (4), scavenged DPPH free radicals and globulusin A (1) showed a higher antioxidant activity than the other tested compounds, with an IC50 of 3.8microM. Globulusin A (1) and eucaglobulin (4) concentration-dependently suppressed inflammatory cytokine production, tumor-necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta in cultured human myeloma THP-1 cells co-stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate. These compounds also inhibited melanogenesis in cultured murine melanoma B16F1 cells, without any significant cytotoxicity. These results suggested that globulusin A (1) and eucaglobulin (4), which were isolated as antioxidants from E. globulus, also had anti-inflammatory as well as anti-melanogenesis activity.
