Dimethyl sulfoxide porous silicon (DMSO-PSi) colloid in which DMSO was used as a surfactant suitable for inhibiting the agglomeration of PSi nanoparticles was prepared for use in cancer photothermotherapy. The photothermal effect of the DMSO-PSi colloid was found to be high enough to destroy cancer cells (T = ∼52 °C). The mean particle size of the PSi nanoparticles in the DMSO-PSi colloid was 67 nm, which is low enough to flow through blood vessels without causing a blockage. The DMSO-PSi colloid in combination with an NIR laser resulted in a cell viability of 5.70%, which is a sufficiently high cytotoxic effect.
