Antibody microarrays have been successfully used to determine relative abundance of key proteins in various cancers and other diseases. We have previously showed liver metastatic-related genes between the metastatic pancreatic cancer line (SW1990HM) and its parental line (SW1990). In this study, we searched for potential markers for metastatic progression using antibody microarrays. The SpringBio Antibody Microarrays were used to analysis the different proteomes between SW1990HM and SW1990 cells. A standard â‰¥2.0-fold cutoff value was used to determine differentially expressed proteins and Western blotting analysis further confirmed the results. Antibody microarrays revealed that 40 proteins were reproducibly altered more than 2-fold between the selected variant and its parental counterpart; 14 of the proteins were up-regulated, and 26 were down-regulated. Most of the up-regulated proteins (7/14) play a role in tumor signal transduction, while a number of down-regulated proteins (10/26) function in cell differentiation; this might be crucial for pancreatic cancer metastasis. Four dysregulated proteins were validated by western blotting in the cell lines. Interestingly, the up-regulation of Glucagon and down-regulation of Prolactin were further confirmed in the culture supernatants by western blotting. These proteomic data are valuable for understanding pancreatic cancer metastasis and searching for potential markers of metastatic progression.
