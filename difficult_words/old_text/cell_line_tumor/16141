Condensation of 3-N,N-diethylaminophenol (1) with α-cyanocinnamonitriles (2a-c) and ethyl α-cyanocinnamates (2d-f) provided compounds 3a-f and 4a-c. 12H-Chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives 6, 11-13 and 16 were obtained by treatment of 4H-chromene compounds (3) with different electrophiles followed by nucleophilic reagents. Structures of these compounds were established on the basis of IR, UV, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS data. Some of the new compounds were evaluated for antimicrobial and cytotoxicity activities.
