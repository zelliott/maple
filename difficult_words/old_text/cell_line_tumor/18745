Double staining flow cytometry was performed using 7-amino actinomycin D and 6-carboxy-2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, to detect the level fluctuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the cell cycle of normal NB4 cells. Our results showed that NB4 cells possessed higher level of ROS in G2/M phase than in G1 and S phases. Double staining flow cytometry, with TdT mediated dUTP nick end labeling (Tunel) and propidium iodide (PI), indicated that As2O3 (2 microM) could induce apoptosis in NB4 cells prevailingly from G2/M phase, and this efficacy was enhanced upon co-administration of 2, 3-dimethoxy-1, 4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ) (2.5 microM) which could produce the endogenous ROS. These results suggested that different ROS level in different cell cycle phases of NB4 cells might determine the selective induction of G2/M apoptosis and the cells' susceptibility to apoptosis by As2O3.
