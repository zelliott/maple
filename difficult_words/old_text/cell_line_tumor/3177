It is well known that heavy oil pollution results in various negative impacts on the marine environment. Although there is a low possibility of direct exposure to heavy oil, the chemical substances contained in heavy oil may be released into the environment and accumulated by marine organisms which in turn can be taken by humans via the food chain. In this study, we examined the biological risk of heavy oil extract using the common mouse, whose genetic backgrounds and immune system are well known and relatively homologous to humans. Water-soluble fraction (WSF) was extracted from heavy oil with water and the extract orally administrated to female or male mice for 7 days. In the WSF administrated group, cystoma-like formation was observed in the ovary in approximately 80% of female mice. On the other hand, we found that the prostate gland size in male mice was markedly reduced in comparison with male control mice. Continuous administration of WSF for 28 days resulted in continued hypertrophy of the cystoma around the ovary and atrophy in the prostate gland. In addition, it was revealed that chemical substances within WSF have estrogenic activity. A major component of heavy oil, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is known to present estrogenic activity. It is likely that the cystoma-like formation in female mice and atrophy of prostate gland in male resulted of estrogenic substances present in the WSF which might be the PAHs.
