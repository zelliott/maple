ZD6126 is a novel vascular-targeting agent that selectively disrupts the tubulin cytoskeleton of endothelial cells. In the immature vessels characteristic of tumor vasculature, this leads to endothelial cell contraction, blood vessel congestion, and, consequently, tumor cell death. ZD6126 has been shown to delay tumor growth in a range of xenograft models. The antitumor effect of ZD6126 can be increased in combination with cisplatin or radiation therapy, although the precise mechanism of this enhancement has not been demonstrated. ZD6126 treatment has also been shown to inhibit lung metastasis, and the present study has explored the potential to increase the antimetastatic effect of ZD6126 by combining with cisplatin, and the underlining mechanism has been investigated.

Human lung adenocarcinoma PC14PE6 cells were injected into the tail vein of nude mice. Five weeks after injection animals were treated with ZD6126 (200 mg/kg i.p.), cisplatin (6 mg/kg i.v.), or a combination of the two agents. The animals were sacrificed 24 hours later, and the extent of lung metastases and the presence of apoptotic cells were assessed.

Histologic analysis revealed that the ZD6126/cisplatin combination resulted in a 2 to 4-fold increase in the total number of tumor-associated apoptotic cells compared with either treatment alone. ZD6126 alone induced apoptosis of tumor-associated endothelial cells in tumors, and the extent of apoptosis was increased 2-fold in combination with cisplatin. The lung weight was significantly reduced, and the number of metastatic nodules significantly was lower in the combined treatment group than in the control group.

These data suggest that the antimetastatic effect of the vascular-targeting agent ZD6126 can be increased by use in combination with cisplatin, which increases the incidence of endothelial cell apoptosis.
