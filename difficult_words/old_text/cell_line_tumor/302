An improved method, which exhibited simultaneously clearly kinetochores and the nucleolar organizer regions of human chromosomes by pretreating of human metaphase chromosomes with HCl and NaOH, followed by staining with silver nitrate and visualizing using ammoniacal silver, is described in the present communication. It has important role for analysis of kinetochore variation, mechanism of chromosomal non-disjunction as well as identification of fuctional active centromeres.
