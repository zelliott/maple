Factor VIIa (FVIIa), a trypsin-like serine protease, plays an essential role in haemostasis by initiating the coagulation in complex with its cofactor, tissue factor (TF). The TF pathway inhibitor is the main physiological inhibitor of FVIIa-TF complex, but FVIIa can also be inhibited by antithrombin, although little is known about this process. Functional analyses by second order kinetic determination and identification of FVIIa-antithrombin complex by electrophoresis, evaluating the effect of different cofactors: pentasaccharide, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH), confirmed that any activation of antithrombin significantly enhanced the inhibition of FVIIa. The analysis of the binding of FVIIa to heparin by surface plasmon resonance identified a high affinity interaction under physiologic conditions (K(D)=3.38 Î¼M, with 0.15M of ionic strength) strongly dependent on Ca(2+) and ionic strength. This interaction was verified in cell models, indicating that FVIIa also binds to the surface of endothelial cells with similar requirements. Structural modeling suggests the presence of a potential exosite II in FVIIa. However, the binding of heparin did not display significant changes on both the intrinsic fluorescence and the associated functional consequences of FVIIa. These results indicate that FVIIa binds to exposed glycosaminglycans of the endothelium through an exosite II, structurally similar to that reported for thrombin and suggested for FIXa. This binding may favor its inhibition by antithrombin in the absence of TF, contributing to the physiological control of this protease. This process may also play an important role in the clearance of recombinant FVIIa administered to patients.
