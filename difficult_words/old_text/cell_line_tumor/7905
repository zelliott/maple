Avian reoviruses (ARVs) are pathogens that cause significant morbidity among commercial poultry. ARVs are prototypic representatives of non-enveloped viruses that can cause cell-cell fusion. They belong to the Reoviridae family, which contains many highly pathogenic viruses. ARVs are ubiquitous in commercial poultry and are frequently isolated from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts of chickens with acute infections. The virus causes a range of disease states in chicken, including viral arthritis/tenosynovitis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, myocarditis, "pale bird syndrome," runting-stunting syndrome, and respiratory illness. This unit describes avian reovirus propagation, quantification, and storage.
