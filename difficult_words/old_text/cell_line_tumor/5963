The biotransformation of 2α,5α,10β-triacetoxy-14-oxo-taxa-4(20),11-diene (1) by cultured Gingko cells afforded four products. Their structures were identified on the basis of analyses of the chemical and spectroscopic (IR, MS, ¹H- and ¹³C-NMR) data. Among them, 2, 3 and 5 were three new compounds, and 4 displayed potent multi-drug resistant (MDR) reversal activities to MX-1/T tumor MDR cells.
