To evaluate the role of LPA in regulating E-cadherin cell surface expression, adhesion, and invasion in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) cells.

E-cadherin mRNA expression in OVCA429 and IOSE-29 cells was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis were performed to determine cell surface expression and shedding of E-cadherin 80-kDa soluble fragment by LPA. Kinetics of LPA-induced uPA activity was followed with a colorimetric enzymatic assay. Invasion assays were performed in a modified Boyden chamber where cells were allowed to migrate to the bottom compartment through a porous filter coated with collagen. Additionally we measured the 80-kDa form from the ascites of women with stage III/IV EOC.

LPA induces E-cadherin shedding of a soluble 80-kDa fragment. We found that this process is mediated by the uPA proteolytic cascade. High levels of soluble E-cadherin were found in the ascites from women with advanced stage EOC. LPA and a soluble recombinant E-cadherin-Fc chimera promotes invasion of OVCA429 cells.

LPA induces shedding of an 80-kDa E-cadherin-soluble fragment in an uPA-dependent manner and promotes in vitro invasion. High levels of soluble E-cadherin in malignant ascites may also affect ovarian metastasis.
