The synthesis of two C-1 analogues of pancratistatin has been accomplished in 17 steps from bromobenzene. The key steps involved the enzymatic dihydroxylation, regioselective opening of epoxyaziridine 9 with the alane derived from 8, a solid-state silica-gel-catalyzed intramolecular opening of aziridine to produce phenanthrene 13 whose oxidative cleavage and recyclization provided the full skeleton of the Amaryllidaceae constituents. The new analogues 5 and 6 exhibited promising activity in several human cancer cell lines.
