The aim of this study was to examine the potential usefulness of a mammaglobin multigene reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay and a mammaglobin sandwich ELISA as diagnostic tools in breast cancer.

We studied peripheral blood samples from 147 untreated Senegalese women with biopsy-confirmed breast cancer and gathered patient information regarding demographic, and clinical staging of disease. The samples were tested for mammaglobin and three breast cancer-associated gene transcripts by a multigene real-time RT-PCR assay and for serum mammaglobin protein by a sandwich ELISA assay.

In 77% of the breast cancer blood samples, a positive signal was obtained in the multigene RT-PCR assay detecting mammaglobin and three complementary transcribed genes. Fifty samples from healthy female donors tested negative. Significant correlations were found between mammaglobin protein in serum, presence of mammaglobin mRNA-expressing cells in blood, stage of disease, and tumor size. Circulating mammaglobin protein was detected in 68% of the breast cancer sera, and was increased in 38% in comparison with a mixed control population. The RT-PCR assay and the ELISA for mammaglobin produced a combined sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 97%.

The ELISA and RT-PCR for mammaglobin and mammaglobin-producing cells could be valuable tools for diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer.
