The NEDD8-activating enzyme is upstream of the 20S proteasome in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and catalyzes the first step in the neddylation pathway. NEDD8 modification of cullins is required for ubiquitination of cullin-ring ligases that regulate degradation of a distinct subset of proteins. The more targeted impact of NEDD8-activating enzyme on protein degradation prompted us to study MLN4924, an investigational NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor, in preclinical multiple myeloma models. In vitro treatment with MLN4924 led to dose-dependent decrease of viability (EC(50) = 25-150 nmol/L) in a panel of human multiple myeloma cell lines. MLN4924 was similarly active against a bortezomib-resistant ANBL-6 subline and its bortezomib-sensitive parental cells. MLN4924 had submicromolar activity (EC(50) values <500 nmol/L) against primary CD138(+) multiple myeloma patient cells and exhibited at least additive effect when combined with dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and bortezomib against MM.1S cells. The bortezomib-induced compensatory upregulation of transcripts for ubiquitin/proteasome was not observed with MLN4924 treatment, suggesting distinct functional roles of NEDD8-activating enzyme versus 20S proteasome. MLN4924 was well tolerated at doses up to 60 mg/kg 2Ã— daily and significantly reduced tumor burden in both a subcutaneous and an orthotopic mouse model of multiple myeloma. These studies provide the framework for the clinical investigation of MLN4924 in multiple myeloma.
