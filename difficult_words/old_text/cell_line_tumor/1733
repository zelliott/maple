Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the major problems to successful cancer chemotherapy. To find novel effective P-gp inhibitors, a series of bifendate-chalcone hybrids were synthesized and evaluated. Among them, the most active compound 8g had little intrinsic cytotoxicity (IC(50)>200 Î¼M), and could increase accumulation of Rhodamine 123 in K562/A02 cells more potently than bifendate and verapamil (VRP) by inhibiting P-gp efflux function. And 8g displayed potent chemo-sensitizing effect and persisted for much longer time (>24h) compared with VRP (<6h). In addition, 8g, unlike VRP, showed no stimulation on the P-gp ATPase activity, suggesting it is not a P-gp substrate. Therefore, 8g may represent a promising lead to develop MDR reversal agents for cancer chemotherapy.
