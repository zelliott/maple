Ten compounds were isolated from the stems of Brucea mollis by various chromatographic techniques such as column chromatography on silica gel and Sephadex LH-20, and preparative HPLC, and their structures were elucidated as deacetylated isobrucein B (1), indaquassin X (2), cleomiscosin A (3), cleomiscosin B (4), (+)-lyoniresinol (5), (+)-epipinoresinol(6), (+)-pinoresinol (7), (+)-syringaresinol (8), 4,5-dihydroblumenol A (9) and adenosine (10) on the basis of spectroscopic data analysiS. All compounds were obtained from this plant for the first time, moreover, compound 1 was a new natural product. Compound 2 showed significant cytotoxic activities against the human cell lines HT-29, HepG2, BGC-823 and SKOV3 with IC50 values of 0.84-3.97 micromol x L(-1).
