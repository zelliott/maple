Malignant brain tumours are rare but are the most challenging types of cancers             to treat. Despite conventional multimodality approaches available for their management,             the outlook for most patients remains dismal due to the ability of the tumour             cells to invade the normal brain. Attention has now focused on novel therapeutic             interventions such as as the use of micronutrients. Both chokeberry extract (Aronia             melanocarpa), which is rich in natural pigments such as anthocyanins and curcumin             (diferuloylmethane) found in turmeric (Curcuma longa) have been reported to possess             anticancer properties in other cancers. The aim of this study was to extend our             previous research to evaluate the therapeutic potential of these two agents by             testing their ability to induce apoptosis in an established glioblastoma cell             line (U373). This was accomplished by treating the cells for 48 h with either             chokeberry extract or curcumin, and using the Annexin-V assay. Gene profiles of             8 MMPs (2, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 24 and 25) and 4 TIMPs (1, 2, 3 and 4) were analysed             for effects of mediators of invasion by quantitative real-time polymerase chain             reaction (RT-PCR). The IC50 values determined for curcumin and chokeberry extract             were 15 and 200 µg/ml, respectively. Our results also suggest that curcumin induces             apoptosis but chokeberry extract is necrotic to this cell line. It is possible             that chokeberry extract kills the cells by other non-apoptotic pathways. In addition,             the RT-PCR results show downregulation of the gene expression of MMP-2, -14, -16             and -17 for both micronutrients. Taken together, the comparative data suggest             that both curcumin and chokeberry extract may exhibit their anticancer potential             by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting invasion by reducing MMP gene expression.
