Simpler and faster! Multifunctionalized nanoparticles are crucial for nanobiomedical applications, but their syntheses are tedious and time-consuming. A multicomponent reaction on nanostructures is an excellent way to prepare such nanomaterials. The gold nanosystem illustrated in the scheme was built and shown to enhance cancer cell targeting and killing by combining the effects of a therapeutic drug with X-ray radiation.
