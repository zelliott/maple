Yes-associated protein (YAP) has been implicated as an oncogene in multiple human cancers. In the present study, human gastric adenocarcinoma tissues of different grades (N=78) were collected and the mRNA and protein expression of YAP and phosphorylated YAP (p-YAP) in gastric adenocarcinomas were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, Real-time PCR and Western blot assays. Then, human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells were stably transfected with lentivirus-mediated YAP small hairpin RNA (shRNA). The expression levels of YAP, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) were detected and the effects of shRNA-mediated knockdown of YAP on cell proliferation and metastasis were assessed in gastric cancer cells. As a result, the expression of YAP was observed in 69.23 percent gastric adenocarcinoma tissues, elevating with the ascending order of tumor malignancy. Knockdown of YAP could down-regulated the expression of PCNA and MMP-2, and inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer cells. In conclusion, YAP is strongly expressed in gastric adenocarcinomas, and knockdown of YAP may inhibit gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through down-regulation of PCNA and MMP-2 expression, suggesting that YAP represents an important therapeutic target in human gastric cancer.
