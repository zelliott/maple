Radial glia play an essential role in the generation of the cerebral cortex through their function as neuronal precursors and as neuronal migration guides. A molecular marker for radial glia in the developing central nervous system is the brain lipid-binding protein (BLBP). To generate mouse models for the visualization and study of radial glia, we expressed EGFP, EYFP, or dsRed2 in transgenic mice under the control of the BLBP promoter. In these transgenic lines, fluorescent protein expression is restricted to radial glia in the embryonic cortex and to astrocytes in the adult brain. Electroporation of the transgenes into embryonic cortex also resulted in radial glia-specific transgene expression. These BLBP promoter driven transgenic mice and organotypic brain slices expressing different fluorescent markers in a radial glia-specific manner will be useful tools to further study the differentiation and function of radial glia in distinct regions of the developing CNS.
