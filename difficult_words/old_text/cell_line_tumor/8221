Activator protein-2alpha (AP-2alpha) is a transcription factor that belongs to the family of AP-2 proteins that have essential roles in tumorigenesis. Indeed, AP-2alpha is considered as a tumour-suppressor gene in different tissues such as colonic, prostatic or breast epithelial cells. Moreover, AP-2alpha also participates in the control of colon and breast cancer cells sensitivity towards chemotherapeutic drugs. Despite its potential interest, very few data are available regarding the roles of AP-2alpha in pancreatic cancer.

We have developed a stable pancreatic CAPAN-1 cell line overexpressing AP-2alpha. Consequences of overexpression were studied in terms of in vivo cell growth, gene expression, migration capacity and chemosensitivity.

In vivo tumour growth of CAPAN-1 cells overexpressing AP-2alpha was significantly decreased by comparison to control cells. An altered expression pattern of cell cycle-controlling factors (CDK-4, CDK-6, cyclin-G1, p27(kip1) and p57(kip2)) was observed in AP-2alpha-overexpressing clones by microarrays and western blot analysis. Promoter activity and ChIP analysis indicated that AP-2alpha induces p27(kip1) protein levels by direct binding to and transactivation of its promoter. Moreover, AP-2alpha overexpression increased the chemosensitivity of CAPAN-1 cells to low doses of gemcitabine and reduced their in vitro migration capacity.

Our data suggested that AP-2alpha overexpression could be exploited to decrease in vivo tumour growth of pancreatic cancer cells and to increase their sensitivity to gemcitabine.
