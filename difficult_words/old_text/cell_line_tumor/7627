Despite the potent antitumor activity of CPT-11, late-onset diarrhea owing to enterohepatic circulation of SN-38 is a critical issue.

We aimed to evaluate the inhibitory potency of gefitinib against the ABCB1- or ABCG2-mediated excretion of CPT-11 and its active metabolite SN-38 in vitro and in vivo.

Gefitinib dose-dependently enhanced the antiproliferation activity of SN-38 in vitro by inhibiting ABCG2. The inhibitory effect of gefitinib on ABCB1 was marginal. When both CPT-11 and gefitinib were administered orally to nude mice bearing human lung cancer PC-6 cells, tumor growth was markedly suppressed. By gefitinib coadministration, the lactone forms of both CPT-11 and SN-38 in the tumor tissue increased more than 2-fold.

Gefitinib significantly enhances the antitumor efficacy of CPT-11 and its tumor distribution in vivo. Coadministration of gefitinib may provide a new means to reduce the dose of CPT-11 and to circumvent the gastrointestinal toxicity risk.
