Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) induces cytosine deamination to generate somatic hypermutation and class switch recombnation in immunoglobulin genes. AID expression is upregulated by inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which in turn induce p53 mutations in inflammatory or cancer cells. In this study, the effects of growth factors, cytokines or sodium butyrate on AID mRNA expression were examined in human OSCC-derived cells using real-time RT-PCR. Expression of AID mRNA was detected in OSCC cells and the expression was increased by EGF, TNF-a, or sodium butyrate. These results suggest that aberrant AID expression may play an important role in the dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in the oral cavity.
