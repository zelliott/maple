To investigate the growth inhibitory mechanism of NS-398, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, in two hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines (HepG2 and Huh7).

HepG2 and Huh7 cells were treated with NS-398. Its effects on cell viability, cell proliferation, cell cycles, and gene expression were respectively evaluated by water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay, 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, flow cytometer analysis, and Western blotting, with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as positive control.

NS-398 showed dose- and time-dependent growth-inhibitory effects on the two cell lines. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expressions in HepG2 and Huh7 cells, particularly in Huh7 cells were inhibited in a time- and dose-independent manner. NS-398 caused cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase with cell accumulation in the sub-G1 phase in HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines. No evidence of apoptosis was observed in two cell lines.

NS-398 reduces cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest in HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines, and COX-2 inhibitors may have potent chemoprevention effects on human hepatocellular carcinoma.
