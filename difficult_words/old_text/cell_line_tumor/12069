Endotoxins are frequent contaminants of recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli. Due to their adverse effects, endotoxins have to be removed from recombinant proteins prior their use in cell-based assays or parenteral application. Reduction of endotoxin to less than 10 EU mg(-1) is, however, one of the most problematic steps during protein purification from E. coli and often associated with substantial loss of biological materials. The present paper describes the use of a single step procedure enabling metal chelate affinity purification and endotoxin clearance from antibody fragments produced in E. coli using a non-ionic detergent. Endotoxin content was as low as 5 to 9 EU mg(-1) with a recovery of antibody fragments of over 90%. Non-ionic detergent treatment did not compromise integrity and functionality of these multimeric molecules. Furthermore, recombinant antibody fragments did not stimulate endotoxin-sensitive cell lines confirming the low endotoxin content. In conclusion, this one-step protocol is a rapid, cost effective and automation-compatible procedure suitable for recombinant antibody fragments.
