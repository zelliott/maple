The origin of soluble CD14 (sCD14) in the circulation is uncertain. To examine whether CD14 could be an acute-phase protein (APP), the levels of sCD14, IL-6, and C-reactive protein were determined by ELISA in serum and synovial fluid (SF) of patients with various arthropathies, and the regulation of CD14 synthesis was examined in liver cells. In patients with crystal-mediated or immunologically mediated arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis), serum levels of sCD14 were higher than or similar to those found in infection-mediated arthritis (reactive arthritis), precluding a relation with bacteria exposure. Levels of sCD14 were similar in SF and serum, and did not correlate with the number of SF leukocytes, excluding an important source from leukocyte membrane-bound CD14, by protease-mediated shedding. In contrast, serum levels of sCD14 in patients correlated with those of C-reactive protein, a classical APP, and IL-6, a cytokine known to regulate the synthesis of APP in the liver. Serum levels of sCD14 also correlated with disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and reactive arthritis patients. IL-6 stimulated the production of CD14 by HepG2 hepatoma cells. By real-time PCR, the inducibility of CD14 by IL-6 was also observed at the mRNA level both in HepG2 cells and human primary hepatocytes. These in vitro results were confirmed by in vivo studies in IL-6(-/-) mice injected with turpentine, an experimental model of acute-phase response. Liver levels of CD14 mRNA increased in IL-6(+/+), but not in IL-6(-/-) mice. These results indicate that sCD14 can be considered as a type 2 APP.
