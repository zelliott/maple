Altered signaling pathways or deregulated transcription factors represent an important category of molecular events leading to aberrant gene regulation in gastric cancer, among which the role of WNT/beta-catenin pathway remains unclear. LRH-1 is a critical transcription factor in controlling cell proliferation via crosstalk with the beta-catenin signaling pathway. In order to gain a knowledge of the expression of hLRH-1v1 and hLRH-1 in gastric cancer, a Q-PCR analysis was carried out. Our results showed that in about 50 and 47.6% of 42 tested patients with gastric cancer, the mRNA expression of hLRH-1v1 and hLRH-1 was significantly upregulated, as compared with self-paired normal control, respectively. Besides, overexpression of hLRH-1 was shown to promote the proliferation of gastric adenocarcinoma cell SGC-7901 via induction of cyclin E1. Taken together, our present study demonstrated for the first time the increased expression of hLRH-1v1 and hLRH-1 in human gastric cancer, an alteration which may implicate in tumorigenesis.
