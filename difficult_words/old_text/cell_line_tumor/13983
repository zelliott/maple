PTEN is a tumour suppressor protein with phosphatase activity frequently altered in several types of human cancers.

The PTEN effect was studied on the cell cycle (by bromdeoxyuridine incorporation) and on the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/Akt (PI3-K/PKB/Akt) pathway regulating proteins (by immunocytochemical, Western blot analysis and kinase assay) upon transfection of wild-type PTEN and its mutant H123Y in breast cancer cell lines.

The expression of the important proteins in the MCF-7 and BT-549 cells was characterised and the cellular localisation of PTEN was analysed. Transfection of H123Y led to the down-regulation of p27(Kip1) and p21(Waf1/Cip1) protein levels and the up-regulation of phosphorylated PKB/Akt. An overexpression of PTEN decreased cyclin E/cdk2 activity and inhibited S-phase entry in MCF-7. In BT-549 these changes were not observed, but overexpression of PTEN led to a diminution of PKB/Akt phosphorylation.

PTEN function is mediated through the inhibition of the cell cycle and PKB/Akt phosphorylation in breast cancer cells.
