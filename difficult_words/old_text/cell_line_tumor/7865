The identification of the factors that allow better monitoring of stem cell renewal and differentiation is of paramount importance for the implementation of new regenerative therapies, especially with regard to the nervous and hematopoietic systems. In this article, we present new information on the function of zinc finger protein 191 (ZNF/Zfp191), a factor isolated in hematopoietic cell lines, within progenitors of the central nervous system (CNS). ZNF/Zfp191 has been found to be principally expressed in progenitors of the developing CNS of humans and mice. Such an overlap of the expression patterns in addition to the high homology of the protein in mammals suggested that ZNF/Zfp191 exerts a conserved function within such progenitors. Indeed, ZNF191 knockdown in human neural progenitors inhibits proliferation and leads to the exit of the cell cycle. Conversely, ZNF191 misexpression maintains progenitors in cycle and exerts negative control on the Notch pathway, which prevents them from differentiating. The present data, together with the fact that the inactivation of Zfp191 leads to embryonic lethality, confirm ZNF191 as an essential factor acting for the promotion of the cell cycle and thus maintenance in the progenitor stage. On the bases of expression data, such a function can be extended to progenitor cells of other tissues such as the hematopoietic system, which emphasizes the important issue of further understanding the molecular events controlled by ZNF/Zfp191.
