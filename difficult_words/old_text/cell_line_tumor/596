To investigate the stimulated effect of liver regeneration on colon cancer cells in remnant liver in rats.

Rat models with liver metastases or retro-peritoneal metastases of colon cancer were established: animals underwent 37% or 70% liver resection and were compared with a sham laparotomy (15, 25, 15 cases, respectively). Metastases were performed two weeks before resection. Rats were killed 3 weeks after the resection. Total body weight, liver and tumor weights were recorded. The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Lovo was cultured in the presence of portal serum withdrawn 24 hours and 14 days after partial hepatectomy (PH). DNA synthesis was assessed by flow cytometry analysis for 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (5-BrdU) incorporation.

The tumor growth was accelerated in the remnant liver in 70% PH group, but the tumors in 37% PH group and retro-peritoneal site were not influenced by PH. Compared with the control group, after cultured 72 hours with portal serum withdrawn 24 h after PH, a higher 5-BrdU incorporation was found in the Lovo cell lines (P < 0.05), and it reached the peak after 120 hours of culture (P < 0.05). No difference was found between the groups when cultured with the portal serum withdrawn 14 d after PH (P > 0.05).

PH may accelerate the growth of residual microscopic tumor in the liver which contributes to local recurrence. It has no systemic effect and effects on the cancer cell lines in extrahepatic sites. The excision extension is related to the stimulating effects on the cancer cell line, and subtotal hepatectomy is presumably a major determinant.
