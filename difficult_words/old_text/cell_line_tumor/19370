Cdc7 kinase is an essential protein that promotes DNA replication in eukaryotic organisms. Genetic evidence indicates that Cdc7 inhibition can cause selective tumor-cell death in a p53-independent manner, supporting the rationale for developing Cdc7 small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of cancers. In this paper, the synthesis and structure-activity relationships of 2-heteroaryl-pyrrolopyridinones, the first potent Cdc7 kinase inhibitors, are described. Starting from 2-pyridin-4-yl-1,5,6,7-tetrahydro-pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridin-4-one, progress toward a simple scaffold, tailored for Cdc7 inhibition, is reported.
