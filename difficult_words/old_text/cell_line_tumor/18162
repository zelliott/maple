Delivery of plasmid DNA encoding therapeutic genes into tumors is one of the main applications of electroporation. This chapter summarizes various investigators' electroporation parameters for intratumoral gene delivery. In addition to electroporation parameters, injection volume is also critical for achieving a high level of gene expression via electroporation. In this study, we attempt to provide a strategy for determining the optimal injection volume for intratumoral injection via electroporation. Unlike muscle tissues, the optimal volume for gene delivery into tumors via electroporation may vary greatly based on the tumor size and the electroporation parameters. More efforts in defining the optimal injection volume should be made to further advance intratumoral electroporation gene therapy for treating tumors.
