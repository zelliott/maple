Tetraspanin CD151 associates with laminin-binding α(3)β(1)/α(6)β(1) integrins in epithelial cells and regulates adhesion-dependent signaling events. We found here that CD151 plays a role in recruiting Ras, Rac1, and Cdc42, but not Rho, to the cell membrane region, leading to the formation of α(3)β(1)/α(6)β(1) integrin-CD151-GTPases complexes. Furthermore, cell adhesion to laminin enhanced CD151 association with β(1) integrin and, thereby, increased complex formation between the β(1) family of integrins and small GTPases, Ras, Rac1, and Cdc42. Adhesion receptor complex-associated small GTPases were activated by CD151-β(1) integrin complex-stimulating adhesion events, such as α(3)β(1)/α(6)β(1) integrin-activating cell-to-laminin adhesion and homophilic CD151 interaction-generating cell-to-cell adhesion. Additionally, FAK and Src appeared to participate in this adhesion-dependent activation of small GTPases. However, engagement of laminin-binding integrins in CD151-deficient cells or CD151-specific siRNA-transfected cells did not activate these GTPases to the level of cells expressing CD151. Small GTPases activated by engagement of CD151-β(1) integrin complexes contributed to CD151-induced cell motility and MMP-9 expression in human melanoma cells. Importantly, among the four tetraspanin proteins that associate with β(1) integrin, only CD151 exhibited the ability to facilitate complex formation between the β(1) family of integrins and small GTPases and stimulate β(1) integrin-dependent activation of small GTPases. These results suggest that CD151 links α(3)β(1)/α(6)β(1) integrins to Ras, Rac1, and Cdc42 by promoting the formation of multimolecular complexes in the membrane, which leads to the up-regulation of adhesion-dependent small GTPase activation.
