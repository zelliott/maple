To express tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) protein using endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) and observe antitumor activity of secreted TRAIL in cell culture supernatant.

EPC were isolated by immunomagnetic sorting. Human TRAIL plasmid was transfected into EPC by lipofectamine 2000. The cell culture supernatant was harvested and the secreted protein was measured by immunoassay method. Apoptosis rate was analysed by flow cytometry.

EPC could develop from the culture of cord blood CD(133)(+) (cluster of differentiation 133(+)) cells. EPC may be transiently transfected with human TRAIL plasmid. The level of TRAIL in the cell culture supernatant was higher in the TRAIL transfected group than in the non-transfected group and green-fluoro protein (GFP) transfected group (532.8 pg/ml versus 12.4 and 9.2 pg/ml). Apoptosis detection showed that TRAIL had high antitumor activity in 3AO cell, the apoptosis rate of ovarian cancer cell could reach 24.1%.

In vitro, TRAIL EPC gene transfer enhances EPC to secrete TRAIL protein, and induces apoptosis of ovarian cancer cell. There is a good clinical prospect for EPC in the gene therapy of ovarian cancer.
