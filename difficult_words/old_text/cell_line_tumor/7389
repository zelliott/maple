CA125, which until recently was considered an ovary specific tumor marker, is elevated in the serum of patients with many pathological conditions, including lung cancer. In order to investigate the production of CA125 by human lung cancer cell lines, cell culture and immunochemical staining were performed in three cell lines. Our results showed the cell surface expression of CA125 in both adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma cell lines and the production of CA125 in culture medium. This is considered as evidence for in vitro production of CA125 by human lung cancer, and suggests that CA125 elevation is not only the result of ovarian cancer but may be due to other pathological conditions, including lung cancer.
