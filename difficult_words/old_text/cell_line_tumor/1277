Overexpression of the multi-drug transporter P-glycoprotein, encoded by the ABCB1 gene, is a clinically relevant problem in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Polymorphisms in ABCB1 might contribute to cancer risk and therapeutic response. We therefore investigated the influence of polymorphisms G1199A, C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T on cancer susceptibility, in vitro cytotoxicity and overall survival in 100 de novo AML patients with normal karyotype. Patients with 1236C/C or 2677G/G genotypes showed poorer survival than patients with other genotypes (P=0.03 and P=0.02, respectively). Both these genotypes were significant factors for survival in multivariate analysis, along with age, NPM1 and FLT3 mutation status. In vitro cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that leukemic cells from 1236T/T and 2677T/T patients were significantly more susceptible to mitoxantrone (P=0.02), and tended to be more susceptible to etoposide and daunorubicin (P=0.07-0.09), but not to cytarabine. No significant difference in allele frequencies was found between patients and healthy volunteers (n=400).
