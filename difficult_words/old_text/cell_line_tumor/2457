Three new cycloartenol triterpene saponins, 3 β,16 α-dihydroxy-12-acetoxy-16,22-cyclo-23-ketone-24 R,25-epoxy-cycloartane-7-ene 3- O- β-D-galactopyranoside ( 1), 24- O-hydroxy-7,8-didehydrohydroshengmanol 3- O- β-D-galactopyranoside ( 2), and 24-epi-24- O-hydroxy-7,8-didehydrohydroshengmanol 3- O- β-D-galactopyranoside ( 3), were isolated from the ethyl acetate soluble fraction of Cimicifuga simplex. Their structures were established by detailed spectroscopic analysis, including extensive 2D-NMR data. This is the first time that a 16,22-cyclo type glycosidesaponin from aCimicifuga species was reported. The immunosuppressive activities of the new compounds were evaluated by a ConA-stimulated T splenocyte proliferation assay in vitro.
