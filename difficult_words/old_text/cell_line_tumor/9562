MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and its metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) are drugs that are widely used in experimental Parkinson disease (PD) models. What is the significance of ORP150/HSP12A, a molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in the nigrostriatal system? Dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) were examined. Our observations led to the hypothesis that ORP150 protects against MPTP/MPP(+)-induced neurotoxicity, and indicate the importance of the ER environment in maintaining the nigrostriatal pathways.
