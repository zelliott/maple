We have previously shown that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) enhance SNU-407 colon cancer cell proliferation via the ERK1/2 pathway. Here, we examined the signaling pathways linking mAChR stimulation to ERK1/2 activation and the subsequent proliferation of SNU-407 cells. The inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by AG1478 or protein kinase C (PKC) by GF109203X significantly reduced carbachol-stimulated ERK1/2 activation and cell proliferation. Cotreatment of the cells with AG1478 and GF109203X produced an additive effect on carbachol-stimulated ERK1/2 activation, suggesting that the EGFR and PKC pathways act in parallel. The p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) are downstream effectors of ERK1/2 and are known to have important roles in cell proliferation. In SNU-407 cells, carbachol treatment induced RSK activation in an atropine-sensitive manner, and this RSK activation was decreased by the inhibition of either EGFR or PKC. Moreover, the RSK-specific inhibitor BRD7389 almost completely blocked carbachol-stimulated cell proliferation. Together, these data indicate that EGFR and PKC are involved in mAChR-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and RSK and the subsequent proliferation of SNU-407 colon cancer cells.
