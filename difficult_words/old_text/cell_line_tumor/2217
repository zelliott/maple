Emerging evidence has indicated microRNAs are involved in tumor development and progression, acting as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Here we report that miR-409-3p was significantly downregulated in gastric cancer (GC) cell lines and tissues. Overexpression of miR-409-3p in SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the transcriptional regulator PHF10 was a target of miR-409-3p. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-409-3p may function as a novel tumor suppressor in GC and its anti-oncogenic activity may involve the direct targeting and inhibition of PHF10.
