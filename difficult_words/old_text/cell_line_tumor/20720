To investigate the effects of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) siRNA on cell proliferation and cell apoptosis of the HeLa cervical carcinoma cell line and the molecular mechanisms involved.

Division was into three groups: A, the untreated group; B, the control siRNA group; and C, the HDAC6 siRNA group. Lipofectamine 2000 was used for siRNA transfection, and Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein levels. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were characterized using a CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively.

HDAC6 protein expression in the HDAC6 siRNA-transfection group was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in the untreated and control siRNA groups. The CCK-8 kit results demonstrated that the proliferation of HeLa cells was clearly inhibited in the HDAC6 siRNA transfection group (P < 0.05). In addition, flow cytometry revealed that the early apoptotic rate (26.0% ± 0.87%) was significantly elevated (P < 0.05) as compared with the untreated group (10.6% ± 1.19%) and control siRNA group (8.61% ± 0.98%). Furthermore, Western blot analysis indicated that bcl-2 protein expression in the HDAC6 siRNA-transfection group was down-regulated, whereas the expression of p21 and bax was up-regulated.

HDAC6 plays an essential role in the occurrence and development of cervical carcinoma, and the down-regulation of HDAC6 expression may be useful molecular therapeutic method.
