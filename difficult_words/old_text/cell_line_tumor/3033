Conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzymes 5 alpha-reductase types 1 (5 alpha R1) and 2 (5 alpha R2) is important for normal and pathological growth of the prostate. The predominant isoenzyme in normal prostate is 5 alpha R2. However, prostate cancer (PCa) development is accompanied by a decrease in 5 alpha R2 and an increase in 5 alpha R1. The biological significance of increased 5 alpha R1 expression is not fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of overexpression of 5 alpha R1 on growth and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) production in PCa cells.

LNGK-9 PCa cells, transiently transfected with pTRE-5 alpha R1 or pTRE alone, were cultured in the presence or absence of testosterone at varying concentrations. Cell growth and PSA secretion were measured after 4-6 days. Cyclin E1, Ki67, and PSA mRNA levels were evaluated using RT-PCR after 24 hr of treatment.

10 pM testosterone increased growth of pTRE-5 alpha R1 transfectants by 54.1% over cells grown in the absence of testosterone, compared to 25.0% in pTRE transfectants (P < 0.01). Likewise, PSA secretion was increased by 56-fold in pTRE-5 alpha R1 transfectants treated with 10 pM testosterone, compared to 26-fold in pTRE transfectants (P < 0.01). At concentrations of testosterone above 10 pM, the stimulatory effect on growth and PSA secretion was not distinguishable between pTRE-5 alpha R1 and pTRE transfectants.

These results demonstrate that upregulation of 5 alpha R1 enhances the cellular response to low, but not high, concentrations of testosterone. This explains one mechanism by which castration-recurrent PCa can proliferate in the presence of castrate levels of circulating testosterone.
