To develop new approach for tumor immunotherapy with VEGFR2-based DNA vaccine.

VEGFR2 derived from different species were prepared by RT-PCR and subjected to recombinant constructs. The chimeric gene of VEGFR2 was prepared by integrating different epitopes in different species. By transfecting into cells, the immunological effect was evaluated with the approaches of ELISA, ELISPOT, and animal experiments.

(1) All these constructs, in particular chimeric construct, can result in both humoral- and cellular-immune response in BALB/c mice after immunization evaluated by the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ and release of IFN-gamma and IL-4 respectively. (2) Mice were vaccinated with these constructs and challenged with renal carcinoma cells subsequently. It manifested that tumor growth was suppressed significantly in the mice vaccinated by chimeric VEGFR2 construct.

Our results manifested that VEGFR2-based DNA chimeric vaccine could be developed as a promising approach for tumor immunotherapy.
