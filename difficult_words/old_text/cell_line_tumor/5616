Somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. Exposure of G protein-coupled receptors to their agonists induces a rapid decrease in their initial response. The goal of this study is to investigate alteration in SSTR2 by the treatment of SSTR agonist octreotide (OCT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the resulting consequence.

Morphology, proliferation and cell cycle of the human HCC cell line (Bel7402) were evaluated. Effect of OCT on HCC growth and development was assessed in vivo. SSTR2 expression was measured by RT-PCR and detected by immunohistochemistry.

Short-term OCT treatment on Bel7402 cells barely changed cell proliferation and morphology, and no apoptosis was induced. The SSTR2 protein level was markedly decreased on Bel7402 cells after exposure to OCT. However, the weight of the HCC xenograft was significantly lower in the OCT treatment group as compared with the control group. In the rat hepatocarcinogenesis model, the mortality and incidence of HCC in the OCT treatment group were remarkably less than those in the control group. Long-term OCT treatment led to increased levels of both SSTR2 mRNA and protein in hepatocytes and HCC cells.

Short-term OCT treatment could lead to SSTR2 desensitization, resulting in a reduced inhibitory effect on HCC by OCT. However, long-term OCT treatment effectively inhibited the development and growth of HCC probably via resensitization and upregulation of SSTR2.
