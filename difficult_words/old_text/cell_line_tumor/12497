In order to develop a niosome-encapsulated ciprofloxacin (CPFX) HCl formulation for pulmonary delivery, the feasibility of encapsulation of CPFX in niosomes, its stability and nebulization capability was evaluated. Various combinations of nonionic surfactants with cholesterol were used to prepare the formulations. The in vitro deposition data of the niosomal formulations were examined using an Andersen cascade impactor. Formulations composed of Span 60 and Tween 60 in combination with 40 mol% of cholesterol exhibited high encapsulation efficacy and stability and also had fine particle fraction and nebulization efficiency of about 61.9% &#x00B1; 1.0 and 77.9 &#x00B1; 2.8, respectively. Minimal inhibitory concentration of the niosomal CPFX against some pulmonary pathogens were lower than free CPFX. Using the MTT assay in human lung carcinoma cell line (A549), niosome-entrapped CPFX showed significantly lower cytotoxicity in comparison to the free drug. These results indicate that niosome can be used as a carrier for pulmonary delivery of CPFX via nebulization.
