Aminopeptidase N (APN), belonged to metalloproteinase, is an essential peptidase involved in the process of tumor invasion and metastasis. A series of tripeptide analogs with the scaffold 3-phenylpropane-1,2-diamine were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit APN. Preliminary activity evaluation showed that most of target compounds possessed potent inhibitory activities against APN. With in this series, compound A6 and B6 exhibited good potency with the IC(50) values of 8.8+/-1.3 microM and 8.6+/-1.1 microM, respectively.
