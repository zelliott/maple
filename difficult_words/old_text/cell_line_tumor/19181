B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL/B-precursor ALL) is characterized by a high rate of tissue infiltration. The mechanism of BCP-ALL cell extravasation is not fully understood. In the present study, we have investigated the major carrier of carbohydrate selectin ligands in the BCP-ALL cell line NALL-1 and its possible role in the extravascular infiltration of the leukemic cells. B-precursor ALL cell lines and clinical samples from patients with BCP-ALL essentially exhibited positive flow cytometric reactivity with E-selectin, and the reactivity was significantly diminished by O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase treatment in NALL-1 cells. B-precursor ALL cell lines adhered well to E-selectin but only very weakly to P-selectin with low-shear-force cell adhesion assay. Although BCP-ALL cell lines did not express the well-known core protein P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a major proportion of the carbohydrate selectin ligand was carried by a sialomucin, CD43, in NALL-1 cells. Most clinical samples from patients with BCP-ALL exhibited a PSGL-1(neg/low)/CD43(high) phenotype. NALL-1 cells rolled well on E-selectin, but knockdown of CD43 on NALL-1 cells resulted in reduced rolling activity on E-selectin. In addition, the CD43 knockdown NALL-1 cells showed decreased tissue engraftment compared with the control cells when introduced into gamma-irradiated immunodeficient mice. These results strongly suggest that CD43 but not PSGL-1 plays an important role in the extravascular infiltration of NALL-1 cells and that the degree of tissue engraftment of B-precursor ALL cells may be controlled by manipulating CD43 expression.
