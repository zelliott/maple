Cisplatin is a clinically important chemotherapeutical agent used to treat epithelial malignancies. High concentrations (20-100 microM) of cisplatin have been used in numerous studies to induce apoptosis of carcinoma cells grown in monolayer culture over 24-48 hr. These conditions may not be relevant to 3-D tumor tissue in vivo and the importance of apoptosis for tumor response is controversial. We here studied the effects of cisplatin on a 3-D colon carcinoma in vitro model (multicellular spheroids). Cisplatin at a dose of 40 microM induced active caspase-3 preferentially in the peripheral 30 microm cell layer of spheroids, mainly during late stages (72-96 hr). The p53 response to cisplatin was also largely confined to peripheral cell layers. Despite the use of a high cisplatin concentration, a significant fraction of the cells in the spheroids survived treatment. A high proportion of surviving cells stained positive for beta-galactosidase, a marker of premature senescence. Cells growth-arrested by cisplatin treatment showed a higher spontaneous cell death rate than untreated proliferating cells. We propose that acute apoptosis is of minor significance for the overall response of carcinoma cells to cisplatin treatment.
