Establishment of transplanted model of VX2 supraglottic carcinoma in rabbits and investigation the rule of lymphatic vessels formation.

After establishment of VX2 tumor-bearing rabbits, the carcinoma tissues were transplanted into the operculum laryngis submucosa in sixty New-Zealand white rabbits to establish transplanted tumor model. Vascular endothelial growth factor-3 (VEGFR-3) label staining was performed to observe lymphatic vessels. Number density, volume density of lymphatics periphery region of carcinoma, normal region and centre region were measured using computer image analysis system.

There was no lymphatic vessels in carcinomatous centre region,but the lymphatic vessels number density, volume density in periphery region was much more than normal region. Their cavities were dilated. The discrepancy had statistical significance ( p<0.01).

The rule of lymphatic formation in rabbit VX2 supraglottic carcinoma model mimesis rule of lymphatic formation anthropo- supraglottic carcinoma. Lymphatic multiplication and dilation at periphery region of carcinoma is associated with lymph node metastasis. Evaluation of it at periphery region of carcinoma may be useful in predicting lymph node metastasis in patients with supraglottic carcinoma. This conclusion provides theoretical basis for utility of the anti-tumor medicines which inhibit lymphatic formation in animal model.
