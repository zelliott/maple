Ethanol has deleterious effects on neuronal cells both in vivo and in vitro, but the mechanisms are unknown. Here, treatment with increasing doses of ethanol (from 20 up to 600mM) decreased the viability of a mouse hippocampal neuroblastoma cell line, HT22. The glutathione concentration decreased and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased in a dose-and time-dependent manner, suggesting that the neurotoxicity was due to oxidative stress. Expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, a redox regulator and heat shock protein, increased with time after ethanol treatment, but HO-2 was expressed constitutively. The addition of 5microM zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP IX), a competitive HO inhibitor, with the ethanol further reduced cell viability and increased intracellular ROS, but these effects were reversed by co-treatment with 50nM bilirubin, a well-known antioxidant and a product of HO catalysis. These results suggest that HO has a protective role in hippocampal neurons as an intrinsic factor against ethanol-induced oxidative stress and the protection depends on the degree of oxidative stress.
