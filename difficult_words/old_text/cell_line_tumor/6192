In order to find new lead compounds with antitumour activies, thirteen new fatty acid esters of 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD) were synthesized using oleoyl chloride or fatty acids and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). Their cytotoxic activities were tested using the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] method, and the structure-activity relationships between the fatty acid esters of PPD and their cytotoxic activities are discussed.
