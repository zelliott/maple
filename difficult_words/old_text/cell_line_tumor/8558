To investigate whether bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression was involved in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-induced osteogenesis in human osteoblast-like cells in vitro.

MG-63 osteogenic human osteosarcoma cells were treated with CGRP (10-8 mol/L) for 48 h. Cell cycle phases were determined using flow cytometry assay. The protein levels of BMP-2, ALP, Osteocalcin, ColIa1, CREB, and pCREB were measured with Western blotting, while the mRNA level of BMP-2 was measured with qR-T PCR. The expression of ALP in MG-63 cells was also studied using immunofluorescence staining. The level of cAMP was measured with ELISA assay.

CGRP treatment significantly stimulated proliferation of MG-63 cells, and increased the expression of BMP-2 and the osteogenic proteins ALP, Osteocalcin and ColIa1. Pretreatment with the BMP signaling inhibitor Noggin (100 ng/mL) did not affect CGRP-stimulated proliferation and BMP-2 expression, but abolished the CGRP-induced increases of the osteogenic proteins ALP, Osteocalcin and ColIa1. Furthermore, CGRP treatment markedly increased cAMP level in MG-63 cells, whereas pretreatment with the cAMP pathway inhibitor H89 (5 Î¼mol/L) abolished the CGRP-induced increases of cAMP level and BMP-2 expression.

In MG-63 cells, the BMP pathway is involved in CGRP-induced osteogenic differentiation but not in proliferation, whereas the cAMP/pCREB pathway is involved in the expression of BMP-2.
