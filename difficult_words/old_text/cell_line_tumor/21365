To explore a new specific therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using an anti-nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) monoclonal antibody BAC5 conjugate with Chinese cobra (CT) and iodine-131(131I).

BAC5 was labeled with 131I by chloramine-T method, CT was labeled with 125I using iodogen method, and BAC5 and 125I-CT were conjugated by SPDP method. The inhibitory effect of the conjugate on cultured human NPC CNE2 cells was observed using MTT assay.

The IC50 of 125I-CT-BAC5 conjugate was 9.17x10(-8) mol/L, and that of 131I-BAC5 was 5.83x10(8) Bq/L, and their combined administration showed obvious inhibitory effect on the NPC cells.

Both 125I-CT-BAC5 and 131I-BAC5 have obvious inhibition effects against NPC cells, but their combined use shows stronger effects.
