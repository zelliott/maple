Combined vaccines containing GL261 murine glioma cells and F-2 murine endothelial cells fixed with glutaraldehyde-phosphate buffered saline were injected into the intradermal tissue of the tail base of C57BL/6 mice. After the vaccination, GL261 cells were injected subcutaneously into the left flank of the mice. Vaccination with fixed F-2 cells induced the development of relatively high amounts of interferon-gamma-releasing cells after in vitro re-stimulation with vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor 2 peptide. Tumor growth was inhibited after preventive use of the combined vaccine, prepared from GL261 and F-2 cells. Tumor specimens obtained from the combined vaccine group in a therapeutic experiment showed significantly decreased vessel count. Glioma immunotherapy with a combined vaccine prepared from tumor cells and endothelial cells might represent a new clinical strategy, as such combinations may theoretically affect both high-grade glioma cells and their environment.
