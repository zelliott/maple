Ten new lantabetulic acid (1) derivatives 2-11 were synthesized and their cytotoxicities against human prostate cancer cells were evaluated. PC3 cells treated with 10 μM 8 exhibited the most potent G1 phase arrest. In addition, 10 μM 8 markedly decreased the levels of cyclin E and cdk2 and caused an increase in the p21 and p27 levels, while 20 μM 8 mainly led to cell death through the apoptotic pathway, which correlated with an increase in reactive oxygen species levels, decreased expression levels of Bcl-2 and caspase-8, the induction of mitochondrial changes, and decreased levels of cytochrome c in mitochondria. The dual action of 8 could provide a new approach for the development of chemotherapeutic drugs.
