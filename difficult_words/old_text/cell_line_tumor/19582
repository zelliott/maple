To determine the characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in different human prostate cancer cell lines and explore the molecular mechanisms of bone metastatic potentials.

Expressions of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin in several prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, C4, C4-2, IF11, IA8, Du145 and PC-3) with different metastatic potentials were detected by Western blotting.

There was remarkable difference in the expressions of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin between these cell lines. As one of the adhesion associated proteins, E-cadherin was detected with high expression in LNCaP, C4, C4-2 and PC-3, whereas with a low expression in IF11, IA8 and Du145. However, as one of the mesenchymal proteins, N-cadherin was shown to be completely different from Vimentin expression profile in these cell lines.

There is actual difference in the EMT phenotypes among cell lines with different metastatic potentials. LNCaP, C4, C4-2 and PC-3 are cells without EMT change, while IF11, IA8 and Du145 are positive for EMT. The expressions of EMT associated proteins play important roles in promoting and repressing the metastasis of prostate cancer.
