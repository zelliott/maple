This study was conducted to determine whether dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with a tumor cell lysate can effectively vaccinate against tumor cells and to establish which cytokines are necessary.

Each wild-type mouse received two subcutaneous immunizations (days 14 and 7) with either saline, tumor lysate, DCs, or tumor-lysate-pulsed DCs. Gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN), knock-out (KO), and interleukin-12 (IL-12) KO mice were also used in immunizations. A tumor challenge was given at day 0. Splenocytes were assayed for gamma-IFN production.

All saline-injected mice (n = 19) and all mice injected with tumor lysate (n = 9) developed tumors. Six of nine mice immunized with DCs alone and 6/24 mice treated with lysate-pulsed DCs developed a tumor. Splenocytes from both the saline- and lysate-immunized groups produced undetectable levels of gamma-IFN, while those from mice immunized with either DCs or pulsed DCs produced high levels of gamma-IFN. Four of five gamma-IFN KO mice developed tumors after immunization with tumor-lysate-pulsed DCs. None of four IL-12 KO mice developed a tumor after immunization with wild-type pulsed DCs and 1/10 wild-type mice developed tumor after immunization with IL-12 KO pulsed DCs. Three of four IL-12 KO mice developed tumors after immunization with IL-12 KO pulsed DCs.

Tumor-lysate-pulsed DCs can initiate an effective antitumor immune response. The presence of gamma-IFN in the host is essential for antitumor protection. In contrast, tumor protection is observed if IL-12 is present in either the host or the DCs.
