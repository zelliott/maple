In this study, we investigated the correlation between p53 and bcl-2 in gambogic acid (GA)-induced apoptosis.

MTT assay was employed to evaluate MCF-7 cell viability after GA treatment. Cell morphological changes were observed follow-up under the inverted microscope after GA withdrawal. To observe the cell apoptosis, DAPI staining was used. Meanwhile, p53 small interfering RNA (si-RNA) was adopted to knock p53 down. All expressions of p53 and bcl-2 were evaluated by Western blot analysis.

MTT assay showed that GA inhibited MCF-7 cell growth effectively in a time-dependent manner. With 0.5 h GA treatment, p53 was significantly increased, whereas bcl-2 was reduced potently with 6 h GA treatment. After GA withdrawal, p53 expressions were maintained in high levels. Furthermore, bcl-2 decreasing was attenuated after co-treatment with PFT alpha, a p53 transcription blocker. Same result was observed after p53 knock-down by p53 si-RNA.

Gambogic acid induced human breast cancer cells MCF-7 apoptosis by reducing bcl-2 expression via p53.
