The reaction of cyanoacetylhydrazine with chloroacetyl chloride gave <em>N'</em>-(2-chloroacetyl)-2-cyanoacetohydrazide. The latter underwent cyclization to afford 1-(5 amino-3-hydroxy-1<em>H</em>-pyrazol-1-yl)-2-chloroethanone, which underwent nucleophilic substitution to give 3-(5-amino-3-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-3-oxopropanenitrile. The latter two compounds<strong> </strong>were used as key synthons to synthesize new thiophene, pyran, thiazole and some fused heterocyclic derivatives. The antitumor activity of the newly synthesized compounds was evaluated against three human tumor cells lines, namely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H460) and CNS cancer (SF-268) and some of these compounds were found to exhibit much higher inhibitory effects towards the three tumor cell lines than the Gram positive control doxorubicin.
