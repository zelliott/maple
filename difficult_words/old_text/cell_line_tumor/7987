The anticancer activities of secalonic acid D separated from the secondary metabolites of the mangrove endophytic fungus No. ZSU44 were investigated in this study. Secalonic acid D showed potent cytotoxicity to HL60 and K562 cells, and the IC(50) values were 0.38 and 0.43 mumol/L, respectively. Annexin V-FITC/PI assay and western blot indicated that secalonic acid D induced apoptosis in HL60 and K562 cells. In addition, secalonic acid D led to cell cycle arrest of G(1) phase related to downregulation of c-Myc. Moreover, our data indicated that downregulation of c-Myc and cell cycle arrest of G(1) phase were caused not by formation of G-quadruplex structures but by activation of GSK-3beta followed by degradation of beta-catenin.
