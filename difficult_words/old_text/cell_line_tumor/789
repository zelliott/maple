Estrogens exert neuroprotective activity in both in vivo and in vitro model systems. Herein, we report that both 17beta-estradiol and low concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) attenuate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced toxicity in SK-N-SH cells, which express the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). 17beta-estradiol rapidly induced an increase in NO levels. A nNOS inhibitor was able to block the neuroprotection of 17beta-estradiol. Cyclic guanylyl mono-phosphate (cGMP) also protected against H2O2 induced toxicity, while NO's protection was attenuated by ODQ, a soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor. In SK-N-SH cells, the major estrogen receptor isoforms is estrogen receptor beta. Our current study suggests that increased activity of nNOS may be involved in the neuroprotection conferred by 17beta-estradiol.
