Combination therapy is considered a promising therapeutic modality in enhancing             treatment efficacy. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway             is almost universally dysregulated in breast cancer, with specific occurrence             of PTEN mutations; thus, it has become an attractive target for cancer treatment.             However, the use of single targeted therapeutics against the PI3K/AKT pathway             has demonstrated only modest clinical benefits. In this study, recombinant adenovirus-mediated             gene transfer of PTEN (AD-PTEN) combined with treatment with LY294002 was utilized             to evaluate the effects of suppression of breast cancer cell proliferation. Herein,             we show that AD-PTEN significantly enhanced the sensitization of breast cancer             cells to LY294002. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of LY294002             were significantly decreased to a greater extent in cells transfected with combination             therapy. In addition, treatment of AD-PTEN-transfected cells with LY294002 resulted             in significantly reduced cell viability and invasion ability compared to single             LY294002 treatment. Using western blotting, we found that combination treatment             resulted in lower levels of phosphorylated AKTSer473 and GSK-3βSer9 than single             treatment with LY294002. Furthermore, we showed a significant decrease in nuclear             β-catenin, Fra-1, Tcf-4 and c-Myc by combination treatment. Our results indicate             that AD-PTEN sensitization of breast cancer to LY294002 is achieved by increased             GSK-3β activity, thus resulting in inhibition of the β-catenin signaling pathway.
