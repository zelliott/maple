Caspase-8 governs multiple cell responses to the microenvironmental cues. However, its integration of "death-life" signalings remains elusive. In our study, the role of caspase-8-Src is well-established as a promoter for migration or metastasis in Casp8(+)Src(+) A549/H226 cells in vivo and in vitro. In particular for nude mice models, mice implanted with Casp8(+)Src(+) A459/H226 cells remarkably increased spontaneous tumor metastatic burden with a significant survival disadvantage. Additionally, we detect that Src-mediated caspase-8 phosphorylation stimulates Src phosphorylation at Tyr-416 via the linkage of Src SH2 domain with phosph-Tyr-380 site of caspase-8. In turn, activated Src can efficiently induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypic features to promote tumor cells metastasis. Surprisingly, RXDLL motif deletion in the DEDa of caspase-8 attenuates tumor cell migration or metastasis via impairing the recruitment of caspase-8 into the cellular periphery where activated Src is subject to caspase-8 phosphorylation. Together, a simple model is that the peripherization of caspase-8 is well-poised to facilitate Src-mediated caspase-8 phosphrylation at Tyr-380, then binding of phospho-Tyr380 of caspase-8 to Src SH2 domain may maintain Src in an active conformation to induce EMT phenotype, a key step toward cancer metastasis.
