The general properties of the taurine uptake in human endometrial tumoral Ishikawa cells were similar to those usually found in other tissues. Uptake was notably affected by the oxygen pressure, being higher at the physiological pO(2) of the endometrium (40 mm Hg, equivalent to 5% O(2)) compared to that used under standard experimental culture conditions (160 mm Hg or 20% O(2)). Uptake of taurine was also density-dependent in Ishikawa cells and was significantly decreased at confluence. Uptake regulation by PKC driven phosphorylation occurs only in growing cells and not in resting cells. The taurine uptake of three Ishikawa cell lines was very different. The taurine uptake of one of the cell lines was affected by estradiol, probably through a non-genomic pathway, whereas tamoxifen had no effect in all cell lines.
