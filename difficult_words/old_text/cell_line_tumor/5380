To explore the effects of c-Met-siRNA on the proliferation, movement and invasion of laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells in vitro.

Firstly, the pSilencer 2.0/c-Met-shRNA recombinant plasmid was transfected into laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells with transfecting agent of cationic liposome Lipofectamine 2000. Secondly,the transfection efficacy was tested by RT-PCR and Western-Blot, then the most inhibitive c-Met-siRNA sequence was elected. Cell proliferation, movement and invasion were detected with MTT, cell migration assay and cell invasion assay, respectively.

After the transfection of pSilencer 2.0/c-Met-shRNA recombinant plasmid into laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells, the expression of mRNA and protein of c-Met decreased significantly in Hep-2 cells, and ability of the proliferation, movement and invasion of laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells were also inhibited.

The results indicated that c-Met-siRNA can down-regulated the expression of c-Met and markedly inhibited laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cell proliferation, movement and invasion. It may have the potential as a therapeutic modality to treat human laryngeal carcinoma.
