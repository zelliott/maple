Two series of simplified analogs of the ecteinascidin-saframycin type alkaloids were prepared from l-DOPA. Their in vitro antitumor activity was tested against three human cancer cell lines (HCT-8 colon carcinoma, Bel-7402 liver carcinoma, and BGC-823 gastric carcinoma). Among these compounds, the ester analogs have stronger activities than those of amide analogs in general. Among them, 1-naphthalene carboxylate ester analog 31 has the strongest activity against BGC-823 cells.
