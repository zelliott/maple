To investigate the role of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) on the proliferation and apoptosis in glioma stem cells.

Stem cells were isolated from a human glioma cell line U87 by using vincristine and characterized by immunofluorescence assay. Proliferation and apoptosis were determined by soft agar colony assay and flow cytometry; Cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and Bax were detected by Western blot analysis.

BMP4 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in U87 glioma stem cells. Moreover, Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1 expression were decreased by BMP4, while Bax level was elevated.

BMP4 can inhibit U87 glioma stem cells proliferation through downregulating Cyclin D1 level, and promote apoptosis through induction of Bax expression and inhibition of Bcl-2 level. It suggests that BMP4 plays an important role in human glioma stem cell biology.
