Because splice variants of a gene with multiple isoforms give rise to proteins with different functions, it seems plausible that changes in the expression levels of the splice variants could be a contributing factor to disease. In fact, recent examples in the literature clearly illustrate that altered expression levels of splice variants may play an important role in disease. Furthermore, these works demonstrate that changes in expression levels could potentially be used to (1) monitor disease progression, (2) diagnose disease, and/or (3) determine disease state. In this work an immobilized form of PCR, known as polony technology, was adapted to quantify the relative expression levels of splice variants. Specifically, the relative expression levels of the two splice variants of the oncogene K-ras, namely, K-RAS2A and K-RAS2B, were determined using polony technology.
