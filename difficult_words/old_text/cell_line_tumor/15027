Recent data suggest that hydroxytyrosol, a phenolic compound of virgin olive oils, has anticancer activity. This communication reports the synthesis of decyl and hexadecyl hydroxytyrosyl ethers, as well as the cytotoxic activity of hydroxytyrosol and a series of seven hydroxytyrosol alkyl ether derivatives against A549 lung cancer cells and MRC5 non-malignant lung fibroblasts. Hydroxytyrosyl dodecyl ether (HTDE) showed the highest selective cytotoxicity, and possible mechanisms of action were investigated; results suggest that HTDE can moderately inhibit glycolysis, induce oxidative stress, and cause DNA damage in A549 cells. The combination of HTDE with the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil induced a synergistic cytotoxicity in A549 cancer cells but not in non-malignant MRC5 cells. HTDE also displayed selective cytotoxicity against MCF7 breast cancer cells versus MCF10 normal breast epithelial cells in the 1-30 Î¼M range. These results suggest that the cytotoxicity of HTDE is more potent and selective than that of parent compound hydroxytyrosol.
