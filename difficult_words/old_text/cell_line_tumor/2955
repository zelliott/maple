The gene PNAS4 is a high conservative gene that shares high homology of sequence in various organisms from plants to animals. We found overexpression of human PNAS4 induced apoptosis and arrested cell cycle in S phase in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. In C57BL/6 mice model of Lewis lung carcinoma, overexpression of mouse PNAS4 significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival time through induction of tumor cell apoptosis, exhibiting effective antitumor. Our original investigations in vitro and vivo indicated PNAS4 is a novel pro-apoptosis gene, which could be used as a potential target of cancer biotherapy in future.
