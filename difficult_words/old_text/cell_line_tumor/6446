To develop a clinically relevant immunocompetent murine model to study pancreatic cancer using two different syngeneic pancreatic cancer cell lines and to assess MRI for its applicability in this model.

Two cell lines, 6606PDA and Panc02, were employed for the experiments. Cell proliferation and migration were monitored in vitro. Matrigelâ„¢ was tested for its role in tumor induction. Tumor cell growth was assessed after orthotopic injection of tumor cells into the pancreatic head of C57/BL6 mice by MRI and histology.

Proliferation and migration of Panc02 were significantly faster than those of 6606PDA. Matrigel did not affect tumor growth/migration but prevented tumor cell spread after injection thus avoiding undesired peritoneal tumor growth. MRI could reliably monitor longitudinal tumor growth in both cell lines: Panc02 had a more irregular finger-like growth, and 6606PDA grew more spherically. Both tumors showed local invasiveness. Histologically, Panc02 showed a sarcoma-like undifferentiated growth pattern, whereas 6606PDA displayed a moderately differentiated glandular tumor growth. Panc02 mice had a significantly shorter (28 days) survival than 6606PDA mice (50 days).

This model closely mimics human pancreatic cancer. MRI was invaluable for longitudinal monitoring of tumor growth thus reducing the number of mice required. Employing two different cell lines, this model can be used for various treatment and imaging studies.
