Five geranyl dihydrochalcones, 1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-{4-hydroxy-6,6,9-trimethyl-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-5-yl}-1-propanone (2), 1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-[3,4-dihydro-3,8-dihydroxy-2-methyl-2-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-5-yl]-1-propanone (4), 1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-[8-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(3,4-epoxy-4-methyl-1-pentenyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-5-yl]-1-propanone (5), 1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-[8-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentenyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-5-yl]-1-propanone (8), and 2-[6-hydroxy-3,7-dimethylocta-2(E),7-dienyl]-2',3,4,4'-tetrahydroxydihydrochalcone (9), along with four known geranyl flavonoids (1, 3, 6, 7), were isolated from the leaves of Artocarpus altilis. Their structures were established by spectroscopic means and by comparison with the literature values. Compounds 2, 4, and 9 exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against SPC-A-1, SW-480, and SMMC-7721 human cancer cells.
