The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between proliferation inhibition and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by Licochalcone A (LCA). Cell viability was evaluated using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Intracellular ROS level was assessed using the 2, 7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) probe and dihydroethidium (DHE) probe assay. The results indicate that LCA inhibits human bladder cancer T24 proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of approximately 55 Î¼M. The LCA-induced ROS production is inhibited by the co-treatment of LCA and free radical scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), on the contrary, the proliferation rate and ROS production increase when treated by the combination of LCA and L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO). The ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) decreases in a concentration-dependent manner. The results suggest that LCA inhibits proliferation by increasing intracellular ROS levels resulted in an oxidative stress status in T24 cells.
