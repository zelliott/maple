Curcumin nanoparticles of less than 50 nm in diameter are accessible using a continuous flow microfluidic rotating tube processor (RTP) under scalable conditions, at room temperature. A mixture of DDAB and Pluronic F127 renders higher stability of the curcumin nanoparticles in physiological pH 7.4 for up to eight hours. The nanoparticles have enhanced cytotoxicity in estrogens receptor negative and positive breast cancer cell lines compared with free curcumin.
