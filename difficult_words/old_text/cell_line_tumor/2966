2,3-Dimethoxy-8,9-methylenedioxybenzo[i]phenanthridine and a few of its 12-substituted analogs are active as TOP1-targeting agents. Studies were performed to further evaluate the potential of this series of non-camptothecin TOP1-targeting agents. The influence of a hydroxymethyl, formyl, N,N-dimethylaminomethyl, 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl, 3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl), and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)butyl substituent at the 12-position on TOP1-targeting activity and tumor cell growth was evaluated. In addition, the relative pharmacologic activities of the 12-carboxamide analog, as well as its N-methyl and N,N-dimethyl derivatives were assessed.
