Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is up-regulated in the vast majority of human tumors. The up-regulation of VEGF not only plays important roles in tumor angiogenesis, but also provides a target for tumor treatment with small interfering RNA (siRNA) that targets VEGF; however, it is unclear whether a quite high up-regulation of VEGF will affect the efficiency of RNA interference strategies targeting VEGF. A high level expression of VEGF was found in CNE cells from a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line. In this study, we investigate whether VEGF-specific siRNAs can effectively suppress VEGF expression in CNE cells, and study the methods for the use of VEGF-specific siRNAs as potential therapeutic agents. CNE cells with high VEGF expression induced by hypoxia were transfected with VEGF-specific siRNAs. The expression of VEGF was effectively suppressed by VEGF-specific siRNAs, measured by ELISA, Western blot analysis and RT-PCR. Furthermore, experiments in nude mice bearing nasopharyngeal carcinoma xenograft were initiated 5 d after injection of CNE cells. VEGF-specific siRNAs were modified with 2'-deoxy, then injected into the tumors, and a liposome-mediated siRNA transfection system and ultrasound exposure were used to help delivery of the siRNAs. Tumor growth was reduced significantly after 3 weeks' treatment. These studies suggest that VEGF-specific siRNAs still can effectively suppress VEGF expression even in tumor cell lines with a relatively high level of VEGF expression, such as CNE, and VEGF-specific siRNAs modified with 2'-deoxy can be used as potential agents for tumor therapy.
