90K/Mac-2 binding protein is a cell adhesive protein whose level of expression has been correlated with metastatic potential in many different tumor types. The purpose of this investigation was to examine 90K expression in prostate cancer and to determine a possible role for 90K in cancer progression.

90K expression in prostate cell lines and tissue samples was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Expression in cell lines was also evaluated by Western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR. Induction of promatrilysin by 90K was evaluated by ELISA.

Some of the human prostate cell lines studied expressed 90K. 90K was over-expressed in 38.8% of prostate cancer tumor samples, 7.14% of PIN lesions, and 18.6% of normal tissue. 90K was also shown to induce promatrilysin expression in the prostate cell line, LNCaP.

These data demonstrate that 90K is over-expressed in a large fraction of malignant tumors. The fact that 90K can induce expression of promatrilysin indicates a possible role for 90K in cancer progression and metastasis. This suggests that 90K over-expression may be a useful marker for examining prostate cancer progression.
