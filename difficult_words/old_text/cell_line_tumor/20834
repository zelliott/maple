To decrease bax expression by RNA interference, and inhibite the apoptosis in glioma cells induced by aluminum.

We had designed three siRNA sequences, and transfected them into glioma cells. The optimal sequence was selected based on the results of cell viability at various transfection concentrations and different transfection times. Fluorescent staining was used to detect the transfection efficiency, interference efficiency was determined by QRT-PCR method, and protein expression was measured with immunohistochemistry.

The optimal siRNA sequence was selected based on the cell viability. The transfection efficiency was above 90%, the interference efficiency of bax gene was 62.3%, and the optimal transfection time was 72h after transfection, the optimal transfection concentration was 20nmol/L, besides, there was a significant decrease in Bax protein content after transfection.

The optimal bax siRNA sequence can effectively inhibit the expression of bax gene and Bax protein, which may decrease apoptosis in aluminum-induced toxicity.
