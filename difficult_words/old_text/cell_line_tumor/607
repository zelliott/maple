To study the feasibility of ovarian tumor cells lysates pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) in the immunotherapy of tumor prevention via cytotoxic test in-vitro.

Forty rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: experimental and control groups. Ten rats from each group were killed and DCs were isolated and cultured. Frozen-thawed antigen of in the study group, rat's Ovarian cancer cells of the line NuTu-19 were cultured, freeze-melt antigens were added at day 3. Two groups co-cultured with T lymphocytes from the other rat's spleen on the 14th day. Then observed the shape of DCs, contrasted the proliferation and killing rate.

In the study group, DCs could significantly stimulate T lymphocytes multiplication and produce tumor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). When the ratios of stimulating cells (SC) to reaction cells (RC) were 1:3, 1:10, 1:30 and 1:100, the stimulating index (SI) in the study group were much higher than those in control group ( p<0.01). When the ratios of SC is the same with RC (SC:RC=3:1, 10:1, 30:1): the killing and wounding rate to tumor cells of study group [(40.9+/-1.2)%, (69.8+/-1.8)%, (89.0+/-0.4%)] is significantly higher than those of control group [(30.9+/-1.9)%, (34.4+/-2.1)%, (51.0+/-1.5)%] (P < 0.01).

DC could activate T lymphocytes proliferation and produce CTL to kill and wound tumor cells in-vitro.
