Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is characterized by late diagnosis due to lack of early symptoms, extensive metastasis, and high resistance to chemo/radiation therapy. Recently, a subpopulation of cells within pancreatic cancers, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), has been characterized and postulated to be the drivers for pancreatic cancer and responsible for metastatic spread. Further studies on pancreatic CSCs are therefore of particular importance to identify novel diagnosis markers and therapeutic targets for this dismal disease. Herein, the malignant phenotype of pancreatic cancer stem-like CD24+CD44+ cells was isolated from a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line (PANC-1) and demonstrated 4-fold increased invasion ability compared to CD24-CD44+ cells. Using lectin microarray and nano LC-MS/MS, we identified a differentially expressed set of glycoproteins between these two subpopulations. Lectin microarray analysis revealed that fucose- and galactose-specific lectins, UEA-1 and DBA, respectively, exhibit distinctly strong binding to CD24+CD44+ cells. The glycoproteins extracted by multilectin affinity chromatography were consequently analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Seventeen differentially expressed glycoproteins were identified, including up-regulated Cytokeratin 8/CK8, Integrin Î²1/CD29, ICAM1/CD54, and Ribophorin 2/RPN2 and down-regulated Aminopeptidase N/CD13. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays showed that CD24 was significantly associated with late-stage pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and RPN2 was exclusively coexpressed with CD24 in a small population of CD24-positive cells. However, CD13 expression was dramatically decreased along with tumor progression, preferentially present on the apical membrane of ductal cells and vessels in early stage tumors. Our findings suggest that these glycoproteins may provide potential therapeutic targets and promising prognostic markers for pancreatic cancer.
