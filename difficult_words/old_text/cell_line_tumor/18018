To establish a human ovarian cancer-bearing mouse model via orthotopic transplantation of human HO-8910 cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP).

GFP-expressing human ovarian carcinoma HO8910/GFP cells (2 x 10(6)) in exponential phase of growth were inoculated subcutaneously in nude mice, and the generated tumor tissues were collected and transplanted below the capsule of the left ovary of 6 nude mice. The growth of the tumors was observed in vivo using a fluorescence stereomicroscope. The nude mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after transplantation to assess the tumor growth and metastasis.

The tumors showed progressive growth at the orthotopic sites in all animals. Two weeks after the transplantation, green fluorescent mass was observed at the left costovertebral angle, and the mass increased thereafter and invaded or metastasized to the peritoneum, omentum, spleen, liver, uterus, and the pelvic lymph nodes, with a metastatic rate as much as 66.7%.

The nude mouse model bearing orthotopic human ovarian carcinoma expressing GFP has been successfully established.
