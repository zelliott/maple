In the search for anticancer compounds against human cancer cells (A549, SK-OV-3, SK-MEL-2, XF498, HCT15), it was found that the chloroform extracts obtained from the whole plant food of Carpesium rosulatum MlQ exhibited significant anticancer activity. The structures and stereochemistry of these compounds were established on the basis of analysis of spectra including melting point, [α](D)(25), infrared, ultraviolet, electron ionization mass spectrometry, mass spectrometry, (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance, (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance and some chemical transformations as follows: compound 1, 4β,10α-dihydroxy-guaia-8α,12-olide; compound 2, 4β,10α-dihydroxy-1(2),11(13)-guaiadien-8α,12-olide; and compound 3, 3β,8β-dihydroxy-1α,5α-guaian-10(14)-ene-6α,12-olide. Anticancer activity of compounds obtained from C. rosulatum on five tumor cells line was evaluated by sulforhodamine B methods. Compound 2 was significantly effective on the five human tumor cell lines.
