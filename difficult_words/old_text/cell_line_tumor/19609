The ability to induce cell cycle progression while evading cell death is a defining characteristic of cancer. Deregulation of E2F is a common event in most human cancers. Paradoxically, this can lead to both cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Although the way in which E2F causes cell cycle progression is well characterized, the pathways by which E2F induces cell death are less well defined. Many of the known mechanisms through which E2F induces apoptosis occur through regulation of E2F target genes. However, mutants of E2F-1 that lack the transactivation domain are still able to induce cell death. To further investigate this activity, we refined a transactivation independent mutant to identify a minimal apoptotic domain. This revealed that only 75 amino acids from within the DNA-binding domain of E2F-1 is sufficient for cell death and that this activity is also present in the DNA-binding domains of E2F-2 and E2F-3. However, analysis of this domain from E2F-1 revealed it does not bind DNA and is consequently unable to transactivate, repress or de-repress E2F target genes. This provocative observation therefore defines a potential new mechanism of death from E2F and opens up new opportunities for inducing cell death in tumours for therapeutic gain.
