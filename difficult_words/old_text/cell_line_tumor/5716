The present study describes the antiproliferative properties of Iris pseudopumila flowers and rhizomes extracts and fourteen constituents isolated from them. The in vitro cytotoxic activity assay against two human cancer cell lines, large lung carcinoma (CORL-23) and amelanotic melanoma (C32), showed that the most antiproliferative extract was the MeOH extract from flowers with a percentage of inhibition of 50.9 at 100 microg/ml against amelanotic melanoma cells. The most antiproliferative compounds against amelanotic melanoma cells were kaempferol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and irisolidone with a percentage of inhibition of 100 and 96.6, respectively, and against large lung carcinoma cells with a percentage of inhibition of 82.1 and 84.6, respectively. Significant activity on the amelanotic melanoma cell line was also showed by irigenin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, with a percentage of inhibition of 89.3. The compounds isovitexin and isoorientin-6-O''-beta-D-glucopyranoside showed a selective activity against amelanotic melanoma cells with a percentage of inhibition of 83.2 and 79.8, respectively.
