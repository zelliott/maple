Non-viral gene vectors have attracted much attention recently due to setbacks with viral delivery systems. Here a new non-viral delivery system based on nanobiohybrids synthesized by the intercalation of a full gene and promoter encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) between the layers of an inorganic host is reported. The nanobiohybrids were delivered to 9L glioma cells, JEG3 choriocarcinoma placental cells, and cardiac myocytes. All cells were able to internalize and tolerate the nanobiohybrids. In addition, all cells expressed the gene with some cell lines having up to 90% transfection efficiency. This new, bio-mimetic delivery system shows promise for use in non-viral gene therapy.
