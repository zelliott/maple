To investigate the persistence of side population (SP) cells in pancreatic cancer and their role and mechanism in the drug resistance.

The presentation of side population cells in pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 and its proportion change when cultured with Gemcitabine, was detected by Hoechst 33342 staining and FACS analysis. The expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 was detected by real-time PCR in either SP cells or non-SP cells.

SP cells do exist in PANC-1, with a median of 3.3% and a range of 2.1-8.7%. After cultured with Gemcitabine for 3 d, the proportion of SP cells increased significantly (3.8% +/- 1.9%, 10.7% +/- 3.7%, t = 4.616, P = 0.001 < 0.05). ABCB1 and ABCG2 expressed at higher concentrations in SP as compared with non-SP cells (ABCB1: 1.15 +/- 0.72, 5.82 +/- 1.16, t = 10.839, P = 0.000 < 0.05; ABCG2: 1.16 +/- 0.75, 5.48 +/- 0.94, t = 11.305, P = 0.000 < 0.05), which may contribute to the efflux of fluorescent staining and drug resistance.

SP cells with inherently high resistance to chemotherapeutic agents do exist in pancreatic cancers, which may be candidate cancer stem cells contributing to the relapse of the tumor.
