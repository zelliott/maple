Kaposi's sarcoma is an angioproliferative tumor caused by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection of vascular endothelial cells. Fibulins, proteins that associate with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, may have both tumor-suppressive and oncogenic activities. We found that the expression of fibulin-2 protein and mRNA were decreased 50-fold and 26-fold, respectively, in 10-day KSHV-infected dermal microvascular endothelial cells (DMVEC). Using quantitative RT-PCR, we found a fivefold and 25-fold decrease of fibulin-2 extracellular matrix binding partners, fibronectin and tropoelastin, respectively. Time-course transcriptional analyses over 10 days showed that in addition to that of fibulin-2, expression of fibulins 3 and 5 was decreased in KSHV-infected DMVEC, fibulins 1C/1D were increased, and fibulins 4, 6, and 7 were unchanged. KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) transcription levels rose consistently over the same period. Addition of recombinant fibulin-3 or -5 for 48 hours to 10-day KSHV-infected cells caused a suppression of KSHV-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein and mRNA levels. Recombinant fibulin-3 also significantly reduced VEGF receptor 3 expression. In pleural effusion lymphoma cell lines that express variable levels of KSHV lytic replication, we observed no detectable fibulin-2 or -5 expression. Finally, fibulin-2 expression was decreased in tissue microarrays from KSHV-infected, LANA-positive patient cells as compared to that in patient nontumor controls. Understanding the interactions between KSHV and the fibulins may lead to the development of novel therapies for treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma.
