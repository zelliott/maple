Antitumor activity of a new highly active promising gestagen 17alpha-acetoxy-3beta-butanoyloxy-6-methyl-pregna-4,6-dien-20-one (butagest) was studied in mice with model cervical carcinoma (RShM-5). The reference drug was medroxyprogesteron acetate (MPA, Depo Provera) used in clinics. The new preparation introduced perorally in a dose of 1 mg per mice inhibited the model tumor growth by 73%, which was 18% (p < 0.01) more effective than the action of the reference drug MPA. The effect of the new gestagen was also studied in vitro with respect to human breast carcinoma of the MCF-7 line and human cervical carcinoma HeLa. The viability of the tumor cells was studied during a 6-day incubation with the drug at a concentration of 10(-7)-10(-5) M (MTT test). The reference compounds were progesterone and MPA. These drugs suppressed the growth of both MCF-7 and, in higher concentrations, of HeLa. Butagest inhibited the growth of HeLa in all concentrations. Thus, the new gestagen 17alpha-acetoxy-3beta-butanoyloxy-6-methyl-pregna-4,6-dien-20-one is capable of suppressing the viability of human breast carcinoma and human cervical carcinoma, being comparable or even more effective than the reference drugs.
