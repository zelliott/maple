TGF-β is a mediator of lung fibrosis and regulates the alveolar epithelial type II cell phenotype. TGF-β can induce epithelial mesenchymal transition of idiopathic pulmonary disease and cancer metastasis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-alpha (PGC-1 α) is a key metabolic regulator that stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and promotes remodeling of muscle tissue to oxidative fiber-type composition. Here, we report that the induction of TGF-β decreased mRNA expression of PGC-1α, and PGC-1 target genes, such as the transcription factors NRF-2, ERR-α, and PPAR-γ in lung epithelial A549 cells. In addition, TGF-β led to the reduction of super oxide dismutase 2 (anti-oxidant enzyme), cytochrome C (electron transport chain in mitochondria), and MCAD (a mitochondrial β-oxidant enzyme) in A549 cells. Together, our results suggest that TGF-β may suppress the transcriptional activity of the genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis or function. This mechanism may provide a novel insight into the understanding of fibrosis disease.
