To elucidate the effects of hyperthermic CO2 pneumoperitoneum on human gastric AGS cells.

Based on a newly devised in vitro study model, we evaluated the anti-cancer effects of HT-CO2 (42-44 degrees C for 2-4h) on human gastric cancer cells, and also the corresponding mechanisms.

HT-CO2 (42-44 degrees C for 2-4h) severely inhibited cell proliferation as assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, while inducing apoptosis in a temperature- and time-dependent manner demonstrated by annexin-V/PI flow cytometry and morphological analysis (Hoechst/PI fluorescence). In addition, it was found that HT-CO2 (42-44 degrees C for 2-4h) promoted the up-regulation of Bax by western blotting. Significantly, it could also suppress gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis by in vitro invasion and motility assay.

In conclusion, HT-CO2 had an efficacious cytotoxic effect on gastric cancer cells through Bax-induced mitochondrial apoptotic signaling. Our studies indicate that it may serve as a potential therapy for peritoneal carcinomatosis of gastric cancer. Further investigations in vivo using animal models are now urgently needed.
