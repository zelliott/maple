Despite extensive preclinical evaluation in several experimental models, no studies have determined the effect of idarubicin and its metabolite idarubicinol on multicellular spheroids, a model which mimics the microregions of solid tumors. The principal aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro cytotoxicity of idarubicin and its metabolite idarubicinol on MCF-7 breast cancer cells growing as monolayers or multicellular spheroids and to evaluate the influence of the length of exposure on the cytotoxic effect of both drugs. Cytoxicity was evaluated on monolayer and spheroid cultures exposed to idarubicin and idarubicinol 0.01-1000 ng/ml for 24 h or treated for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h to 100 ng/ml of both drugs. The IC50 of idarubicin and idarubicinol were 3.3+/-0.4 and 3.6+/-0.7 ng/ml, respectively, on MCF-7 monolayers and 7.9+/-1.1 and 5.3+/-0.7 ng/ml in multicellular spheroids, respectively. The antiproliferative effects of 100 ng/ml idarubicin and idarubicinol on MCF-7 spheroids was characterized by a marked time-dependence, which was less evident on MCF-7 growing as monolayer. In conclusion, the present experimental data demonstrate, for the first time, that idarubicin and idarubicinol have significant cytotoxic activity against multicellular spheroids, comparable to the antiproliferative effects on monolayer cells. In contrast, spheroids displayed substantial resistance after short exposure times that was not present in the two dimensional cultures.
