Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp/ABCB1) in tumor cells is associated with a classic phenotype of multidrug resistance (MDR). Moreover, some members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, such as survivin, contribute to an apoptosis-resistant phenotype, by inhibiting chemotherapy-induced cell death and promoting MDR. By using Western blotting, qRT-PCR, Annexin V and immunofluorescence assays we have demonstrated a relationship between Pgp and survivin in a prior sensitive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line (K562). A high dose of vincristine induced a concomitant overexpression of Pgp and survivin, which was associated with a low apoptotic index in the K562 cell line. In addition, we observed a cytoplasmic co-localization of Pgp and survivin, suggesting a functional association between these two proteins in apoptosis control by a common mechanism. In summary, our data suggest that Pgp and survivin should be analyzed in aggregate because they may have significant impact on drug resistance in CML cells.
