Some simplified adociaquinone B analogs and a series of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives were synthesized and tested against the three enzymes Cdc25B, MKP-1, and MKP-3. Cdc25B and MKP-1 in particular are enzymes overexpressed in human cancer cells, and they represent potential molecular targets for novel cancer chemotherapeutic treatments. A number of analogs exhibited significant inhibitory activity against these enzymes, and the bioassay data in addition to structure-activity relationships of these compounds will be discussed.
