Two new aminophenoxazinone compounds with antitumor activity, elloxazinone A and B, were isolated from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces griseus Acta 2871. Their chemical structures were determined by mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray analysis. Elloxazinones A and B showed a moderate inhibition of the proliferation of human cells from gastric adenocarcinoma in vitro but a strong inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma cells whereas elloxazinone B strongly inhibited the proliferation of human breast carcinoma cells.
