Recent researches found that an abundant production of mucin protein well correlates with tumor cell metastasis. This study was to investigate inhibitory effect of benzyl-alpha-GalNAc on production of mucin 1 (MUC1), and on adhesion and invasion of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.

MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with benzyl-alpha-GalNAc, expression of MUC1 was detected by immunohistochemistry, adhesive ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to artificial basement membrane Matrigel was measured by MTT assay. Gelatin zymography was performed to detect the secretion changes of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9.

Compared with control cells, the tumor cells deglycosylated by benzyl-alpha-GalNAc showed lower expression of MUC1 (P < 0.05), and less adhesion to the Matrigel (P< 0.01), the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 suppressed (P< 0.05).

The expression of MUC1 correlates to adhesion and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, benzyl-alpha-GalNAc may weaken adhesion and type IV collagenase-secreting activity of MDA-MB-231 cells by inhibiting MUC1.
