The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway has been implicated in diverse cellular functions. ERK and its activating kinase, mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), are downstream of cell surface receptors known to be up-regulated in many malignant gliomas. We sought to investigate the role of ERK in glioma cell migration, proliferation and differentiation using the rat-derived C6 glioma cell line and the MEK inhibitor, U0126. Treatment of C6 cells with U0126 caused a significant concentration-dependent reduction in cell proliferation and migration and also induced expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker of astrocytic differentiation. These results suggest that the ERK pathway regulates glioma cell proliferation, migration and differentiation.
