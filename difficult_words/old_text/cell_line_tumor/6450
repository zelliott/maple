Curcumin (CU) loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) of fatty acids (FA) were prepared with a coacervation technique based on FA precipitation from their sodium salt micelles in the presence of polymeric non-ionic surfactants. Myristic, palmitic, stearic, and behenic acids, and different polymers with various molecular weights and hydrolysis grades were employed as lipid matrixes and stabilisers, respectively. Generally, spherical-shaped nanoparticles with mean diameters below 500 nm were obtained, and using only middle-high hydrolysis, grade-polymer SLNs with diameters lower than 300 nm were produced. CU encapsulation efficiency was in the range 28-81% and highly influenced by both FA and polymer type. Chitosan hydrochloride was added to FA SLN formulations to produce bioadhesive, positively charged nanoparticles. A CU-chitosan complex formation could be hypothesised by DSC analysis, UV-vis spectra and chitosan surface tension determination. A preliminary study on HCT-116 colon cancer cells was developed to evaluate the influence of CU-loaded FA SLNs on cell viability.
