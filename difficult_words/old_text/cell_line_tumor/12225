A number of studies performed in our laboratory and elsewhere, showed that resveratrol is able to prevent carcinogenesis and to impair tumor growth and progression. In order to provide additional information on the pleiotropic effects of resveratrol on malignant cells, the present study was performed to test the in vitro influence of the compound on the growth and TLMA of HT-29 and WiDr human colon cancer cell lines. The results confirmed that resveratrol has a direct, dose dependent, inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in both lines. In addition, for the first time, relatively high concentrations of this compound were found to be able to substantially down-regulate telomerase activity. These preliminary results further support the potential role of resveratrol in chemoprevention/chemotherapy of human colon tumor cells and provide the rational basis for novel strategies in cancer control.
