Sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) plays a crucial role in the trafficking and metabolism of cholesterol and other lipids in mammalian cells. Lipid hydroperoxides generated under oxidative stress conditions are relatively long-lived intermediates that damage cell membranes and play an important role in redox signaling. We hypothesized that SCP-2-facilitated translocation of lipid hydroperoxides in oxidatively stressed cells might enhance cytolethality if highly sensitive sites are targeted and detoxification capacity is insufficient. We tested this using a clone (SC2A) of rat hepatoma cells that overexpress mature immunodetectable SCP-2. When challenged with liposomal cholesterol-7alpha-hydroperoxide (7alpha-OOH), SC2A cells were found to be much more sensitive to viability loss than vector control (VC) counterparts. Correspondingly, SC2A cells imported [14C]7alpha-OOH more rapidly. The clones were equally sensitive to tert-butyl hydroperoxide, suggesting that the 7alpha-OOH effect was SCP-2-specific. Fluorescence intensity of the probes 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein and C11-BODIPY increased more rapidly in SC2A than VC cells after 7alpha-OOH exposure, consistent with more rapid internalization and oxidative turnover in the former. [14C]7alpha-OOH radioactivity accumulated much faster in SC2A mitochondria than in VC, whereas other subcellular fractions showed little rate difference. In keeping with this, 7alpha-OOH-stressed SC2A cells exhibited a faster loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and development of apoptosis. This is the first reported evidence that peroxidative stress damage can be selectively targeted and exacerbated by an intracellular lipid transfer protein.
