Osteosarcoma is characterized by high neovascularization and a high propensity for metastasis through bloodstream. This study was to examine whether there is evidence for vasculogenic mimicry in osteosarcoma and to illustrate mechanism of tumor blood vessels formation in osteosarcoma.

Osteosarcoma cell lines (U-2OS) were tested for their ability to form tubular networks in three-dimensional culture containing type I collagen. The structures of the tubular networks were observed with phase contrast microscope and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Morphometric studies using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain and CD31 immunohistochemical stain to show tumor-lined channels in human osteosarcoma were also performed.

Observation with light microscope and TEM showed that highly aggressive osteosarcoma cell lines (U-2OS) formed networks containing channels when grown in three-dimensional culture containing type I collagen, in the absence of endothelial cells or fibroblasts. Morphometric observation using HE stain and CD31 immunohistochemical stain showed that tumor cell-lined channels were also detected in vivo in osteosarcoma; by comparison, all vascular areas in the pedicle of osteochondroma or outside osteochondroma were endothelial-lined.

These observations strongly suggest that aggressive osteosarcoma cells may generate vascular channels that facilitate tumor perfusion independent of tumor angiogenesis and have the ability of vasculogenic mimicry.
