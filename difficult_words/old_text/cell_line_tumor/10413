Adoptive immunotherapy using chimeric antigen receptor-engrafted T cells is a promising emerging therapy for cancer. Prior to clinical testing, it is mandatory to evaluate human therapeutic cell products in meaningful in vivo pre-clinical models. Here, we describe the use of fused single-photon emission CT-CT imaging to monitor real-time migration of chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T cells in immune compromised (SCID Beige) mice. Following intravenous administration, human T cells migrate in a highly similar manner to that reported in man, but penetrate poorly into established tumors. By contrast, when delivered via intraperitoneal or subcutaneous routes, T cells remain at the site of inoculation with minimal systemic absorption-irrespective of the presence or absence of tumor. Together, these data support the validity of pre-clinical testing of human T-cell immunotherapy in SCID Beige mice. In light of their established efficacy, regional administration of engineered human T cells represents an attractive therapeutic option to minimize toxicity in the treatment of selected malignancies.
