Intercalation of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), an antineoplastic drug in interlayer gallery of Na(+)-clay (MMT) was further entrapped in poly (L-lactide) matrix to form microcomposite spheres (MPs) in order to reduce the cell toxicity and enhance in vitro release and pharmacokinetic proficiency. The drug-clay hybrid was fabricated via intercalation by ion-exchange method to form MPs from hybrid. In vitro drug release showed controlled pattern, fitted to kinetic models suggested controlled exchange and partial diffusion through swollen matrix of clay inter layered gallery. The in vitro efficacy of formulated composites drug was tested in Human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR32) by various cell cytotoxic and oxidative stress marker indices. In vivo pharmacokinetics suggested that the intensity of formulated drug level in plasma was within remedial borders as compared to free drug. These clay based composites therefore have great potential of becoming a new dosage form of 6-MP.
