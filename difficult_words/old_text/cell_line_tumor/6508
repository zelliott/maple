A key point for successful transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells in the treatment of leukemia is the purging technique, of which photodynamic therapy (PDT) proved effective and promising. The aim of this study was to evaluate the purging effect of a novel amphipathic photosensitizer, di-sulfo-di-phthalimidomethyl phthalolcyanine zinc (ZnPcS2P2)-based PDT (ZnPcS2P2-PDT) on murine erythroblastic leukemic EL9611 cells. Bone marrow cells (BMC), harvested from normal BALB/c mice, were contaminated with variable EL9611 cells. Cell suspensions were incubated with 4 microg/ml ZnPcS2P2 for 5 h and then exposed to 2.1 J/cm2 irradiation by a semiconductor laser 670 nm. Lethally irradiated recipient BALB/c mice (7 Gy) received syngeneic bone marrow transplantation with purged or nonpurged cell mixtures of 10(7) BMC contaminated with variable numbers (10(2)-10(5)) of EL9611 cells. All of the irradiated controls died due to sepsis. All of the mice injected with nonpurged cell mixtures developed leukemia and died, whereas the mice transplanted with ZnPcS2P2-PDT-treated mixtures had a longer survival time, and the fewer leukemic cells there were in the cell mixtures, the higher the leukemia-free survival rate. We conclude that ZnPcS2P2-PDT could purge leukemic cells from bone marrow autografts but could retain sufficient progenitor cells for the hematopoietic activity.
