Simplify, simplify, simplify! Pretubulysin (structure without the green substituents), a simplified tubulysin was prepared in the laboratory and also found in a natural myxobacterial source. This biosynthetic precursor of the tubulysins is not as active as tubulysins A and D but is still effective in picomolar concentrations against cancer cell lines.
