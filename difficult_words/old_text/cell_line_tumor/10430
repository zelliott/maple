To study the chemical constituents of Iodes cirrhosa and evaluate their bioactivity.

The compounds were isolated and purified by various kinds of column chromatography methods and their structures were determined by spectroscopic data analysis. Neuroprotective assay against serum deprivation induced SH-SYSY-JNK3 cell apoptosis was evaluated by MTr method while potassium channel-blocking activity was assayed in both non-specific and specific K+ channel-regulator screening models.

Twenty-one compounds were obtained from an EtOAc portion of an ethanolic extract of the root of I. cirrhosa. Their structures were elucidated as 1beta, 3beta-dihydroxyurs-9(11),12-diene(1), bauerenyl acetate(2),3beta-hydroxy-11-oxo-olean-12-enyl palmitate(3), 3beta-acetoxy-urs-12-ene-11-one(4), betulinic acid(5), stigmasta-5, 22-diene-3beta-ol(6), 7beta-hydroxystigmasterol(7), stigmasta-5, 22diene-3beta-ol3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside(8),scopoletin(9),scopolin(10),clovamide(11),methyl 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinate(12),3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid(13),2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone(14), protocatechualdehyde(15), vanillin(16), protocatechuic acid(17), vanillic acid(18),caffeic acid(19),azelaic acid(20),and succinic acid(21). Compound 3,4,6,9,10,14,15,18 and 20 showed neuroprotective activities against serum deprivation induced SH-SYSY-JNK3 cell apoptosis at a concentration of 1.0 x 10(6) mol x L(1) with relative protection rates of 177%, 144%, 137%, 137%, 143%, 145%, 137%, 189%, 130%, respectivley. Compound 16 could increase DiBAC4(3) fluorescence response in both non-specific and specific K+ channel-regulator screening models at the concentration of 1.0 x 10(-5) mol x L(-1).

Compound 1 was a new compound and all compounds were isolated from this genus for the first time. Compounds 3,4,6,9,10,14,15,18 and 20 showed neuroprotective activities while 16 exhibited K+ channel-blocking activity.
