Molecular pathogenesis of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HG-SOC) is poorly understood. Recent recognition of HG-SOC precursor lesions, defined as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) in fimbria, provides a new venue for the study of early genetic changes in HG-SOC. Using microRNA profiling analysis, we found that miR-182 expression was significantly higher in STIC than in matched normal Fallopian tube. Further study revealed that miR-182 was significantly overexpressed in most HG-SOC cases. To test whether miR-182 plays a major role in early tumourigenesis of HG-SOC, we overexpressed miR-182 in immortalized ovarian surface, Fallopian tube secretory cells and malignant ovarian cell lines, and found that miR-182 overexpression resulted in increased tumour transformation in vitro, and enhanced tumour invasiveness in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the oncogenic properties of miR-182 in ovarian cancer were mediated in part by its impaired repair of DNA double-strand breaks and negative regulation of breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) expression as well as its positive regulation of the oncogene high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2). Our findings suggest that miR-182 dysregulation confers powerful oncogenic potential in the tumourigenesis of HG-SOC. Copyright Â© 2012 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.
