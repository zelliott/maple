A series of novel ribavirin hydrazone derivatives were synthesized by the reaction of ribavirin hydrazone with benzaldehyde or acetophenone derivatives. The structures of the compounds were determined by IR, (1)H NMR, and HRESIMS. Preliminary biological evaluation showed that one compound (7h) inhibits the growth of A549 cells at 20microM.
