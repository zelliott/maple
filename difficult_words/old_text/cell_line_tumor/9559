The expression of wild-type and mutant p53 was studied in two fibrosarcoma cell lines in a mouse xenograft model.

Human cell lines HT1080 and Hs913(D)T were implanted in athymic mice via intramuscular (i.m.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) routes. After eight weeks, liver, lung and primary inoculation sites were harvested. Sections were stained using two methods: a) haematoxylin and eosin to detect tumour at implantation site, liver and lung; b) immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to detect expression of wild-type (wt) and mutant p53.

Both cell lines had similar implantation rates via either route but Hs913(D)T had a higher metastatic rate than HT1080. The Hs913(D)T cells exhibited greater expression of mutant and wild-type p53 than the HT1080 cells.

The expression of wild-type and mutant p53 is associated with a cell line of greater malignant potential. The inoculation route does not affect primary tumour uptake or metastatic rate.
