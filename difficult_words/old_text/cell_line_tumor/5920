Effects of magnetic fields (MFs) on cancer cells may depend on cell type and exposure conditions. Gene expression levels are different among cancer cells. However, the effect of MFs on cancer cells with different gene expressions is still unclear. In this study, the cancer cell lines BGC-823, MKN-45, MKN-28, A549, SPC-A1, and LOVO were exposed to a low-frequency MF. Specific parameters of MFs were determined. Furthermore, the potential of the MF to influence cancer cell growth with midkine (MK) expression was evaluated. Cell proliferation and cell cycle were detected using the CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. Cell ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy. BGC-823 cells with over-expression of MK (BGC-MK cells) and stanniocalcin-1 were generated by plasmid construction and transfection. Results showed that exposure to a 0.4-T, 7.5 Hz MF inhibited the proliferation of BGC-823, MKN-28, A549, and LOVO cells, but not MKN-45 and SPC-A1 cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of the MF on BGC-MK cells was lower (12.3%) than that of BGC-823 cells (20.3%). Analysis of the cell cycle showed that exposure to the MF led to a significant increase in the S phase in BGC-823 cells, but not in BGC-MK cells. In addition, organelle morphology was modified in BGC-823 cells exposed to the MF. These results suggest that exposure to a 0.4-T, 7.5 Hz MF could inhibit tumor cell proliferation and disturb the cell cycle. The alteration of MK expression in cancer cells may be related to the inhibitory effect of the MF on these cells.
