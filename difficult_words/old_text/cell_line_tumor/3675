The human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, was used to examine the effects of morphine and the endogenous opioid peptides, endomorphin-1 (EM-1) and endomorphin-2 (EM-2), on mu opioid receptor (MOR) internalization and down-regulation. Treatment for 24 h with EM-1, EM-2 or morphine at 100 nM, 1 microM and 10 microM resulted in a dose-dependent down-regulation of mu receptors. Exposure of cells to 10 microM EM-1 for 2.5, 5 and 24 h resulted in a time-dependent down-regulation of mu receptors. Down-regulation of mu receptors by morphine and EM-1 was blocked by treatment with hypertonic sucrose, consistent with an endocytosis-dependent mechanism. Sensitive cell-surface binding studies with a radiolabeled mu antagonist revealed that morphine was able to induce internalization of mu receptors naturally expressed in SH-SY5Y cells. EM-1 produced a more rapid internalization of mu receptors than morphine, but hypertonic sucrose blocked the internalization induced by each of these agonists. This study demonstrates that, like morphine, the endomorphins down-regulate mu opioid receptors in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This study also demonstrates that morphine, as well as EM-1, can induce rapid, endocytosis-dependent internalization of mu opioid receptors in SH-SY5Y cells. These results may help elucidate the ability of mu agonists to regulate the number and responsiveness of their receptors.
