To examine expression of survivin gene in ovarian epithelial carcinoma drug resistant cell line SKOV3/ADM and its parental cell line SKOV3, and induction of cells apoptosis and reversal of drug resistance in SKOV3/ADM after RNA interference (RNAi) silencing survivin gene.

The transcription of survivin gene in cells was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the protein expression level of survivin gene was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. SKOV3/ADM cells were treated with pshRNA-survivin and paclitaxel (Taxol), and acridine orange (AO)/ethidium bromide (EB) staining was performed to evaluate the apoptosis of cells.

Survivin gene mRNA expressed by 99.1% and 75.3% respectively in cell lines SKOV3/ADM and SKOV3, while fluorescent cells were 59 +/- 5 and 42 +/- 3 (P < 0.05). After the introduction of pshRNA-survivin into SKOV3/ADM, mRNA transcription level of survivin gene decreased distinctly from 99.1% to 7.9%. The apoptotic cells of control group detected by AO/EB staining was 3.6 +/- 0.6, of Taxol group 10.2 +/- 1.0, of RNAi group 48.5 +/- 4.9, of RNAi + Taxol group 71.5 +/- 6.8. Apoptosis ratio between RNAi + Taxol group and RNAi group had significant difference (P < 0.05), and that between RNAi + Taxol group and Taxol group also had significant difference (P < 0.05).

Both survivin gene mRNA and its protein are over-expressed in ovarian epithelial carcinoma cell lines SKOV3 and SKOV3/ADM, the level of survivin gene expressed in SKOV3/ADM is obviously different compared with that in its parental cell line SKOV3. RNA interference targeted against specific sequences of survivin in SKOV3/ADM cell could significantly reduce the level of survivin mRNA transcripts and protein, effectively induce the cells apoptosis and restore the sensitivity of cell to conventional chemotherapeutic agents Taxol.
