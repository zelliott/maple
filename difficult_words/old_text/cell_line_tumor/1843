The addition of tunicamycin to prostate cancer cells enhances cell death mediated by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). In this study, we investigated whether tunicamycin, an endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer, can potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. We evaluated the combination of tunicamycin and TRAIL and found synergistic promotion of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. The combined treatment with tunicamycin and TRAIL significantly induced apoptosis, and stimulated caspase-3, -8 and -9 activity, as well as the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. We found that tunicamycin promoted TRAIL-induced apoptosis by the upregulation of death receptor (DR)4 and DR5 and the downregulation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2). In addition, downregulation of cIAP2 expression using small interfering RNA significantly attenuated the apoptosis induced by TRAIL. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the combination of tunicamycin and TRAIL may provide a novel strategy for treating prostate cancer by overcoming critical mechanisms of apoptosis resistance.
