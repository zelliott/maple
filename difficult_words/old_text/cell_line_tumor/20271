The thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) gene is associated with the differentiation of lung epithelial cells and has been reported to be an independent prognostic factor for lung adenocarcinoma patients. The aim of the present study was to detect the expression of TTF-1 in human lung cancer cell lines and to evaluate the association of overexpressed TTF-1 with Ki-67 and apoptosis in the A549 cell line. We also investigated the expression of TTF-1 and Ki-67 in Xuanwei lung adenocarcinoma. TTF-1 mRNA expression was evaluated in 10 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Overexpression of TTF-1 in A549 cells was achieved by transient transfection. The TTF-1 and Ki-67 proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. We also investigated immunohistochemically the expression of TTF-1 and Ki-67 in 62 resected cases of Xuanwei lung adenocarcinoma. Overall the expression of TTF-1 mRNA in the 10 cell lines was low. Overexpression of TTF-1 mRNA was found only in 3 (30%) of 10 NSCLC cell lines, including 1 (25%) of 4 adenocarcinoma cell lines. A549 cells overexpressing TTF-1 were found to have repressed expression of Ki-67 (P=0.012) and increased apoptosis (P=0.000). Immunohistochemical analysis of resected cases of Xuanwei lung adenocarcinoma (n=62) showed the expression of TTF-1 in 58 (93%) of 62 and Ki-67 in 22 (35%) of 62. Patients with strong immunohistochemical expression TTF-1 were statistically associated with well-differentiated phenotype (P=0.006) and inverse correlation with Ki-67 expression (P=0.016). These data suggest that TTF-1 may serve as a tumor suppressor gene based on its inverse correlation with Ki-67 proliferative activity and increase of cellular apoptosis.
