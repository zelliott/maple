Ovarian carcinomas are highly invasive, especially in the peritoneal cavity. SDF-1α and its receptor, CXCR4, play a crucial role in migration of cancer cells. Here, SDF-1α directed HO8910 cell migration, but not SKOV3 cells. After being educated to express CXCR4 in vivo or by treating with sCD40L, SDF-1α reexhibited the ability of directing SKOV3 cell migration, which could be antagonized by CXCR4-neutralizing antibody. Furthermore, concomitant expression of CXCR4/CD40 in ovarian carcinoma tissues had stronger correlation with pelvic metastasis than did each alone. It is suggest that SDF-1α acts through CXCR4 to induce ovarian cancer cell migration, which could be facilitated by CD40 activation. Simultaneously examining the expression of CXCR4 and CD40 will provide valuable diagnosis of pelvic metastasis for ovarian carcinomas.
