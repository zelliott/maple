In the past 10 years, we have developed a new approach to the development of a clinically accurate rodent model for human cancer based on our invention of surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI). The SOI models have been described in approx. 70 publications and in 4 patents.*SOI allows human tumors of all the major types of human cancer to reproduce clinical like tumor growth and metastasis in the transplanted rodents. The major features of the SOI models are reviewed here and also compared to transgenic mouse models of cancer.
