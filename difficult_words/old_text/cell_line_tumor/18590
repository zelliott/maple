Rhombomeres are embryonic territories arising from the transient segmentation of the hindbrain. Their identity is specified by Hox genes from paralogous groups 1-4. Hoxa2 is the only Hox gene to be expressed in the second rhombomere and the regulatory cues leading to this region-specific expression have been poorly investigated. A 2.5-kb DNA fragment overlapping with the 3' end of Hoxa2 was previously shown to specifically direct the expression of a reporter gene in the second rhombomere and the rostral somites of mouse embryos. Here, we report that this enhancer region is activated in vitro by Hoxa2 and that this activation is strictly dependent on a short 10-bp sequence matching the consensus for Hox-Pbx recognition sites.
