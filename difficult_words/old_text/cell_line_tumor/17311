Overexpression of the ErbB2 receptor in one-third of human breast cancers contributes to the transformation of epithelial cells and predicts poor prognosis for breast cancer patients. We report that the overexpression of ErbB2 inhibits IGF-I-induced MAPK signaling. IGF-I-induced MAPK phosphorylation and MAPK kinase activity are reduced in ErbB2 overexpressing MCF-7/HER2-18 cells relative to control MCF-7/neo cells. In SKBR3/IGF-IR cells, reduction of ErbB2 by antisense methodology restores the IGF-I-induced MAPK activation. The inhibition of IGF-I-induced MAP kinase activation in ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells is correlated with decreased IGF-I-induced Shc tyrosine-phosphorylation, leading to a decreased association of Grb2 with Shc and decreased Raf phosphorylation. However, IGF-I-induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of IGF-I receptor and IRS-I and AKT phosphorylation were unaffected by ErbB2 overexpression. Consistent with these results, we observed that the proportion of IGF-I-stimulated proliferation blocked by the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 fell from 82.6% in MCF-7/neo cells to 41.2% in MCF-7/HER2-18 cells. These data provide evidence for interplay between the IGF-IR and ErbB2 signaling pathways. They are consistent with the view that the IGF-IR mediated attenuation of trastuzumab-induced growth inhibition we recently described is dependent on IGF-I-induced PI3K signaling rather than IGF-I-induced MAPK signaling.
