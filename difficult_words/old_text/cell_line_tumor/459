Transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice spontaneously develop hormone-dependent and hormone-independent prostate cancer (PC) that potentially resembles the human pathological condition. The aim of the study was to validate PET imaging as a reliable tool for in vivo assessment of disease biology and progression in TRAMP mice using radioligands routinely applied in clinical practice: [(18)F]FDG and [(11)C]choline.

Six TRAMP mice were longitudinally evaluated starting at week 11 of age to visualize PC development and progression. The time frame and imaging pattern of PC lesions were subsequently confirmed on an additional group of five mice.

PET and [(18)F]FDG allowed detection of PC lesions starting from 23 weeks of age. [(11)C]Choline was clearly taken up only by TRAMP mice carrying neuroendocrine lesions, as revealed by post-mortem histological evaluation.

PET-based molecular imaging represents a state-of-the-art tool for the in vivo monitoring and metabolic characterization of PC development, progression and differentiation in the TRAMP model.
