ML-IAP [melanoma IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis)] is an anti-apoptotic protein that is expressed highly in melanomas where it contributes to resistance to apoptotic stimuli. The anti-apoptotic activity and elevated expression of IAP family proteins in many human cancers makes IAP proteins attractive targets for inhibition by cancer therapeutics. Small-molecule IAP antagonists that bind with high affinities to select BIR (baculovirus IAP repeat) domains have been shown to stimulate auto-ubiquitination and rapid proteasomal degradation of c-IAP1 (cellular IAP1) and c-IAP2 (cellular IAP2). In the present paper, we report ML-IAP proteasomal degradation in response to bivalent, but not monovalent, IAP antagonists. This degradation required ML-IAP ubiquitin ligase activity and was independent of c-IAP1 or c-IAP2. Although ML-IAP is best characterized in melanoma cells, we show that ML-IAP expression in normal mammalian tissues is restricted largely to the eye, being most abundant in ciliary body epithelium and retinal pigment epithelium. Surprisingly, given this pattern of expression, gene-targeted mice lacking ML-IAP exhibited normal intraocular pressure as well as normal retinal structure and function. The results of the present study indicate that ML-IAP is dispensable for both normal mouse development and ocular homoeostasis.
