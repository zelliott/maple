Heat shock protein 90 is a new target of antitumor drug, the inhibitor of Hsp90 fight against tumor by destroy and degrade the structure of protein. In recent years, looking for Hsp90 inhibitor is not only via structure modifying of natural products, but also via high throughput screening and computer aided drug design to find and synthesize new kinds of Hsp90 inhibitor. Anyway, Hsp90 inhibitor has considered as an important biology target and to pay more and more attention. This review describes recent developments of small molecule Hsp90 inhibitors.
