Twenty 18beta-glycyrrhetic acid (18beta-GA) derivatives 2-21 including 13 new 18beta-GA derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents. Compounds 7 and 20 with a 3,4-seco-structure and compound 6 with a lactone moiety showed potent inhibitory effect on superoxide anion generation in rat neutrophils response to fMLP/CB and PMA, respectively. Compound 6 with a lactone moiety revealed stronger inhibitory effect on XO activity than those of compounds 13 and 14 with a 3,4-seco-structure. Compound 14, a 30-isoproylcarbamoyl seco-compound exhibited potent inhibitory effect on NO accumulation and iNOS protein expression while compounds 3, 10, 13, 15, 17, and 21 revealed potent inhibitory effect on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) formation in RAW 264.7 cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The cleavage of ring A of 3 attenuated the inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha formation in RAW 264.7 cells in response to LPS except for 17. The present results suggested these compounds were potential to be served as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents.
