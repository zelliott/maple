Chemical investigation of a terrestrial lichen has yielded the pulvinic acid derivative pinastric acid (4). The structure of 4 was secured by detailed spectroscopic analysis as well as via a single X-ray diffraction study. This is the first report of the X-ray structure and 2D NMR assignment of pinastric acid (4). Pinastric acid (4) displayed antitumour, antiviral and antimicrobial (both antibacterial and antifungal) activities. Whilst the antiviral and antimicrobial activities are consistent with previous findings of 4 this is the first report of the antitumour properties for the compound.
