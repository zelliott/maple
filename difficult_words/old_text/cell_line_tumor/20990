Macrophages are considered a key component of the immunosuppressive environment present in solid tumors, where they support tumor growth through the production of pro-angiogenic factors and active suppression of effector immune responses. Zoledronic acid (ZA), an aminobisphosphonate clinically approved for treatment of symptomatic skeletal events, has recently been shown to have immunomodulatory properties that can be exploited in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we utilize an in vitro model of prostate cancer cell-macrophage interaction to dissect the effect of ZA, on the function of prostate cancer tumor-associated macrophages (PC-TAM). We show that prostate cancer cells recruit macrophages, which in turn express a variety of proangiogenic and immunosuppressive mediators. ZA selectively suppressed the expression of MMP-9 by PC-TAM, whereas the expression of other mediators was not limited. PC-TAM treated with ZA, on the other hand, could effectively drive the proliferation of activated Tgammadelta lymphocytes, which lysed bisphosphonate-pulsed prostate cancer cells. Moreover, ZA boosted the production of type-1 cytokines by PC-TAM in response to immunomodulators such as IL-12 and polyI:C, which are known to polarize macrophages towards an anti-tumoral M1 phenotype. Overall, we provide evidence that ZA shifts the balance of PC-TAM from a tumor promoting to a tumor-eliminating phenotype and also suggest a potential use of this pharmacological agent as an immunotherapeutic adjuvant.
