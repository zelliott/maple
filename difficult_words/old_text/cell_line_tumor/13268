β-elemene, extracted from the ginger plant, possesses antitumor activity             against a broad range of cancers clinically. However, the mechanism underlying             β-elemene-induced cytotoxicity remains incompletely understood. Here, we show             that β-elemene promoted apoptotic cell death in human glioma cells, downregulated             survivin gene expression, and induced caspase-9, -3 and -7 activities. Induction             of apoptosis was associated with inhibition of survivin gene expression, and restoration             of survivin levels remarkably attenuated β-elemene-induced glioma cell death.             Moreover, we found that the interaction between surviving and HBXIP, a critical             regulator of caspase-9 activity, was impaired by β-elemene treatment. The results,             therefore, reveal a caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway induced by β-elemene in             human glioma cells, which is associated with downregulation of survivin itself             and the interaction between survivin and HBXP.
