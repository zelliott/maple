Most previous studies of the induction of tumor cell apoptosis by morphine have been conducted with concentrations very much higher than those used clinically. An investigation of the ability of morphine to induce apoptosis at its clinical concentration (10(-8) M) was therefore undertaken. Cytotoxicity was tested by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, induction of early apoptosis and necrosis by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis with Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI), activation of caspase -2, -3, -8 and -9 by cleavage of specific substrates, DNA fragmentation by agarose gel electrophoresis, radical intensity and O2- scavenging activity by ESR spectroscopy. Millimolar concentrations of morphine showed higher cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines (HL-60, A549, MCF7) than against normal human cells (HGF, HPC, HPLF). The clinical concentration of morphine produced early apoptotic markers in HL-60 and A549 cells whereas it induced higher numbers of necrotic cells in MCF7 cells, both in a naloxone-sensitive manner. The clinical concentration of morphine failed to activate any caspase species and induced only trace amounts of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, in contrast to cytotoxic concentrations of morphine. Morphine, with a C-3 hydroxyl group, showed higher cytotoxicity and O2- scavenging activity than codeine, in which the hydroxyl group at C-3 was replaced with a methoxy group, suggesting the involvement of a radical-mediated reaction. The present report may offer new strategies for treatment and prevention of cancer using a clinical concentration of morphine not only as an anti-nociceptive, but also as an apoptosis or necrosis inducer.
