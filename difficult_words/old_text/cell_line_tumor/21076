Two new triterpene glycosides, argusides B and C (1 and 2, resp.), have been isolated from the sea cucumber Bohadschia argus Jaeger collected in the South China Sea. Their structures have been established by spectral analysis (2D-NMR and ESI-MS) and chemical evidence. Compounds 1 and 2 both possess a holostane-type triterpene aglycone with a C(9)==C(11) bond and a OH group at C(12), but differ in their substituents at C(17) and the hexasaccharide moiety. The two glycosides exhibited significant cytotoxicities against four human tumor cell lines (A549, HCT-116, HepG2, and MCF-7). In comparison with the positive control V-16 (etoposide), 1 and 2 showed higher cytotoxicities to A549 and HCT-116 cell lines.
