Derivatives of the somatostatin analogues octreotide and octreotate labeled with radioiosotopes are used in the diagnosis and therapy of somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-positive tumors. A method has been devised to synthesize {N-(4-guanidinomethyl-3-iodobenzoyl)-Phe1-octreotate (GMIBO). Receptor binding assay and scatchard analysis yielded a Kd of 4.83 +/- 0.19 nM for this peptide. Derivatives of this peptide labeled with radioiodine ([*I]GMIBO) and the alpha-particle-emitting radiohalogen 211At N-(3-[211At]astato-4-guanidinomethylbenzoyl)-Phe1-octreotate; [211At]AGMBO} were prepared in a single step from a tin precursor in radiochemical yields of 30-35% and 15-20%, respectively. Paired-label internalization assays performed with the SSTR-positive D341 Med human medulloblastoma cell line demonstrated that [125I]GMIBO and [211At]AGMBO were specifically internalized 20-40% more than Nalpha-(1-deoxy-D-fructosyl)-[131I]I-Tyr3-octreotate ([131I]I-Glu-TOCA), the radioiodinated octreotide derivative previously shown to exhibit maximum internalization in this cell line. Uptake of [131I]GMIBO in D341 Med subcutaneous xenografts in a murine model (8.34 +/- 1.82 versus 8.10 +/- 2.23% ID/g at 1h) and SSTR-expressing normal tissues was comparable to that of [125I]I-Glu-TOCA and was shown to be specific. However, the uptake of [131I]GMIBO also was substantially higher in liver (16.9 +/- 3.15 versus 1.39 +/- 0.45% ID/g at 1 h) and in kidneys (44.33 +/- 6.47 versus 3.44 +/- 0.68% ID/g at 1h) compared to that of [125I]I-Glu-TOCA. These data suggest that these novel peptide conjugates retain their specificity for SSTR both in vitro and in vivo; however, because of their higher accumulation in normal tissues they would be best applied in settings amenable to loco-regional administration such as medulloblastoma neoplastic meningitis.
