Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) belong to a group of hypoxia related proteins. IGF-I induces expression of VEGF and decomposes wild type p53 in cancer cell lines. The goal of our study was to evaluate serum IGF-I, VEGF and p53 with respect to overall and disease free survival of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) patients compared with healthy volunteers.

Preoperative blood samples from 125 patients with CRC and 16 healthy volunteers were examined using ELISA for serum IGF-I, p53 and VEGF concentrations.

Concentrations of p53 and VEGF were significantly higher in CRC patients than in controls ( p<0.0006 and  p<0.0001, respectively). IGF-I was not statistically different between both groups. Serum IGF-I showed negative correlation with p53 in CRC patients ( p<0.04, r=-0.193). IGF-I and VEGF showed negative correlation in poorly differentiated cancers (G3) ( p<0.03, r=-0.339). Patients with VEGF concentrations that were above average for the cancer population survived for a shorter period of time (p=0.065 in evaluation of overall survival and 0.071 in estimation of disease-free survival during a 3-year follow-up) compared with patients with serum VEGF lower than the highest values seen in controls.

Comparisons between serum IGF-I and p53 appear to confirm the metabolism of p53 by IGF-I. Serum VEGF showed prognostic significance in our study. Serum concentrations of IGF-I and VEGF did not show positive correlation, as expected due to IGF-I induction of VEGF in malignant colon cell lines.
