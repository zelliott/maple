COX (cyclooxygenase), a prostaglandin H synthase, catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin biosynthesis. Two isoforms of COX have been identified: COX-1 and COX-2. We examined the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 in esophageal normal mucosa, dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

The expression of COX-1 and COX-2 in 80 surgically removed esophagi due to SCC, as well as in 5 human esophageal SCC cell lines was analyzed, using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses.

COX-1 and COX-2 were variably expressed in the SCC cell lines. Higher COX-1 expression was noted in 31 (41.9%) of the 74 specimens of normal mucosa, in none of the 40 specimens of dysplastic mucosa and in 15 (18.8%) of the 80 specimens of SCC, the frequency being significantly higher in normal mucosa than in dysplasia or SCC (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0018, respectively). COX-1 expression was significantly higher in well-differentiated SCC than in moderately or poorly differentiated SCC (p < 0.01). Higher COX-2 expression was noted in none (0.0%) of the specimens of normal mucosa, in 12 (30%) of the specimens of dysplastic mucosa, and in 41 (51.3%) of the speciments of SCC, the frequency being significantly higher in SCC than in normal mucosa or dysplasia (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0278, respectively).

COX-1 is expressed in normal esophageal mucosa and is occasionally induced in well-differentiated SCC, whereas COX-2 expression is more characteristic of dysplasia and carcinoma than of normal mucosa, implying a possible association with cell differentiation in the former, and esophageal tumorigenesis in the latter.
