Various substituted 3-aryl-1-isoquinolinamines were designed and synthesized based on the previously constructed CoMFA model. Most of the synthesized compounds showed excellent potency in eight different human tumor cell lines as expected. In order to find the exact cytotoxic mechanism of these 3-aryl-1-isoquinolinamines, we analyzed the cell cycle dynamics by flow cytometry and found that 3-aryl-1-isoquinolinamine 6k-treated HeLa cells were arrested in G2/M phase, which is related to apoptosis.
