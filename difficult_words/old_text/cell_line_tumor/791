The study aim was to investigate the microbiological safety of islet isolation and transplantation.

Between 1996 and 2002, prospective microbiological screening was performed on all pancreata procured for islet transplantation. Pancreas transport media and postpurification preparations were screened for microbiological contamination. Prior to isolation, pancreata were washed with either Hanks solution (group I, n = 170) or decontaminated with antiseptic and antimicrobial drugs (group II, n = 45).

Microbiological contamination of the pancreas preservation media was shown in 62%. Analysis of the contaminants showed 74% gram-positive, 21% gram-negative organisms, and 5% fungi. The donor condition or procurement center did not influence the contamination rate. Longer pancreas transport duration was significantly associated with bacterial contamination (P <.05). In group I, 16 (9.4%) of 170 islet preparations presented microbial contamination at the end of the isolation procedures. Gram-positive organisms were present in 10 (6%), gram-negative organisms in 4 (2.4%), and fungi in 2 (1.2%) preparations. Four islet preparations (2.4%) from pancreata with noninfected transport medium were positive on postpurification cultures, all with gram-positive organisms. In group II, only 2 of 45 islet preparations (4.4%) presented microbial contamination at the end of the isolation process.

The rate of microbial contamination during pancreas procurement and transport is high. Significant contaminants present when beginning islet isolation become undetectable by the conclusion of isolation. Diminishing the bio-burden by pancreas decontamination reduces the risk of contamination of the final islet preparation.
