We studied the effect of the integrin inhibitor cilengitide in glioma cells. Cilengitide induced cell detachment and decreased cell viability, and induction of autophagy followed by cell apoptosis. In addition, cilengitide decreased the cell renewal of glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). Inhibition of autophagy decreased the cytotoxic effect of cilengitide. Pretreatment of glioma cells and GSCs with cilengitide prior to γ-irradiation resulted in a larger increase in autophagy and a more significant decrease in cell survival. We found that cilengitide induced autophagy collectively in glioma cells, xenografts, and GSCs, which contributed to its cytotoxic effects and sensitized these cells to γ-radiation.
