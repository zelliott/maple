Rhodiola imbricata is a medicinal plant having immunostimulating properties. The anti-proliferative effects of Rhodiola aqueous extract (RAE), were studied in human erythroleukemic cell line K-562 using MTT cell proliferation assay. The proliferation of K-562 was significantly decreased after 72h incubation with RAE at 100 and 200microg/ml. However, almost no suppressive effects could be detected in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes or mouse macrophage cell line RAW-264.7. RAE was also found to induce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in K-562 cells at 200microg/ml when incubated overnight. The increased ROS generation may cause apoptosis, which was observed in AnnexinV-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) staining of cells treated with RAE for 72h in K-562 cells. Moreover, RAE arrested cell cycle progression in G2/M phase in early and late period of exposure. The anti-cancer activity of RAE was also confirmed by increased NK cell cytotoxicity. These observations suggest that aqueous extract of R. imbricata rhizome has very potent anti-cancer activities, which might be useful in leukemia cancer treatment.
