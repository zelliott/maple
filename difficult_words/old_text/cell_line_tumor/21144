Umbilical cord matrix stem (UCMS) cells that were engineered to express interferon-beta (IFN-beta) were transplanted weekly for three weeks into MDA 231 breast cancer xenografts bearing SCID mice in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The UCMS cells were found within lung tumors but not in other tissues. Although both treatments significantly reduced MDA 231 tumor area in the SCID mouse lungs, the combined treatment resulted in a greater reduction in tumor area than by either treatment used alone. These results indicate that a combination treatment of UCMS-IFN-beta cells and 5-FU is a potentially effective therapeutic procedure for breast cancer.
