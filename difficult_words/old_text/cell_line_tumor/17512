We investigated the role of cyclin A in the cytotoxic effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on cancer cell lines. Experiments were performed using gastric cancer chemosensitive NUGC3, and chemoresistant NUGC3/5FU/L established by repeated exposure to 5-FU. 5-FU inhibited cell growth of NUGC3 in a dose-dependent manner. Low concentrations of 5-FU did not inhibit cell growth of NUGC3/5FU/L, while high concentrations slightly inhibited cell growth. Examination of the cell cycle pattern of NUGC3 cells showed accumulation at S-phase at 10 micro M and at G1-S-phase at 100 micro M of 5-FU. Cell cycle pattern of NUGC3/5FU/L cells did not change 5-FU concentrations. 5-FU increased cyclin A mRNA level in NUGC3 cells but not NUGC3/5FU/L cells. In the presence of 100 micro M 5-FU, cyclin A protein level increased 2.6-fold in NUGC3 and 1.47-fold in NUGC3/5FU/L. 5-FU dose-dependently increased the percentage of cyclin A-positive NUGC3 cells, but not NUGC3/5FU/L cells. The percentage of cyclin A-positive cells in other 5-FU sensitive esophageal, colon and gastric cancer cell lines (T.Tn, LOVO, DLD-1, MKN-7), increased in the presence of 1 and 10 micro M 5-FU, while cyclin A-positive cells in 5-FU resitant hepatocellular and colon carcinoma cell lines (HCC50 and C-1), did not increase with the same treatment. Our results indicate that the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU in human cancer cell lines correlate with cyclin A and it may be used as a predictive factor for chemotherapy response.
