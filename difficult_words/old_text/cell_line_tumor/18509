Antimicrotubule Vinca alkaloids, such as vinblastine and vincristine, interfere with the dynamics of microtubules and have shown significant cell killing activity in a variety of tumor cells through induction of apoptosis. The mechanism by which Vinca alkaloids induce apoptosis is not entirely clear. In this study, we found that glucocorticoids inhibit Vinca alkaloid-induced apoptosis without affecting G(2)-M arrest in human breast cancer BCap37 cells and human epidermoid tumor KB cells, suggesting that Vinca alkaloid-induced apoptosis may occur via a pathway independent of cell cycle arrest. Further analyses indicated that Vinca alkaloids cause significant degradation of IkappaBalpha, which in turn results in nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. Transfection of antisense IkappaBalpha in BCap37 cells sensitizes Vinca alkaloid-induced apoptosis. Moreover, in vitro kinase assays show that the activity of IkappaB kinase (IKK) was activated by Vinca alkaloids and was not affected by glucocorticoids. Stable transfection of dominant-negative deletional mutant IkappaBalpha, which is insensitive to IKK-mediated phosphorylation and degradation, resulted in the inhibition of Vinca alkaloid-induced NF-kappaB activation and reduced sensitivity of tumor cells to Vinca alkaloid-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that the NF-kappaB/IkappaB signaling pathway may contribute to the mediation of Vinca alkaloid-induced apoptosis in human tumor cells.
