The serine/threonine Pim 1 kinase is an oncogene whose expression is deregulated in several human cancers. Overexpression of Pim 1 facilitates cell cycle progression and suppresses apoptosis. Hence pharmacologic inhibitors of Pim 1 are of therapeutic interest for cancer. ETP-45299 is a potent and selective inhibitor of Pim 1 that inhibits the phosphorylation of Bad and 4EBP1 in cells and suppresses the proliferation of several non-solid and solid human tumor cell lines. The combination of the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 with ETP-45299 was strongly synergistic in MV-4-11 AML cells, indicating that the combination of selective Pim kinase inhibitors and PI3K inhibitor could have clinical benefit.
