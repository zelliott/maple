The sorption characteristics of 10 organic chemicals, categorized as pharmaceuticals, estrogens and phenols, onto synthetic suspended particle (i.e., alumina) coated with humic acid were investigated according to their octanol-water partition coefficient (K(ow)). Chemical analyses were performed with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The effects of particles on the toxicity reduction were evaluated using bioassay tests, using Daphnia magna and Vibrio fisheri for phenols and pharmaceuticals, and the human breast cancer cell MCF-7 for estrogens. Sorption studies revealed that 22 and 38% of octylphenol and pentachlorophenol, respectively, were removed by suspended particle, whereas 2,4-dichlorophenol was not removed, which was directly proportional to the logK(ow) value. Similar to the sorption tests, suspended particles significantly reduced the acute toxicities of octylphenol and pentachlorophenol to D. magna and V. fisheri ( p<0.01), but there was no significant difference in the toxicity of 2,4-dichlorophenol to D. magna (p=0.8374). Pharmaceuticals, such as ibuprofen, gemfibrozil and tolfenamic acid, showed no discernible sorption to the suspended particle, with the exception of diclofenac, which revealed 11% sorption. For estrogens, such as estrone, 17beta-estradiol and 17alpha-ethynylestradiol, the results indicated no reduction in the sorption test. This may be attributed to the polar interaction by functional groups in sorption between pharmaceuticals and estrogens and suspended particles. In the bioassays, presence of suspended particles did not significantly modify the toxicity of pharmaceuticals (regardless of their K(ow) values) to D. magna, V. fisheri or E-screen.
