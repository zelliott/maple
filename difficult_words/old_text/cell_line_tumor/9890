B lymphocytes converted into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) by an Epstein-Barr virus that expresses a conditional EBNA3C require complementation with EBNA3C for growth under nonpermissive conditions. Complementation with relatively large EBNA3C deletion mutants identified amino acids (aa) 1 to 506 (which includes the RBP-Jkappa/CSL [RBP-Jkappa] binding domain) and 733 to 909 to be essential for LCL growth, aa 728 to 732 and 910 to 992 to be important for full wild-type (wt) growth, and only aa 507 to 727 to be unimportant (S. Maruo, Y. Wu, T. Ito, T. Kanda, E. D. Kieff, and K. Takada, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 106:4419-4424, 2009). When mutants with smaller deletions were used, only aa 51 to 400 and 851 to 900 were essential for LCL growth; aa 447 to 544, 701 to 750, 801 to 850, and 901 to 992 were important for full wt growth; and aa 4 to 50, 401 to 450, 550 to 707, and 751 to 800 were unimportant. These data reduce the EBNA3C essential residues from 68% to 40% of the open reading frame. Point mutations confirmed RBP-Jkappa binding to be essential for wt growth and indicated that SUMO and CtBP binding interactions were important only for full wt growth. EBNA3C aa 51 to 150, 249 to 311, and 851 to 900 were necessary for maintaining LCL growth, but not RBP-Jkappa interaction, and likely mediate interactions with other key cell proteins. Moreover, all mutants null for LCL growth had fewer S+G(2)/M-phase cells at 14 days, consistent with EBNA3C interaction with RBP-Jkappa as well as aa 51 to 150, 249 to 311, and 851 to 900 being required to suppress p16(INK4A) (S. Maruo, Y. Wu, S. Ishikawa, T. Kanda, D. Iwakiri, and K. Takada, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103:19500-19505, 2006). We have confirmed that EBNA3C upregulates TCL1 and discovered that EBNA3C upregulates TCL1 through RBP-Jkappa, indicating a central role for EBNA3C interaction with RBP-Jkappa in mediating cell gene transcription.
