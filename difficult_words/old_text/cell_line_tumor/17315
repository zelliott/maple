Multiple co-crystal structures of an adenine-based series of inhibitors bound to the molecular chaperone Hsp90 have been determined. These structures explain the observed SAR for previously described compounds and new compounds, which possess up to 8-fold improved potency against the isolated enzyme. Anti-tumour cell potency and mechanism of action data is also described for the most potent compounds. These data should enable the design of more potent Hsp90 inhibitors.
