Quinidine and Ba(2+), non-selective K(+)-channel blockers, have previously been shown to inhibit antigen-induced mediator (beta-hexosaminidase) release from RBL-2H3 cells, a mucosal-type mast cell line. We therefore used selective blockers of Ca(2+)-activated and other K(+) channels to determine if there was a role for these channels in antigen-induced mediator release. Charybdotoxin and cetiedil dose-dependently inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release with IC(50) values of 133 nM and 84 microM, respectively. Charybdotoxin also inhibited the repolarization phase of the antigen-induced biphasic change in the membrane potential (IC(50) 84 nM), antigen-stimulated 86Rb(+)-efflux and increase in free intracellular calcium, [Ca(2+)](i). Iberiotoxin, margatoxin, apamin and tetraethylammonium had no effect on beta-hexosaminidase release. These results suggest that K(+) conductances play a significant role in mediator release from RBL-2H3, that these conductances are of the intermediate conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (IK(Ca)) type, and that they are somewhat similar to those which have been described in red blood cells, though they are much less sensitive to clotrimazole.
