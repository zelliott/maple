The laminin tyrosine-isoleucine-glycine-serine-arginine (YIGSR) peptide, corresponding to the 929-933 sequence of beta1 chain, is known to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. In the present study, we observed that YIGSR not only inhibited the growth and migration of prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner but also decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited ATP synthesis and increased caspase-9 activity. Investigation into the interaction of YIGSR with 67LR, the receptor for laminin and polyphenol (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) employing MVD (Molegro Virtual Docker, an integrated platform for predicting protein ligand interactions), revealed that the binding site of YIGSR was the same as that of EGCG that explains as to why YIGSR is able to inhibit the cytotoxicity of EGCG against PC-3 cells.
