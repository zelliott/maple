Wilms' tumor (nephroblastoma) is a cancer of the kidneys that occurs typically in children and rarely in adults. Early diagnosis is very important for the treatment and prognosis of the disease. The aim of our study was to discover and identify potential non-invasive and convenient biomarkers for the diagnosis of Wilms' tumor.

Nude mice were used to construct a Wilms' tumor model by injecting nephroblastoma cells into their bilateral abdomen. We collected 94 serum samples from mice consisting of 45 samples with Wilms' tumor and 49 controls. The serum proteomic profiles of the samples were analyzed via surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The candidate biomarkers were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and validated using ProteinChip immunoassays.

We finally retrieved two differential proteins (m/z 4509.2; 6207.9), which were identified as apolipoprotein A-II and polyubiquitin, respectively. The expression of apolipoprotein A-II was higher in the Wilms' tumor group than in the control group (P < 0.01). By contrast, the expression of polyubiquitin was lower in the Wilms' tumor group than in the control group.

Apolipoprotein A-II and polyubiquitin may be used as potential biomarkers for nephroblastoma in children, and the analysis of apolipoprotein A-II may help diagnose and treat Wilms' tumor.
