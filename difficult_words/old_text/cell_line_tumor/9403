Mucin gene expression and mucin production are markedly increased in inflammatory airway disorders such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and rhinosinusitis. Cytokines, lipopolysaccharides and other inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin and leukotriene are related to the secretion and production of mucin. However, the relationship of leukotrienes with mucin genes expression is not clear. The aim of this study is to evaluate MUC2/5AC gene expression and mucin secretion by the leukotriene receptor in human airway epithelial cells.

The effect of leukotriene D(4) and the leukotriene receptor antagonist, pranlukast hydrate (ONO-1078) on the regulation of MUC2/5AC gene expression and mucin secretion were observed in human airway NCI-H292 epithelial cells. The mRNA levels of MUC2/5AC and the amount of mucin were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoassay.

Leukotriene D(4) upregulated MUC2/5AC gene expression and mucin secretion in a dose dependent pattern. Pranlukast hydrate (ONO-1078, 100 microM) downregulated the leukotriene D(4)-induced MUC2/5AC gene expression and mucin secretion.

These results suggest that the leukotriene receptor system is one of the mechanisms related to MUC2/5AC gene expression and mucin secretion in the human airway epithelium.
