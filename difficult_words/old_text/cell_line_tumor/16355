Goniothalamin (GTN), a plant bioactive styryl-lactone, is a natural product with potent anti-tumorigenesis effects for several types of cancer. Nonetheless, the anticancer effect of GTN has not been examined in oral cancer. The present study was designed to evaluate its potential anticancer effects in an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) model and to determine the possible mechanisms with respect to apoptosis, DNA damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Our data demonstrated that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by GTN in Ca9-22 OSCC cancer cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners ( p<0.05). For cell cycle and apoptotic effects of GTN-treated Ca9-22 cancer cells, the sub-G1 population and annexin V-intensity significantly increased in a concentration-dependent manner ( p<0.001). For the analysis of DNA double strand breaks, Î³H2AX intensity significantly increased in GTN-treated Ca9-22 cancer cells in concentration-response relationship ( p<0.05). Moreover, GTN significantly induced intracellular ROS levels in Ca9-22 cancer cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner ( p<0.05). For membrane depolarization of mitochondria, the DiOC(2)(3) (3,3'-diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide) intensity of GTN-treated Ca9-22 cancer cells was significantly decreased in concentration- and time-dependent relationships ( p<0.001). Taken together, these results suggest that the anticancer effect of GTN against oral cancer cells is valid and GTN-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis influence the downstream cascade including ROS induction, DNA damage, and mitochondria membrane depolarization. Therefore, GTN has potential as a chemotherapeutic agent against oral cancer.
