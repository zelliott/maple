Increasing of adhesion between leukemia cells and endothelial cells during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment plays an important role in retinoic acid syndrome. This work observed the effects of tripterine on this ATRA-caused increasing in adhesion.

The effects of tripterine on ATRA-induced expressions of adhesive molecules in acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were detected by flow cytometry. The effects of tripterine on adhesion between ATRA-treated NB4 and HUVEC were determined by adhesive assays.

ATRA caused remarkable elevation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in NB4 cells, which could be significantly reduced by tripterine ( p<0.01). The expressions of E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and ICAM-1 in HUVEC were elevated by conditioned medium from ATRA-induced NB4 (ATRA-NB4-CM) ( p<0.01), and inhibited by tripterine with inhibition rates being 25.3%, 42.4% and 61.0% respectively. ATRA increased the adhesion between NB4 and HUVEC, which was reversed completely by tripterine.

Tripterine can inhibit ATRA-caused adhesion between leukemia cells and endothelial cells, and it might be a potential agent for treating retinoic acid syndrome.
