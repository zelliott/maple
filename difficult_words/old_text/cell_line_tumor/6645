Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) plays a pivotal role in transepithelial Na+ and HCO3(-) absorption across a wide range of epithelia in the digestive and renal-genitourinary systems. Accumulating evidence suggests that PDZ-based adaptor proteins play an important role in regulating the trafficking and activity of NHE3. A search for NHE3-binding modular proteins using yeast two-hybrid assays led us to the PDZ-based adaptor Shank2. The interaction between Shank2 and NHE3 was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance studies. When expressed in PS120/NHE3 cells, Shank2 increased the membrane expression and basal activity of NHE3 and attenuated the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3 activity. Furthermore, knock-down of native Shank2 expression in Caco-2 epithelial cells by RNA interference decreased NHE3 protein expression as well as activity but amplified the inhibitory effect of cAMP on NHE3. These results indicate that Shank2 is a novel NHE3 interacting protein that is involved in the fine regulation of transepithelial salt and water transport through affecting NHE3 expression and activity.
