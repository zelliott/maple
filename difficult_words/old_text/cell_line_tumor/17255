Analyzing the regenerative compartment in the blast cell population of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may yield important insights into the mechanisms of disease progression. Here we present findings with a human AML cell line (AML-SP1), initiated from leukemic precursor cells and consecutively propagated by serial xenotransplantation in vivo. AML-SP1 maintained the characteristics of a human AML, consistently exhibiting a small leukemic side population (SP) of blast cells with high Hoechst 33342 exclusion. In the AML-SP1 line, an increased expression of the ABC transporters MDR1, MRP, ABCG2 and ABCA3 was found in the SP cells. The detection of ABCA3 in leukemic progenitor cells merits further investigation with regard to intracellular drug transport in AML blast cells. In vivo propagation of leukemias, such as AML-SP1 is a model system of maintaining the populational heterogeneity of AML disease, especially the unique characteristics of leukemic SP cells.
