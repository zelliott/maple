Melatonin is synthesized mainly in pineal gland. It has been suggested that melatonin has proven antioxidant effects and protective effects against neuronal cell degeneration. There are several studies indicating that c-Jun-N-terminal kinase pathways might be involved in neuronal cell death. In this study, the effects of melatonin on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated cultured SK-N-SH cells were investigated. The results showed that 6-OHDA significantly decreased cell viability as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and melatonin was able to reverse the toxic effects of 6-OHDA on cell viability. In addition, induction of c-Jun phosphorylation by 6-OHDA was diminished by melatonin. These results demonstrate some protective properties of melatonin against neuronal cell degeneration and its action on the inhibition of c-Jun-N terminal kinase signaling cascade.
