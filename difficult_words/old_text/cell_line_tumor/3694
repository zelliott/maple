The cross-arming of effector CTL in response to cross-presented tumor Ags is predicted to fail in the absence of CD40 stimulation. However, questions remain regarding the role of CD40 signaling and additional CD4+ T cell-derived signals in this process. To address this, we have analyzed the cross-arming of tumor-specific CTL effectors in vivo in a mouse model of established tumor and tumor regression following CD40 activation. We found that tumor-specific CTL were constitutively cross-armed in tumor-draining lymph nodes during tumor growth and that systemic CD40 activation did not alter CTL cross-arming in the tumor-draining lymph nodes. Rather, CD40 activation induced peripheral dissemination of tumor-specific CTL effectors that required continual CD40 stimulation to maintain peripheral CTL and tumor regression. These data indicate that CD40 activation enhances the peripheral survival of constitutively cross-armed CTL and that persistent CD4+ T cell signals are required for their long-term activity.
