Three new steroidal compounds with polyhydroxy groups, tupisteroide A-C (1-3), were obtained from the roots of Tupistra chinensis, together with one known compound (4) that was isolated from this plant for the first time. The structures of tupisteroide A-C were determined on the basis of one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, including (1) H-(1) H Correlation Spectroscopy, Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation, and Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence experiments. The isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against A549, HepG2, and CaSki cancer cell lines in vitro. Among them, compounds 1, 2, and 4 did not show significant inhibitory activity, but compound 3 showed cytotoxicity against A549 cancer cell lines with IC(50) values of 25.0 μM.
