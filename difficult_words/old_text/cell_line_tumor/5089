Although carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are increasingly used, their biological effects are only incompletely characterized. However, experimental evidence suggests that the intratracheal instillation of CNTs causes the formation of interstitial granulomas and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in rodents. Using human epithelial Calu-3 cells as a model of airway epithelium in vitro, we have recently reported that the exposure to commercial multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) causes a progressive decrease of the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), pointing to a CNT-dependent impairment of the epithelial barrier function. To characterize better this behavior, we compared the effects of two types of MWCNTs and single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) of different lengths on the TEER of Calu-3 monolayers. All the materials were used at a dose of 100 microg/mL corresponding to an exposure of 73 microg/cm(2) of cell monolayer. Only the longer MWCNTs and SWCNTs cause a significant decrease in TEER. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the changes in barrier function, the expression of the junction proteins occludin and ZO-1 has been also assessed. No significant decrease in the mRNA for either protein is detectable after the exposure to any type of CNTs. It is concluded that the impairment of barrier function in Calu-3 monolayers is a peculiar effect of CNTs endowed with clear cut fiber properties and is not referable to marked changes in the expression of junction proteins.
