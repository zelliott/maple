Phospholipase D (PLD) has been strongly implicated in the regulation of Golgi trafficking as well as endocytosis and exocytosis. Our aim was to investigate the role of PLD in regulating the biphasic exocytosis of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells that is essential for mammalian glucose homeostasis. We observed that PLD activity in MIN6 pancreatic beta-cells is closely coupled to secretion. Cellular PLD activity was increased in response to a variety of secretagogues including the nutrient glucose and the cholinergic receptor agonist carbamoylcholine. Conversely, pharmacological or hormonal inhibition of stimulated secretion reduced PLD activity. Most importantly, blockade of PLD-catalyzed phosphatidic acid formation using butan-1-ol inhibited insulin secretion in both MIN6 cells and isolated pancreatic islets. It was further established that PLD activity was required for both the first and the second phase of glucose-stimulated insulin release, suggesting a role in the very distal steps of exocytosis, beyond granule recruitment into a readily releasable pool. Visualization of granules using green fluorescent protein-phogrin confirmed a requirement for PLD prior to granule fusion with the plasma membrane. PLD1 was shown to be the predominant isoform in MIN6 cells, and it was located at least partially on insulin granules. Overexpression of wild-type or a dominant negative catalytically inactive mutant of PLD1 augmented or inhibited secretagogue-stimulated secretion, respectively. The results suggest that phosphatidic acid formation on the granule membrane by PLD1 is essential for the regulated secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells.
