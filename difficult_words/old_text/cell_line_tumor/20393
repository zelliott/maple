Celecoxib has been shown to have an antitumor effect in previous studies, but the mechanisms are unclear. Ca(2+) is a key second messenger in most cells. The effect of celecoxib on cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in human suspended PC3 prostate cancer cells was explored by using fura-2 as a fluorescent dye. Celecoxib at concentrations between 5 and 30 μM increased [Ca(2+)](i) in a concentration-dependent manner. The Ca(2+) signal was reduced partly by removing extracellular Ca(2+). Celecoxib-induced Ca(2+) influx was not blocked by L-type Ca(2+) entry inhibitors or protein kinase C/A modulators [phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), GF109203X, H-89], but was inhibited by the phospholipase A(2) inhibitor, aristolochic acid. In Ca(2+)-free medium, 30 μM of celecoxib failed to induce a [Ca(2+)](i) rise after pretreatment with thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum [ER] Ca(2+) pump inhibitor). Conversely, pretreatment with celecoxib inhibited thapsigargin-induced Ca(2+) release. Inhibition of phospholipase C with U73122 did not change celecoxib-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rises. Celecoxib induced slight cell death in a concentration-dependent manner, which was enhanced by chelating cytosolic Ca(2+) with BAPTA. Collectively, in PC3 cells, celecoxib induced [Ca(2+)](i) rises by causing phospholipase C-independent Ca(2+) release from the ER and Ca(2+) influx via non-L-type, phospholipase A(2)-regulated Ca(2+) channels. These data may contribute to the understanding of the effect of celecoxib on prostate cancer cells.
