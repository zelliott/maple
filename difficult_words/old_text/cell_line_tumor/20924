To screen a group of traditional Chinese medicines with effect on pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated transcription regulation of P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); and to study whether they can induce the expression of CYP3A4 with a dose, time-dependent manner.

Transient cotransfection reporter gene assays were performed with pCI-hPXR-neo, pGL3-CYP3A4-Luc and beta-galactosidase expression plasmid in HepG2 cells.

Rhizoma Curcumae, Atractylodes lancea, A. macrocaphala and Poria cocos could induce transcriptional expression of CYP3A4. In the dose-effect study, 24 h after induction, 500 mg x L(-1) Rhizoma Curcumae, A. lancea, A. macrocaphala and Poria cocos, respectively, could induce the CYP3A4 gene expression with (6.82 +/- 0.09), (6.76 +/- 0.20), (5.49 +/- 0.13) and (4.97 +/- 0.07) folds, as compared with 0.1% DMSO treated cells. In the time-effect study, 500 mg x L(-1) Rhizoma curcumae, A. lancea, A. macrocaphala and Poria cocos for 48 h could induce the CYP3A4 gene expression with (7.74 +/- 0.54), (7.34 +/- 0.10), (5.54 +/- 0.11) and (5.32 +/- 0.18) folds, compared with 0.1% DMSO treated cells.

Rhizoma Curcumae, A. lancea, A. macrocaphala and Poria cocos could induce the expression of CYP3A4 gene transcription through activating PXR.
