MiR-17-92 cluster miRNAs are disclosed to contribute to the development of multiple organs and tumorigenesis, but their roles in pancreas development remains unclear. In this study, we found that miR-19b, a member of miR-17-92, was highly expressed in the pancreatic progenitor cells, and miR-19b could target the 3' UTR of NeuroD1 mRNA to decrease its protein and mRNA levels. Functional analysis showed that miR-19b exerted little effect on the proliferation of pancreatic progenitors, whereas it inhibited the expression of insulin 1, but not insulin 2 in MIN6 cells. These results suggest that miR-19b can downregulate insulin 1 expression through targeting transcription factor NeuroD1, and thus regulate the differentiation and function of Î²-cells.
