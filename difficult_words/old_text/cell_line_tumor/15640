Src tyrosine kinase and matrix metalloproteinase play the pivotal roles in lung cancer invasion and metastasis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Src tyrosine kinase inhibition on secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.

ELISA was used to examine the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 produced by NSCLC cells (PC14PE6, H226, PC-9, A549) as well as the effect of Src tyrosine kinase inhibition on secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by NSCLC cells. Boyden chamber assay was used to assess the effect of Src tyrosine kinase inhibition on invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro.

The levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in PC14PE6 and H226 cells were high, whereas the level of MMP-9 in A549 cell was low. MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels in PC-9 cell could not be detected. Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor obviously decreased the secretion of MMP-9 by PC14PE6, H226 and A549 cells, as well as MMP-2 by PC14PE6 cells in a dose-dependent manner. 10 μM Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor suppressed the secretion of MMP-9 by H226 and A549 cells, as wells as MMP-2 by PC14PE6 cells by more than 50%, while the same concentration of Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor almost had no effect on the level of MMP-2 in H226 cell. Invasiveness of NSCLC cells was suppressed by Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner, though there was minor difference in degree of the inhibition among four cell lines. 3 μM Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor suppressed the cell invasiveness of PC14PE6, H226, A549 and PC-9 cells by 79.1%, 68.09%, 90.96% and 96.98%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Inhibition of Src tyrosine kinase could suppress the invasion of NSCLC cells as well as the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by NSCLC cells in vitro. MMP-2 and MMP-9 were involved in regulating cell migration and invasion.
