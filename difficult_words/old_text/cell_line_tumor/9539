Previous studies indicate that specific extracts and the pure triterpene glycoside actein obtained from black cohosh inhibit growth of human breast cancer cells. Our aim is to identify alterations in gene expression induced by treatment with a methanolic extract (MeOH) of black cohosh.

We treated MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells with the MeOH extract at 40 microg/ml and collected RNA at 6 and 24 h; we confirmed the microarray results with real-time RT-PCR for 18 genes.

At 6 h after treatment there was significant increase in expression of ER stress (GRP78), apoptotic (GDF15), lipid biosynthetic (INSIG1 and HSD17B7) and Phase 1 (CYP1A1) genes and, at 24 h, decrease in expression of cell cycle (HELLS and PLK4) genes.

Since the MeOH extract activated genes that enhance apoptosis and repressed cell cycle genes, it may be useful in the prevention and therapy of breast cancer.
