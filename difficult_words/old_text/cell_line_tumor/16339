Neoadenoloside A (1), an unprecedented diterpene C-glycoside with a unique C(26) framework, along with lasiokaurin (3) were isolated from the leaves of Isodon adenolomus. The absolute configuration of 2, a derivative of 1, was determined by spectroscopic methods and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.
