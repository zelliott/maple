In this study, we investigated the effects of lentivirus (LV)-mediated short             hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting IGF-1R on the growth and lymphangiogenesis of breast             cancer. The LV vector effectively delivered the IGF-1R shRNA to MDA-MBâ€‘231 cells,             leading to significant reduction of IGF-1R mRNA and protein expression. Infection             of MDA-MB-231 cells with LV-IGF-1R shRNA reduced cell growth and migration. Transplantation             of MDA-MB-231 cells with suppressed IGF-1R expression in SCID mice reduced tumor             growth and lymphangiogenesis. These data collectively suggest that LV-mediated             shRNA is an effective way to suppress IGF-1R expression and to inhibit growth             and lymphangiogenesis of breast cancer. Specific inhibition of IGF-1R expression             with shRNA represents a promising approach for the treatment of breast cancer.
