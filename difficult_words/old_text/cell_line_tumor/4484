Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. To improve the prognosis of patients with NSCLCs, new and validated therapeutic targets are critically needed. In this study, we focused on F-box and WD repeat domain containing-7 (FBXW7), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, that regulates the degradation of MCL1, Myc, cyclin E, and TOP2A. Importantly, loss of FBXW7 was associated with increased sensitivity of tumors to a class I-specific histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, MS-275. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased expression of FBXW7 targets, MCL1 and TOP2A, in NSCLC tumors with low expression of FBXW7. Moreover, clinical specimens exhibiting low FBXW7 expression presented with more progressive cancer and significantly shorter cancer-specific survival than patients with high FBXW7 expression. Mechanistic study of NSCLC cell lines with silenced FBXW7 revealed enhanced MS-275 sensitivity and taxol resistance. Interestingly, taxol resistance was eliminated by MS-275 treatment, suggesting the potential of HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of aggressive taxol-resistant NSCLCs that lack FBXW7.

FBXW7 status impacts chemosensitivity and is a prognostic marker in NSCLCs. VISUAL OVERVIEW: http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2013/12/19/1541-7786.MCR-13-0341/F1.large.jpg.
