Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widely used plasticizer whose estrogenic properties may impact hormone-responsive disorders and fetal development. In vivo, BPA appears to have greater activity than is suggested by its estrogen receptor (ER) binding affinity. This may be a result of BPA sulfation/desulfation providing a pathway for selective uptake into hormone-responsive cells. BPA is a substrate for estrogen sulfotransferase, and bisphenol A sulfate (BPAS) and disulfate are substrates for estrone sulfatase. Although the sulfated xenobiotics bind poorly to the ER, both stimulated the growth of receptor-positive breast tumor cells. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with BPAS leads to desulfation and uptake of BPA. No BPAS is found inside the cells. These findings suggest a mechanism for the selective uptake of BPA into cells expressing estrone sulfatase. Therefore, sulfation may increase the estrogenic potential of xenobiotics.
