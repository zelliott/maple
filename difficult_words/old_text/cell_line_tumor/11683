MicroRNA-200a (miR-200a) has been reported to regulate tumour progression in several tumours; however, little is known about its role in non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLCs). Here, we found that miR-200a was up-regulated in A549 and SK-MES-1 cells compared with normal lung cells HELF. By a series of gain-of-function and loss-offunction studies, over-expression of miR-200a was indicated to enhance cells migration, and its knock-down inhibited migration of cells in NSCLC cell lines. Furthermore, miR-200a was identified to induce TSPAN1 expression which was related to migration. TSPAN1 was proved to induce migration, and so up-regulation of TSPAN1 by miR-200a may explain why over-expressing miR-200a promotes NSCLC cells migration.
