Tyrosinase is a key enzyme for melanin biosynthesis, and hyperpigmentation disorders are associated with abnormal accumulation of melanin pigments, which can be improved by treatment with depigmenting agents. In the present study, piperlonguminine from Piper longum was discovered to inhibit melanin production in melanoma B16 cells stimulated with alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine or protoporphyrin IX, where the compound exhibited stronger depigmenting efficacy than kojic acid. However, piperlonguminine did not affect 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-induced melanogenesis and did not affect protein kinase C-mediated melanin production. Surprisingly, piperlonguminine did not inhibit the catalytic activity of cell-free tyrosinase from melanoma B16 cells but rather suppressed tyrosinase mRNA expression. This effect was attributed to the inhibitory action of piperlonguminine on alpha-MSH-induced signaling through cAMP to the cAMP responsive element binding protein that in turn regulates the expression of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, a key activator of the tyrosinase promoter. This study demonstrates that piperlonguminine is an efficient depigmenting agent with a novel mechanism of action.
