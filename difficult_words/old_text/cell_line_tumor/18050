Current knowledge about molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression and drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM) is still limited. Here, we analyzed the potential pathogenetic role of the Y-box binding protein YB-1 in MM. YB-1 is a member of the cold-shock domain protein superfamily and involved in various cellular functions such as proliferation. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that neither normal bone marrow (BM) plasma cells (PCs), premalignant PCs of patients with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), nor MM cells with a mature morphology showed expression of YB-1 in situ. In contrast, YB-1 was strongly expressed in situ in normal PC precursor blasts as well as in a MM subset and in vitro in all of the evaluated MM cell lines. The YB-1-expressing MM cells were characterized by an immature morphology and a highly proliferative phenotype as defined by Ki 67 expression. We observed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of YB-1 decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis in MM cells even in the presence of BM stromal cells. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of YB-1 mediated resistance toward doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in MM cells. Thus, YB-1 contributes to disease progression, survival, and drug resistance in MM and might therefore provide an attractive therapeutic target.
