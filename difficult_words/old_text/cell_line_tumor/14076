Cryptosporidium parvum has become the focus of numerous studies on waterborne disease and transmission in response to outbreaks endangering populations worldwide. The Foci Detection Method-Most Probable Number Assay (FDM-MPN) is an in vitro cell culture method that has been developed and used to determine the quantity of infectious C. parvum oocysts. This research evaluated 2 vendor's producing oocysts, Sterling Parasitology Laboratory (SPL) and Pleasant Hill Farms (PHF) (now known as Bunch Grass Farms as of 12/03), classified as young (<30 days) and aged (>165 days), for comparison of treatments (bleach, antibiotic, no treatment) before cell culture, as well as an age study, to determine any lot-to-lot differences and vendor differences regarding the rate of decline in infectivity. Bleach treatment (0.525%) appeared to be the optimum method for the FDM-MPN with regards to maximum infectivity, efficient disinfection, with no visible antagonistic affects on the C. parvum oocysts. The age study revealed that lot-to-lot variability within each vendor stayed within 1 log10 difference, while the rates of decline in infectivity measured until 107 and 120 days of age when stored at 4 C for SPL and PHF were -0.016 and -0.014 log10 infectious oocysts/day, respectively. These results provide insight regarding C. parvum oocyst viability in a fecal population, as well as useful knowledge for further methods development.
