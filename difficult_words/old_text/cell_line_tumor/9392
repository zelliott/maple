To study the effects of lutein on apoptosis and its mechanism.

The cells of human esophageal carcinoma EC9706 were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% bovine serum and were treated with lutein at 100 microg x mL(-1) concentration. Flow cytometry was employed to investigate the effects of lutein on cell apoptosis of EC9706 cells. Histochemistry was performed to determine apoptosis-related protein expresion.

Flow cytometry analyses revealed that lutein increased EC9706 cell apoptosis ratio when treated with lutein 100 microg x mL(-1) at 96 h. Lutein decreased the expression of Bcl-2 protein and increased the expression of Bax protein in EC9706 cells.

Lutein could inhibit mitosis and stimulate apoptosis of EC9706 cells. The apoptotic effect may result from the down-regulation of expression of Bcl-2 and up-regulation expression of Bax.
