At 2677, the GG and TT were most frequent in Asian cell lines, whereas the GT and GG were most frequent in non-Asians (p=0.032). At 3435, TT and CC was most common in Asians and non-Asians, respectively (p=0.018). A higher IC(50) was found in GG than GT/A genotype (p=0.02) and in G-C than G-T haplotype (p=0.046). Non-Asian cell lines were more sensitive to paclitaxel than Asian cell lines (p=0.01) due to different polymorphism frequencies. We identified 65 genes that were differently expressed in cell lines of the G-C and G-T ABCB1 haplotypes. Ethnic differences in the G-T haplotype of the ABCB1 gene may be a biomarker for paclitaxel sensitivity, and future clinical validation is necessary to confirm our findings.
