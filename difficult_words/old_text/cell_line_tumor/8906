Glioma tumor-suppressor candidate region gene2 (GLTSCR2) is a recently identified nucleolus-localized protein participating in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Down-regulation of GLTSCR2 in several types of cancers and increased transforming activity in GLTSCR2-downregulated cancer cells indicated its tumor suppressive potential. The aim of this study was to evaluate GLTSCR2 expression in breast cancer and to investigate the question of whether reduced expression of GLTSCR2 may have any pathological significance in breast cancer development or progression. In this study, we performed quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of GLTSCR2 and relevance with clinicopathological factors in the invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). GLTSCR2 expression was reduced in 48% of IDC (n=426) by a semi-quantitative scoring system using tissue microarray. GLTSCR2 mRNA was significantly reduced by 0.16 fold in 15 out of 17 (88%) cases of IDC. Reduction of GLTSCR2 was significantly correlated with increased histological grade ( p<0.005), increased tumor size ( p<0.001), axillary lymph node involvement ( p<0.001) and decreased disease free survival ( p<0.025). In addition, we show that upregulation of GLTSCR2 decreases the invasive potential of breast cancer cells. Taken together, our data suggest that GLTCR2 may play a role in the tumorigenesis, progression and biological behavior in breast cancer.
