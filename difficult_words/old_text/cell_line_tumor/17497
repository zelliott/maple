To observe the effect of beta-ionone on the proliferation of human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line SGC-7901 and the inhibition of metalloproteinase.

Using growth inhibition, Zymograms assays and reverse transcription-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR), we examined cell growth rates, activities of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and -9 (MMP-9), and expression of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) and -2 (TIMP-2) in SGC-7901 cells after the treatment with beta-ionone for 24 h and 48 h, respectively.

beta-ionone had an inhibitory effect on the growth of SGC-7901 cells. Eight days after the treatment with beta-ionone at concentrations of 25, 50, 100 and 200 micromol/L, the inhibition rates were 25.9%, 28.2%, 74.4% and 90.1%, respectively. The IC50 value of beta-ionone for SGC-7901 cells was estimated to be 89 micromol/L. The effects of beta-ionone on MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities in SGC-7901 cells were not observed. However, the levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 transcripts were elevated in cells treated with beta-ionone in a dose-dependent manner.

beta-ionone can inhibit the proliferation of SGC-7901 cells, upregulate the expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression, and may influence metastasis of cancer.
