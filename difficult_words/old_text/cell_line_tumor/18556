A novel 28 kDa cysteine protease (Cs28CF) secreted by the hepatobiliary trematode, Clonorchis sinensis was identified. The protease was purified from the excretory-secretory products (ESP) of the adult worm using DEAE-ion exchange and Arginine-Sepharose 4B chromatography. It showed a high activity between pH 6.5 and 7.5 in a dithiothreitol (DTT)-dependent manner. Inhibitors specific to cysteine proteases down-regulated the activity. Addition of Cs28CF to monkey cholangiocyte cultures resulted in approximately 95% cell death after 7 days. The full-length cDNA (1078 bp) encoded a single peptide of 328 amino acids (aa) with an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence, an ERFNAQ motif in the propeptide and a mature domain. Expression of mRNA transcripts of Cs28CF was observed in both the metacercaria and adult stages. Bacterially expressed recombinant protein exhibited a specific antibody reaction with clonorchiasis sera. Deduced aa exhibited 52-76% sequence identity with the cathepsin F analogues from other organisms. A novel E/DXGTA motif was recognized in the propeptide region. Phylogenetic analysis of 63 papain family members revealed that the trematode cysteine proteases formed 2 major clades of cathepsins F and L. The trematode cysteine proteases classified as cathepsin F shared higher homology among themselves than those classified as cathepsin L. Cathepsin F is phylogenetically conserved in the trematode parasites as well as in mammals.
