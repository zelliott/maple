Novel non-steroidal progesterone receptor antagonists with a 3-phenylquinazoline-2,4-dione/2-phenylisoquinoline-1,3-dione skeleton were developed and their structure-activity relationships were investigated. Among the prepared compounds, 4-(4,4-diethyl-3,4-dihydro-1,3-dioxoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)benzonitrile (DEPIQ-4CN) showed the most potent activity, with IC(50) values of 74-78nM in alkaline phosphatase activity and reporter gene assays.
