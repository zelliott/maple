FOXO3a is a ubiquitously expressed mammalian forkhead transcription factor with a high expression level in adult brain. The activity of FOXO3a is inhibited by growth factors through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, which phosphorylates FOXO3a and decreases the level of FOXO3a in the nucleus. In the present study, we examined the regulation of FOXO3a by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in retinoic acid (RA)-differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. BDNF caused a rapid and time-dependent decrease of nuclear FOXO3a with a corresponding increase of cytosolic FOXO3a. The rate of the BDNF-induced nuclear/cytosolic redistribution was consistent with the time course of BDNF-induced threonine32-phosphorylation of FOXO3a, and was mediated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Active FOXO3a rapidly increased the level of Bcl-2-interacting mediator (bim) in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, and BDNF decreased the FOXO3a-induced increase of bim through activation of both PI3K/Akt and Erk signaling pathways. Thapsigargin, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing agent, significantly decreased threonine32-phosphorylation of FOXO3a, and increased nuclear and decreased cytosolic FOXO3a, suggesting that thapsigargin activates FOXO3a. Treatment with BDNF completely reversed and blocked the thapsigargin-induced dephosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a. In addition, protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitors increased threonine32-phosphorylation of FOXO3a, decreased nuclear FOXO3a, and blocked thapsigargin-induced activity of FOXO3a. The regulatory effect of BDNF on FOXO3a and its target genes may play a significant role in the BDNF-mediated neuronal survival, differentiation, and plasticity.
