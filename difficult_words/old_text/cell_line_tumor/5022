Early-onset ataxia with ocular motor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia (EAOH)/ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding aprataxin (APTX). Although several in vitro findings proposed that impaired enzymatic activities of APTX are responsible for EAOH/AOA1, potential instability of mutant proteins has also been suggested as the pathogenesis based on in vivo finding that mutant proteins are almost undetectable in EAOH/AOA1 tissues or cells. The present study aimed to experimentally prove instability of mutant proteins in neuronal cells, the cell type preferentially affected by this disease. Results of pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that all of the disease-associated mutants had extremely shorter half-lives than the WT. We further found that mutants were targeted for rapid proteasome-mediated degradation. These results help establish pathogenic and physiological protein characteristics of APTX in neuronal cells.
