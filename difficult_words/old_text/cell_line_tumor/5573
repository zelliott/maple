Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a decoy receptor for receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). While RANKL is essential for osteoclastogenesis and facilitates breast cancer migration into bone, TRAIL promotes breast cancer apoptosis. We analyzed the expression of OPG and TRAIL and its modulation in estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells and receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. In both cells, OPG mRNA levels and protein secretion were dose- and time-dependently enhanced by interleukin (IL)-1beta and suppressed by dexamethasone. In contrast to MCF-7 cells, MDA-MB-231 abundantly expressed TRAIL mRNA, which was enhanced by IL-1beta and inhibited by dexamethasone. TRAIL activated pro-apoptotic caspase-3, -7, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase and decreased cell numbers of MDA-MB-231, but had no effect on MCF-7 cells. Gene silencing siRNA directed against OPG resulted in a 31% higher apoptotic rate compared to non-target siRNA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, TRAIL induced significantly less apoptosis in cells cultured in conditioned media (containing OPG) compared to cells exposed to TRAIL in fresh medium lacking OPG (P < 0.01) and these protective effects were reversed by blocking OPG with its specific ligand RANKL (P < 0.05). The association between cancer cell survival and OPG production by MDA-MB-231 cells was further supported by the finding, that modulation of OPG secretion using IL-1beta or dexamethasone prior to TRAIL exposure resulted in decreased and increased rate of apoptosis, respectively (P < 0.05). Thus, OPG secretion by breast cancer cells is modulated by cytokines and dexamethasone, and may represent a critical resistance mechanism that protects against TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
