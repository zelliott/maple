We assessed the contribution of antibody internalization in the efficacy and toxicity of intraperitoneal α-radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of small volume carcinomatosis using (212)Pb-labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target HER2 (internalizing) or CEA (non-internalizing) receptors.

Athymic nude mice bearing 2-3 mm intraperitoneal tumor xenografts were intraperitoneally injected with similar activities (370, 740 and 1480 kBq; 37 MBq/mg) of (212)Pb-labeled 35A7 (anti-CEA), trastuzumab (anti-HER2) or PX (non-specific) mAbs, or with equivalent amounts of unlabeled mAbs, or with NaCl. Tumor volume was monitored by bioluminescence and survival was reported. Hematologic toxicity and body weight were assessed. Biodistribution of (212)Pb-labeled mAbs and absorbed dose-effect relationships using MIRD formalism were established.

Transient hematological toxicity, as revealed by white blood cells and platelets numbering, was reported in mice treated with the highest activities of (212)Pb-labeled mAbs. The median survival (MS) was significantly higher in mice injected with 1.48 MBq of (212)Pb-35A7 (non-internalizing mAbs) (MS = 94 days) than in animals treated with the same activity of (212)Pb-PX mAbs or with NaCl (MS = 18 days). MS was even not reached after 130 days when follow-up was discontinued in mice treated with 1.48 MBq of (212)Pb-trastuzumab. The later efficacy was unexpected since final absorbed dose resulting from injection of 1.48 MBq, was higher for (212)Pb-35A7 (35.5 Gy) than for (212)Pb-trastuzumab (27.6 Gy). These results also highlight the lack of absorbed dose-effect relationship when mean absorbed dose was calculated using MIRD formalism and the requirement to perform small-scale dosimetry.

These data indicate that it might be an advantage of using internalizing anti-HER2 compared with non-internalizing anti-CEA (212)Pb-labeled mAbs in the therapy of small volume xenograft tumors. They support clinical investigations of (212)Pb-mAbs RIT as an adjuvant treatment after cytoreductive surgery in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
