Malignant cells show increased glucose uptake, which is thought to be mediated by glucose transporters. Glucose transporter protein 1 (Glut-1) is critical for growth, proliferation, and migration of tumor cells and Glut-1 overexpression is associated with poor overall survival in osteosarcoma patients. The present study was designed to determine the role of Glut-1 in the growth and invasion of the osteosarcoma cell line MG63, using RNA interference technology in vitro. shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors targeting the Glut-1 gene were constructed, which were stably expressed in MG63 cells. The level of Glut-1 mRNA was investigated using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the protein expression of Glut-1 mRNA was observed using western blotting. MG63 cellular glucose uptake, proliferation, and migration were detected by methyl thiazole tetrazolium assay and flow cytometry. A Glut-1-specific shRNA-expressing lentiviral vector was obtained, which could efficiently inhibit the mRNA and protein expression of Glut-1 to âˆ¼82%-85% in MG63 cells. Downregulation of Glut-1 inhibited the cellular glucose uptake, growth, and invasion of MG63 cells in vitro. These results indicate that RNA interference targeting of Glut-1 could be an effective strategy for the treatment of osteoscarcoma patients.
