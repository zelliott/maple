We have developed biochemical and cell based assays to characterize small therapeutic molecules that inhibit the DNA damage checkpoint enzyme, Chk1 (Checkpoint kinase 1).

To prepare a screen of large chemical libraries, we purified the full-length and the catalytic domain versions of human Chk1. We characterized their properties and then selected full-length Chk1 as the variant most suitable for screening. We then identified and characterized structurally different Chk1 inhibitors in cell based-assays by measuring cytotoxicity and checkpoint bypass activity.

We treated human cells with topoisomerase I inhibitors and demonstrated that at the time of Chk1 inhibitor addition, the cells have damaged DNA and activated Chk1. One Chk1 inhibitor, the indolocarbazole S27888, was active in the checkpoint bypass assay.

Knowing that the protein kinase inhibitory properties are different for each inhibitor, it seems that only a limited range of inhibitory activity is tolerated by cells. Chk1 has an essential role in determining how cancer cells respond to genotoxic treatments, therefore, inhibitors of this protein kinase are of great medical interest.
