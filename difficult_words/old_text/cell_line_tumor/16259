To understand the mechanisms behind platinum drug/DENSPM-induced inhibition of cancer cell growth, we compared the effects of oxaliplatin and cisplatin when combined with DENSPM on the induction of SSAT mRNA, activity, polyamines and cell growth in A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells and their oxaliplatin- and cisplatin-resistant variants A2780/C10B and A2780/CP, respectively.

Parental and Pt-resistant cells were treated with platinum agent alone, DENSPM alone or combination (10 Î¼M each, 20 h). QRT-PCR, radioactive product measurement and HPLC were used for mRNA, activity and polyamine pools, respectively; drug interaction on cell growth was by SRB and isobologram analysis.

Both platinum agents induced SSAT mRNA in parental A2780 cells, but not in resistant cells. Platinum drug/DENSPM combinations produced high levels of SSAT activity in parental cells with significant depletion of spermine and spermidine, but not in resistant cells. Co-treatment with platinum agents increased the levels of DENSPM in all cell lines. Oxaliplatin/DENSPM combination was superior to cisplatin/DENSPM in the inhibition of cell growth in parental cells. No synergy was observed in the resistant cells.

Increased DENSPM levels following co-treatment with Pt agents enhances the translation and stability of SSAT protein leading to polyamine pool depletion, facilitating more Pt-DNA adduct formation in parental cells. Oxaliplatin/DENSPM combination is superior to cisplatin/DENSPM in cell growth inhibition as DACH-Pt DNA adducts are cytotoxic even at relatively fewer numbers. Reduced platinum uptake in Pt-resistant cells contributes to reduced SSAT mRNA induction and absence of synergy when combined with DENSPM.
