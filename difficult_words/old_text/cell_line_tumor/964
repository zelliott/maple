Expression of genes in the Rb-E2F signaling pathway is controlled by E2F transcriptional factors originally defined as molecules that bind to the promoter of E2 adenovirus. The E2F gene family consists of six members and is designated E2F1-6. The Rb-E2F signaling pathway is among the main regulators of the cell cycle, hence its importance in differentiation and oncogenesis. We document here up-regulation of E2F1, but not other members of the E2F gene family, in 15 of 18 primary papillary thyroid cancers examined (83%) in comparison to corresponding noncancerous thyroid tissues and in all of 11 anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cell lines (100%). The E2F4 gene, however, was down-regulated in 12 of the papillary thyroid cancers (67%). Immunohistochemical analysis with antibody to E2F1 revealed prominent intracellular E2F1 protein in most of the primary papillary cancers (16 of 18; 89%) but was not detectable in normal thyroid tissues. These data indicated that increased expression of the E2F1 gene might play a significant role in human thyroid carcinogenesis through derangement of the Rb-E2F signaling pathway.
