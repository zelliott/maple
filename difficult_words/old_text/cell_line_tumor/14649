Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is a ubiquitous intracellular redox enzyme that regulates tumor growth and proliferation in various cancer cells. Ethaselen (1,2-[bis(1,2-benzisoselenazolone-3(2H)-ketone)]-ethane), a novel anticancer agent, is designed to target mammalian TrxR1 with the aims of cancer growth inhibition and TrxR inactivation. In this study, we demonstrated that ethaselen significantly inhibits cell growth in the poorly differentiated colorectal RKO cell line, and simultaneously downregulates mammalian TrxR1 mRNA transcript levels, protein expression and enzyme activity, which differs from its actions in moderately differentiated colorectal LoVo cells. Ethaselen's significant abatement of the Wnt/beta-catenin cell differentiation-related signaling pathway was also observed in RKO cells; this apparently leads to its strong inhibitory effect on cell growth and TrxR1 activity in this cell line. These results suggest that ethaselen has a novel mechanism affecting cell growth in the poorly differentiated RKO colorectal cell line.
