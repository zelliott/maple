We tested the hypothesis that cell invasiveness and tumorigenesis are driven by hypomethylation of genes involved in tumor progression. Highly invasive human prostate cancer cells PC-3 were treated with either the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) or methyl DNA-binding domain protein 2 antisense oligonucleotide (MBD2-AS). Both treatments resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of key genes, such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and vascular endothelial growth factor expression to decrease tumor cell invasion in vitro. No change in the levels of expression of genes already known to be methylated in late-stage prostate cancer cells, such as glutathione S-transferase P1 and androgen receptor, was seen. Inoculation of PC-3 cells pretreated with SAM and MBD2-AS into the flank of male BALB/c nu/nu mice resulted in the development of tumors of significantly smaller volume compared with animals inoculated with PC-3 cells treated with vehicle alone or MBD2 scrambled oligonucleotide. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumors showed the ability of SAM and MBD2-AS to significantly decrease tumoral uPA and MMP-2 expression along with levels of angiogenesis and survival pathway signaling molecules. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of tumoral genomic DNA showed that inhibition of both uPA and MMP-2 expression was due to methylation of their 5' regulatory region. These studies support the hypothesis that DNA hypomethylation controls the activation of multiple tumor-promoting genes and provide valuable insight into developing novel therapeutic strategies against this common disease, which target the demethylation machinery.
