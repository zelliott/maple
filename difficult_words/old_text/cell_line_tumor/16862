An eye for an iron: A highly sensitive, selective and reversible turn-on Fe(3+)  sensor for imaging labile Fe(3+)  in live cells at subcellular resolution is reported. The sensor can respond to changes in intracellular Fe(3+)  levels and was used to image endogenous chelatable Fe(3+)  in live human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, with two Fe(3+)  pools being identified in mitochondria and endosomes/ lysosomes for the first time.
