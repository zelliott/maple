Some novel pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile derivatives bearing various substituent have been synthesized. The structures of target compounds were confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data. Some selected members of the newly synthesized compounds were investigated for their cytotoxic potency against certain human tumor cell lines. Five representative active anticancer compounds 6a, 6c, 6d, 17a and 18a were subjected to docking using MOE program on the 3D structure of two enzymes, namely; thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase. The antimicrobial activities of the synthesized compounds were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri and Candida albicans. Compounds 2c, 7a and 9c showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity.
