On the basis of the fact of the overexpression of integrins in malignant tumor cells and neovasculature, and the advantage of polymeric micelles (PM) as the drug carriers, a cyclic RGD peptide (cRGDyK) was anchored on the surface of polyethylene glycol-b-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PEG-b-PLGA) micelles as a ligand of integrins in order to enhance the intracellular delivery of encapsulated hydrophobic drug into the tumor cells and its neovasculature. Toward this goal, PEG-b-PLGA micelles without or with cRGDyK conjugation loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) or DiI were prepared and characterized. The results revealed that drug-loaded micelles were stable in solution, with small diameters (<80â€‰nm) and a low critical micelle concentration. Spectrophotofluorometry, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry showed that cRGDyK-conjugated micelles (TPM) facilitated the cell-specific uptake of DiI into the murine melanoma B16-F10 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) via integrin-mediated endocytosis compared with cRGDyK-free micelles (NPM), and the uptake was proportional to the ratio of cRGDyK modification in certain range. Meanwhile, PTX-loaded TPM displayed higher cytotoxicity and antiproliferation activities against both cells than PTX-loaded NPM. These results suggest that cRGDyK-coupled PEG-b-PLGA micelles may be the promising intracellular targeting carriers for efficient delivery of chemotherapeutic agents into tumor cells and neovasculature.
