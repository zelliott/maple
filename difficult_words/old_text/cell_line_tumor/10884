Bioassay-guided fractionation of CHCl3 extract from the fermentation broth of a sponge Mycale plumose-derived actinomycete Saccharopolyspora sp. nov., led to the isolation of two known prodigiosin analogs--metacycloprodigiosin (1) and undecylprodigiosin (2). These compounds exhibited significant cytotoxic activities against five cancer cell lines: P388, HL60, A-549, BEL-7402, and SPCA4. This is the first report on the significant cytotoxicity of metacycloprodigiosin (1) against human cancer cell lines.
