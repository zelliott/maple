The microRNA miR-138 is dysregulated in several human cancers, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we report that miR-138 is commonly underexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) specimens and NPC cell lines. The ectopic expression of miR-138 dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. Moreover, we identified the cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene as a novel direct target of miR-138. In consistent with the knocked-down expression of CCND1, overexpression of miR-138 inhibited cell growth and cell cycle progression in NPC cells. Furthermore, CCND1 was widely upregulated in NPC tumors, and its mRNA levels were inversely correlated with miR-138 expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-138 might be a tumor suppressor in NPC, which is exerted partially by inhibiting CCND1 expression. The identification of functional miR-138 in NPC and its direct link to CCND1 might provide good candidates for developing diagnostic markers and therapeutic applications for NPC.
