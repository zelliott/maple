Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) is an aggressive malignancy resistant to standard treatment modalities. Previously, we have reported that cancer-associated Sm-like protein (CaSm) contributes to the neoplastic transformation of PC. In this study, we utilized a recently established preclinical model of PC to determine if molecular targeting of CaSm can serve as the basis for a novel PC therapy. In a subcutaneous tumor model, intratumoral administration of an adenoviral vector encoding CaSm antisense RNA (Ad-alphaCaSm) significantly inhibited Panc02 tumor growth. Furthermore, in a metastatic tumor model, systemic administration of Ad-alphaCaSm resulted in a significant decrease in the number of hepatic metastases and increased survival time. We assessed the efficiency of in vivo delivery and observed significant levels of vector transduction in tissues containing PC, as well as a bystander effect that was amplifying the efficacy of CaSm gene therapy. This bystander effect was also active in vitro and was shown to be at least partially independent of host-related mechanisms. We conclude that CaSm antisense gene therapy is an effective novel therapy for PC and that the antitumor efficacy is dependent on both direct and bystander mechanisms.
