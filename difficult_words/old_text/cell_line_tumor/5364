Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) of Paclitaxel were prepared by modified Hot homogenization method using Glyceryl monostearate (GMS). The SLNs were characterized for its physicochemical characteristics such as mean particle size, percentage entrapment efficiency and zeta potential, which were found to be 226 nm, 92.43% and -29.4 mV, respectively. The Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies showed that prepared SLNs were of spherical shape. The drug retarding efficiency of the lipid (GMS) was better in pH 7.4 compared to pH 3.5. The release profile showed a tendency to follow Higuchi diffusion pattern at pH 7.4 and Peppas-Korsenmeyer model at pH 3.5. Chemosensitivity assay carried out using B16F10 cell lines showed that anti-proliferative activity of Paclitaxel was not hindered due to encapsulation.
