Silencing and position-effect (PE) variegation (PEV), which is due to integration of viral vectors in heterochromatin regions, are considered significant obstacles to obtaining a consistent level of transgene expression in gene therapy. The inclusion of chromatin insulators into vectors has been proposed to counteract this position-dependent variegation of transgene expression. Here, we show that the sea urchin chromatin insulator, sns5, protects a recombinant gamma-retroviral vector from the negative influence of chromatin in erythroid milieu. This element increases the probability of vector expression at different chromosomal integration sites, which reduces both silencing and PEV. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, we demonstrated the specific binding of GATA1 and OCT1 transcription factors and the enrichment of hyperacetylated nucleosomes to sns5 sequences. The results suggest that this new insulator is able to maintain a euchromatin state inside the provirus locus with mechanisms that are common to other characterized insulators. On the basis of its ability to function as barrier element in erythroid milieu and to bind the erythroid specific factor GATA1, the inclusion of sns5 insulator in viral vectors may be of practical benefit in gene transfer applications and, in particular, for gene therapy of erythroid disorders.
