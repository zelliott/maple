Pharmacological agents that are safe and can sensitize the lung cancer are urgently required. We investigated whether Atractylenolide III (ATL-III), the major component of Atractylodes rhizome can induce apoptosis of the lung carcinoma cells. ATL-III inhibited cell growth, increased lactate dehydrogenase release and modulated cell cycle on human lung carcinoma A549 cells. ALT-III induced the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and cleavage of poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase. ATL-III induced the release of cytochrome c, upregulation of bax expression, and translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor. In addition, ATL-III inhibited the proliferation and capillary tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These data indicate that ATL-III is a potential candidate for treatment of human lung carcinoma.
