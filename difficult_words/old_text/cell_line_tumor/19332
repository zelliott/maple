Two new prenylated dihydroflavanoids have been isolated from the medicinal plant of Dolichos tenuicaulis (Baker) Craib. Their structures were elucidated as (2S)-5,2',6'-trihydroxy-8-prenyl-6,7-(3-prenyl-2,2-dimethylpyrano)-3',4'-(2,2-dimethyl-1-keone-cyclohexadiene)-flavanone (1) and (2S)-5,2',6'-trihydroxy-8-prenyl-6,7-(3-prenyl-2,2-dimethyl-1-keone-cyclohexadiene)-flavanone (2) on the basis of spectroscopic analysis.
