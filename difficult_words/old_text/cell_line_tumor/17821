To investigate the inhibitive role of the invasion and growth of laryngeal cancer by lentivirus mediated Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-9) gene silence.

RNA interference (RNAi) technic was used. Recombinant lentivirus of small interference RNA targeting MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene were transduced into Hep-2 cells, and Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to test MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in Hep-2 cells. The effect of the invasive capability in Hep-2 cells after MMP-2-RNAi-lentivirus and MMP-9-RNAi-lentivirus transduction was observed by Boyden assay. In vivo experiment, the nude mouse model of laryngeal squamous carcinoma was established and MMP-2-RNAi-lentivirus and MMP-9-RNAi-lentivirus were intratumoral injected. Finally, the tumor inhibitive effect was observed and the Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in xenografts were examined to evaluate proliferation change of the Hep-2 cells.

The recombinant lentivirus can transduce the target cells efficiently. RT-PCR showed the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were negative. Boyden assay showed there were (14 +/- 4) Hep-2 cells permeate artificial basement which was less than that (32 +/- 6) in the control group. In vivo, the average tumor weight and volume in treated group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.01) and the tumor inhibitive rate was 46.59%. Immunohistochemistry showed PCNA index in treated group was obviously lower than that in control group (P < 0.01).

The invasion, growth and proliferation of laryngeal cancer can be inhibited by lentivirus mediated MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene silence together.
