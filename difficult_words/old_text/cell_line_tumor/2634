Here we report a fast and effective method to visualize interactive proteins across intact mammalian cells via on-site formation of fluorescence using instant reaction of non-fluorescent fluorescamine with primary amines on proteins. Without interference by fluorescence background, this fluorogenic labelling opens a way for selective identification of primary amine-rich interacting proteins, efficient mapping and real-time monitoring of their spatial distribution in assemblies/network, and fast differentiation of cellular types. Without adverse effect on biological functions, this labelling method also provides new insights to comprehend important aspects of cellular functions of organelles and their relation to health imperfections for disease diagnostics and imaging-guided therapy.
