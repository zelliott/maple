Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancers in the United States. Epothilone B (EpoB), Taxol and vinblastine are anti-neoplastic agents that interfere with microtubules and arrest the cell cycle in the G2/M phase. EpoB is being evaluated in phase III clinical trials, and its analogs are currently being used in the treatment of taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer. Little is known about the effect of these drugs on the immune response to tumors. Cancer cells evade immune recognition by down-regulating HLA Class I expression, allowing escape from immune surveillance and destruction. Our data illustrates the effect of microtubule-interacting agents on HLA Class I and HLA-A2 expression as well as the modulation of cytokine expression in ovarian cancer cells.

Ovarian cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of drugs. Cell surface expression and mRNA transcription of HLA Class I molecules and HLA-A2 was examined. IFNα, IL1β, IL12 and IL6 mRNA expression was also evaluated upon EpoB treatment.

Low-dose EpoB, Taxol and vinblastine greatly increased expression of HLA Class I and HLA-A2 molecules in Hey ovarian cancer cells. EpoB does not modulate HLA expression in drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells. The expression of IFNα, IL1β, IL12 and IL6 is also markedly increased upon EpoB treatment.

Nanomolar concentrations of microtubule-interacting agents enhance immune-visibility of ovarian cancer cells by increasing HLA Class I and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Immune recognition of tumor cells may be improved.
