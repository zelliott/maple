Early stage rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is often difficult to diagnose because initial symptoms are non-specific. To aid diagnosis, suitable serological diagnostic markers are sought. Elevated levels of soluble MHC class II (soluble human leukocyte antigen; sHLA-DR) in human serum have been associated with rheumatoid and 'rheumatoid-like' autoimmune diseases. As a result, sHLA-DR has been suggested as a specific marker of RA. However, reported levels of sHLA-DR in sera of healthy donors vary significantly and the mechanism of release of HLA-DR into serum is poorly understood. Investigations into the diagnostic potential of this molecule necessitate the development of a sensitive and specific sHLA-DR assay. We have investigated multiple ELISA setups to develop such an assay and false positive signal has been carefully removed using a combination of isotype-matched controls and immuno-depletion. sHLA-DR levels in sera of RA patients were not significantly different from those in healthy donors which suggests sHLA-DR has limited utility in the diagnosis of RA. In RA patients, we detected high levels of sHLA-DR in aspirated synovial fluid (SF), but this did not correlate with sHLA-DR levels in serum.
