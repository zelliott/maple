Ethyl-4-[trans-4-[((2S)-2-hydroxy-3-[4-hydroxy-3[(methylsulfonyl)amino] phenoxy]propyl) amino]cyclohexyl]benzoate hydrochloride (SAR150640) was characterized as a new potent and selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist for the treatment of preterm labor. SAR150640 and its major metabolite, the corresponding acid 4-[trans-4-[((2S)-2-hydroxy-3-[4-hydroxy-3[(methylsulfonyl) amino] phenoxy]propyl)amino]cyclohexyl]benzoic acid (SSR500400), showed high affinity for beta(3)-adrenoceptors (K(i) = 73 and 358 nM) and greater potency than (-)-isoproterenol in increasing cAMP production in membrane preparations from human neuroblastoma cells (SKNMC), which express native beta(3)-adrenoceptors (pEC(50) = 6.5, 6.2, and 5.1, respectively). SAR150640 and SSR500400 also increased cAMP production in membrane preparations from human uterine smooth muscle cells (UtSMC), which also express native beta(3)-adrenoceptors (pEC(50) = 7.7 and 7.7, respectively). In these cells, SAR150640 dose-dependently inhibited oxytocin-induced intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation. SAR150640 and SSR500400 had no beta(1)- or beta(2)-agonist or antagonist activity in guinea pig atrium and trachea, or in human isolated atrium and bronchus preparations. Both compounds concentration-dependently inhibited spontaneous contractions in human near-term myometrial strips, with greater potency than salbutamol and 4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)-amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one hydrochloride (CGP12177) (pIC(50) = 6.4, 6.8, 5.9, and 5.8, respectively), but with similar potency to (-)-isoproterenol and atosiban (oxytocin/vasopressin V(1)a receptor antagonist). SAR150640 also inhibited the contractions induced by oxytocin and prostaglandin F(2alpha). In vivo, after intravenous administration, SAR150640 (1 and 6 mg/kg), but not atosiban (6 mg/kg), dose-dependently inhibited myometrial contractions in conscious unrestrained female cynomolgus monkeys, with no significant effects on heart rate or blood pressure. In contrast, salbutamol (50 and 250 microg/kg) had no inhibitory effect on uterine contractions, but it dose-dependently increased heart rate. These findings indicate a potential for the therapeutic use of SAR150640 in mammals during preterm labor.
