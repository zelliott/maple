To investigate the synergistic effect of oxymatrine (OM) and angiogenesis inhibitor NM-3 on modulating apoptosis in human gastric cancer cell lines SGC-7901, MKN-45, MKN-74.

Human gastric cancer lines SGC-7901, MKN-45, MKN-74 were treated with OM in the absence and presence of NM-3. The inhibitory rates were detected by MTT assay. Synergistic effect of OM and NM-3 on the growth of survivin, bcl-2, bax and p53 in SGC-7901 cells were examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, and their growth inhibitory effects were also observed on SGC-7901 tumor xenograft in nude mice.

OM combined with NM-3 exhibited a synergistic inhibitory effect on the growth of SGC-7901, MKN-45 and MKN-74 cells in a time-dependent manner. Twenty-four hours after treatment with OM, NM-3 alone and their combination, mRNA expression of survivin and bcl-2 in SGC-7901 cells decreased, p53 mRNA expression increased. OM (4 g/L) combined with NM-3 significantly increased the expression of p53 mRNA and decreased the expression of survivin and bcl-2 compared with either agent alone (193% +/- 34% vs 129% +/- 12%; 44% +/- 18% vs 92% +/- 18%; 36 +/- 17% vs 93% +/- 23%, P < 0.05). Western blotting showed that the synergistic effect of OM and NM-3 on protein translation of survivin, bcl-2 and p53 was in accordance with their mRNAs. Furthermore, OM/NM-3 combination obviously exhibited antitumor growth effect in xenografted human gastric cancer cells SGC-7901 compared with either agent alone.

OM combined with NM-3 has synergistic inhibitory effects on human gastric cancer cells in vitro and can suppress the growth of xenografted human gastric cancer cells SGC-7901 in vivo.
