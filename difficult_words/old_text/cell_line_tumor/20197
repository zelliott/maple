GS-9451, a novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 3/4a (NS3/4a) protease inhibitor, is highly active in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (GT 1). The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical resistance profile of GS-9451 in GT 1 HCV-infected patients in a phase 1, 3-day monotherapy study. The full-length NS3/4A gene was population sequenced at baseline, on the final treatment day, and at follow-up time points. NS3 protease domains from patient isolates with emerging mutations were cloned into an NS3 shuttle vector, and their susceptibilities to GS-9451 and other HCV inhibitors were determined using a transient replication assay. No resistance mutations at NS3 position 155, 156, or 168 were detected in any of the baseline samples or in viruses from patients treated with 60 mg of GS-9451 once daily. Among patients who received 200 mg and 400 mg of GS-9451, viruses with mutations at position D168 (D168E/G/V) and R155 (R155K), which confer high-level resistance to GS-9451, were detected in those with GT 1b and GT 1a virus, respectively. Viruses with D168 mutations were no longer detected in any GT 1b patient at day 14 and subsequent time points. In GT 1a patients, R155K mutants were replaced by the wild type in 57% of patients at week 24. These NS3 clinical mutants were sensitive to NS5B and NS5A inhibitors, as well as alpha interferon (IFN-Î±) and ribavirin. The lack of cross-resistance between GS-9451 and other classes of HCV inhibitors supports the utility of combination therapy.
