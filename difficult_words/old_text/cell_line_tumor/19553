Exposure to solar UVB radiation is involved in the development of cutaneous melanoma. We previously showed that human melanocytes and melanoma cells respond to UVB radiation via a p53-independent pathway involving GADD45A activation. Here, we determined that UVB-induction of Gadd45a is necessary for G(2) arrest and that Gadd45a and its partner p21(Waf1) colocalize in nuclear bodies called Nuclear Speckles. We further observed that UVB-induced G(2) arrest is associated with Cdc2 accumulation in these Nuclear Speckles. Knock-down of Gadd45a expression by RNA interference prevents both UVB-induced Cdc2 accumulation in Nuclear Speckles and G(2) arrest. Our results demonstrate that UVB-induced G(2) arrest of melanoma cells is Gadd45a-dependent. Furthermore, we show that Cdc2 sequestration by Gadd45a occurs in Nuclear Speckles, suggesting a new role for these nuclear bodies, so far only linked to RNA maturation.
