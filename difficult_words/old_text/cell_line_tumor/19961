The tumoricidal activity of a bioactive metabolite produced by submerged culture in a 2.1-L airlift fermentor of Grifola frondosa NTUS was investigated. After 14 days of cultivation, ethyl acetate extracts from the supernatant of culture broth (EES) were analyzed by cell viability assay. The IC50 of EES for cytotoxicity against human carcinoma cells (Hep 3B, Hep G2, HeLa, CL1-1) and normal human lung fibroblast MRC-5 was 78.4, 52.7, 77.6, 71.0, and 233.3 microg/mL, respectively. EES was further fractionated and a main cytotoxic compound, HE-5-5, was obtained. The IC50 of HE-5-5 based on the cell viability of Hep 3B and MRC-5 cells was 3.6 and 33.1 microg/mL, respectively. Thus, HE-5-5 showed a selective cytotoxic effect against Hep 3B cells and MRC-5. According to the UV, MS, and NMR data, HE-5-5 was identified as o-orsellinaldehyde. A DNA fragmentation assay together with the presence of a significant sub-G1 peak by flow cytometry suggested that o-orsellinaldehyde might mediate its cytotoxicity through apoptosis.
