Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common malignant tumor in the oral and maxillofacial region. The mechanism of carcinogenesis of OSCC is still unclear. In vitro study on OSCC cell lines, especially derived from immortalized oral epithelial cells, is a very useful strategy to understand the mechanism of carcinogenesis. Based on our previous human immortalized oral epithelial cell (HIOEC) line, obtained from normal oral epithelial cells by transfection of HPV16 E6/E7 gene, a new cancerous cell line, HIOEC-B(a)P-96 (HB96), was established from the HIOEC by induction with benzo(a)pyrene. The characteristics of the HB96 cells such as cell morphology, ultrastructure, proliferation ability, invasion ability, and tumorigenesis were studied. The HB96 cells lost contact inhibition with uncontrolled cell division and obvious cell overlap, they were polygonal in shape and ununiform in size with increased ratio between nucleus and plasma. Increased proliferative ability and invasion ability were confirmed by the cell proliferation analysis and cell invasion assay, respectively. The tumorigenicity of well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed in the nude mice experiments pathologically. Increased expression of HPV16 E6/E7 proteins and obvious correlation with decreased expression of p53 and Rb proteins was also confirmed by Western blotting. Thus, this HB96 cell line induced by benzo(a)pyrene from the HIOEC line is a useful tool to study the mechanism of carcinogenesis of OSCC in vitro for future genomic and proteomic analyses. It is also the first in vitro cancerous cell line of OSCC in China derived from immortalized oral epithelial cells.
