To investigate the effect of pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) on the growth of lung cancer cells and the cancer-related neovascularization.

The full length of human PEDF gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Human lung cancer cells of the line SKEMS1 were cultured and transfected with PEDF(exp), An eukaryotic expression vector constructed by recombinant DNA technology, so as to construct the SKMES1(PEDFexp) cells over-expressing PEDF protein. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to confirm the mRNA and protein expression of PEDF in these cells. Another SKMES1 lung cancer cells were transfected with blank plasmids (SKMES1(pEF/His) cells). The SKMES1 cells not transfected were called SKMES1(WT) cells. The 3 kinds of SKMES1 cells were inoculated in the chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) of chick embryo hatched for 7 days respectively. The size and weigh of the tumor were measured. The vessels density was examined.

The tumor volume of the SKMES1(PEDFexp) group was (0.10 +/- 0.05) cm(3), significantly smaller than that of the control group [(0.17 +/- 0.07) cm(3), P = 0.016], and the mass of the SKME(SPEDFexp) group was (0.008 +/- 0.004) mg, significantly smaller than that of the control group too [(0.024 +/- 0.009) mg, P = 0.006]. The amount of first class neo-vessels of the SKMES1(PEDFexp) group was (15 +/- 3), significantly fewer than that of the control group [(41 +/- 9), P < 0.001]. The amount of second class neo-vessels of the SKMES1(PEDFexp) group was (75 +/- 22), also significantly fewer than that of the control group [(175 +/- 39), P = 0.001].

Inhibiting the growth of lung cancer cells and neovascularization, PEDF protein may be used as a potential biological drug to treat lung cancer.
