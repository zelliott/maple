Nitric oxide (NO*) synthesis is induced within many tumors. The time course of NO* synthesis was evaluated during intra-peritoneal Meth A fibrosarcoma progression. While increasing macrophage recruitment into ascites was noted, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) antigen and function peaked between days 3-6 after tumor implantation. The capacity of cells to respond to LPS and IFNgamma stimulation was markedly depressed on day 9 and 11. Cellular proliferation correlated in an inverse fashion with levels of NO* synthesis. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and nitrotyrosine immunostaining failed to show accumulation of characteristic target cell lesions induced by NO*. These findings lead us to conclude that NO* production was increasingly suppressed during Meth A tumor progression. Depression of NO* production did not correlate with levels of the inhibitory cytokines TGFbeta and IL-10, but could be partially overcome by addition of sepiapterin (a tetrahydrobiopterin prodrug). Thus, depletion of essential co-factors necessary for iNOS function may contribute to depressed NO* responses during cancer progression.
