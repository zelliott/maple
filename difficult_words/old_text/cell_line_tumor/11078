Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), the most abundant known connexin-interacting protein in osteoblastic cells, associates with the carboxyl termini of both Cx43 and Cx45. To learn more about the role of the cormexin-ZO-1 interaction, we analyzed connexin trafficking and function in ROS 17/2.8 cells that were stably transfected either with full length Cx45 or with Cx45 lacking 34 or 37 amino acids on the carboxyl terminus (Cx45t34 or Cx45t37). All three proteins were transported to appositional membranes in the transfected cells: Cx45 and Cx45t34 displayed a punctate appositional membrane-staining pattern, while Cx45t37 staining at appositional membranes was more linear. Expression of Cx45 decreased gap junction communication as assayed by dye transfer, while expression of Cx45t34 or Cx45t37 increased the amount of dye transfer seen in these cells. We found that Cx43, Cx45 and Cx45t34 co-precipitated with ZO-1 in these cells, while Cx45t37 did not. We also found that Cx45t37 was much more soluble in 1% Triton X-100 than the other connexins examined. In addition, Cx45t37 migrated to a fraction of lighter buoyant density on sucrose flotation gradients than Cx43, Cx45, ZO-1 and Cx45t34. As ZO-1 is an actin-binding protein, this suggested that the differences in Cx45t37 solubility might be due to a difference between the interaction of gap junctions and the actin cytoskeleton in the ROS/Cx45t37 and in the other transfected ROS cells. To examine this possibility, the transfected ROS cells were stained with fluorescently labeled phalloidin and demonstrated that there was a notable loss of actin stress fibers in the ROS/Cx45t37 cells. These findings suggest that association with ZO-1 alters the plasma membrane localization of Cx45 by removing it from a lipid raft compartment and rendering it Triton-insoluble, presumably by promoting an interaction with the actin cytoskeleton; they also suggest that Cx45 has a complex binding interaction with ZO-1 that involves either an extended carboxyl terminal domain or two distinct binding sites.
