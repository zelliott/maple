Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) and HER2 (ErbB2/neu), members of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, are frequently overexpressed in breast cancer and are known to drive tumor growth and progression, making them promising targets for cancer therapy. Lapatinib is a selective competitive inhibitor of both the HER2 and EGFR tyrosine kinases. Although lapatinib showed significant activity in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, the role of EGFR in the response of breast cancer to lapatinib has not been defined. Here, we examined the role of EGFR expression levels in the sensitivity of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells to lapatinib. Depletion of EGFR by EGFR small-interfering RNA knockdown did not affect lapatinib sensitivity in these cells, whereas treated HER2 siRNA knockdown cells became more resistant to lapatinib. We conclude that the in vitro activity of lapatinib is not dependent on EGFR expression level in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.
