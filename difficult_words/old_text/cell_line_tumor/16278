Nowadays, investigation for possible therapeutic applications of various metal-based drugs attracts the scientific interest worldwide. The triorganotin compound bis[triphenyltin(IV)](3-carboxy-pyridine-2-thionato) (SnMNA), was tested for its anti-proliferative and antitumor activities. Cytotoxic activity was assessed by Trypan blue and 3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT). SnMNA exhibited potent cytotoxic effects against leiomyosarcoma cells (LMS) and human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7), which is 200 times stronger than that of cisplatin. Moreover, SnMNA induced significant apoptosis in LMS and MCF-7 cells characterized by flow cytometry analysis and DNA fragmentation. Acute and chronic toxicity studies on Wistar rats caused kidney and lung toxicity at a single dose of 80mg/kgBody Weight (BW) or four repeated doses of 8mg/kgBW once per week. Furthermore, antitumor activity studies on sarcoma bearing Wistar rats revealed that SnMNA complex at four repeated doses of 5.4mg/kgBW every three days prolonged mean survival time of the animal at 200% and decreased mean tumor growth rate (MTGR) compared to the control group ( p<0.05). It is noteworthy to mention that the 30% (3 out of 10) of the bearing animals were totally cured. These findings indicate that SnMNA might be a promising new antitumor agent.
