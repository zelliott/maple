Curcumin has a surprisingly wide range of chemo-preventive and chemo-therapeutic activities and is under investigation for the treatment of various human cancers. However, the clinical application of curcumin has been significantly limited by its instability and poor metabolic property. Although a number of synthetic modifications of curcumin have been studied intensively in order to develop a molecule with enhanced bioactivities, few synthetic studies were done for the improvement of pharmacokinetic profiles. In the present study, a series of mono-carbonyl analogues of curcumin were designed and synthesized by deleting the reactive beta-diketone moiety, which was considered to be responsible for the pharmacokinetic limitation of curcumin. The results of the in vitro stability studies and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies indicated that the stability of these mono-carbonyl analogues was greatly enhanced in vitro and their pharmacokinetic profiles were also significantly improved in vivo. Furthermore, the cytotoxic activities of mono-carbonyl analogues were evaluated in seven different tumor cell lines by MTT assay and the structure-activity relation (SAR) was discussed and concluded. The results suggest that the five-carbon linker-containing analogues of curcumin may be favorable for the curcumin-based drug development both pharmacokinetically and pharmacologically.
