To investigate the effects of catalase on the mitochondria and apoptotic behavior of SW480 cells treated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the changes in intracellular expression of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB).

LPS-stimulated SW480 cells were treated with catalase and the changes in their mitochondria and apoptotic behavior were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The expression of NF-kappaB was detected by immunohistochemical method.

Mitochondria damages and apoptosis were slightly diminished in the LPS-stimulated cells with catalase pretreatment, and the NF-kappaB expression was also decreased.

Catalase protect the mitochondria of SW480 cells from damages by LPS and inhibit the cell apoptosis, possibly due to the activation of NF-kappaB.
