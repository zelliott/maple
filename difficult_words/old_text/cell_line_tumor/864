This article describes the production and characterization of two liposome formulations containing antitumor drugs, namely distamycin A (Dist) and a new alkyl derivative of distamycin A (C16-Dist). Egg-PC/cholesterol liposomes (4:1 mol/mol) were prepared by reverse phase evaporation technique followed by extrusion through polycarbonate filters. The encapsulation efficiency was found to be almost complete for C16-Dist (99.8%), while native distamycin A showed a lower yield (19.0%). The in vitro antiproliferative activity of the distamycins-containing liposomes determined on human leukaemic K562 cells, was 11-fold and 8-fold higher for native and alkyl derivative distamycin A, respectively, compared with that of the corresponding free drugs. Liposomal formulations show an increase in the activity and specificity of distamycins in experimental antitumor therapy.
