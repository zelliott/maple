Drug screening is an essential and widely used technique for drug discovery in various biomedical fields notably in oncology. Here we describe a functional screening assay based on the bioluminescence detection of a secreted luciferase for monitoring cell viability of cancer cells in a high-throughput format. This assay allows the screening of large libraries comprising thousands of compounds and the identification of potential anticancer molecules in a rapid, facile, and cost-effective manner.
