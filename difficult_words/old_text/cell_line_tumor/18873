In tumor cells, alterations in cellular glycosylation may play a key role in their metastatic behavior. Using small interfering RNA against GnT-V, we found that the expression of GnT-V and beta1,6GlcNAc branching were significantly reduced which was particularly accompanied by the arrest in both cell migration and invasion as compared to the negative control. Moreover, the suppressed GnT-V expression by siRNA technique inactivated the signaling molecules including Rac1, cofilin, Erk and Akt, and activated RhoA levels in cells lacking GnT-V, but revealed no impact on Cdc42 activity. All these notions disclose for the first time that GnT-V and beta1, 6GlcNAc branching mediate the cell migration and invasion in Rac1-positive and RhoA-negative regulatory manners.
