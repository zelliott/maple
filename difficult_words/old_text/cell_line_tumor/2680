Inhibition of the protein chaperone Hsp90 is a promising new approach to cancer therapy. We describe the preparation of potent non-benzoquinone ansamycins. One of these analogues, generated by feeding 3-amino-5-chlorobenzoic acid to a genetically engineered strain of Streptomyces hygroscopicus, shows high accumulation and long residence time in tumor tissue, is well-tolerated upon intravenous dosing, and is highly efficacious in the COLO205 mouse tumor xenograft model.
