To investigate the expression of antigen processing-1 (Tap-1) and Tapasin in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and observe the immune response against OSCC by use of IFN-γ-antigen induced dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro and in vivo.

Expression of Tap-1 and Tapasin in different cell lines was analysed. CAL27 cells were treated with IFN-γ. Antigen from the treated cells was presented by DCs. Pulsed DC was then co-cultivated with CD8+ T lymphocyte to induce antigen specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs). The immune response elicited by CTLs against OSCC was observed.

A significant lower expression of Tap-1 and Tapasin was observed in OSCC cell lines. IFN-γ exerted time-dependent effect for increasing the expression of these genes. Antigen from the treated CAL27 cells was presented by DCs. CTLs were induced and generated a strong immune response in vitro and in vivo.

Tap-1 and Tapasin were downregulated in OSCC. IFN-γ increased the expression of these genes. Use of IFN-γ-antigen induced DCs could induce stronger immune response in vitro and in vivo.
