Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are emerging as an exciting new class of potential anti-cancer agents for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. However, the best characterized HDAC function concerns the control of gene expression via the regulation of transcription activation or repression. To understand the genome-wide effects of HDAC inhibition on gene regulation, we performed serial gene expression analyses from 0 to 48 h after treating MDA-MB-435, a melanoma-derived highly metastatic tumor cell line, with Apicidin, a HDAC inhibitor. Combined-transcriptomic analysis of large-scale molecular changes induced by Apicidin resulted in the identification of 631 outlier genes that were continuously up- or down-regulated during the 48 h study period. When the 631 outlier genes were mapped to known biological processes, cell-cycle suppression emerged as the function most elicited by Apicidin. In addition comprehensive negative cell-cycle regulation by Apicidin was dissected using gene expression data and validated by Western blot analysis. We suggest the 631 outlier genes as a characteristic molecular signature for Apicidin, and propose concurrent transcriptional suppression of major components of cell-cycle regulatory circuit as potent anti-tumor mechanism of Apicidin. Genetic elements identified during this study also provide the possibility of novel therapeutic interventions in tumor metastasis.
