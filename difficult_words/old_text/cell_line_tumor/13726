The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of propofol, a intravenous             sedative-hypnotic agent used widely in inducing and maintaining anesthesia, on             µ-opioid receptor (MOR) expression in a human neuronal cell line. SH-SY5Y human             neuroblastoma cells were treated with various concentrations of propofol (1, 5,             10 or 20 µM) for different lengths of time (6, 12 or 24 h). Real-time quantitative             RT-PCR showed that at a concentration range of 1-10 µM, propofol increased MOR             mRNA levels in a statistically significant dose- and time-dependent manner within             12 h of treatment. Western blot analyses demonstrated that propofol treatment             for 12 h dose-dependently increased the MOR protein levels. In the 12-h SH-SY5Y-treated             cells, propofol dose-dependently increased MOR density (Bmax) in the cell membranes.             In addition, in the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (1 mg/ml),             propofol (10 µM) had no significant effect on the MOR mRNA levels over time. The             results suggested that propofol dose- and time-dependently enhances MOR expression             in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells at the transcriptional level, leading to             an increased density of ligand-binding MORs in the cell membranes. This study             demonstrated for the first time a link between propofol and the opioid system,             thereby providing new insights into propofol mechanism of action and potential             for abuse.
