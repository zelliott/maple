The proteasome plays a pivotal role in controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation in a variety of tumor cells. Bortezomib is a boronic acid dipeptide derivative, which is a selective and potent inhibitor of the proteasome and has prominent effects in vitro and in vivo against several solid tumors. We examined the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of bortezomib in three gastric cancer cell lines (SNU638, MUGC-3 and MKN-28), along with its antitumor combination effects with other chemotherapeutic agents. Tumor cell growth inhibition and apoptosis was measured by MTT assay and FACS analysis, respectively. Apoptosis- and cell cycle-associated protein expression levels were measured by Western blot assay. Bortezomib induced the suppression of tumor cell growth and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner with an inhibitory dose (ID)50 of approximately 0.5 microg/ml in all gastric cancer cell lines tested. Further combination treatment with cisplatin and docetaxel, in particular with docetaxel displayed dramatically increased tumor cell growth suppression in all three gastric cancer cell lines, as compared to single drug treatment alone. This was concomitant with the induction patterns of apoptotic cells. Bortezomib treatment increased the Bax protein expression. Moreover, combination treatment of bortezomib plus docetaxel resulted in a dramatic increase in the Bax expression. In contrast, Bcl-2 expression was decreased by combination treatment with bortezomib plus docetaxel in SNU638 cells. Finally, bortezomib, docetaxel and to a greater degree bortezomib plus docetaxel increased the expression levels of p27 proteins even without influencing p53 expression levels. Bortezomib has profound effects on tumor cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells, suggesting that bortezomib may be an effective therapeutic drug for patients with gastric cancer. Further combination studies with other chemotherapeutic drugs, in particular docetaxel showing more tumor cell growth inhibition and apoptosis suggest that combining bortezomib with docetaxel might be more effective for displaying tumor cell growth inhibitory effects in gastric cancer cells through regulation of Bcl-2, Bax and p27 proteins in vitro.
