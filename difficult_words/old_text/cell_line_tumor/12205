Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been reported in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a highly angiogenic carcinoma. However, little or no information is available on the expression of Ets-1, which is one of the target molecules of VEGF. In the present study, we examined the expression of Ets-1 and VEGF in RCC by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and correlations between expression and the microvessel density (MVD) were evaluated. Ets-1 was immunolocalized to carcinoma cells and endothelial cells of the microvessels in clear cell RCC, but not in papillary RCC. Immunohistochemical Ets-1 expression and MVD were significantly higher in clear cell RCC than in papillary RCC. Predominant mRNA expression of Ets-1 in clear cell RCC was confirmed by RT-PCR. The expression of Ets-1 correlated directly with MVD in clear cell RCC. Hypoxic treatment upregulated the mRNA expression of Ets-1 and VEGF in cell lines derived from clear cell RCC, suggesting that hypoxia is a key regulator for these molecules. These results demonstrate the expression of Ets-1 in human clear cell RCC and suggest the possibility that Ets-1 is involved in angiogenesis in clear cell RCC.
