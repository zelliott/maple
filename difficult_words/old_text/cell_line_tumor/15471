To investigate the inhibitory effect of geraniol alone, or in combination with gemcitabine, on the proliferation of BXPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells.

BXPC-3 cells were treated under different conditions: with geraniol at 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 µmol/l each for 24 h, 48 h or 72 h; with 20 µmol/l geraniol for 24 h or 0 h before 20 µmol/l gemcitabine for 24 h; with 20 µmol/l geraniol for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h following 20 µmol/l gemcitabine for 24 h; or with 20 µmol/l gemcitabine alone as a control. Cell proliferation was assessed and changes in cell morphology were assessed by light and fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry.

Geraniol inhibited BXPC-3 cell proliferation in a time- and dosa-dependent manner. Geraniol alone or combined with gemcitabine induced BXPC-3 cell apoptosis. BXPC-3 inhibition rates with combined treatment were 55.24%, 50.69%, 49.83%, 41.85% and 45.27% following treatment with 20 µmol/l geraniol for 24 h or 0 h before 20 µmol/l gemcitabine for 24 h, or 20 µmol/l geraniol for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, following 20 µmol/l gemcitabine for 24 h, respectively.

Geraniol inhibited the proliferation of BXPC-3 cells. Geraniol significantly increased the antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects of gemcitabine on BXPC-3 cells. Maximum inhibition of BXPC-3 cells was achieved with geraniol treatment for 24 h before gemcitabine treatment.
