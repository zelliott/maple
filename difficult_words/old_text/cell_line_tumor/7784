A new series of diorganotin(IV) complexes of the type R(2)SnL(2) (R=Me, Et, Bu, Ph, Bz and L=2-[(9H-Purin-6-ylimino)]-phenol) have been synthesized, characterized by elemental analyses and their solid state configuration has been determined by various spectroscopic (IR, (1)H, (13)C, (119)Sn NMR, (119m)Sn MÃ¶ssbauer) techniques. The results obtained on the basis of these techniques are in full concurrence with the proposed 2:1 stoichiometry. The title complexes have been screened against various microorganisms, fungi and human cell line KB, the results obtained showed that the bis(2-[(9H-Purin-6-ylimino)]-phenolate) diphenyltin(IV) complex exhibited excellent activity against all types of bacteria and fungi used, while bis(2-[(9H-Purin-6-ylimino)]-phenolate) diethyltin(IV) complex was found to have promising antitumor activity.
