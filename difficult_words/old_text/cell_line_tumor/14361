SEL1L gene product plays a role in cell transformation and tumor progression in human breast, pancreas, esophageal, and prostate cancer. SEL1L expression was evaluated in a series of 76 surgically resected non-small cell lung carcinomas to investigate its clinical significance. SEL1L is scarcely detectable in normal lung, whereas in the initial stages of cell transformation, it becomes consistently expressed with evident staining in bronchial squamous metaplasia and in associated dysplastic changes. SEL1L immunoreactivity can be detected both in the cytoplasm and less commonly in the nuclei; the subcellular location correlates with tumor histotype, with cytoplasmic immunoreactivity being most prevalent in squamous cell carcinomas (P = .0005) and nuclear immunoreactivity being associated with adenocarcinomas (P = .02). Nuclear import and export signals are present in the SEL1L coding sequence, justifying the different subcellular location of the protein. SEL1L immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with tumor grade (P = .05); when considering only the adenocarcinomas, a stronger association was found (P = .006). SEL1L messenger RNA and protein evaluation in lung cancer cell lines confirmed the expression of the gene and the dual subcellular location of the protein in lung tumors. The data here reported suggest that, in non-small cell lung carcinoma, SEL1L may be an indicator of cell transformation, thus having important biologic and clinical implications.
