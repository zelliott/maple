Previous research has shown that the Dwarf lilyturf tuber has antitumor             effects. The antitumor ability of DT-13, a saponin monomer isolated from the roots             of the Dwarf lilyturf tuber, is discussed in this study. The results showed that             DT-13 inhibited the proliferation, adhesion and invasion of MDA-MB-435 cells.             DT-13 decreased the excretion and expression of MMP-2/9. Furthermore, DT-13 inhibited             the phosphorylation of p38 in MDA-MB-435 cells. In conclusion, the results suggest             that DT-13 possesses anticancer and antimetastatic properties by inhibiting the             invasion of cancer cells.
