In this paper is reported a new approach for the treatment of sarcoma--electroporation therapy. Electroporation can accelerate pharmacal molecules into cytoplasm by transient electromagnetic pulses. We have utilized the phenomenon of electroporation treating the S-180 sarcomas in the hind legs of the Kunming mice by intratumoral injection of anti-tumor agent at low dose. From the experiment, we learned that this approach can bring about remarkable effect. The technical procedure is easy to do and easy to control. Especially, it is useful in curing the flat tumor and has little untoward side effect. It deserves to be recommended as a new approach to treating the tumor in clinics.
