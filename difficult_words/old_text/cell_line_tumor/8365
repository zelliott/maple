Polycomb gene products play a crucial role in the development of highly malignant phenotypes and aggressive cancer progression in a variety of cancers; however, their role in hepatocellular carcinoma remains unclear. First, we analyzed the impact of EZH2 and BMI1 modulation on cell growth of HepG2 cells. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assays revealed marked growth inhibition after EZH2 or BMI1 knockdown. In addition, simultaneous knockdown of these 2 genes further augmented cell growth inhibitory effects. Next, we conducted immunohistochemical assessment of 86 hepatocellular carcinoma surgical specimens, evaluating the correlation between EZH2 and BMI1 protein expression and clinicopathologic features. High-level EZH2 and BMI1 expression was detected in 57 (66.3%) and 52 tumor tissues (60.5%), respectively. Among these, 48 tumor tissues (55.8%) showed colocalization of EZH2 and BMI1 in almost all tumor cells. The cumulative recurrence rate, but not survival rate, was significantly higher in patients positive for EZH2 (P = .029) and BMI1 (P = .039) than in their negative counterparts, as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. These data indicate that EZH2 and BMI1 may cooperate in initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.
