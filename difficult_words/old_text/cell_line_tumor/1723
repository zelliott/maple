A series of dihydropyrimidine derivatives were synthesized by utilizing Biginelli reaction and evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity against MCF-7 human breast cancer (HBC) cell line using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay and antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) H(37)Rv using Microplate Alamar Blue Assay (MABA). Compounds 13p, 13t were exhibited 70.6% and 63.7% of HBC cell growth inhibition at 10 μM concentration. Interestingly compound 13p was also found to be the most potent in the series against MTB H(37)Rv with MIC value of 0.125 μg/mL.
