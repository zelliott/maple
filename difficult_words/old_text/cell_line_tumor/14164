Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common tumor arising in the central nervous system. Patients with these tumors have limited treatment options and their disease is invariably fatal. Molecularly targeted agents offer the potential to improve patient treatment, however the use of these will require a fuller understanding of the genetic changes in these complex tumors. In this study, we identify copy number changes in a series of glioblastoma multiforme tumors and cell lines by applying high-resolution microarray comparative genomic hybridization. Molecular cytogenetic characterization of the cell lines revealed that copy number changes define translocation breakpoints. We focused on chromosome 6 and further characterized three regions of copy number change associated with translocations including a discrete deletion involving IGF2R, PARK2, PACRG and QKI and an unbalanced translocation involving POLH, GTPBP2 and PTPRZ1.
