We examined the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in crystalline silica-induced expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, an important mediator of airway inflammation, in A549 human lung epithelial cells. The levels of COX-2 mRNA increased after a 30-min exposure, and COX-2 protein increased after a 2-h exposure to crystalline silica. Both remained elevated at 8 h; however, no change was observed in the expression of the constitutive COX-1 isoform. The level of prostaglandin E(2), a major product of COX enzymes, increased in response to crystalline silica exposure. Phosphorylated forms of MAPKs including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, and p38 were also increased after crystalline silica exposure. COX-2 expression was markedly suppressed by treatment with the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, and mildly suppressed by the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, U0126. Treatment with the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor, BAY11-7082, markedly suppressed silica-induced COX-2 expression. These results show that crystalline silica exposure induces COX-2 expression in A549 cells in a manner that is dependent on the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. Although a marked induction of MAPK phosphatase (MKP)-1 expression was observed in A549 cells exposed to crystalline silica, the silencing of MKP-1 expression using short interference RNA did not affect silica-induced COX-2 expression, suggesting that the down-regulation of COX-2 expression by MKP-1 is unlikely.
