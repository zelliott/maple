Hepatic hollow fiber bioreactors are a promising class of bioartificial liver assist device (BLAD). The development of this type of device is currently hindered by limited oxygen transport to cultured hepatocytes, due to low solubility of oxygen in aqueous media. In order to increase the oxygen spectrum to cultured hepatocytes housed within a hollow fiber bioreactor, several different engineering strategies were explored in this study. These included: supplementing the circulating media stream of the hollow fiber bioreactor with a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (bovine red blood cells) with defined oxygen binding and release kinetics and operating the bioreactor with media flow through the hollow fiber membrane into the extracapillary space (ECS). We hypothesize that these two strategies can be used to improve hepatocyte oxygenation and possibly attain an in vivo-like pO(2) spectrum, similar to that observed in vivo in the liver sinusoid. This work is significant, since provision of an in vivo-like pO(2) spectrum should create a fully functional BLAD that could potentially bridge thousands of liver failure patients towards native liver regeneration of damaged tissue or, if necessary, orthotopic liver transplantation.
