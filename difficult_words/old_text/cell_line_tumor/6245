Dependence on Bcl-2 proteins is a common feature of cancer cells and provides a therapeutic opportunity. ABT-737 is an antagonist of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and therefore is a good predictor of Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-2 dependence. Surprisingly, analysis of Mcl-1-dependent multiple myeloma cell lines revealed codependence on Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L) in half the cells tested. Codependence is not predicted by the expression level of antiapoptotic proteins, rather through interactions with Bim. Consistent with these findings, acquired resistance to ABT-737 results in loss of codependence through redistribution of Bim to Mcl-1. Overall, these results suggest that complex interactions, and not simply expression patterns of Bcl-2 proteins, need to be investigated to understand Bcl-2 dependence and how to better use agents, such as ABT-737.
