The lymphocytic CD81 molecule, capable of modulating type-1/-2 T-helper responses and serving as a putative receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV), might influence the outcome of anti-HCV treatment. This study characterized the interferon-alpha-induced alteration of lymphocytic CD81. The CD81 levels in healthy subjects and na√Øve chronic HCV patients were compared, with the results showing that the two groups had comparable surface CD81 levels for total peripheral blood lymphocytes, subpopulation-B, -T, and -NK cells. In vitro interferon-alpha treatment could suppress the CD81 expression from both groups. Subsequently, we compared the in vitro interferon-alpha modulatory effects on lymphocytic CD81 from patients having received anti-HCV therapy with either sustained virological response (SVR) or without SVR. There was a significant down-regulation of the B-cell's CD81 only in the SVR group. The CD81 modulation was further investigated using Daudi lymphoid cell line, showing declined surface CD81 levels following treatment with interferon-alpha, interferon-beta or polyI:C. Thus, interferons could directly decrease CD81 expression. The interferon-alpha effect could be restored by 2-aminopurine, suggesting that double-stranded RNA activated kinase might be involved in the suppression of CD81. In conclusion, CD81 down-regulation is a primary host response to interferon-alpha-based therapy and an immunophenotype associated with anti-HCV SVR.
