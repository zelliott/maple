Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7 (IGFBP7) is a gene identified as being low expressed in colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) cell lines. In the current study, we investigated the function of IGFBP7 in CRC by transfection studies. We found that IGFBP7 could inhibit cell growth, decrease soft agar colony formation activity and induce apoptosis in RKO and SW620 cells. Correlation analysis between the expression of IGFBP7 in CRC tissue and the prognosis in 218 patients showed that high expression of IGFBP7 was associated with favorable prognosis. Based on above results, we conclude that IGFBP7 plays a potential tumor suppressor role in colorectal carcinogenesis.
