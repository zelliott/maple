A new phenanthrenequinone, 5-hydroxy-2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-phenanthrenequinone (1), was isolated along with a known 9,10-dihydrophenanthrenequinone, ephemeranthoquinone B (2) from an MeOH extract of Odontioda Marie Noel 'Velano' through bioassay-guided fractionation. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, and the compounds were tested for in vitro cytotoxic activity. The compounds showed slightly higher cytotoxicity in human oral squamous cell carcinoma and leukemic cell lines as compared with human oral normal cells. The results suggest that apoptosis may not be involved in the cytotoxicity induction.
