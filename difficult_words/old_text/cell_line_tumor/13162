Revised version: the first total synthesis of indoxamycin B leads to a stereochemical reassignment of the natural product. The synthetic route features an efficient carboannulation sequence to rapidly access the dihydroindenone system. Moreover, a series of Au(I)-catalyzed transformations served in the construction of the sterically congested core framework.
