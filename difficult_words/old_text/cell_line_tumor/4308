Locoregional death of cancer cells (in vitro) is induced by ablation of plasmonic nanorattles combined with triggered release of a chemotherapeutic drug from the nanorattles. Completion of the therapy process is indicated by a "Raman signal flip" between the two reporters of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probe. The nanorattles enable targeted delivery of payload and simultaneous monitoring of the payload release and the therapy process.
