This study was carried out to investigate the apoptotic effects of glycine- and proline-rich glycoprotein [Solanum nigrum Linne (SNL) glycoprotein, 150-kDa] isolated from SNL, which has been used as an antipyretic and anticancer agent in Korean herbal medicine. We found that SNL glycoprotein has obviously cytotoxic and apoptotic effects at 80 microg/ml of SNL glycoprotein for 4 h in Hep3B cells (hepatocellular carcinoma cells). In mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway, SNL glycoprotein has abilities to stimulate release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, activations of caspase-9 and caspase-3, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase and production of intracellular reactive oxygen species in Hep3B cells. In nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB)-mediated apoptosis pathway, the results showed that SNL glycoprotein dose-dependently blocked DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB, activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and production of inducible nitric oxide (NO). Interestingly, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (for NF-kappaB inhibitor) and Nomega-nitro-l-arginine methylester hydrochloride (for NO inhibitor) effectively stimulated the caspase-3 activation and induced apoptosis in Hep3B cells. These results indicate that SNL glycoprotein transfers its cell death signal from cytochrome c to caspase 3 by inhibiting NF-kappaB and iNOS activation in Hep3B cells. Here, we speculate that SNL glycoprotein is one of the chemotherapeutic agents to modulate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis signals in Hep3B cells.
