Magnesium alloys represent a valuable option for the production of bioresorbable implantable medical devices aimed to improve the therapeutic approach and minimize the potential risks related to biostable materials. In this regard, the degradation process needs to be carefully evaluated in order to assess the effectiveness of the regenerative support and the eventual toxic effects induced by the released corrosion products. Aluminium is one of the most common alloying element that raised several safety concerns, contributing to shift the investigation toward Al-free alloys. To delve into this issue, a long-term investigation (up to 28 days) was performed using AZ91D alloy, due to its relevant Al content. Immersion tests in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution was performed following the ASTM standards and the corrosion behaviour was evaluated at fixed time points by means of electrochemical techniques. Cytotoxic effects were assessed by culturing human neuroblastoma cells with conditioned medium derived from immersion tests at different dilution degree. An increase in the resistance corrosion with the time was observed. In all the investigated cases the presence of Al in the conditioned media did not induce significant toxic effects directly correlated to its content. A decrease of cell viability was only observed in the case of 50 % dilution of PBS conditioned for the longest immersion period (i.e., 28 days).
