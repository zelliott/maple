Chondrosarcoma is a type of highly malignant tumor with a potent capacity to invade locally and cause distant metastasis. Chondrosarcoma shows a predilection for metastasis to the lungs. Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a chemokine with a defining CXC amino acid motif, is known to possess tumorigenic and proangiogenic properties. Over-expression of IL-8 has been detected in many human tumors. However, the effects of IL-8 in migration and integrin expression in chondrosarcoma cells are largely unknown. In this study, we found that IL-8 increased the migration and the expression of αvβ3 integrin in human chondrosarcoma cells. Activations of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and AP-1 pathways after IL-8 treatment were demonstrated, and IL-8-induced expression of integrin and migration activity was inhibited by the specific inhibitor and mutant of PI3K, Akt, and AP-1 cascades. Taken together, our results indicated that IL-8 enhances the migration of chondrosarcoma cells by increasing αvβ3 integrin expression through the PI3K/Akt/AP-1 signal transduction pathway.
