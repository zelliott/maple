Information on gene alterations associated to poorly differentiated (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC) is scarce. Using human cancer cell lines as a tool for gene discovery, we performed a cytogenetic and oligo-array analysis in five new cell lines derived from two PDTC and three ATC. In PDTC we evidenced, as important, the involvement of the MAPK/ERK kinase pathway, and downregulation of a group of suppressor genes that include E-cadherin. In ATC, downregulation of a specific group of oncosuppressor genes was also observed. Our ATC cell lines presented chromosomal markers of gene amplification, and we were able to identify for the first time the nature of the involved amplicon target genes. We found that the main molecular differences between the two cell line types were related to signal transduction pathways, cell adhesion and motility process. TaqMan experiments performed for five amplicon target genes and for two genes, which allowed a clear distinction between ATC and PDTC: CDH13 and PLAU corroborated array results, not only in the cell lines, but also in an additional set of primary 14 PDTC and three ATC. We suggest that our findings may represent new tools for the development of more effective therapies to the hitherto untreatable ATC.
