To determine the effect of pulsed ultrasound (US) on radiation-induced cell killing, U937 and Molt-4 cell lines were exposed to 1.0 MHz US with 50% of duty factor at 0.3 W/cm(2) and pulsed at 1 Hz immediately after exposure to X-rays at 0, 0.5, 2.5 and 5 Gy. The cells were assayed 24 h after the treatments. The result showed significant enhancement of cell killing in the combined treatments. However, the ratio of apoptotic cells induced either by X-rays or US alone did not significantly change. These findings suggest that pulsed US can enhance the anticancer effect of X-irradiation due to US streaming under non-inertial cavitational condition. This combined treatment can potentially enhance the therapeutic effect of radiation therapy.
