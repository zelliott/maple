Local radiation of tumor masses is an established modality for the therapy of a range of human tumors. It has recently been recognized that doses of radiation, lower than or equal to those that cause direct cytolysis, may alter the phenotype of target tissue by up-regulating gene products that may make tumor cells more susceptible to T-cell-mediated immune attack. Previously, we demonstrated that radiation increased Fas (CD95) gene expression in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing murine tumor cells, which consequently enhanced their susceptibility to CEA-specific CTL-mediated killing. The present study was designed to determine whether these phenomena also occur with human tumor cells. Here, 23 human carcinoma cell lines (12 colon, 7 lung, and 4 prostate) were examined for their response to nonlytic doses of radiation (10 or 20 Gy). Seventy-two hours postirradiation, changes in surface expression of Fas (CD95), as well as expression of other surface molecules involved in T-cell-mediated immune attack such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1, mucin-1, CEA, and MHC class I, were examined. Twenty-one of the 23 (91%) cell lines up-regulated one or more of these surface molecules postirradiation. Furthermore, five of five irradiated CEA(+)/A2(+) colon tumor cells lines demonstrated significantly enhanced killing by CEA-specific HLA-A2-restricted CD8(+) CTLs compared with nonirradiated counterparts. We then used microarray analysis to broaden the scope of observed changes in gene expression after radiation and found that many additional genes had been modulated. These up-regulated gene products may additionally enhance the tumor cells' susceptibility to T-cell-mediated immune attack or serve as additional targets for immunotherapy. Overall, the results of this study suggest that nonlethal doses of radiation can be used to make human tumors more amenable to immune system recognition and attack and form the rational basis for the combinatorial use of cancer vaccines and local tumor irradiation.
