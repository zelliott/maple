Targeted radionuclide therapy has shown impressive results for the palliative treatment of several types of cancer diseases. The folate receptor has been identified as specifically associated with a variety of frequent tumor types. Therefore, it is an attractive target for the development of new radionuclide therapies using folate-based radioconjugates. Previously, we found that pemetrexed (PMX) has a favorable effect in reducing undesired renal uptake of radiofolates. Moreover, PMX also acts as a chemotherapeutic and radiosensitizing agent on tumors. Thus, the aim of our study was to investigate the combined application of PMX and the therapeutic radiofolate (177)Lu-EC0800. Determination of the combination index (CI) revealed a synergistic inhibitory effect of (177)Lu-EC0800 and PMX on the viability of folate receptor-positive cervical (KB) and ovarian (IGROV-1) cancer cells in vitro (CI < 0.8). In an in vivo study, tumor-bearing mice were treated with (177)Lu-EC0800 (20 MBq) and a subtherapeutic (0.4 mg) or therapeutic amount (1.6 mg) of PMX. Application of (177)Lu-EC0800 with PMXther resulted in a two- to four-fold enhanced tumor growth delay and a prolonged survival of KB and IGROV-1 tumor-bearing mice, as compared to the combination with PMXsubther or untreated control mice. PMXsubther protected the kidneys from undesired side effects of (177)Lu-EC0800 (20 MBq) by reducing the absorbed radiation dose. Intact kidney function was shown by determination of plasma parameters and quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography using (99m)Tc-DMSA. Our results confirmed the anticipated dual role of PMX. Its unique features resulted in an improved antitumor effect of folate-based radionuclide therapy and prevented undesired radio-nephrotoxicity.
