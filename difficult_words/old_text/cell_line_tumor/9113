A novel method for fabricating recyclable hydrophilic-hydrophobic micropatterns on glass chips is presented. TiOx patterns (100-2000 microm) were sputtered on glass chips via a through-hole mask. The patterned chips were then vapor-coated with fluoroalkylsilane, for example, (heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl)triethoxysilane (FTES) to form a hydrophobic coating layer. The fluoroalkyl chain of FTES film on TiOx patterns was photocleaved under UV irradiation, exposing the fresh hydrophilic TiOx patterns. The resulting chip could be used multiple times by repeating the coating and photocleaving processes with negligible deterioration of the hydrophobic FTES film coated on glass. If desired, bare glass patterns could also be generated by removing the TiOx patterns with KOH. The patterned glass chips have been successfully used for microarray fabrication.
