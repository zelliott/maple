In this study, 4,7-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,3-benzodioxole (SY-1) was isolated from three different sources of dried Antrodia camphorata (AC) fruiting bodies. AC is a medicinal mushroom that grows on the inner heartwood wall of Cinnamomum kanehirai Hay (Lauraceae), which is an endemic species that is used in Chinese medicine for its antitumor properties. We demonstrated that SY-1 [given as a 1-30 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneal (ip) injection three times per week] profoundly decreased the growth of COLO-205 human colon cancer cell tumor xenografts in an athymic nude mouse model. We further demonstrated that significant AC extract-mediated antitumor effects were observed at the highest concentration (5 g/kg body weight/day). No gross toxicity signs were observed (i.e., body weight changes, general appearance, or individual organ effects). Frozen COLO-205 xenograft tumors were pulverized in liquid N(2), and the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins was detected by immunoblotting. We found that the p53-mediated p27/Kip1 protein was significantly induced in the low-dose (1 mg/kg body weight) SY-1-treated tumors, whereas the p21/Cip1 protein levels did not change. The G0/G1 phase cell cycle regulators induced by SY-1 were also associated with a significant decrease in cyclins D1, D3, and A. These results provide further evidence that SY-1 may have significance for cancer chemotherapy.
