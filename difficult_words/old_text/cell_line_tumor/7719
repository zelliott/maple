The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is related to the various signal routes that are activated in unfolded protein response (UPR). The Grp78, Grp94, CHOP, MTJ1 and HMOX1 genes expressions demonstrate UPR activity. In this study, we investigated the UPR gene expressions in larynx epidermoid carcinoma (HEp2) to which dexamethasone (dex) was applied. HEp2 cells were administered for 48 h with different combinations using 0.1 microM and 1 microM dex, 1 mM phenyl butyric acid (PBA) and 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The Grp78, Grp94, CHOP, MTJ1 and HMOX1 genes expression was determined using quantitative RT-PCR. The Grp78, MTJ1 and HMOX1 gene expression increased with the administration of 1 microM dex. CHOP expression, on the other hand, decreased with 0.1 microM dex. When dex was combined with LPS, nearly all gene expressions decreased. The increase in Grp78, Grp94, HMOX1 and MTJ1 gene expression was greater in groups in which dex was administered in combination with PBA than in groups in which dex was administered alone. Dex in low dose (0.1 microM) caused a decrease in CHOP expression in HEp2 cells and an increase in Grp78 expression, in particular. The changes in UPR genes expressions may lead to the extended survival of the cells.
