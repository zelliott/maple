Novel curcumin analogs were synthesized using Knoevenagel condensation to convert enolic diketones of curcumin into non-enolizable ones and Schiff bases were prepared using a bioactive thiosemicarbazide pharmacophore. Copper(II) conjugates of all synthesized ligands were prepared and structurally characterized as well as evaluated for their potential of inhibiting TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation and proliferation in human leukemic KBM-5 cells wherein compound 13 was found to be more potent than curcumin. Compounds were further examined on other tumor cell lines such as Jurkat, H1299, and MM1, respectively.
