During endochondral ossification, the production of hyaluronan (HA) is strictly and selectively regulated by chondrocytes, with a temporal peak at the hypertrophic stage. This study was conducted to clarify the effects of HA on expression and activity of runt-related gene 2 (Runx2), a potent transcription factor for chondrocyte differentiation in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Immature chondrocytes from an ATDC5 cell line were cultured and differentiated in DMEM/Ham's F12 with pre-defined supplements. Using real-time PCR, the gene expressions of type II collagen, MMP-13, HAS2, and Runx2 in cultured chondrocytes were analysed from days 0 to 18 of cell differentiation. The activity and expression of Runx2 in hypertrophic chondrocytes were analysed after the treatment with HA oligosaccharide (HAoligo) using AML-3/Runx2 binding, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. The effects of pre-incubation of anti-CD44 antibody on Runx2 expression were also examined. Expression of type X collagen and Runx2 mRNAs reached a maximum at the terminal differentiation of chondrocytes. The activity and expression of Runx2 was significantly inhibited in hypertrophic chondrocytes treated with HAoligo compared to the untreated controls. High molecular weight-HA did not affect the expression or activity of Runx2. The expression of Runx2 mRNA was significantly decreased in hypertrophic chondrocytes treated with anti-CD44 antibody. These results suggest that HAoligo may affect the terminal differentiation of chondrocytes during the endochondral ossification by inhibiting the expression and activity of Runx2.
