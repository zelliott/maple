The p14(ARF) protein, the product of an alternate reading frame of the INK4A/ARF locus on human chromosome 9p21, disrupts the ability of MDM2 to target p53 for proteosomal degradation and causes an increase in steady-state p53 levels, leading to a G(1) and G(2) arrest of cells in the cell cycle. Although much is known about the function of p14(ARF) in the p53 pathway, not as much is known about its function in human tumor growth and chemosensitivity independently of up-regulation of p53 protein levels. To learn more about its effect on cellular proliferation and chemoresistance independent of p53 up-regulation, human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells null for p14(ARF) and harboring a defective p53 pathway were stably transfected with p14(ARF) cDNA under the tight control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Induction of p14(ARF) caused a decrease in cell proliferation rate and colony formation and a marked decrease in the level of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein. The effect of p14(ARF) on DHFR protein levels was specific, because thymidylate kinase and thymidylate synthase protein levels were not decreased nor were p53 or p21WAF1 protein levels increased. The decrease in DHFR protein was abolished when the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, demonstrating that p14(ARF) augments proteasomal degradation of the protein. Surprisingly, induction of p14(ARF) increased resistance to the folate antagonists methotrexate, trimetrexate, and raltitrexed. Depletion of thymidine in the medium reversed this resistance, indicating that p14(ARF) induction increases the reliance of these cells on thymidine salvage.
