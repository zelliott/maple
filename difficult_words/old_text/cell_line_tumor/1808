Components of the TNFR1 complex are subject to dynamic ubiquitination that impacts on their effects as signalling factors. We have found that the ubiquitin-specific protease USP2a has a pivotal role in the decision for cell death or survival by the TNFR1 complex. This enzyme is a novel component of the TNFR1 complex that is recruited upon ligand binding and controls the signalling activity of the TNFR1-interacting protein RIP1 by removing its K63-linked ubiquitin chains. USP2a similarly de-ubiquitinates TRAF2, a ubiquitin-ligase recruited to the TNFR1 complex. During the TNF response the activity of USP2a on RIP1 and TRAF2 is required for the efficient reappearance of IκBα, which is essential to inactivate the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-κB. The effects of USP2a culminate in the conversion of the anti-apoptotic TNFR1 complex I into the pro-apoptotic TNFR1 complex II. Consequently, downregulation of USP2a promotes NF-κB activation and protects cells against TNF-induced cell death.
