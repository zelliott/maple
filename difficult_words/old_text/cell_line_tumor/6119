The expression of high mobility group protein A1 (HMGA1) protein has been closely related to various malignant and prognostic degrees of tumor. To investigate the influence of down-regulating HMGA1 on the tumor and the mechanism underlying antitumor of HMGA1, we transfected the HMGA1 shRNA vector into the osteogenic sarcoma MG-63 cell and observed the changes of cell proliferation, invasion abilities, and the tumor growth. HMGA1 gene expression could be efficiently inhibited, and cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and matrix metalloprotease level were also decreased. BALB/C nude mice injected with the MG-63 cells transfected HMGA1 shRNA showed the significant lower tumor weight, tumor volume, and longer tumor-forming time compared with the control group. Our results suggest that knockdown of HMGA1 could inhibit growth and metastasis potentials of MG-63 cells, which may be a therapeutic target protein for osteogenic sarcoma and may be of biological importance.
