Radiolabeled hybrid ligands with defined distances between an agonist and an antagonist for the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor were found to have excellent tumor-targeting properties. Oligoprolines served as rigid scaffolds that allowed for tailoring distances of 10, 20, and 30 Å between the recognition elements. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that the hybrid ligand with a distance of 20 Å between the recognition elements exhibits the highest yet observed tumor cell uptake and retention time in prostate cancer cells.
