It is well established that efficient removal of highly-promutagenic UV-induced dipyrimidine photoproducts via nucleotide excision repair (NER) is required for protection against sunlight-associated malignant melanoma. Nonetheless, the extent to which reduced NER capacity might contribute to individual melanoma susceptibility in the general population remains unclear. Here we show that among a panel of 14 human melanoma strains, 11 exhibit significant inhibition of DNA photoproduct removal during S phase relative to G0/G1 or G2/M. Evidence is presented that this cell cycle-specific NER defect correlates with enhanced apoptosis and reduced clonogenic survival following UV irradiation. In addition, melanoma strains deficient in S phase-specific DNA photoproduct removal manifest significantly lower levels of phosphorylated histone H2AX at 1 h post-UV, suggesting diminished activation of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad 3-related (ATR) kinase, i.e., a primary orchestrator of the cellular response to UV-induced DNA replication stress. Consistently, in the case of DNA photoproduct excision-proficient melanoma cells, siRNA-mediated depletion of ATR (but not of its immediate downstream effector kinase Chk1) engenders deficient NER specifically during S. On the other hand simultaneous siRNA-mediated depletion of ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) exerts no significant effect on either phosphorylation of H2AX at 1 h post-UV or the efficiency of DNA photoproduct removal. Our data suggest that defective NER exclusively during S phase, possibly associated with decreased ATR signaling, may constitute an heretofore unrecognized determinant in melanoma pathogenesis.
