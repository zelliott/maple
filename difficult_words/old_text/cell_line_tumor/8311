A series of 4-anilino-7-pyridyl-3-quinolinecarbonitriles was prepared as Src kinase inhibitors. A systematic SAR study of substitutions on both the pyridine ring and the 3-quinolinecarbonitrile core established the requirements for optimal activity. The lead compound, 17, showed potent activity in both the Src enzyme assay and cell assays, and demonstrated in vivo anti-tumor activity in a xenograft model.
