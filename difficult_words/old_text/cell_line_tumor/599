To investigate the effect of transfection with human soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1(sFlt-1) gene on cell growth and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration of the culture supernatant in human colon cancer cell line Lovo.

The recombinant plasmid pcDNA3-sFlt-1 containing sFlt-1 gene was transfected into Lovo cells by Lipofectamine 2000, which was identified by RT-PCR and ELISA. The effect of sFlt-1 protein on cell growth and VEGF expression in Lovo cells were investigated by MTT and ELISA.

The recombinant plasmid pcDNA3-sFlt-1 was successfully transfected into Lovo cells. The sFlt-1 expression was identified by RT-PCR and ELISA, which inhibited the growth of Lovo cells and reduced the VEGF concentration in the culture supernatant compared with control. The inhibitory rates of proliferation of Lovo cells via MTT assay after 2,14,21 and 28 days were(23.92+/-9.16)%, (13.98+/-10.21)%,(22.54+/-11.92)% and (33.43+/-9.34)% respectively. Compared with the control groups, the differences were significant ( p<0.05,  p<0.01).

Transfection with sFlt-1 gene into Lovo cells results in the expression of sFlt-1 protein, which possesses high biological activity and inhibits the growth of cancer cells.
