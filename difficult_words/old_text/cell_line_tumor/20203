KIBRA (kidney- and brain-expressed protein) is a novel regulator of the Hippo pathway, which controls tissue growth and tumorigenesis by regulating both cell proliferation and apoptosis. In mammals, KIBRA is associated with memory performance. The physiological function and regulation of KIBRA in non-neuronal cells remain largely unclear. We reported recently that KIBRA is phosphorylated by the mitotic kinases Aurora-A and -B. In the present study, we have expanded our analysis of KIBRA's role in cell-cycle progression. We show that KIBRA is also phosphorylated by CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) in response to spindle damage stress. We have identified KIBRA Ser(542) and Ser(931) as main phosphorylation sites for CDK1 both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that the CDC (cell division cycle) 14A/B phosphatases associate with KIBRA, and CDK1-non-phosphorylatable KIBRA has greatly reduced interaction with CDC14B. CDC14A/B dephosphorylate CDK1-phosphorylated KIBRA in vitro and in cells. By using inducible-expression cell lines, we show further that phospho-regulation of KIBRA by CDK1 and CDC14 is involved in mitotic exit under spindle stress. Our results reveal a new mechanism through which KIBRA regulates cell-cycle progression.
