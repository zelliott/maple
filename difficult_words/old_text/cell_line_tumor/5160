Rat mesenchymal renal tumor cells (NeDe) transplanted under the kidney capsule of F344 rats resulted in metastases in the parathymic lymph nodes. Tumor cells were isolated from these tumor-bearing lymph nodes and 106 cells were implanted under the kidney capsule. Tumor growth after this implantation could be traced within six days. India ink was implanted to prove that there is a connection between the lymphatic vessels of the kidney capsule and the parathymic lymph nodes. The distribution of the radioligand 18FDG in different organs also provided evidence that the parathymic lymph nodes are the primary sites of metastatic tumor growth. Tumor growth was followed after staining sections of biopsies of normal, tumorous kidneys and parathymic lymph nodes embedded in paraffin. The progression of tumor formation was seen as a frontline between the healthy and tumor bearing tissue. This demarcation line was sharp at the beginning of the invasion and at the peripheral regions of the tumor, while the central region infiltrated into the healthy kidney tissue. The initial invasion gradually turned to an infiltration resulting in the disruption of the renal tissue, especially at the periphery. Accumulation of lipids and flow of blood to the lymphatic vessels was due to the lack of angiogenesis, leading to an increased pressure of the interstitial fluid. Interstitial damage ultimately led to the appearance of blood and the growth of tumor cells in parathymic lymph nodes. The kidney capsule-parathymic lymph node complex is proposed as a suitable metastatic model for the isolated in vivo examination of tumor development and for the analysis of secondary tumors.
