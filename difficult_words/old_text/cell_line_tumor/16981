Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors belong to G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors and mediate a variety of cellular responses through the binding of LPA. So far, six types of LPA receptors (LPA receptor-1 (LPA₁) to LPA₆) have been identified. Recently, it has been demonstrated that each LPA receptor has opposite effects on malignant property of cancer cells. In this study, to evaluate an involvement of LPA receptors on angiogenic process in mammary tumor cells, we generated Lpar1- and Lpar3-expressing (FM3A-a1 and FM3A-a3A9, respectively) cells from FM3A cells, and investigated the effects on cell proliferation and migration abilities of endothelial F-2 cells by those cells. In Vegf-A and Vegf-C genes, FM3A-a1 cells indicated high expression and FM3A-a3A9 cells showed low expression, compared with control cells. When F-2 cells were cultured with a supernatant from FM3A-a1 cells, the cell growth rate and migration ability of F-2 cells was significantly higher than control cells. By contrast, a supernatant from FM3A-a3A9 cells significantly inhibited those abilities of F-2 cells. These results suggest that LPA₁ and LPA₃ may play opposite roles on the regulation of endothelial cells in mouse mammary tumor FM3A cells.
