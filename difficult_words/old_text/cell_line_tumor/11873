Dialysis patients, often carriers of Staphylococcus aureus in their nares, are at high risk of S. aureus infections.

We examined whether RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP), which interferes with quorum sensing mechanisms, reduces adherence of S. aureus to host cells and to dialysis catheter polymers in vitro. Adherence was tested by spectroscopy using safranin staining, by confocal scanning laser microscopy and by atomic force microscopy.

RIP inhibited bacterial adherence to HaCat and HEp-2 cells and reduced adherence and biofilm formation not only on polystyrene, but also on both polyurethane- and silicone-made dialysis catheters, with a preponderant effect on silicone, to which bacteria were more adherent.

RIP opens a new perspective in anti-S. aureus prophylaxis, particularly in dialysis patients.
