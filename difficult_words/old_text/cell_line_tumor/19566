Stomach cancer is still a major cause of death in Asian people despite a complete cure after the resection of early cancers, mainly because peritoneal dissemination is difficult to treat. In the present study, we used two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) to identify specific proteins differentially expressed between a highly metastatic stomach cancer cell line MKN-45-P and its parental cell line MKN-45. We detected 27 protein spots in at least 2 of 3 experiments which showed statistically significant differences in abundance. All 27 protein spots were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and database-searching software. A proteomic analysis revealed 13 different proteins with some isoforms sharing different biochemical characteristics, and that 8 proteins were up-regulated, and 5 were down-regulated. The 13 proteins were mainly involved in protein synthesis (transfer RNA synthetase), metabolism (flavoprotein subunit, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase), receptor and signal transduction (annexins I and A2), the cytoskeleton (keratin 5, cytokeratin 8) and cell cycling (ts11). These results suggested that a proteomic approach including 2-D DIGE would be an efficient way to identify the proteins responsible for specific biological functions. Moreover, these observations might be novel findings leading to the prediction of postoperative peritoneal recurrence.
