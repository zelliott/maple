The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) belongs to the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and regulates several genes as heterodimers with other bHLH proteins. ARNT is also able to homodimerize, but no mammalian target genes for the homodimer have been shown. We identified a palindromic E-box element in the 5' regulatory region of the murine cytochrome P450 (Cyp) 2a5 gene that was found to be important for Cyp2a5 transcription in primary hepatocytes, and was found by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to interact with ARNT. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay experiments with in vitro translated ARNT showed binding without heterodimerization partner, indicating binding as a homodimer. Transfection studies in wild-type and ARNT-deficient Hepa-1 cells revealed that ARNT expression is necessary for full activity of the Cyp2a5 promoter. In the liver-specific Arnt-null mouse line, the level of hepatic CYP2A5 mRNA was decreased significantly. Co-transfection studies with an ARNT expression vector lacking the transactivation domain (TAD) demonstrated that the ARNT TAD is needed for Cyp2a5 activation, which suggests that ARNT transactivates Cyp2a5 as a homodimer. In primary hepatocytes, the mRNA levels of both CYP2A5 and ARNT splice variant 1 were increased during cultivation. Upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2a were also able to bind to the same E-box as ARNT, indicating that there may be competition for DNA binding between these factors. Indeed, the upstream stimulatory factors activated the Cyp2a5 promoter through the E-box only in the presence of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha, while ARNT transactivation was independent of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha. In conclusion, these results indicate that ARNT controls Cyp2a5 transcription and thus, for the first time, suggest active involvement of the ARNT homodimer in mammalian gene regulation.
