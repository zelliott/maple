A series of novel cinnamic acyl sulfonamide derivatives (9a-16e) have been designed and synthesized and their biological activities were also evaluated as potential tubulin polymerization inhibitors. Among all the compounds, 10c showed the most potent growth inhibitory activity against B16-F10 cancer cell line in vitro, with an IC(50) value of 0.8Î¼g/mL. Docking simulation was performed to insert compound 10c into the crystal structure of tubulin at colchicine binding site to determine the probable binding model. Based on the preliminary results, compound 10c with potent inhibitory activity in tumor growth may be a potential anticancer agent.
