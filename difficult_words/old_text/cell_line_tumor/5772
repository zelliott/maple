The antiproliferative activity of 2-(3,5-Dihydroxyphenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (DHB) is reported here. DHB inhibits the growth of human colon cancer HCT-15 with a 50% cell growth inhibition value of 23 μM and breast cancer MCF-7 with a 50% cell growth inhibition value of 41 μM in a dose/time dependent manner by using sulforhodamine B assay. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that DHB-induced growth arrest could be associated with apoptosis in both cell lines. Moreover, suppression of clonogenic activity occurs after exposure to DHB at a concentration of 25 μM for HCT-15 and of 40 μM for MCF-7.
