5-Fluorouracil (5FU) is the main drug used for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) and Thymidilate Synthase (TS) is its target enzyme. TS gene has regulatory tandemly repeated sequences in its 5' and 3'untraslated region (5'-3' UTR). CRC often shows a kind of genomic instability called Microsatellite Instability (MSI) that is associated with TS levels and survival. Our data show that the genotype 2R/2R (homozygosity for 2 tandem repeat sequences in the 5'UTR) is more frequently associated with MSI+ and lower TS levels. More over we did not find any significant association between the 2R/3R (heterozygosity for 2 and 3 tandem repeat sequences in the 5'UTR) and 3R/3R (homozygosity for 3 tandem repeat sequences in the 5' UTR) genotypes with the MSI+ and MSI-, while these genotypes were associated with a higher TS expression. As a consequence we can hypothesise that patients bearing CRC with the MSI+, the 2R/2R genotype and with low TS levels could have a better prognosis and they could not be drug resistant.
