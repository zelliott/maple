Progestins are reported to increase the risk of invasive breast cancers in postmenopausal women receiving hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin. We report here that estrogen and progesterone receptor positive (ER+PR+) rat mammary tumors arising in the presence of estrogen and progesterone exhibit increased invasiveness and decreased expression of E-cadherin protein compared with tumors growing in the presence of estrogen alone. A similar decrease of E-cadherin expression was observed in human ER+PR+ invasive ductal carcinoma compared with ductal carcinoma in situ. In agreement with findings in the rat, estrogen plus progestin R5020 treatment decreased E-cadherin expression in vitro in T47D human breast cancer cells. Decrease of E-cadherin protein was mediated by progesterone receptor B (PRB) and dependent on the activation of the Wnt pathway. These results suggest that progesterone signaling via PRB contributes to tumor invasiveness and can provide an important therapeutic target for treatment of invasive ER+PR+ breast cancers.
