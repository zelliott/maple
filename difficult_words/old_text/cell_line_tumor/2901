Bioactivity-guided fractionation of extracts from the fungus IBWF79B-90A resulted in the isolation of three known naphthoquinones, herbarin, dehydroherbarin, and O-methylherbarin and the azaanthraquinone scorpinone as well as three structurally related derivatives, O-phenethylherbarin and herbaridines A and B. All seven compounds exhibited cytotoxic activities against several cell lines.
