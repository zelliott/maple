To prepare cantharidin and cantharidin peptides from Mylabris and compare their antitumor activity.

Cantharis peptides was prepared by bionic enzymolysis approach and cantharidin was prepared by alkaline water supersonic extraction. The inhibitory effects of both compounds on BEL-7402 cells proliferation of human liver cancer were tested by Prestoblue method. The influence of both compounds on the grown of tumor, thymus, spleen of S180 tumor-bearing mice were detected.

Cantharis peptides and cantharidin could inhibit the proliferation of BEL-7402 cells (P < 0.05) in vivo, and the inhibitory effect of cantharis peptide was 12.54% lower than that of cantharidin. At the same time, they could inhibit the grown of S180 sarcoma (P < 0.05), and the inhibitory effect of cantharidin was higher than that of cantharis peptides (5.93%). Furthermore, cantharis peptides could't inhibit the grown of thymus and spleen.

Both cantharis peptides and cantharidin have antineoplastic activity, but cantharidin peptides have no immunosuppression.
