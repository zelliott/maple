Exosomes are sub-100 nm extracellular vesicles secreted by normal and cancer cells. We present a high-resolution structure of previously unidentified nanofilaments on glioblastoma-derived exosomes, using nanoscale peak force imaging. These stiff, adhesive, trypsin- and RNAse-resistant surface nanofilaments add a new dimension to the current structural knowledge of exosome-mediated intercellular communication.
