Standard therapies such as surgery and chemotherapy offer only minimal improvement in pancreatic cancer. However, the viruses killing cancer cells and substances like some antibiotics and phytoalexins with anticancer potential may represent a candidate non-conventional mean of cancer treatment in the future. In this study, the effect of infection with oncolytic H-1 parvovirus (H-1PV) combined with antibiotic norfloxacin (NFX) or phytoalexin resveratrol on the survival of cell lines Panc-1 and BxPC3 derived from human pancreatic carcinoma was tested. Whereas H-1PV with NFX exerted a synergistic effect, H-1PV with resveratrol resulted in an additive effect only. All the effects were partial, but they were more pronounced in Panc-1 compared to BxPC3 cells.
