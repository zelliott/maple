Accumulating research indicates that B cells are involved in anti-tumor immunity. Chronic alcohol consumption is associated with decreased survival of cancer patients. The effect of alcohol consumption on B cells in tumor-bearing hosts is unknown. Results in melanoma-bearing mice showed that chronic alcohol consumption did not alter the percentage and number of B cells in bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes but dramatically decreased B cells in the peripheral blood. Alcohol consumption did not alter the development of B cells in the bone marrow and did not affect follicular B cells in the spleen; however, it increased T1 B cells and decreased marginal zone B cells in the spleen. Alcohol consumption also decreased mature B cells in the blood. It did not alter the chemotactic capacity of plasma to facilitate migration of splenocytes or the chemotactic response of splenocytes to CXCL13 and CCL21. However, the response of splenocytes to sphingosine-1-phosphate was impaired in alcohol-consuming, melanoma-bearing mice. The expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1) and sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase-1 (SPL1) in splenocytes was downregulated. Taken together, these results indicate that chronic alcohol consumption decreases peripheral blood B cells by compromising B cell egress from the spleen. The downregulation of S1PR1 and SPL1 expression in alcohol-consuming, melanoma-bearing mice could be associated with compromised egress of B cells from the spleen.
