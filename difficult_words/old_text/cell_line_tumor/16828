To study the molecular mechanism of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), one of effective ingredient of brucine, in inducing non-small cell lung cancer cell apoptosis.

COX-2 promoter, transcription factor deletion mutants and COX-2 mRNA 3'-UTR-containing report plasmids were transfected with Renillia to non-small cell lung cancer A549 cell, in order to detect the activity of report gene luciferase and minimum cis-acting element of COX-2 promoter inhibited by brucine. The influence of brucine on IkappaB phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of p65 were detected by immunoblotting assay.

Brucine significantly suppressed LPS-induced COX-2 promoter activation, but revealed minor impact on COX-2 mRNA stability. NF-kappaB in the vicinity of COX-2 promoter-262 was an important cis-acting element of brucine for inhibiting the activity of COX-2 promoter. Brucine was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha as well as the nuclear translocation of p65.

Brucine can improve A549 cells apoptosis by inhibiting the activity of NF-kappaB and the subsequent COX-2 gene expression.
