Neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery is currently being investigated for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study reports efficacy, toxicity and feasibility of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent radiotherapy (CCRT) in stage IIIA, N2 positive NSCLC.

From March 2001 to February 2004, 52 patients with histologically confirmed stage IIIA, N2 positive NSCLC were registered. Patients received preoperative CCRT that consisted of weekly paclitaxel plus platinum chemotherapy and concurrent radiotherapy followed by surgery.

Overall response rate was 76.9% (95% CI, 64-88%). The major grade 3-4 toxicities were radiation esophagitis (15.4%) and neutropenia (11.5%), and treatment-related mortality rate was 1.9%. Forty-two of 52 patients (80.8%) subsequently underwent surgical resection and 35 of 52 patients (67.3%) underwent complete resection. Among them, pathological complete response was obtained in 4.8%. Pathological downstaging rate to N0-1 and stage 0-II at surgery were 69.0% and 66.7%, respectively. The perioperative major morbidity rate was 23.8% and perioperative mortality was 2.4%. At a median follow-up of 33.9 months (range: 16.4-49.9), the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 16.5 months (95% CI, 6.2-26.8) and 25.6 months (95% CI, 14.6-36.6), respectively. Multivariate analyses identified that patients achieved mediastinal nodal clearance (downstage to pathological N0 or N1) after CCRT (p=0.02) and age at diagnosis<60 years (p=0.01) showed significantly improved survival.

Neoadjuvant CCRT showed a high overall response rate with tolerable toxicity profile. Downstaging after CCRT may increase the rate of complete tumor resection and result in survival benefit in stage IIIA, N2 positive NSCLC patients.
