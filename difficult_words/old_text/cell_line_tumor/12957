RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular regulatory process that inhibits gene expression by transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms. Synthetic approaches that emulate this process (small interfering RNA (siRNA), short hairpin RNA (shRNA)) have been shown to be similarly effective in this regard. We developed a novel 'bifunctional' RNAi strategy, which further optimizes target gene knockdown outcome. A bifunctional construct (bi-sh-STMN1) was generated against Stathmin1, a critical tubulin modulator that is overexpressed in human cancers. The bifunctional construct is postulated to concurrently repress the translation of the target mRNA (cleavage-independent, mRNA sequestration and degradation) and degrade (through RNase H-like cleavage) post-transcriptional mRNA through cleavage-dependent activities. Bi-sh-STMN1 showed enhanced potency and durability in parallel comparisons with conventional shRNA and siRNAs targeting the same sequence. Enhanced STMN1 protein knockdown by bi-sh-STMN1 was accompanied by target site cleavage at the mRNA level showed by the rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends (RACE) assay. Bi-sh-STMN1 also showed knockdown kinetics at the mRNA level consistent with its multieffector silencing mechanisms. The bifunctional shRNA is a highly effective and advantageous approach mediating RNAi at concentrations significantly lower than conventional shRNA or siRNA. These results support further evaluations.
