Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American men. The loss of Y chromosome has been frequently observed in primary prostate cancer as well as other types of cancer. Earlier, we showed that introduction of the human Y chromosome suppresses the in vivo tumorigenicity of the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. To further characterize the Y chromosome, we have developed a high-density bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) microarray containing 178 BAC clones from the human Y chromosome. BAC microarray was used for array comparative genomic hybridization on prostate cancer samples and cell lines. The most prominent observation on prostate cancer specimens was a deletion at Yp11.2 containing the TSPY tandem gene array. Out of 36 primary prostate tumors analyzed, 16 (44.4%) samples exhibited loss of TSPY gene copies. Notably, we observed association between the number of TSPY copies in the blood and the incidence of prostate cancer. Moreover, PC-3 hybrids with an intact Yp11.2 did not grow tumors in nude mice, whereas PC-3 hybrids with a deletion at Yp11.2 grew tumors in nude mice.
