A TAT peptide-delivered molecular beacon was developed and utilized to enumerate murine norovirus 1, a human norovirus (NoV) surrogate, in RAW 264.7 cells. This allowed the detection of a single infective virus within 6 h, a 12-fold improvement in time required for viral detection and quantification compared to that required by the conventional plaque assay.
