The HBx protein of hepatitis B virus is involved in deregulation of cell cycle and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Since c-Myc also plays an important role in cell proliferation and tumor development, we studied its regulation by HBx in a human hepatoma cell line. Co-expression of HBx and c-Myc resulted in increased stability of intracellular c-Myc. HBx blocked the ubiquitination of Myc through a direct interaction with the F box region of Skp2 and destabilization of the SCF(Skp2) complex. We suggest that sustained presence of c-Myc combined with mitogenic activity inherent to HBx may be associated with cell cycle deregulation and transformation.
