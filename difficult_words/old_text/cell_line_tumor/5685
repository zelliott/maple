Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) signalling mediates lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic invasion; however, the effect of VEGFR-3 inhibition on the lymph node (LN) metastasis remains unclear. The aim of this study is to clarify the benefit of a VEGFR-3 inhibitor Ki23057 for LN metastasis.

Ki23057 was administered orally to gastric cancer models created by orthotopic inoculation of diffuse-type gastric cancer cells, OCUM-2MLN. The effects of Ki23057 on lymphatic vessel invasion, lymphatic vessel density, and VEGFR-3 phosphorylation were examined by immunostaining or immunoblotting.

Ki23057 inhibited the autophosphorylation of VEGFR-3, with IC50 values of 4.3 nM in the cell-free kinase assay. Murine gastric cancer models created by the orthotopic inoculation of OCUM-2MLN cells showed the diffusely infiltrating growth and frequently developed LN metastasis. The oral administration of Ki23057 significantly ( p<0.01) reduced the size of orthotopic tumours and the number of the metastatic LN in gastric cancer models. The degree of lymphatic invasion and lymphangiogenesis was significantly ( p<0.05) lower in the gastric tumours treated by Ki23057. Ki23057 inhibited the phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 of lymphatic endothelial cells in gastric tumours.

The inhibition of lymphangiogenesis targeting VEGFR-3 phosphorylation is a therapeutic strategy for inhibiting LN metastasis of diffuse-type gastric cancer.
