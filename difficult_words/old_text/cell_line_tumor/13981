Nedaplatin (NDP) was developed as a second-generation platinum complex. The antitumor efficacy of the combination of NDP with docetaxel (TXT) was evaluated against human head and neck carcinoma. The antitumor activity of NDP plus TXT was compared with that of some other platinum compounds, cisplatin (CDDP) and carboplatin (CBDCA) plus TXT.

Mice implanted with HNC-3 or KB3-1, human head and neck carcinoma were administered i.v. NDP, CDDP or CBDCA plus TXT.

The antitumor efficacy was enhanced significantly by the combination of NDP with TXT. Combined NDP plus TXT treatment exerted antitumor efficacy comparable to that of combined CDDP plus TXT treatment. Thrombocytopenia induced by NDP was not enhanced by the combination of NDP and TXT.

The results suggest that combined NDP and TXT can alleviate thrombocytopenia caused by NDP and that this combination may have significant potential in clinical use.
