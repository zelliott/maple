Cooperating mercapto groups with tacrine in a single molecular, novel multifunctional compounds have been designed and synthesized. These mercapto-tacrine derivatives displayed a synergistic pharmacological profile of long-term potentiation enhancement, cholinesterase inhibition, neuroprotection, and less hepatotoxicity, emerging as promising molecules for the therapy of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
