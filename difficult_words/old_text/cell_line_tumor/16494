A series of novel Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes with oxaprozin (Hoxa), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has been synthesized. The drug and complexes have been characterized by elemental and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, Fourier transform (FT)-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The (pseudo)octahedral geometry has been proposed for all complexes based on electronic spectra and magnetic moments. With exception of the Cu(II) complex, where bridging bidentate mode of COO groups has been found, FT-IR spectra confirmed chelately coordinated COO groups in the other complexes. The general formula of the complexes is [M(H2O)2(oxa)2 ·χH2O, with χ=2 for M=Mn, Co and Ni and χ=1.5 for Zn. The binuclear Cu(II) complex, [Cu2(H2O)2(OH)(oxa)3]·2H2O, has strong Cu-Cu interactions of antiferromagnetic type. The complexes and Hoxa did not exhibit the cytotoxic effect to peritoneal macrophages. For the first time these complexes have been tested for their in vitro antiproliferative activity against human colon and breast cancer cell lines, HCT-116 and MDA-231, respectively. For all investigated compounds significant antiproliferative effects have been observed. Ni(II) complex has been shown to be a promising antiproliferative agent exerting excellent activity against HCT-116 even in nanomolar concentrations.
