Epirubicin is widely used in osteosarcoma chemotherapy. Growing evidence indicates that the microRNA (miRNA) expression levels which are induced by chemotherapeutic agents play an important role in osteosarcoma development and progression. In this study we investigate the alterations of miRNA expression in the osteosarcoma cells after epirubicin treatment and whether miRNAs can enhance its anti-osteosarcoma effect. After epirubicin exposure, microarray shows 40 miRNAs are differentially expressed in osteosarcoma cells including 24 down-regulated miRNAs. Notably, miR-302b, which is stably low-expressed in osteosarcoma, could be induced by the epirubicin. Furthermore, we find that miR-302b can inhibit the osteosarcoma cell proliferation, promote cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest MiR-302b can activate caspase-3 and regulate the Akt/pAkt, Bcl-2, Bim expression to increase the cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, miR-302b also attenuates cyclin D1 and CDKs expression to induce cell cycle arrest. Therefore, our results suggest miR-302b can play an essential role in osteosarcoma treatment as a potential tumor suppressor.
