The aim of this study was to prepare oxymatrine (OMT) mixed micellar nanoparticles to delay release of the drug and enhance its cytotoxicity against cancer cells. A co-solvent evaporation method using lipoid E80, lipoid S75, MPEG-PLA and Poloxamer 188 was chosen to prepare the OMT formulation, and its release characteristics, cytotoxic activity in vitro and physical characteristics were evaluated. The results showed that OMT mixed micellar nanoparticles have sustained release and cytotoxic activity in vitro to the SMMC-7721 cell line.
