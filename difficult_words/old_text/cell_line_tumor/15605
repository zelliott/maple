Prostate cancer metastasis to bone may be mediated by preferential proliferation of these cells in the bone's microenvironment. We hypothesize that this preferential proliferation is mediated by bone-associated growth factors (GFs) and cytokines. To test our hypothesis, human prostate cancer cells, derived from both soft tissue (LNCaP, DuCaP, DU145) and bone metastases (PC-3, VCaP, MDA-2a, MDA-2b), were treated with bone-associated GFs and cytokines (PDGF, IGF-1, TGF-beta, EGF, bFGF, TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6) for 48 h, and their growth responses were compared. The responses of soft tissue-derived prostate cancer cell lines to bone GFs and cytokines were variable. LNCaP cell growth was stimulated by IGF-1 but was inhibited by TNF-alpha. DU145 cell growth was stimulated with EGF. Prostate cancer cell lines derived from bone metastases also responded variably to bone GFs and cytokines. IL-1 stimulated the growth of MDA-2a and 2b cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. PDGF and bFGF both demonstrated variable effects on bone-derived prostate cancer cell lines. TNF-alpha inhibited proliferation of the VCaP cells. These findings demonstrate that human prostate cancer cell lines derived from bone metastases may not respond preferentially to bone-associated GFs and cytokines.
