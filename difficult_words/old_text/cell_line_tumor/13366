An oral squamous cell carcinoma Ca9-22 cell line was treated with 11-dehydrosinulariolide, an active compound isolated from the soft coral Sinularia leptoclados, in order to evaluate the effect of this compound on cell growth and protein expression. Cell proliferation was strongly inhibited by 11-dehydrosinulariolide treatment. The 2-DE master maps of control and treated Ca9-22 cells were generated by analysis with the PDQuest software. The comparison between such maps showed up- and down-regulation of 23 proteins, of which 14 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. The proteomic studies described here have identified some proteins, which are involved in the mitochondrial dysfunction and ER-stress pathway and imply that 11-dehydrosinulariolide induces cell apoptosis through either mitochondrial dysfunction-related or ER stress pathway. Based on this observation, several proteins related to apoptosis pathway were explored for the potential roles involved in this drug-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, Salubrinal, an ER stress inhibitor, is able to protect the cell from 11-dehydrosinulariolide-induced apoptosis in a physiological dosage. The significance of these studies illustrates the potential development of anticancer drugs from the natural derivatives of soft coral.
