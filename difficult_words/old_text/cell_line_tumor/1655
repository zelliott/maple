The composition of the essential oils of Cirsium palustre and C. rivulare and their antiproliferative activity against breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MBA-231) were investigated. The essential oils obtained by hydro-distillation from the roots (yield 0.2 and 0.1% v/w, respectively), leaves and inflorescences (yield below 0.01%), were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The composition of the essential oils in the respective organs of each plant differed considerably. On the other hand, similarities were observed in the composition of root and leaf oils. In C. palustre and C. rivulare root oil, 50 and 39 constituents were identified, accounting for 95.3% and 92.4% of the total content. The main components were aplotaxene and its derivatives, representing 78.6% and 46.6% of the total content. In leaf oils of both species, 59 and 49 compounds, respectively, were identified, representing 67.4% and 78.3% of the total content. The major constituents were beta-damascenone (4.1% and 13.4%, respectively) and beta-ionone (6.7% and 5.3%, respectively). Short-chain saturated and unsaturated aliphatic alcohols and aldehydes constituted another important group of compounds (17.7% and 9.0%, respectively). The essential oils of the roots have moderate anti-proliferative activity, with IC50 values ranging from 110 to 140 microg/mL. These concentrations were below the level able to inhibit the proliferation of healthy cells.
