The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-osteosarcoma effects and mechanisms of 4-O-amino-phenol-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin ether (ODE), a new derivative of podophyllotoxin. The results showed that ODE inhibited proliferation of K562, OS-9901, CNE, BGC-823 and Tca-8113 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner as determined by microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay. OS-9901 and K562 cells treated with ODE for 24 h showed cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M and a parallel decrease in G(0)/G(1) and S phase as detected by flow cytometry (FCM). Meanwhile, a fraction of cells with hypodiploid DNA content representing apoptosis were detected by FCM. Morphology observation also revealed typical apoptotic features, including shrinkage of cellular and nuclear membranes, condensed heterochromatin around the nuclear periphery and cytoplasmic vacuolation in OS-9901 cells. Under a confocal laser scanning microscope, intracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations were greatly increased whereas the pH value, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were markedly reduced in OS-9901 cells after treatment with ODE. Taken together, these results suggest that the anti-osteosarcoma mechanisms of ODE are attributed to apoptosis through increasing intracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations, and reducing pH value, MMP and ROS.
