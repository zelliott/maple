N-(2-Hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer-docetaxel-RGDfK conjugate was synthesized, characterized, and evaluated in vitro and in vivo in comparison with untargeted low and high molecular weight HPMA copolymer-docetaxel conjugates. The targeted conjugate was designed to have a hydrodynamic diameter below renal threshold to allow elimination post treatment. All conjugates demonstrated the ability to inhibit the growth of DU145 and PC3 human prostate cancer cells and the HUVEC at low nanomolar concentrations. The targeted conjugate showed active binding to α(v)β(3) integrins in both HUVEC and DU145 cells, whereas the untargeted conjugate demonstrated no evidence of specific binding. Efficacy at two concentrations (20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg) was evaluated in nu/nu mice bearing DU145 tumor xenografts treated with a single dose of conjugates and compared with controls. RGDfK targeted and high molecular weight nontargeted conjugates exhibited the highest antitumor efficacy as evaluated by tumor regression. These results demonstrate that α(v)β(3) integrin targeted polymeric conjugates with improved water solubility, reduced toxicity and ease of elimination post treatment in vivo are promising candidates for prostate cancer therapy.
