To identify genetic changes involved in the progression of breast carcinoma, we did cDNA array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on a panel of breast tumors, including 10 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 18 invasive breast carcinomas, and two lymph node metastases. We identified 49 minimal commonly amplified regions (MCRs) that included known (1q, 8q24, 11q13, 17q21-q23, and 20q13) and several uncharacterized (12p13 and 16p13) regional copy number gains. With the exception of the 17q21 (ERBB2) amplicon, the overall frequency of copy number alterations was higher in invasive tumors than that in DCIS, with several of them present only in invasive cancer. Amplification of candidate loci was confirmed by quantitative PCR in breast carcinomas and cell lines. To identify putative targets of amplicons, we developed a method combining array CGH and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data to correlate copy number and expression levels for each gene within MCRs. Using this approach, we were able to distinguish a few candidate targets from a set of coamplified genes. Analysis of the 12p13-p12 amplicon identified four putative targets: TEL/ETV6, H2AFJ, EPS8, and KRAS2. The amplification of all four candidates was confirmed by quantitative PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization, but only H2AFJ and EPS8 were overexpressed in breast tumors with 12p13 amplification compared with a panel of normal mammary epithelial cells. These results show the power of combined array CGH and SAGE analysis for the identification of candidate amplicon targets and identify H2AFJ and EPS8 as novel putative oncogenes in breast cancer.
