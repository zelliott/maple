Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a fatal disease that shows minimal response to chemotherapy. Genetic changes involved in the progression of PDAC concern genes that encode proteins related to signal transduction networks. This fact reveals the importance in identifying the role and the relations between multiple signaling cascades in PDAC. One of the major factors that modulate signaling events is multidomain scaffold proteins that function by binding several proteins simultaneously, inducing their proximity and influencing the outcome of signaling. A particular group among them, containing multiple Src homology 3 (SH3) domains that can bind proteins containing proline-rich motifs, was associated to different aspects of cancer cell homeostasis. In this work, using a microarray-based analysis, we have shown that 13 multiple SH3 domain containing scaffold proteins are expressed in PDAC cells. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, we have identified proteins that interact with these adaptor proteins. Among them we have found several molecules that modulate cell proliferation and survival (CIZ1, BIRC6, RBBP6), signaling (LTBP4, Notch2, TOM1L1, STK24) and membrane dynamics (PLSCR1, DDEF2, VCP). Our results indicate that interactions mediated by multi-SH3 domain-containing proteins could lead to the formation of dynamic protein complexes that function in pancreatic cancer cell signaling. The identification of such protein complexes is of paramount importance in deciphering pancreatic cancer biology and designing novel therapeutic approaches.
