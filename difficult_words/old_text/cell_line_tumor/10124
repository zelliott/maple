Silk fibroin coated CdSe quantum dots (SF-CdSe QDs) were successfully synthesized via a one-step gamma-radiation route in an aqueous system at room temperature. The as prepared products were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersion spectrum (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and photoluminescence spectrum (PL). The SF-CdSe QDs were about 5 nm in diameter and exhibited excellent water-solubility and photoluminescence properties. The cellular distribution, photostability and cytotoxicity of SF-CdSe QDs with different amount of SF coatings were also investigated by laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) and MTT assays in human pancreatic carcinoma (PANC-1) cells. All the results reveal that these QDs could be easily internalized by cells and localized in cytoplasm around nuclei. Moreover, SF-CdSe QDs were proved to be low cytotoxicity (the concentration of QDs < 5 microg mL(-1)) and high photostability (the illumination energy density < 2 x 10(-5) W microm(-2)) within PANC-1 cells, which was mainly due to the biocompatible silk fibroin. The resulted SF-CdSe QDs might have many potential applications in tumor imaging and therapy. And the synthesis strategy could be easily extended to fabrication of other nanoparticles coated with silk fibroin.
