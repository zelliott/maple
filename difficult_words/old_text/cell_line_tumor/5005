Intratumoral (i.t.) injection of OK-432, a streptococcal preparation, into implanted tumors of mouse hepatocellular carcinoma (MIH-2) showed antitumor effect including tumor eradication. Intraperitoneal administration of same dose OK-432 did not exhibit tumor suppressive effect. In vitro cytotoxic test suggested that direct cytotoxic effect of OK-432 was not associated with antitumor activity by i.t.-OK-432 treatment. It was also found that Toll-like receptor 4 signaling was not involved in i.t.-OK-432 treatment. Three mice out of five, which had shown tumor eradication by i.t.-OK-432 treatment did not reject re-challenge of MIH-2 cells. Splenocytes from i.t.-OK-432 treated mice did not produce IFN-gamma by stimulation with MIH-2 cells in vitro, but produced abundant IFN-gamma by stimulation with OK-432. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that CD4+T cells, but not CD8+T cells, infiltrated to i.t.-OK-432 treated tumor tissue produced IFN-gamma. Tumor-infiltrating CD4+T cells from i.t.-OK-432 treated tumor tissue produced IFN-gamma by in vitro stimulation with OK-432 higher than those from untreated tumor tissue. IFN-gamma directly induced apoptosis of MIH-2 cells in vitro. Collectively, i.t.-OK-432 treatment induced priming of CD4+T cells to antigenecity of OK-432, and repetitive i.t.-OK-432 treatment induced IFN-gamma production from OK-432-sensitized CD4+T cells in tumor site, leading to apoptosis of MIH-2 cells susceptible to IFN-gamma.
