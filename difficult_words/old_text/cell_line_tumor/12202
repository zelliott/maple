Caspase-8 belongs to the cysteine protease family and is known to be activated at the initial step in the cascade of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The activation of procaspase-8 can be blocked by a relatively large amount of c-FLIP, which renders resistance to death receptor-mediated apoptosis in many types of cancer cells. To ask if extrinsic over-expression of caspase-8 contributes to the induction of apoptosis, we introduced the caspase-8 gene into HCC cells using an adenoviral (Adv) vector (Adv-Casp8). We demonstrated that Adv-Casp8 increased expression of active forms of caspase-8 in MOI-dependent manner. A large amount of Adv-Casp8 (MOI of 50) induced apoptosis significantly in HCC cells and resulted in downregulation of c-FLIP (in SK-Hep1, HLE, and HepG2 cells), XIAP, survivin, and Bcl-xL (in HLE cells) and dynamic release of cytochrome c and Smac from the mitochondria into the cytosol. On the other hand, a small amount of Adv-Casp8 (MOI of 10) causes a slight but detectable increase in the level of apoptosis with only a small effect on anti-apoptotic proteins and mitochondrial activation. However, small amounts of Adv-Casp8 augmented TRAIL- or chemotherapeutic agent-induced cell death (with an MOI of 10 or 20, respectively). These results suggest both that exogenous over-expression of caspase-8 by Adv-Casp8 may be essential for induction of HCC cell death and that the combination of Adv-Casp8 and TRAIL or chemotherapeutic agents could provide a useful strategy for treatment of HCC.
