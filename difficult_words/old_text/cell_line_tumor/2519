The inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) are important regulators of apoptosis. However, little is known about the capacity of Smac mimetics (IAP inhibitor) to overcome virally associated-lymphoma's (VAL) resistance to apoptosis. Here, we explored the pro-apoptotic effect of a novel Smac mimetic, RMT5265.2HCL (RMT) in VAL cells. RMT improved the sensitivity to apoptosis in EBV- and to some extend in HTLV-1- but not in HHV-8-VAL. Furthermore, we identified that RMT promotes caspase 3 and 9 cleavage by inhibiting XIAP and inducing the mitochondrial efflux of Smac and cytochrome C. This investigation further support exploring the use of Smac inhibitors in VAL.
