In terms of nuclear decay 18F is the most ideal PET nuclide but its short t(½) precludes its use for directly labelling whole antibodies due to their long blood residence times. Pre-targeted imaging using affinity systems such as Neutravidin™-biotin facilitates the application of short-lived nuclides by their attachment to biotin for imaging cell surface proteins targeted with Neutravidin™-conjugated antibodies.

Boroaryl functionalised biotin was prepared with a PEG linker and radiolabelled by incubation with 18F in acidified aqueous solution. Cells expressing high (SKBr3), medium (MDA-MB-453) and low (MDA-MB-468) levels of HER-2 were pre-incubated with Neutravidin™-conjugated trastuzumab, washed, and then incubated with 18F -PEG-biotin.

The 18F -fluorination of boroaryl-PEG-biotin was much more efficient than reported for other versions of boroaryl-biotin. The novel 18F -PEG-biotin was demonstrated to bind to HER-2-expressing cells in-vitro pre-incubated with Neutravidin™-conjugated trastuzumab.

Biotin can be functionalised with boroaryl and readily 18F -radiolabelled in aqueous solution and will bind to cells pre-incubated with Neutravidin™-antibody conjugates.
