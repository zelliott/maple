In order to apply photodynamic therapy (PDT) to pigmented melanoma, the efficacy of PDT mediated by pheophorbide alpha from silkworm excreta (SPbalpha) and commercial Photofrin against B16F10 melanoma was comparatively studied from the in vivo assay using C57BL/6J mice. From in vitro PDT assay, the proliferation of B16F10 cells treated with SPbalpha (more than 0.5 microg/ml) and light illumination (1.2 J/cm2) were significantly inhibited with the necrotic response. This indicated that the photocytotoxicity of SPbalpha (665 nm) was not influenced by melanin from melanoma. From the assessment of the in vivo photosensitizing activity, the tumor growth was further delayed in groups treated with SPbalpha/PDT compared to that treated with Photofrin /PDT. The survival rate of tumor bearing mice treated with SPbalpha/PDT was closely associated with its photosensitizing effect. In addition, the photosensitizing effect of SPbalpha/PDT showed a dose dependent tendency in light illumination. These results demonstrated that B16F10 melanoma cells were significantly photosensitized by SPbalpha/PDT, regardless of the influence of melanin from melanoma, and SPbalpha/PDT at very low drug dose (1 mg/kg) and light dose (1.2 J/cm2) showed the photosensitizing efficacy surpassing Photofrin against B16F10 melanoma in mice system.
