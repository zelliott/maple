Invasion and metastasis cause death of patients with liver cancer. Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is closely associated with tumor progression. Type IV collagen is the main structure protein of basilar membrane which is a natural barrier for inhibiting the metastasis of liver cancer cells. In this experiment, we used all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) to inhibit collagenase type IV in order to protect the type IV collagen and basilar membrane, further to suppress the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinomas.

By the use of cell culture and experimental animal models, the influence of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) on the invasion of Hca-F liver cancer cells was studied in terms of adhesion capacity to artificial basilar membrane and production of collagenase type IV.

ATRA could inhibit the adhesion capacity and collagenase IV secretion of Hca-F cells in a dose-dependent manner.

ATRA can exert multiple effects on the invasion of Hca-F cells.
