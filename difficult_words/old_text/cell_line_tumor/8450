Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) play a key role in the metabolism of a wide range of environmental xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. The expression and activity levels of CYPs can be elevated by a process of induction involving the activation of nuclear receptors. The effects of the ionic liquid 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C(8)mim][Cl]) on the expression of cytochrome P450 members, including CYP1A1, CYP2E1, and CYP3A, as well as on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) in mouse mammary carcinoma cells (EMT6) were investigated by using quantitative real-time PCR in the present study. The results reveal that [C(8)mim][Cl]-exposure up-regulates the expressions of CYP1A1, CYP2E1, and CYP3A at mRNA level, suggesting that imidazolium-based ionic liquids can activate CYPs. Our results also suggest that [C(8)mim][Cl]-mediated CYP3A induction be PXR-dependent. This result may be beneficial to evaluating the environmental toxicity of imidazolium-based ionic liquids and investigating the metabolism of imidazolium-derivative drugs.
