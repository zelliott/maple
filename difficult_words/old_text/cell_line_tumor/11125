To investigate the chemical constituents from the tuber of the planted Cremastra appendiculata.

The compounds were isolated by column chromatography over silica gel, Sephadex LH-20 and RP-HPLC, and their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis.

Eight compounds were isolated, and identified as cirrhopetalanthrin (I), 7-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenanthrene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (II), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methoxyphenyl-1-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (III), tyrosol 8-O-beta-D-gluco-pyranoside (IV), vanilloloside (V), p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (VI), sucrose (VII), adenosine (VIII).

These compounds are isolated from this plant for the first time. All compounds were evaluated against human colon cancer (HCT-8), human hepatoma (Bel7402), human stomach cancer(BGC-823), human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), human breast cancer (MCF-7), and human ovarian cancer (A2780) cell lines, and cirrhopetalanthrin (I) showed non-selective moderate cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 8.4-13.3 micromol x L(-1), and other compounds were inactive.
