Chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) present in the placental intervillous blood spaces has been described as the main receptor involved in the massive sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes to the placenta. Placental parasite isolates are functionally distinct from isolates that sequester in other organs, because they do not cytoadhere to CD36 but instead bind to CSA. To investigate for the parasites molecules associated with the CSA adhesion phenotype, different methodologies have been developed to select for CSA-binding lines in vitro mainly using non-placental sources of CSA that differ in their sulfation pattern. In this study, we show that the human trophoblastic BeWo cell line is a very efficient alternative to select for the CSA-binding phenotype in parasitized erythrocytes.
