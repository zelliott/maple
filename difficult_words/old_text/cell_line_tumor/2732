To clarify molecular mechanisms involved in the action of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in hormone insensitive prostate cancer cells.

Total ribonucleic acid from untreated and PEDF-treated cells was subjected to microarray analysis using BioStar 8464 microarray. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was conducted to confirm the microarray data.

Twenty-seven out of 8464 genes were found altered in both cell lines. Common gene responses altered by PEDF were identified and included genes known to alter cell signaling as well as genes involved in catalytic activity, cell proliferation, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, in accordance with the microarray analysis, indicated that PEDF treatment caused an upregulation in the mRNA expression level of stanniocalcin 2, brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 2 and growth arrest, DNA-damage-inducible, alpha, and downregulation in the messenger ribonucleic acid level of fibroblast growth factor 3, teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor, neuropilin1, and endothelial Per/ARNT/Sim domain protein1, respectively.

These findings demonstrate that PEDF administration causes significant changes in the gene expression of the prostate, providing insights into the potential role of PEDF in the treatment of prostate cancer.
