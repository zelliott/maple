Fra-2 (Fos-related antigen 2) is a member of the Fos family of AP-1 transcription factors which is often up-regulated in mammary carcinomas. Previous results suggested that it might be involved in the regulation of breast cancer invasion and metastasis. In order to analyze the role of Fra-2 in breast cancer cells, it was silenced in the highly invasive MDA-MB231 cells using RNA interference. On the other hand, stable transfectants of the weakly invasive MCF7 cell line were established in order to analyze the effects of Fra-2 overexpression. In both approaches, cell proliferation was not or only weakly influenced by Fra-2. In contrast, the invasive potential of the cells was increased, and a weaker effect on motility was observed. By cDNA microarray analysis of the MCF7 transfectants followed by validation on a protein level, we identified several Fra-2 target genes which might be involved in cell invasion and migration, i.e., ALCAM and connexin 43. Additionally, mRNA expression levels of various genes which are associated with a more malignant behavior of the tumors in vivo were up- or downregulated, i.e., members of the MAGE family, S100P, TIMP2, IL24 etc. These results show that Fra-2 overexpression is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and is probably involved in breast cancer progression in vivo.
