To investigate the effect of taxol combining accelerated radiation on the human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma Hep-2 cell lines in vitro, and to provide the experimental basis for the usage of these two combined theraputic methods.

Using techniques of tumor cells culture in vitro, the suppressive and time-dependency effects of taxol (1 x 10(-8) mol/L) combine 2 Gy X-rays generated by accelerator on the human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma Hep-2 cell lines were observed.

Cell growth is obviously suppressed in group taxol combined accelerated radiation and it's livability is 11.11%, much lower than accelerated radiation combined taxol. After adding taxol 12 h or 24 h then combined accelerated radiation, the two groups were no difference statistically. Cell livability of group taxol is lower than group accelerated radiation.

Cell growth is obviously suppressed in the human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma Hep-2 cell lines after given 1 x 10(-8) mol/L taxol combined 2 Gy X-rays generated by accelerator. Taxol acts as a radiation sensitizer.
