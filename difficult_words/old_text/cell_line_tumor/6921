Crystallographic and modelling data, in conjunction with a medicinal chemistry template-hopping approach, led to the identification of a series of novel and potent inhibitors of human cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), with selectivity over glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). One example had a CDK2 IC(50) of 120 nM and showed selectivity over GSK-3beta of 167-fold.
