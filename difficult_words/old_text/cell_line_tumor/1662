Purification of a MeOH extract from the aerial parts of Hylomecon vernalis Maxim. (Papaveraceae) using column chromatography furnished a new acetylated flavonol glycoside (1), together with twenty known phenolic compounds (2-21). Structural elucidation of 1 was based on 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy data analysis to be quercetin 3-O-[4‴-O-acetyl-α-L-arabinopyranosyl]-(1‴→6″)-β-D-galactopyranoside (1). The structures of compounds 2-21 were elucidated by spectroscopy and confirmed by comparison with reported data; quercetin 3-O-[2‴-O-acetyl-α-L-arabinopyranosyl]-(1‴→6″)-β -D-galactopyranoside (2), quercetin 3-O-α-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1‴→6″)-β-D-galactopyranoside (3), quercetin 3-O-β -D-galactopyranoside (4), kaempferol 3,7-O-α-L-dirhamnopyranoside (5), diosmetin 7-O-β -D-glucopyranoside (6), diosmetin 7-O-β -D-xylopyranosyl-(1‴→6″)-β-D-glucopyranoside (7), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (8), protocatechuic acid (9), caffeic acid (10), 6-hydroxy-3,4-dihydro-1-oxo-β -carboline (11), (Z)-3-hexenyl-β -D-glucopyranoside (12), (E)-2-hexenyl-β -D-glucopyranoside (13), (Z)-3-hexenyl-α-Larabinopyranosyl-(1″→6')-β-D-glucopyranoside (14), oct-1-en-3-yl-α-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1″→6')-β-D-glucopyranoside (15), benzyl-β-D-apiofuranosyl-(1″→6')-β-D-glucopyranoside (16), benzyl-α-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1″→6')-β-D-glucopyranoside (17), benzyl-β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1″→6')-β-Dglucopyranoside (18), 2-phenylethyl-α-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1″→6')-β-D-glucopyranoside (19), 2-phenylethyl-β-D-apiofuranosyl-(1″→6')-β-D-glucopyranoside (20), and aryl-β-D-glucopyranoside (21). Compounds 2-21 were isolated for the first time from this plant. The isolated compounds were tested for cytotoxicity against four human tumor cell lines in vitro using a Sulforhodamin B bioassay.
