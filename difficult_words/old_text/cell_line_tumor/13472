Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL antiapoptotic proteins are attractive cancer therapeutic targets. We have previously reported the design of 4,5-diphenyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acids as a class of potent Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitors. In the present study, we report our structure-based optimization for this class of compounds based upon the crystal structure of Bcl-xL complexed with a potent lead compound. Our efforts accumulated into the design of compound 30 (BM-957), which binds to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL with K(i) < 1 nM and has low nanomolar IC(50) values in cell growth inhibition in cancer cell lines. Significantly, compound 30 achieves rapid, complete, and durable tumor regression in the H146 small-cell lung cancer xenograft model at a well-tolerated dose schedule.
