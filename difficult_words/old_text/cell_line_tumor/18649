The natural ligands recognized by gammadelta TCRs are still largely unknown, in part because immunization does not normally result in Ag-specific gammadelta T cell responses. Taking advantage of an established ligand for a particular gammadelta TCR, we demonstrated that a multimerized recombinant form of this gammadelta TCR can be used like a mAb to specifically detect its own ligand. Using the same approach for more common gammadelta TCRs whose ligands remain unknown, we detected on certain cell lines molecules that appear to be ligands for three additional gammadelta TCRs. One of these represents the mouse Vgamma6/Vdelta1 invariant gammadelta TCR, which predominates in the female reproductive tract, the tongue, and the lung, and other tissues during inflammation. The second represents the closely related Vgamma5/Vdelta1 invariant gammadelta TCR expressed by most epidermal T cells. The third is a Vgamma1/Vdelta6.3 TCR, representative of a variable type frequently found on lymphoid gammadelta T cells. We found evidence that ligands for multiple gammadelta TCRs may be simultaneously expressed on a single cell line, and that at least some of the putative ligands are protease sensitive. This study suggests that soluble versions of gammadelta TCRs can be as tools to identify and characterize the natural ligands of gammadelta T cells.
