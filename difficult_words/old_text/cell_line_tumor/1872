Diallyl disulfide (DADS) has shown potential as a therapeutic agent in various             cancers. Previously, we found that myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl1) was             downregulated in DADS-induced cell cycle arrest in HL-60 human leukemia cells.             Here, we investigated the role of this protein in DADS-induced G2/M cell cycle             arrest in HL-60 cells. We demonstrated that DADS treatment significantly increased             the proportion of G2/M phase HL-60 cells ( p<0.05) and caused a time-dependent             significant downregulation of Mcl1 and the cell cycle-related proteins PCNA and             CDK1 ( p<0.05). Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Mcl1 expression             in HL-60 cells arrested the cell cycle in G2/M phase. By co-immunoprecipitation,             we demonstrated that Mcl1 associated with PCNA and CDK1 in G2/M cell cycle arrest             in DADS-treated HL-60 cells. DADS decreased the interaction of Mcl1 with PCNA             and CDK1, leading to G2/M cell cycle arrest in HL-60 cells. Mcl1 plays an important             role in DADS-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in HL-60 human leukemia cells.
