P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is expressed in a wide range of cell types including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) where it may restrict intracellular accumulation of substrates like antineoplastic agents, HIV protease inhibitors, or rhodamine123. P-gp is known to be located in membrane microdomains, whose structure and function are susceptible to cholesterol alterations. This study evaluated the effect of cholesterol alteration in human PBMCs on P-gp activity. Whereas cholesterol depletion had no effect, cholesterol repletion of depleted cells significantly decreased intracellular rhodamine123 concentrations in lymphocytes to 32.2%+/-2.7 ( p<0.001) and to 41.9%+/-3.5 ( p<0.001) in monocytes. After cholesterol saturation of native cells intracellular rhodamine123 fluorescence decreased to 12.4%+/-1.6 ( p<0.001) in lymphocytes and 12.9%+/-3.5 ( p<0.001) in monocytes. These data demonstrate that elevated cellular cholesterol levels can markedly increase P-gp activity in human PBMCs.
