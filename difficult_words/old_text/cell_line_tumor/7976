New therapeutic approaches are needed for lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Methylating agents constitute a widely used class of anticancer drugs, the effect of which on human non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been adequately studied. N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), a model S(N)1 methylating agent, induced cell death through a distinct mechanism in two human NSCLC cell lines studied, A549(p53(wt)) and H157(p53(null)). In A549(p53(wt)), MNU induced G2/M arrest, accompanied by cdc25A degradation, hnRNP B1 induction, hnRNP C1/C2 downregulation. Non-apoptotic cell death was confirmed by the lack of increase in the sub-G1 DNA content, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase-3, -7 activation. In H157(p53(null)), MNU induced apoptotic cell death, confirmed by cytofluorometry of DNA content and immunodetection of apoptotic markers, accompanied by overexpression of hnRNP B1 and C1/C2. Thus, the mechanism of the cell death induced by S(N)1 methylating agents is cell type-dependent and must be assessed prior treatment.
