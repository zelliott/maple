To determine the expression levels of three metabolic enzymes of fluoropyrimidines: thymidylate synthase (TS), thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) in seven human gastrointestinal cancer cell lines, and to compare the enzyme levels with the sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd).

TS, TP and DPD mRNA levels were assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, TP and DPD protein contents were measured by ELISA. Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations of growth (IC50), representing the sensitivity to drugs, were determined by MTT assay.

IC50 values ranged from 1.28 to 12.26 microM for 5-FU, and from 5.02 to 24.21 microM for FdUrd, respectively. Cell lines with lower DPD mRNA and protein levels tended to be more sensitive to 5-FU ( p<0.05), but neither TS nor TP correlated with 5-FU IC50 (p>0.05). Only TS mRNA level was sharply related with FdUrd sensitivity ( p<0.05), but TP and DPD were not (p>0.05). A correlation was found between mRNA and protein levels of DPD ( p<0.05), but not TP ( p<0.05).

DPD and TS enzyme levels may be useful indicators in predicting the antitumor activity of 5-FU or FdUrd, respectively.
