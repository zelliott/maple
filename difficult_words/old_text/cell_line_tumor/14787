Kindlins are a protein family that regulates cell-matrix interactions. Although kindlin-2 is known to be essential for the early developmental processes, its role in the homeostasis of adult tissues has remained elusive. In this study, we used new domain-specific antibodies and small interfering RNA technology to uncover physiological functions of kindlin-2 in human dermal fibroblasts in vitro and in adult skin in situ. In primary dermal fibroblasts, kindlin-2 is essential for the integrin clustering and activation, and it regulates cell adhesion and directed migration by guiding formation and maturation of focal adhesions (FAs) and organization of the cytoskeleton. These functions are linked to the transmission of mechanical cues between cells and their microenvironment, typically in processes wherein fibroblasts differentiate to myofibroblasts under mechanical tension. In concert, kindlin-2 was shown to be required for the stabilization and maturation of FAs and stress fibers in activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. These findings implicated that in physiological wound closure and tissue repair, the prediction was validated by strong upregulation of kindlin-2 in contractile myofibroblasts during middle stages of wound healing in human skin. Taken together, the data reveal a physiological role for kindlin-2 in skin fibroblasts under normal steady-state conditions and during tissue regeneration.
