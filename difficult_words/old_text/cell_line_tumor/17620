Lactating breast tissue and some breast cancers express the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) and concentrate iodide. We recently demonstrated that all-trans retinoic acid (tRA) induces both NIS gene expression and iodide accumulation in vitro in well-differentiated human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). In the present study, we investigated the in vivo efficacy and specificity of tRA-stimulated iodide accumulation in mouse breast cancer models. Immunodeficient mice with MCF-7 xenograft tumors were treated with systemic tRA for 5 days. Iodide accumulation in the xenograft tumors was markedly increased, approximately 15-fold greater than levels without treatment, and the effects were tRA dose dependent. Iodide accumulation in other organs was not significantly influenced by tRA treatment. Significant induction of NIS mRNA and protein in the xenograft tumors was observed after tRA treatment. Iodide accumulation and NIS mRNA expression were also selectively induced in breast cancer tissues in transgenic mice expressing the oncogene, polyoma virus middle T antigen. These data demonstrate selective induction of functional NIS in breast cancer by tRA. Treatment with short-term systemic retinoic acid, followed by radioiodide administration, is a potential tool in the diagnosis and treatment of some differentiated breast cancer.
