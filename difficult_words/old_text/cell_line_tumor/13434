Cathodic arc deposition technique was used to deposit zirconia (ZrO(2)) films and titania (TiO(2)) films on titanium (Ti) disks respectively. The surface topography was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The element composition of the films was detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The phase of films was identified by thin film X-ray diffraction. The biological behavior of osteoblast-like MG63 cells cultured on Ti, TiO(2) and ZrO(2) was investigated and the possible signaling molecules involved was studied by the gene expressions of integrin β1, extracellular related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and c-fos. The results indicated that both the TiO(2) and ZrO(2) films were amorphous. Scanning electron microscopy study showed that the adhesion of MG63 cells on TiO(2) and ZrO(2) films was significantly enhanced compared to Ti. The CCK8 assay indicated that the TiO(2) and ZrO(2) films promoted the proliferation of MG-63 cells. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity test and the production of type collagen I (COLI) by immunofluorescence showed that both the TiO(2) and ZrO(2) films can enhance ALP activity and COLI expression of MG-63 cells. In addition, the ALP activity on ZrO(2) films was higher than on TiO(2) films at day 4, which indicate ZrO(2) films may lead to promotion of a more osteoblastic phenotype of MG-63 cells than TiO(2) films. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that The gene expression of integrin β1, ERK1/2, and c-fos was higher on TiO(2) and ZrO(2) films than on Ti. The present work suggests that the amorphous ZrO(2) films produced by cathodic arc deposition may be favorable for orthopedic implant applications and worth further study.
