The interaction of cancer within a microenvironment is an important factor determining cancer development. This study analyzed the soluble factors secreted by tumor-associated dendritic cells (TADCs), which are responsible for increasing lung cancer growth, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Addition of amphiregulin, present in large amounts in TADC-conditioned medium (CM), mimicked the inductive effect of TADC-CM on lung cancer progression, supported by the enhancement of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as osteolytic bone metastases phenotypes. In contrast, neutralization of amphiregulin from TADC-CM decreased the advanced malignancy-inductive properties of TADC-CM. Significant upregulation of amphiregulin has been seen in tumor-infiltrating CD11c(+) DCs in human lung cancer samples and patients' sera. The enhancement of amphiregulin in TADCs has also been noted in mice transplanted with lung cancer cells. Induction of lung cancer progression by TADC-derived amphiregulin is associated with increased STAT3 and AKT activation, which subsequently increases the expression of cyclin D, Twist, and Snail. Blocking AKT significantly decreases TADC-CM and amphiregulin-mediated migration by decreasing the upregulation of Snail, whereas inhibition of STAT3 reduced the modulation of TADC-derived amphiregulin on Twist and cyclin D expression, suggesting that cooperation of STAT3 and AKT plays a critical role in TADC-mediated cancer progression. Moreover, mice treated with anti-amphiregulin Abs showed decreased incidence of cancer development and increased survival rates. Our study suggests that inhibition of amphiregulin or amphiregulin-related signaling is an attractive therapeutic target in lung cancer patients.
