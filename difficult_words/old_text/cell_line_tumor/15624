Twenty-one pyridine-2-carboxylate derivatives were prepared by the coupling of 6-formyl-2-carboxylic acid with the corresponding phenol, thiophenol, and aniline, substituted with various functional groups. Among them, the 3,4-dichlorothiophenol ester (9p) showed the highest in vitro telomerase inhibitory activity and quite significant in vivo tumor suppression activity.
