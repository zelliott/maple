Effects of jasplakinolide (JSP), a stabilizer of F-actin, and latrunculin A (LTA), a destabilizer of F-actin, on a series of events occurring in the execution phase of staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptotic processes were studied using human osteosarcoma 143B cells. Time-dependent apparent increases of the population of cells with collapsed membrane potential of mitochondria (Delta Psi(m)) caused by STS treatment were not due to actual decreases in the Delta Psi(m) per cell, but due to the fragmentation of cells resulting in decreases in the number of active mitochondria per cell. Decreases in the Delta Psi(m) in fragmented cells occurred late in the execution phase. Both JSP and LAT failed to prevent STS-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria followed by the activation of caspases 3 and 9, the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and apoptotic nuclear fragmentation. However, both drugs prevented STS-induced apoptotic cell fragmentation and decreases in the Delta Psi(m). These results indicate that physicochemical states of actin filaments play a certain role in the execution phase of STS-induced apoptotic processes.
