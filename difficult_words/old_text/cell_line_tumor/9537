To investigate the effect of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression.

The vector containing short hairpin RNA of iNOS was transfected into Tca8113 cells using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. The gene and protein expression of iNOS and VEGF was examined by RT-PCR and Western blot.

The expression of iNOS, VEGF gene in Tca8113 cells was significantly different between the experimental and control groups 24 h and 48 h after transfection (P < 0.05). The protein expression of iNOS was different between the two groups 36 h and 48 h after transfection, and of VEGF was also different between the two groups 48 h after transfection (P < 0.05).

The expression of VEGF could be down-regulated by silencing the iNOS gene in Tca8113 cells.
