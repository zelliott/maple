Oncogenic ras genes relate to the development of human cancers. In this study, we used a plasmid-mediated short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting N-ras gene to combine with clinical drug vincristine (VCR) for the treatment of human hepatoma cells. Our results showed that anti-N-Ras shRNA expression vector (pCSH1-shNR) knocked down the target mRNA and protein. Higher efficacy on growth inhibition was observed when pCSH1-shNR was combined with VCR. This synergistic effect was associated with abrogation of VCR-induced overexpressions of P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 by pCSH1-shNR through downregulations of N-Ras and total Ras. Western blot analysis showed that pCSH1-shNR-induced downregulations of N-Ras and total Ras were potentiated by VCR. Following Ras downregulation, phosphorylations of ERK1/2 and Akt were dramatically inhibited by combinatory treatment. The data showed that pCSH1-shNR-induced inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB was enhanced by VCR. In addition, the combination of pCSH1-shNR and VCR synergistically inhibited the growth of human hepatoma HepG2 in vivo. Our findings suggested that combination of gene-specific therapeutics and appropriate chemotherapeutic agents might be a promising approach for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma.
