Inhibitors of heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM) cells, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this cytotoxic outcome are not clear. Here, we investigate the effect of IPI-504, a novel and highly soluble inhibitor of the Hsp90 ATPase activity, on the unfolded protein response (UPR) in MM cells. The UPR is a stress response pathway triggered by sensors located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane whose function is to reduce an excessive accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER. During normal development of B-lymphocytes to antibody-producing plasma cells, a partial UPR has been described, where IREalpha and ATF-6 are stimulated, whereas the third sensor, PERK, is not induced.

Levels of the activated forms of the three main UPR sensors ATF-6, XBP-1 and PERK/eIF-2 were monitored in two different MM cells lines and one non-MM cell lines under various experimental conditions including incubation with increasing concentration of IPI-504. Also, MM cells were incubated with IPI-504 and several apoptosis markers were monitored.

We show here that a partial UPR is constitutively activated in plasma cell-derived MM cells and that IPI-504 can potently inhibit this pathway. IPI-504 achieves this by inactivating the transcription factors XBP1 and ATF6. In addition, IPI-504 also blocks the tunicamycin-induced phosphorylation of eIF2 by PERK. Dose-response and time course experiments reveal that IPI-504's inhibitory effect on the UPR parallels its cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects on MM cells.

The results presented here suggest that the IPI-504-induced apoptosis might be, in part, mediated by the inhibition of the partial UPR. Other malignancies that rely on intact and efficient UPR to survive could be considered as new indications for Hsp90 inhibitors.
