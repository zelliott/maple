Integrins are essential protagonists in the complex multistep process of cancer progression and metastasis. We recently reported that lebectin, a novel C-type lectin from Macrovipera lebetina venom, displays an anti-integrin activity. In this study, we extend this observation to lebecetin, a second C-type lectin isolated from the same venom and previously reported as a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Both venom lectins appear to exert their effect on cell adhesion, migration, invasion and proliferation by inhibiting alpha5beta1 and alphav-containing integrins. Moreover, the inhibition of alpha5beta1 and alphav integrins is likely due to the binding of venom peptides, as both lebectin and lebecetin co-immunoprecipitate with these integrins. Lebectin and lebecetin are thus the first examples of venom C-type lectins inhibiting an integrin other than the collagen receptor alpha2beta1.
