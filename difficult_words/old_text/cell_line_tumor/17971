Peroxynitrite, via post-translational modifications to target proteins, contributes to cardiovascular injury and cancer. Since tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-4 (TIMP-4), the activity of which is impaired in both pathological conditions, has several amino acid residues susceptible to peroxynitrite, we investigated its role as a potential target of peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite-induced nitration and oligomerization of TIMP-4 attenuated its inhibitory activity against MMP-2 activity and endothelial or tumor cell invasiveness. Moreover, cell treatment with peroxynitrite promoted the nitration of endogenous TIMP-4. HPLC/ESI-MS/MS analysis of peroxynitrite-treated TIMP-4 showed modifications at Y114, Y195, Y188 and Y190. In conclusion, TIMP-4 nitration might be a potential mechanism contributing to cardiovascular disease and cancer.
