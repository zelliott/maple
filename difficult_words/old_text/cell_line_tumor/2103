To investigate the effects of cis-combretastatin-A1 phosphate (cis-CA1P) on tumor cell proliferation, and its effects on the blood vessel formations.

MTT and IC50 values were used to assess the inhibitory effects of cis-CA1P on tumor cell proliferation. Chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane and thoracic aorta annulations isolated from rats were used to investigate the effects of cis-CAIP on the blood vessel formation.

Cis-CA1P concentration-dependently inhibited the proliferations of several cancer cell lines, including human gastric carcinoma cell line MGC-803, human leukemic monocyte lymphoma cell line U937, human melanoma cell line A375, human colon cancer cell line HCT116, human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231, and human leukemia cell line K562. Cis-CAIP significantly decreased the formation of blood vessels in chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane and in thoracic aorta annulations.

Cis-CA1P inhibits cancer cell proliferation and prevents blood vessel formation.
