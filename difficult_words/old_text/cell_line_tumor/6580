The transduction efficiency of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors in various somatic tissues is determined primarily by the viral capsid proteins. In contrast to vectors made with AAV type 2 capsids, those having type 5 or 6 capsids show high transduction rates in airway epithelial cells, in a range that should be sufficient for treating lung disease. Here we have compared the properties of vectors made with AAV5 or AAV6 capsid proteins to determine whether their receptor usage is similar, and found several differences between the viruses. First, an AAV6 vector did not hemagglutinate red blood cells, whereas an AAV5 vector did, and this property was sialic acid dependent. Second, AAV5 vector transduction required sialic acid in all cells tested, whereas AAV6 vector transduction was sialic acid dependent or independent, depending on the target cells tested. Third, levels of an AAV6 vector that interfered with entry of another AAV6 vector only poorly inhibited AAV5 vector transduction and vice versa. These results indicate that AAV5 and AAV6 vectors use distinct cellular receptors for cell entry. Although both AAV5 and AAV6 vectors exhibited high transduction rates in well-differentiated human airway epithelial cultures, they exhibited distinct cell-type transduction profiles in mouse lung that may reflect differences in receptor usage.
