High continuous hydrostatic pressure has been shown to affect many cellular functions within the pressurised cells, for instance, accumulation of heat shock protein 70 occurs during pressurisation. Various signal transduction pathways are likely to mediate these changes, however, at the present time our knowledge of the pathways involved is rather limited. The aim of this study was to investigate whether some of the well known transduction pathways are activated by the exposure of human chondrosarcoma cells to 15-30 MPa hydrostatic pressure. The results showed an increased presence of the active, phosphorylated forms of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in cells exposed to 15 and 30 MPa continuous hydrostatic pressure, while 0.5 Hz cyclic loading had weaker effects. Inhibition of ERK-pathway with UO126 did not prevent the accumulation of heat shock protein 70. No activation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) or p38 could be noticed in pressurised cells. In conclusion, we could identify at least two different signal transduction pathways that are activated under high continuous hydrostatic pressure. Accumulation of heat shock protein 70 was independent of ERK-activation.
