To study melanoma cell fusion and find a highly efficient fusion method for tumor cells.

Melanoma cells were labeled with green fluorescent protein and red fluorescent protein, respectively, and fused by a modified phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-ECM830 fusion method. Melanoma fusion cells were selected by the fluorescence activated cell sorting. DNA content was determined by propidium iodide staining.

Melanoma cells were labeled with green fluorescent protein and red fluorescent protein markers and successfully fused through PHA-ECM830 fusion method. The fusion efficiency (7.18%) was much higher compared with ECM830 electricfusion method (0.50%). Melanoma fusion cells were successfully obtained by the fluorescence activated cell sorting.DNA content was doubled in melanoma fusion cells compared to B16-F10 melanoma cells. The proliferation rate of melanoma fusion cells was significantly decreased in vitro and in vivo.

We successfully obtained the melanoma fusion cells by the improved PHA-ECM830 fusion method. The proliferation rate of melanoma fusion cells dramatically decreases.
