It is unclear whether the two enantiomeric forms (R & S) of lipoic acid (LA) share similar pharmacological activity and the exact cellular targets of LA are not well identified. We oxidatively stressed 3 cell culture systems representing different cell types. Mitochondrial metabolism was the primary endpoint. When C6 glioma was damaged by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), all forms of LA protected. Racemic and S-LA were less effective than the R-isomer that was also protective in tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-damaged C6 glioma. In PC12 cells, little damage was produced by TBHP; R-LA increased mitochondrial metabolism above the level of non-damaged control. In H2O2 damaged PC12 cells, R-LA and racemic LA (but not S-LA) not only protected against damage, but increased mitochondrial metabolism above the non-damaged control level. When BAE cells were damaged with H2O2, R- and racemic LA protected while S-LA was ineffective.
