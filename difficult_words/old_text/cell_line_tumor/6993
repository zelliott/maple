A functional relationship between the apoptotic endonuclease DNAS1L3 and the chemotherapeutic drug VP-16 was established. The lymphoma cell line, Daudi, exhibited a significant resistance to VP-16 treatment in comparison to the lymphoma/leukemia cell line, U-937. While U-937 cells degraded their DNA into internucleosomal fragments, Daudi cells failed to undergo such fragmentation in response to the drug. Activation of both caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation factor was not sufficient to trigger internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in Daudi cells. No correlation was found between expression levels of topoisomerase-II, Pgp, Bcl-2, Bax, or Bad and decreased sensitivity of Daudi cells to VP-16. Daudi cells failed to express DNAS1L3 and ectopic expression of this protein significantly sensitized the cells to VP-16. An enhancement of caspase-3 activity and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential underlie DNAS1L3-mediated sensitization of Daudi cells to VP-16, which may be a direct result of DNAS1L3-mediated increase in PARP-1-activating DNA breaks after VP-16 treatment. Our results suggest that DNAS1L3 plays an active role in lymphoma cell sensitization to VP-16 and that its deficiency may constitute a novel mechanism of drug resistance in these cells.
