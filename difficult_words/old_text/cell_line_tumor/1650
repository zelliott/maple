The crude methanolic extract obtained from C. erythraea resin was chromatographed on silica gel with solvent of increasing polarity. The extract and fractions were evaluated for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity [parainfluenza type 3 virus (PIV3)] by plaque forming units (PFU) reduction assay using HEp-2 cells (human larynx epidermoid carcinoma cell line). From the active fraction, five compounds were isolated and tested. Only two of these showed anti-PIV3 activity with a selectivity index (SI) of 66.6 and 17.5, respectively. Both the compounds are furanosesquiterpenoids.
