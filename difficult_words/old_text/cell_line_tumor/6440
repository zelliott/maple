Cancer stem cells have been isolated from various types of cancer including leukemia and solid tumors. However, the methods for isolating gastric cancer stem-like cells (GCSCs) have not been well established. As a consequence, the biological behavior and the significance of these cells to cancer progression remains to be clarified. In this study, we isolated and characterized GCSCs from a gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 and found their enhanced capabilities of invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. We further studied the expression of molecules related to epithelial-mesenchymal and invasion in GCSCs and found there were decreased E-cadherin, but increased vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), in these cells. Our results suggest that decreased E-cadherin and increased MMP-2 may be associated with the capacity of GCSCs to metastasize.
