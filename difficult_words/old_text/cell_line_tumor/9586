We previously reported that overexpressing connexin 26 (Cx26) enhances the spontaneous metastasis of mouse BL6 melanoma cells. In contrast, daily intraperitoneal injections of an oleamide derivative named MI-18 potently inhibits the spontaneous metastasis of BL6 cells. In the present study, we chemically synthesized a novel oleamide derivative named MI-22 and found that it also efficiently suppressed the spontaneous metastasis of BL6 cells. Both MI-18 and MI-22 inhibited the gap junction-mediated intercellular communications (GJIC) that are formed between HeLa cells by the ectopic expression of the hCx26 and hCx32 human connexin subtypes; however, they had no effect on GJIC mediated by hCx40, hCx43 or hCx45. Fluorescently labeled MI-18 primarily localized not only at plasma membrane but also at Golgi/endosome. This suggests that this oleamide derivative may also act on the Cx26 molecules that accumulate in the Golgi/endosome because of their overexpression. Notably, neither derivative had a cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells when they were added into the tissue culture medium. Taken together, we propose that the MI-18 and MI-22 oleamide derivatives may serve as prototypes for novel and clinically important anticancer drugs.
