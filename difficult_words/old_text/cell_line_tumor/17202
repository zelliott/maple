p51/p63, a member of the p53 gene family, is structurally conserved among a wide range of organisms, although the transactivator (TA) and N-terminally truncated (deltaN) isotype producing property seems to vary. Since p51/p63 is thought to play important roles in skin, limb, and craniofacial development in mammals, we examined Xenopus laevis larval and adult tissues for expression of p51/p63. Temporal analyses indicated enhanced transcription of the deltaN form of p51/p63 in premetamorphosis phase (at stage 44-48). p51/p63-positive cells in the inner layer of larval skin expanded to the suprabasal layers during the stratification. The epithelium of limb buds and the maxillofacial ectodermal tissues in tadpoles had a high level expression of p51/p63. The cloned deltaN-A/gamma type Xenopus p51/p63 exhibited a dominant-negative activity against the human TA-A/gamma isotype in a reporter assay. These results suggest that tissue-specific p51/p63-inducing mechanism and isotype-specific transcriptional regulator activities of p51/p63 are conserved between mammals and frogs.
