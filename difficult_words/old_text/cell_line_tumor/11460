A BODIPY-based fluorescent probe integrated with an aldoxime unit shows a remarkable fluorescence ''turn-on'' response to hypochlorous acid (HOCl). The oxidative dehydrogenation of BODIPY aldoxime by HOCl results in a distinct fluorescence enhancement as well as a change in color from red to orange.
