A biologically active quinone that exhibits a growth-inhibitory effect on rat liver cancer cells was isolated from the nest of a social wasp, Vespa simillima (Vespinae, Vespidae). The structure was unambiguously determined by NMR and synthetic experiments and identified as being 7,8-seco-para-ferruginone. The synthetic quinone showed potent growth-inhibitory effects on rat hepatoma cells (IC50 value=1.9 microM). Morphological analyses of dRLh84 cells using the synthetic compound were tested. Chromatin coagulation was induced by the synthetic compound at 31.6 muM.
