To study the activities of matrine and anti-tumor drugs on SPCA/I human lung adenocarcinoma cell line.

Suppression effects of different concentrations of matrine and matrine combined with anti-tumor drugs on lung cancer cells were measured by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric assay.

Different concentrations of matrine could inhibit the growth of SPCA/I human lung adenocarcinoma cells and there was a positive correlation between the inhibition rate and the drug concentration. Different concentrations of matrine combined with anti-tumor drugs had higher growth inhibition rate than anti-tumor drugs alone.

Matrine has direct growth suppression effect on SPCA/I human lung adenocarcinoma cells and matrine combined with anti-tumor drugs shows a significant synergistic effect on tumor cells.
