Cellular protrusions involved in motile processes are driven by site-directed assembly of actin filaments in response to Rho-GTPase signalling. So far, only chemical compounds depolymerizing actin or stabilizing filaments, inhibiting N-WASP, Arp2/3 or formins, have been used to eliminate the formation of protrusions, while Rho-GTPase-dominant positive strategies have been designed to stimulate protrusions. Here we describe the design of four polyamines (macrocyclic and branched acyclic), and show that they enter the cell and induce specific growth of actin-enriched lamellipodia within minutes. The largest increase in cell area is obtained with micromolar amounts of a branched polyamine harbouring an 8-carbon chain. These polyamines specifically target actin both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of their effects on filament assembly dynamics and its regulation indicates that the polyamines act by slowing down filament dynamics and by enhancing actin nucleation. These compounds provide new opportunities to study the actin cytoskeleton in motile and morphogenetic processes.
