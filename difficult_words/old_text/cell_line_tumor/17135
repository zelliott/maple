A systematic study on intracellular Pt uptake and Pt accumulation ratio in breast cancer MCF-7 cell line has been performed on a number of Pt(II)-complexes, namely cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, clinically employed as antitumor drugs, trans- and cis-[Pt(Cl)2(pyridine)2] and cis-[Pt(Cl)2(pyridine)(5-SO3H-isoquinoline)] complexes, previously investigated also as potential telomerase inhibitors. In particular, long incubation times have been chosen in order to understand the fate of the complexes in the cells. For this purpose, sub-acute drug concentrations must be employed and, therefore, a very sensitive method of analysis like as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) superior to the widely employed atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) has been adopted. Any relationships among uptake/accumulation and several parameters such as drug structure, lipophilicity, drug concentration and incubation time have been sought and analyzed: the bulk of data point for a passive diffusion mechanism through the cell membrane.
