Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMA) and malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) have a frequent metastatic spread and a poor prognosis. Aberrant miRNA expression is often found in metastatic tumors. The aim of this study was to identify specific miRNA expression patterns in these tumors. We analyzed the expression of miRNAs in RMA and MRT in tissue samples and in the rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell lines (Rh30 and RD). Selected target miRNAs were modulated with mimic or inhibitor oligonucleotides. Functional analysis was monitored by flow cytometry and migration assays. A set of 107 differentially expressed miRNAs showed tissue-specific clustering of RMA and MRT. Comparison with the Sarcoma microRNA Expression Database revealed RMA- and MRT-specific miRNAs. Metastatic invasion associated miRNA miR-9 was overexpressed in RMA. miR-200c-inhibiting migration-was lower expressed in RMA than in MRT. Transient transfection of RMS cells with a miR-200c mimic and miR-9( inhibitor did neither increase the expression of the known target E-cadherin nor decrease migration. Expression of E-cadherin could be induced in RD cells using decitabine, but demethylation did not influence cell migration. Despite a comparable high rate of metastatic invasion pediatric RMA and MRT show a different pattern of miRNA expression possibly allowing risk stratification.
