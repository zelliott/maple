To investigate the effect of decorin (DCN) gene transfection on the growth of nude mice xenograft bearing human gastric carcinoma cell SGC-7901 and study the possible mechanism.

Gastric carcinoma xenograft model was established in nude mice. Recombinant plasmid pEGFP-N1-DCN was injected to the center and bottom of the carcinoma;  meanwhile,  the empty plasmid or physiological saline was injected in the other models as controls. We monitored the changes of carcinoma volume and weight,  detected the expression of DCN by RT-PCR and Western blotting,  the expressions of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9)  by Western blotting,  and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by immunohistochemistry.

Gastric carcinoma xenograft models were constructed successfully in nude mice. Compared with the control groups,  slower growth speed,  smaller volume and lighter weight were found in recombinant plasmid group ( p<0.05). RT-PCR showed that the expression of DCN gene in recombinant plasmid group was significantly higher than that in the control groups ( p<0.05);  Western blotting indicated the expression of fusion protein in recombinant plasmid group;  Western blotting also showed that the expressions of TGF-β1 and MMP-9 protein were lower in recombinant plasmid group than in the control groups ( p<0.05);  immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of VEGF was down-regulated in recombinant plasmid group ( p<0.05).

DCN gene can inhibit the growth of nude mice xenograft,  which is probably related with the decreased expressions of TGF-β1 and MMP-9 protein and the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.
