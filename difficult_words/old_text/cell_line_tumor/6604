Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy characterised by the accumulation of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Different reports indicate the expression of CD44 variant isoforms (CD44v) by MM cells. Osteopontin (OPN), which is expressed by MM cells, is known to be a ligand for CD44v6. In this study, we investigated the role of OPN with emphasis on a functional correlation between OPN and CD44v in the 5T33MM model. Our group reported the expression of CD44v by 5T33MM cells. Using this model, we have demonstrated the secretion of OPN by 5T33MM cells. OPN affected 5T33MM cell survival by increasing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. OPN also stimulated 5T33MM cell migration, transendothelial migration and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity. We confirmed the proliferative and migratory effects of OPN on human MM cells. By applying inhibiting anti-CD44v6 antibodies, we found that OPN stimulated cell proliferation by engaging this isoform. Anti-CD44v antibodies and RGD peptides both inhibited cell migration, suggesting an involvement of both, CD44v isoforms and integrins. In conclusion, OPN may act as a mediator of MM cell survival by engaging CD44v. The protein is further involved in migration and invasion of MM cells through the activation of either alphavbeta3 integrin or CD44v isoforms.
