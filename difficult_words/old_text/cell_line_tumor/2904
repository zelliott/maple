Two 11(15-->1)abeotaxanes having a tetrahydrofuran ring along the carbon atoms C-2, C-3, C-4, C-20 were identified for the first time from the needles of the Canadian yew, Taxus canadensis. The compounds could be identified as 4alpha,10beta,13alpha-triacetoxy-15-benzoyloxy-2alpha,20beta-epoxy-11(15-->1)abeotax-11-ene-5alpha,7beta,9alpha-triol (1) and 4alpha,7beta,9alpha,10beta,15-pentaacetoxy-2alpha,20beta-epoxy-11(15-->1)abeotax-11-ene-5alpha,13alpha-diol (2) on the basis of 1D-, 2D-NMR evidence and high-resolution FABMS analysis. Compound 1 showed weak growth inhibitory activities against T-98 and MM1-CB cells in vitro.
