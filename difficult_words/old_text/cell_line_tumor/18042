Antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis B remains a major clinical problem worldwide. Like lamivudine, nucleoside analogs have become the focus of investigation of anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBV) drugs. Here, beta-LPA is a novel 2,6-diaminopurine analog found to possess potent anti-HBV activity. In HepG2.2.15 cell line, beta-LPA had a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 0.01 microM against HBV, as determined by analysis of secreted and intracellular episomal HBV DNA. Levels of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and e antigen (HBeAg) in drug-treated cultures revealed that beta-LPA had no significant inhibitory effects on HBsAg and HBeAg. beta-LPA didn't show any cytotoxicity up to 0.4 microM with a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) of 50 microM. Furthermore, treatment with beta-LPA resulted in no apparent inhibitory effects on mitochondrial DNA content. Considering the potent inhibition of HBV DNA synthesis and no obvious toxicity of beta-LPA, this compound should be further explored for development as an anti-HBV drug.
