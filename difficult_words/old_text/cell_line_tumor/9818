A series of COX-2 selective inhibitor nimesulide derivatives were synthesized. Their anti-cell proliferation activities were evaluated with a long-term estrogen deprived MCF-7aro (LTEDaro) breast cancer cell line, which is the biological model of aromatase inhibitor resistance for hormone-dependent breast cancer. Compared to nimesulide which inhibited LTEDaro cell proliferation with an IC(50) at 170.30 microM, several new compounds showed IC(50) close to 1.0 microM.
