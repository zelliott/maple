Polymer scaffolds which can support cells to grow as well as deliver growth factors to the cells simultaneously have great potential for the successful regeneration of failed tissues. As popularly used vehicles to deliver anti-cancer drugs and growth factors, microspheres also show many advantages as substrates to guide the growth of cells. Therefore, we aimed to examine the feasibility of using microspheres as ideal scaffolds for liver tissue engineering. To determine the capabilities of previously used microsphere scaffold to deliver growth factors simultaneously, this work investigated a long-term (about three months) release of bovine serum albumin (BSA) from microsphere scaffolds fabricated by using two different polymers, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV, 8% PHV), poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA, 5050) and a blend of PLGA and PHBV. BSA served as a model for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) since both proteins have similar molecular weights and hydrophilicity. Furthermore, HGF was encapsulated into the PLGA/PHBV composite microsphere with a core-shell structure, and sustained delivery of HGF with maintained bioactivity was achieved for at least 40 days. The moderate degradation rate (about 55% loss of the initial mass) and well-preserved structure after three months of incubation indicated that the PLGA/PHBV composite microspheres would therefore be more suitable than the pure PHBV or PLGA microspheres as a scaffold for engineering liver tissue.
