The crude extracts of the leaves of Dodonaea viscosa and Rumex nervosus as well as of the root of Rumex abyssinicus were tested for anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities. It was observed that the three plants possess antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus and strong activity against Coxsackie virus B3 and influenza A virus. In contrast, none of them exhibited anti-fungal activity. The anti-inflammatory activity test results verified that only R. abyssinicus inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) E(2).
