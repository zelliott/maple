The chromatographic separation of the MeOH extract of the aerial parts of Solidago virga-aurea var. gigantea M(IQ) (Compositae) led to the isolation of six terpenoids and four phenolic compounds, trans-phytol (1), ent-germacra-4(15),5,10(14)-trien-1alpha-ol (2), beta-amyrin acetate (3), ent-germacra-4(15),5,10(14)-trien-1beta-ol (4), beta-dictyopterol (5), oleanolic acid (6), kaempferol (7), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (8), methyl 3,5-di-O-caffeoyl quinate (9), and 3,5-di-O-caffeoyl quinic acid (10). Their structures were established by chemical and spectroscopic methods. Compounds 4, 5, and 10 showed moderate cytotoxicity against five cultured human tumor cell lines in vitro with its ED50 values ranging from 1.52 to approximately 18.57 microg/mL.
