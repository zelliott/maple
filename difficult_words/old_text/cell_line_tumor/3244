1,4-Naphthoquinones have already been recognized to possess a wide range of biological activities. We have developed quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) for different series of 2- or 6-substituted-5,8-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinones to understand the chemical-biological interaction governing antiproliferative/cytotoxic activities against L1210 cells. QSAR results have shown that these activities of 2- or 6-substituted-5,8-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinones depend largely on their hydrophobicity.
