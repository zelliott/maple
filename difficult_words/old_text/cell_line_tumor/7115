The synthesis of several acridine thioethers is described. These compounds were oxidized to give new sulfoxides and sulfones. Among 23 compounds prepared, 19 were tested in vitro against the human cancer cell lines panel of NCI screening. Activity is increased 5-10 times from sulfides to sulfoxides. Among substituted groups in the side chain, sulfur mustard, epoxy sulfide and sulfoxide displayed the most interesting activity.
