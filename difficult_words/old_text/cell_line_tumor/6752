We report the feasibility of monitoring both hemoglobin oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration in the superficial layer of tissue using polarization-gated elastic light-scattering spectroscopy. We detail our analysis technique, the experimental validation of our analysis, and the detection of an early increase in blood supply to the superficial layer of colon tissue in human patients with colonic adenomas as well as in an animal model of colon carcinogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first evidence that polarization gating can be used as a spectroscopic tool to quantify hemoglobin concentration as well as oxygen saturation in the uppermost tissue layer.
