The Tibetan herb Potentilla anserina L. has been widely used in China for many thousands of years to treat hepatitis-B. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethanol extract of the rhizomes led to the isolation of a triterpenoid saponin (TS) that was determined to be 2alpha,3beta,19alpha-trihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester. Using models of HBV infection, this compound was evaluated for its effect on HBV antigene expression in the 2.2.15 cell line in vitro and anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activities in Peking ducklings in vivo. Results showed that it could decrease the expression levels of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBVDNA in the 2.2.15 cell culture and the inhibitory effect was not due to the cytotoxity of the triterpenoid saponin. The antiviral study in vivo on Peking ducklings also demonstrated that this compound inhibits duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) DNA replication.
