The SR-related-CTD-associated-factors (SCAFs) have the ability to interact with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II, linking this way transcription to splicing. SRA1 (SR-A1) gene, encoding for a human high-molecular weight SCAF protein, is located on chromosome 19, between the IRF3 and the R-RAS oncogene and it has been demonstrated from members of our group that SRA1 is constitutively expressed in most of the human tissues, while it is overexpressed in a subset of ovarian tumors. In this study, we examine the expression of SRA1 gene in 111 ovarian malignant tissues and in the human ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3, TOV21-G, and ES-2, using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR method. SRA1 gene was overexpressed in 61/111 (55%) of ovarian carcinomas. This higher expression was positively associated to the size of the tumor ( p<0.001), the grade and the stage of the disease (p=0.003 and p=0.006, respectively), and the debulking success ( p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that lower SRA1 expression increases the probability of both the longer overall and the progression free survival of the patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that SRA1 may be used as an independent prognostic biomarker in ovarian cancer. Our results suggest that SRA1 is associated with cancer progression and may possibly be characterized as a new marker of unfavorable prognosis for ovarian cancer.
