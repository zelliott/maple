The design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel series of oxazinyl isoflavonoids is described. Several analogs were shown to exhibit growth inhibitory effects against SKOV-3, DU-145 and HL-60 human colon cancer cell lines with IC(50) values in the micromolar range. The cellular potency of compounds 7e and 12h were found to have greater in vitro inhibitory activities than phenoxodiol, the parental compound currently in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. The results shown are suitable for further lead optimization.
