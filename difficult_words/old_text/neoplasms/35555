Coagulation factor V (FV) is an essential component of the prothrombinase complex, which activates the zymogen prothrombin to thrombin. Acquired FV inhibitor is rare and clinical symptoms are quite variable. The aim of this study was to summarize the spectrum of the bleeding presentation of acquired FV deficiency and characterize the underlying causes of the clinical symptoms. This study was designed as a descriptive retrospective and 30 case reports were included for further analysis. At least 33 cases of acquired FV inhibitor were investigated. Most patients have a presentation of bleeding and most of those are from hematuria and bleeding at surgical sites. Seven cases of asymptomatic acquired FV inhibitor were also detected. A total of 39.4% (19 of 33) of those cases with acquired FV inhibitor have an unknown cause. For those with known etiologies, chemical and drug-induced causes are the most common (30.8%).
