Cancer mortality was studied among 265 male workers in 40 small plating factories (chromium, copper and nickel) where bicycle parts are plated. The study utilized record linkage with the Osaka Cancer Registry file between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1979. The results showed that seven workers had died of cancer, and the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) calculated for all cancers, stomach cancer and lung cancer were 1.13, 1.23 and 1.11, respectively, with no significant relationship found between the observed and expected values. The SMR for lung cancer among those workers with a high degree of skin ulceration and with perforation of the nasal septum was high, 11.22 and 5.13, respectively, although not statistically significant because of the small sample size in the study. The results suggest that lung cancer occurs in those subjected to a high degree of exposure to chromium.
