Rapid and effective differentiation between normal and cancer cells is an important challenge for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. Here, we describe an array-based system for identification of normal and cancer cells based on a "chemical nose/tongue" approach that exploits subtle changes in the physicochemical nature of different cell surfaces. Their differential interactions with functionalized nanoparticles are transduced through displacement of a multivalent polymer fluorophore that is quenched when bound to the particle and fluorescent after release. Using this sensing strategy we can rapidly (minutes/seconds) and effectively distinguish (i) different cell types; (ii) normal, cancerous and metastatic human breast cells; and (iii) isogenic normal, cancerous and metastatic murine epithelial cell lines.
