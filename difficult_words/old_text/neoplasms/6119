Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24) suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in a broad range of human cancers without significant cytotoxicity to normal cells. Conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAds) not only have the ability to destroy cancer cells but may also be potential vectors for the expression of therapeutic genes.

This review provides an overview of specifications for a novel anti-tumor approach CRAds carrying IL-24, and discusses recent progress in this field.

Studies in multiple laboratories report that CRAds carrying IL-24 selectively induced apoptosis in some cancer cells, and enhanced selective toxicity to cancer cells when combined with chemotherapeutic agents.

CRAds carrying IL-24 may prove a novel and effective approach for the treatment of cancers.
