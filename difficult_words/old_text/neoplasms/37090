We compared the use of sedation for helical CT examination of pediatric patients with that for conventional CT studies.

We retrospectively compared two 4-month periods of CT examinations that differed only in that conventional CT was routinely used in one period and helical CT was exclusively used in the other period. For these two periods, we compared the type and number of CT examinations, the sedation used (if any), and the age of patients who required sedation.

We performed 1055 conventional CT examinations in 762 pediatric cancer patients. Of the 264 children who were 8 years old or younger, 107 had been sedated. In comparison, 1195 helical CT examinations were performed on 838 patients: of the 246 children 8 years old or younger, 51 received sedation. For both study groups, the mean and median age of the patients was 4 years old. The mean age of patients requiring sedation was 21 (conventional CT) or 20 months (helical CT); the median age of patients who required sedation was 2 years old for both study groups. Patients who were 8 years old or younger and who underwent helical CT required sedation 49% less frequently than such patients who underwent conventional CT. The most dramatic reduction occurred among patients who were 3 years old or younger (p &lt; or = .004).

Use of helical CT reduced the need for sedation among our pediatric patients. Fewer sedations may reduce the risk of complications, decrease disruption of the patient's normal daily activities, and improve patient throughout. The associated savings in personnel time and pharmaceutical costs can be redistributed.
