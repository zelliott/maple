Immunohistochemical (IHC) examination is frequently necessary for a histological differential diagnosis of tumors. To simplify IHC examination, we have developed a novel device called a "multiplex-immunostain chip (MI chip)." The chip is a panel of antibodies contained in a silicon rubber plate that consists of 50 2-mm-diameter wells. A tissue section slide is placed on the plate and is fastened tightly with a specially designed clamp. The plate with the slide is then turned upside down, which applies the antibodies to the section. This technology allows IHC staining of a tissue section with 50 different antibodies in a single experiment, reducing the time, effort, and expense of IHC analysis. In addition, it enables pathologists to compare expression of multiple antigens on a tissue section simply by changing microscopic fields on a single slide. These features are unique to the MI chip technology. The method requires no expensive instruments. This device can be used in various applications in differential diagnosis of tumors and the field of cell biology.
