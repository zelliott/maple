Nursing home care for terminally ill cancer patients was organized according to nursing care plans that were based on diagnoses as recommended by the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA). This study was carried out among a sample of 40 patients receiving home health care for a period of 1 to 19 weeks. More than 697 nursing diagnoses were identified in the study. The most frequently recorded nursing diagnoses were anxiety, constipation, and diminished food intake. Fifteen of the 40 patients in the study were able to complete a weekly self-report of their symptoms. The patients' own descriptions of their symptoms were then compared with their symptoms as identified by nursing staff. There was a congruence in 63% of reported instances. Although nurses' assessments were not always in agreement with the symptoms reported by the patients, agreement was more frequently found with somatic symptoms than with psychological ones. One conclusion is that nursing plans should incorporate multidimensional methods for assessing patients' real needs.
