Green tea catechins have been extensively studied for their cancer preventive effects. Accumulating evidence has shown that green tea catechins, like (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, have strong anti-oxidant activity and affect several signal transduction pathways relevant to cancer development. Here, we review the biological properties of green tea catechins and the molecular mechanisms of their anticancer effects, including the suppression of cancer cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. We summarize the efficacy of a single catechin and the synergetic effects of multiple catechins. We also discuss the enhanced anticancer effects of green tea catechins when they are combined with anticancer drugs. The information present in this review might promote the development of strategy for the co-administration of green tea catechins with other anticancer drugs to increase the potency of currently available anticancer medicine. This new strategy should in turn lower the cytotoxicity and cost of anticancer treatment.
