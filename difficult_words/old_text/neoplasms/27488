The organization and replication of DNA render fragile sites (FSs) prone to breakage, recombination as well as becoming preferential targets for mutagens-carcinogens and integration of oncogenic viruses. For many years, attempts to link FSs and cancer generated mostly circumstantial evidence. The discoveries that chromosome translocations, amplification of proto-oncogenes, deletion of tumor suppressor genes, and integration of oncogenic viruses all result from the specific breakage of genomic DNA at FSs, however, have provided compelling support for such a link, further suggesting a causative role for FSs in cancer.
