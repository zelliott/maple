Immunoreactivity of human tissue mast cells (TMCs) was studied in one case of solitary mastocytoma of the skin, three cases of malignant mastocytosis, and in six lymph nodes with reactive intrasinusoidal increase of TMCs. Immunohistochemically, TMCs reacted positively to antisera against vimentin, common leukocyte antigen (CLA), lysozyme, alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT), and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (alpha 1-ACT) and to a monoclonal antibody (KiB3) that detects preferentially B-lymphocytes. Additionally, strong positive reactions to polyclonal antisera against adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and human peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI) and weaker reactions to antisera against leu-enkephalin and met-enkephalin were observed; all other antisera tested yielded negative results. Positive stainings for vimentin, CLA, alpha 1-AT, alpha 1-ACT, and lysozyme further support the hypothesis that human TMCs may be related to the myeloid-monocytic system. The positive reactivity of TMCs to antisera against ACTH, PHI, leu-enkephalin, and met-enkephalin has not been reported previously. These findings suggest that TMCs are able to store and/or produce regulatory peptides in addition to many other well-known, granule-bound mediators.
