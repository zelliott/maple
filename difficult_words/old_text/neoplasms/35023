The results of block model calculations for multiple discretizations of a dielectric sphere and circular cylinder suggest that it is essential that the cells must be arranged for a best-fit of the body being modeled, the matrix elements must be reasonably accurate, and the cells must be small enough so that the pulse-function basis approximation is not blatantly unreasonable. When these criteria are approximately satisfied the remaining errors appear to be mainly due to imperfect representation of the shape of the object being modeled. It appears that the accuracy can be improved by using discretizations having cells of reduced size near the surface of the object. Geometric factors are defined which allow testing the potential accuracy of a solution without dimensioning or inverting a large matrix. Several unique procedures for discretization are also described that have the potential of partially mitigating the errors due to inaccurate representation of the shape of a scatterer.
