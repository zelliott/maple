In total, 132 cancer patients in four oncology outpatient clinics in Hamburg completed a questionnaire consisting of a newly designed instrument for measuring psychosocial support. In this questionnaire, patients were asked about their knowledge of institutions offering support, their previous participation in psychosocial support, the reasons for participation and their experience with and attitude towards it. A second section consisted of standardized instruments: the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire (Aaronson), the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis and Melisaratos), the List of Physical Complaints (von Zerssen and Koller) and the Impact of Event Scale (Horowitz). Descriptive and variance-analytical methods were used for the analysis of results. Most respondents were women (88%). The largest group (72%) had a history of breast cancer. A total of 28% of the patients in the sample had participated in psychosocial support, about 4% of these in self-help groups. Participants in psychosocial support did not differ from non-participants in gender, but they were significantly younger. They showed considerably higher scores in emotional and physical distress than non-participants, their attitude towards psychosocial support was more positive, and they had more knowledge about institutions offering support than non-participants. The main reasons listed for their participation in psychosocial support were mental distress, a desire to obtain help, and the wish to cope with the illness. The main reason for not participating was sufficient support from the family, friends or doctors.
