Attenuated Salmonella induce immunosuppressive, microbicidal and tumoricidal macrophages in mice. All three effects are mediated by activated macrophages producing nitric oxide (NO). NO is induced by the innate immune response pathway involving IL-12, NK cells and IFN-gamma in response to infection. NO has beneficial and detrimental effects on the host.
