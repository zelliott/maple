This paper presents a mixed model of carcinogenesis and derives the incidence functions and the first four cumulants of the number of tumors. The model is then fitted to some retinoblastoma data from the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology End Results) project of the National Cancer Institute for the years 1973-1982. In all the cases presented, the estimated incidence functions appear to fit the observed incidence curves quite well, suggesting the usefulness of the model.
