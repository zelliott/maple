Hycanthone was given to 15 patients with metastatic cancer in order to determine the maximum tolerable dose. The drug was administered in 5-day courses at 3-week intervals. The starting dose was 30 mg/m2/day and the highest dose level reached was 90 mg/m2/day. The most common (13 patients) side effect was nausea and/or vomiting. The dose-limiting toxicity was toxic hepatitis manifested as elevation in serum transaminases in eight of 15 patients and an increase in serum bilirubin in three patients. Hepatotoxicity was dose-related and was observed in two of 25 courses given at the dose level of less than or equal to 70 mg/m2 compared to seven of nine courses given at the dose level of greater than or equal to 80 mg/m2. Because of an unacceptable incidence of hepatotoxicity at higher doses, 70 mg/m2/day x 5 appears to be a safe dose for phase II studies.
