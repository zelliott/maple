711 women were identified who in 1939 were married to men who died with cancer of the penis in England and Wales during the period 1964 to 1973. The records of women were traced through the National Health Service Central Register and, by January 1975, 378 (53%) were found to have died. Expected numbers of deaths from all causes, all cancers and from some specific cancers were calculated assuming the women to have the same mortality rates as the general population of England and Wales. The total number of deaths (378) was close to the number expected (366-8) but there was a slight excess of deaths from cancer (89 against 76.5 expected). Of the individual sites examined only cancer of the cervix showed a statistically significant excess (11 deaths against 3.9 expected, P = 0.002). This finding is similar to those reported in two other studies of the wives of men with cancer of the penis. On the basis of these studies it is suggested that some cases of cancer of the cervix and cancer of the penis may have a common aetiology. Other epidemiological characteristics of the two diseases do not show a marked similarity.
