Gene therapy offers new opportunities for cancer treatment and prevention through the use of targeted, relatively nontoxic treatments that can identify, disable, and destroy malignant cells. This article reviews the principles behind oncogene inactivation, tumor suppressor gene replacement, inhibition of angiogenesis, immunopotentiation, molecular chemotherapy, and addition of drug resistance genes. The adcantages and limitations of viral and nonviral vectors for delivery of the therapeutic genes are presented.
