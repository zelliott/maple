We conducted a grounded theory study examining nutritional care experiences in advanced cancer from the perspective of patients (n = 13), families (n = 23), and health care providers (n = 11) (McClement, 2001). That work generated an inductively derived model that captured important information about adult family members' perceptions and behaviour regarding the nutritional care their terminally ill adult relative received while hospitalized on an inpatient palliative care unit, and has been reported elsewhere (McClement et al, 2003). This article provides a more detailed description of one of the major sub-processes of the model regarding family member responses to declining oral intake and weight loss in a terminally ill relative-the sub-process of 'letting nature take its course: it's best not to eat.' The strategies family members use when letting nature take its course, and the consequences of these strategies for patients, family members and health care providers are reported. Implications for practice and research are provided.
