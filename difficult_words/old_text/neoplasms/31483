Formation of new blood vessels is a prerequisite for outgrowth of solid tumours and metastasis. Leukaemia and lymphoma are also dependent on angiogenesis. Inhibition of angiogenesis is therefore a promising therapy for all cancer types. Angiogenic factors reduce the expression of tumour endothelial adhesion molecules for leukocytes, which enables tumours to escape the inflammation response. Antiangiogenic factors induce not only starvation of the tumour owing to deprivation of vasculature, but also re-expression of adhesion molecules, resulting in increased leukocyte infiltration. On the basis of de novo design of chemokines with antiangiogenic properties, novel inhibitors of angiogenesis are developed and selected for their ability to induce a tumour inflammatory reaction.
