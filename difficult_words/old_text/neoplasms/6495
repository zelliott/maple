The activity of three new antimicrobial agents [cefpirome (HR 810), BMY 28142, WIN 49375], and imipenem was compared to that of four currently available agents, ceftazidime, aztreonam, timentin and piperacillin, against 253 bacterial isolates from cancer patients. The activity of all four agents not yet in clinical use at our institution was significantly greater than that of the four antibiotics already in use.
