Hyalinizing trabecular tumors are rare neoplasms of the thyroid gland often mistaken for thyroid carcinoma on fine-needle aspiration. We review the distinguishing characteristics of hyalinizing trabecular tumors and their management.

We present the case of a patient diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma on fine-needle aspiration as well as a review of the literature.

Intraoperative findings were felt to be inconsistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma and only a thyroid lobectomy was performed pending the results from pathologic evaluation, which confirmed a benign process and a diagnosis of hyalinizing trabecular tumor. Due to the diagnostic difficulty in distinguishing hyalinizing trabecular tumors from thyroid carcinomas on fine-needle aspiration, many patients receive overtreatment for what is primarily a benign disease.

Recognition of hyalinizing trabecular tumors as a possible benign etiology of a thyroid mass can facilitate appropriate management.
