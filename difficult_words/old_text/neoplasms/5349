To characterize the disposition and tolerance of azithromycin after single and multiple oral doses of 12 mg/kg in children with and without cancer.

Open-label, nonrandomized pharmacokinetic study.

Two pediatric hospitals.

Twelve children with cancer admitted to the inpatient unit for empiric antibiotic treatment of febrile neutropenia, and 16 hospitalized patients receiving antibiotic therapy

Patients received azithromycin suspension either as a single dose or daily dose every morning for 5 consecutive days. Serial blood samples were collected up to 120 hours after a single dose or during and after multiple doses to characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for a two-compartment absorption model.

All 28 patients were evaluable for safety. Azithromycin was well tolerated except in one patient with cancer who experienced abdominal cramps and withdrew from the study. Pharmacokinetic results were not determined in five patients because of insufficient concentration-time data. The mean +/- SD estimates of oral clearance, terminal half-life, maximum concentration in serum (Cmax), and time to achieve Cmax in the 23 evaluable patients were 4.83 +/- 3.59 L/hour/kg, 54.5 +/- 36.4 hours, 318.2 +/- 174.5 microg/L, and 2.4 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. These estimates did not differ between single-dose (14 patients) and multiple-dose (9 patients) groups. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not different between the 11 children with cancer and the 12 without cancer.

Azithromycin 12 mg/kg results in proportionately higher serum concentrations than previously published results for lower doses (5 mg/kg). Variability in concentration profiles among patients is substantial, and age or other yet unidentified clinical factors may explain some of the differences observed.
