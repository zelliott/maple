A two-layer model using different properties for the pathological tissue and the normal tissue was developed to describe the spatial photon, temperature and thermal damage distributions during laser-induced interstitial thermo-therapy (LITT). The photon distribution was simulated using the Monte Carlo method. The optical tissue parameters and the blood perfusion were derived based on the Arrhenius rate process formulation of thermal damage and kinetics of vasodilatation. The corresponding temperature distribution was numerically calculated using the Pennes bio-heat equation. The calculated results showed that the two-layer model predicted different results on the temperature variation and distribution, the thermal damage distribution and the thermal damage volume etc. from the one-layer model. As a more reasonable physical model, the two-layer model can be used to optimize the therapeutic parameters for improved LITT treatments.
