The recent development of advanced analytical and bioseparation methodologies based on microarrays and biosensors is one of the strategic objectives of the so-called post-genomic. In this field, the development of microfabricated devices could bring new opportunities in several application fields, such as predictive oncology, diagnostics and anti-tumor drug research. The so called "Laboratory-on-a-chip technology", involving miniaturisation of analytical procedures, is expected to enable highly complex laboratory testing to move from the central laboratory into non-laboratory settings. The main advantages of Lab-on-a-chip devices are integration of multiple steps of different analytical procedures, large variety of applications, sub-microliter consumption of reagents and samples, and portability. One of the requirement for new generation Lab-on-a-chip devices is the possibility to be independent from additional preparative/analytical instruments. Ideally, Lab-on-a-chip devices should be able to perform with high efficiency and reproducibility both actuating and sensing procedures. In this review, we discuss applications of dielectrophoretic(DEP)-based Lab-on-a-chip devices to cancer research. The theory of dielectrophoresis as well as the description of several devices, based on spiral-shaped, parallel and arrayed electrodes are here presented. In addition, in this review we describe manipulation of cancer cells using advanced DEP-based Lab-on-a-chip devices in the absence of fluid flow and with the integration of both actuating and sensing procedures.
