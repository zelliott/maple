Cancer rates have risen in West Virginia since 1950, especially in men. In the 1980s, the increase was in older citizens and for most cancers. An analysis conducted by Dr. Jack Riggs stated that this increase is not the result of environmental hazards, but because we all have to die and other causes of death are decreasing. However, we are dying at an older age.
