A new procedure for activation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL2) is described. PBL obtained by leukapheresis were subjected to NH4Cl (ACK) treatment to clear erythrocyte contamination; Ficoll separation was not performed. PBL were subsequently seeded in 10-floor multitrays (Cell FactoryTM, CF), gasified and incubated at 37 degrees C for 3-4 days in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. This procedure achieved an activation (evaluated as cytotoxicity and proliferation) comparable with that obtained by culturing PBL in small flasks. Optimal activation of PBL was achieved in CF even in the presence of granulocyte contamination of up to 40%. It was also possible to freeze, thaw and recover most of the frozen cells and their cytotoxic activity. With this procedure therefore large quantities of lymphokine activated killer cells (LAK) can be easily produced to be used in adoptive immunotherapy trials.
