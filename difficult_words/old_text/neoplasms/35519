Statins have been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular events and overall mortality in primary and secondary prevention trials. This study was designed to examine the effect of statin use on overall death. Cross-sectional data were obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Integrated Service Network 16 database for approximately 1.5 million veterans followed up in 10 hospitals in the southern United States. Statins were prescribed more often to elderly subjects with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, current smoking, and using cardiovascular drugs (beta blockers, aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers). The predictors of death were, as expected, cancer, diabetes mellitus, the use of cardiac drugs, and age. Importantly, using statins showed a highly significant negative association with death (odds ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 0.69, p &lt;0.0001), even after adjustment for all other variables. Overall, the mean age at death among statin users was 2 years older than among nonstatin users, despite statin users being at a higher risk of death. In conclusion, the results of this study have shown that using statins is a potent life-saving strategy. The benefit observed in this study is unique because almost 1/2 the patients were &gt;or=70 years of age when statin therapy was initiated.
