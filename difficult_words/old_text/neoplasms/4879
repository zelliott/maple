The transcription factor Twist1 is overexpressed in tumours and can induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, resulting in increased invasiveness. Twist1 is now shown to regulate cancer cell migration and invasion in three-dimensional environments by activating the RAC1 GTPase through suppression of a let-7 microRNA family member.
