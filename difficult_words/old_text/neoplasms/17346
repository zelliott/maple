To visualize intratumoral hypoxic areas and their reoxygenation before and during fractionated radiation therapy (RT), (18)F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography and computed tomography (F-MISO PET/CT) were performed. A total of 10 patients, consisting of four with head and neck cancers, four with gastrointestinal cancers, one with lung cancer, and one with uterine cancer, were included. F-MISO PET/CT was performed twice, before RT and during fractionated RT of approximately 20 Gy/10 fractions, for eight of the 10 patients. F-MISO maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of normal muscles and tumors were measured. The tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratios of F-MISO SUVmax were also calculated. Mean SUVmax ± standard deviation (SD) of normal muscles was 1.25 ± 0.17, and SUVmax above the mean + 2 SD (≥1.60 SUV) was regarded as a hypoxic area. Nine of the 10 tumors had an F-MISO SUVmax of ≥1.60. All eight tumors examined twice showed a decrease in the SUVmax, T/M ratio, or percentage of hypoxic volume (F-MISO ≥1.60) at approximately 20 Gy, indicating reoxygenation. In conclusion, accumulation of F-MISO of ≥1.60 SUV was regarded as an intratumoral hypoxic area in our F-MISO PET/CT system. Most human tumors (90%) in this small series had hypoxic areas before RT, although hypoxic volume was minimal (0.0-0.3%) for four of the 10 tumors. In addition, reoxygenation was observed in most tumors at two weeks of fractionated RT.
