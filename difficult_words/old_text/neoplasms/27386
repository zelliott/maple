The first professional meeting and educational symposium of the All Ireland Fatigue Coalition (AIFC) convened in Dublin in September 2002, with an attendance of 350 health professionals who work in cancer research and cancer patient care. The AIFC is a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the U.S. whose mission is to champion the proactive management of cancer-related fatigue. The major goals of the symposium were to better understand the status and prevalence of cancer fatigue on the island of Ireland and to learn how to better assess and manage fatigue in cancer patients. An international faculty presented on topics ranging from defining the condition to developing an international protocol implementing a fatigue algorithm.
