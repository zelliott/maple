Two thousand and four patients with various types of late stage cancer were treated with living BCG immunotherapy from 1972 to 1982. Fourty-five out of 1,112 patients were able to survive more than 5 years after initiation of this immunotherapy. All of these patients were noncurative operation except for 2 cases of hepatoma who received no surgery. We report the immunological and clinical aspects of the long term survivors of this treatment.
