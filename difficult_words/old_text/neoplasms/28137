The purpose of collecting this important disease burden information is of course not simply for reports like this one. The real value lies in use of data for program planning, resource allocation, program design, and evaluation. Data in the annual KCR report and on the website should be a valuable resource for district and county health departments in their assessment of health problems in their area and as critical decisions are made about how to utilize limited intervention resources. The Kentucky Cancer Registry will continue to work very closely with the Community Outreach Division of the Kentucky Cancer Program to make this data available on an annual basis to District Cancer Councils to help guide their assessment and planning process. District and local health departments are encouraged to actively participate in the District Cancer Councils and in the cancer control activities guided by the regional community outreach coordinators.
