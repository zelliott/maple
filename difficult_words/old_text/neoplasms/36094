Nursing theories provide inspiration for practice by describing how to meet needs, enhance wellness, and respond to clients as whole persons. This paper discusses the McGill Model of Nursing with reference to how its ideas can support nursing practice for patients with cancer during the end-of-life phase. We suggest this model provides for a relational approach that is congruent with the philosophy of palliative care. The goal of this paper is to stimulate reflection amongst oncology nurses and nursing leaders. By comparing the value base of our practice against extant nursing theory, we may discover new opportunities for teaching and learning about what it means to be an end-of-life care nurse.
