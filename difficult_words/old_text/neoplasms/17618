An extensive area of rural Ireland was monitored in detail for natural background radiation (NBR); average background radiation values were derived for all District Electoral Divisions (DEDs) in this area. Cancer mortality rates were calculated for the DEDs aggregated according to average NBR. No association was apparent between cancer mortality rates and levels of natural background radiation.
