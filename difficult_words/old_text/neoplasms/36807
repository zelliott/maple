Of 291 juvenile and adult snakes examined post mortem over a 20-year period (1978-1997) at the National Zoological Park (NZP) in Washington, DC, 36 (24 females and 12 males) had neoplasms. Two snakes had tumours of two or three different types, but the other 34 snakes had only one type. All affected animals were adults and their average time on exhibit at the NZP was 108-9 months. Malignant neoplasms (79.5%) outnumbered benign neoplasms (20.5%). Of the malignant tumours, 19 (61.3%) were considered to have arisen in mesenchymal tissues, 11 (35.5%) were of epithelial origin, and one (3.2%) was derived from neuroectodermal tissues. All the benign neoplasms were of epithelial origin. Neoplasms of the lymphoid and haematopoietic tissues were the most common (12 cases), followed by tumours of the liver and biliary tract (seven cases) and the gastrointestinal tract (four cases).
