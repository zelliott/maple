The task of a psychoanalyst working in cancerology is to help patients and families cope with the illness and the treatments by recognizing them all as "subjects" with their own phantoms, desires and personal history. Above all, the cancer patient is concerned by possible losses: loss of an essential body-function, loss of a social and/or economical status and finally loss of life itself. From our experience; we know that relieving pain is not only a question of prescribing the right medication but depends mostly on the way the team is able to recognize fears, conflicts and treat the person globally, offering solutions to solve the problems patients and families meet.
