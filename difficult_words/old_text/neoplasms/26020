9 of 15 patients, including 1 man, with advanced mammary cancer were improved by treatment with a combination of 50 mg of progesterone and 5 mg of estradiol benzoate administered intramuscularly every day.  The effectiveness of estradiol and progesterone therapy was evaluated on the basis of its influence on the state of well-being of the patients, the relief of pain, changes in visible or palpable tumors, and alterations in bone metastases as  revealed by X-ray examination.  7 of the 9 patients who improved with treatment had previously responded to endocrine therapy (adrenalectomy, hypophysectomy, castration, estrogen, or androgen).  Serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations rose during the first 2 weeks of treatment in all patients in whom the disease ameliorat ed, but in only 2 of the 6 who were not improved.  No toxic or adverse reactions were observed.  Although the benefit secured by this treatment was sometimes short-lived, the results seemed sufficiently encouraging to merit more exhaustive trials.
