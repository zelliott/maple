Continuous subcutaneous administration of octreotide acetate (SMS201-995: SMS) has not been done in Meiwa Hospital for malignant gastrointestinal obstruction in terminal patients for the following reasons: First, patients and families refuse an indwelling needle on the abdominal wall; second, an additional route limits daily activity; third, the needle site becomes inflamed or sclerosed; and fourth, an infusion pump is required. Hence, the effectiveness of three types of intravenous administration was investigated retrospectively in 15 patients in our hospital: 7 cases received intermittent IV drip infusion; 4 continuous IV drip infusion; and 4 bolus IV injection. As a result, 6 cases (86%), 2 cases (50%), and 1 case (25%), respectively, were successfully treated. These results suggested that intermittent IV administration of SMS is efficient, safe, and very convenient, while continuous IV administration is also efficient as long as the SMS potency is not reduced by mixed drugs.
