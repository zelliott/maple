Tumour markers are substances stemming either from the tumour cell itself or the production of which is stimulated by the malignant growth. They are released into body fluids where they can be detected quantitatively with the aid of sensitive immunological methods. In addition to oncofetal antigens they include hormones, enzymes, isoenzymes as well as special proteins. The determination of markers by aid of monoclonal antibodies has led to an additional improvement in tumour diagnostics. Tumour markers are indubitably valuable preoperatively as prognostic parameters, and postoperatively for the follow-up and after-care. However, the tumour-associated substances so far in use are unsuitable for the early recognition of malignant processes.
