Malignancies are among the most common causes of death in children. The present study was undertaken to evaluate and compare bone marrow aspiration and unilateral biopsy to detect bone marrow metastases in pediatric patients, using bilateral biopsy as the gold standard.

During a 6-month period, 63 consecutive newly diagnosed children with confirmed malignant diseases other than leukemia were evaluated for bone marrow metastases or infiltration. Biopsies were obtained from both right and left posterior iliac crests whereas aspiration was performed only at the right crest. Interpretation to the right-side biopsy was considered as the unilateral biopsy result, whereas the bilateral biopsy result was as follows: positively was accepted if one or both of the two-side samples were qualified as positive, while a negative result was considered only if both sides were negative. The bilateral biopsy was considered the gold standard, and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and false positive and negative rates were computed for the unilateral biopsy and aspiration procedure.

We identified bone marrow metastases in 11 (17.5%) patients. The sensitivity was the only significant difference (p &lt;0.05) observed between unilateral biopsy and aspiration. Finally, of the 63 patients, unilateral biopsy was reported as inadequate in one patient (1.6%), while aspiration was inadequate in two (3.2%).

Unilateral biopsy was better than bone marrow aspiration. However, because bilateral biopsy is the gold standard, we recommend using this and bone marrow aspiration simultaneously to evaluate a pediatric patient with any malignancy potentially infiltrating bone marrow.
