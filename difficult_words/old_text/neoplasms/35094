The reactivity of mononuclear cells from patients with breast cancer to the 3 M KCl extract of breast tumor was tested using the superoxide (O2-) assay monocyte adherence test. The mononuclear cells were incubated with the 3 M KCl extract of breast tumor or normal breast tissues in a microcell for spectrophotometer analysis. After 2 h incubation, the nonadherent cells were removed, and the O2- generated from the monocytes adherent to the intersurface of the microcell was assayed. Thirty of 36 patients with breast cancer before treatment reacted to the extract of breast tumor. Sixteen patients showed adherence inhibition and 14 adherence stimulation. None of 8 patients with breast cancer reacted to the extract of lung tumor. Of 31 control donors (19 healthy volunteers and 12 patients with cancer of other organs), only 3 reacted to the extract of breast tumor.
