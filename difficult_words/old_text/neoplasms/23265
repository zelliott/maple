Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer into a tumor mass can be improved by combining it with conditionally-replicating adenovirus (CRAd) when both vectors co-infect the same cancer cell. We investigated the efficiency of enhancing transgene expression and effectiveness of cancer killing of two advenoviruses (Ads), one expressing E2F-1 (AdE2F-1) and another expressing a truncated form of E2F-1 that lacks the transactivation domain (AdE2Ftr), when combined with oncolytic Adhz60. We found that AdE2F-1 with Adhz60 actually decreased E2F-1 expression and viral replication through a mechanism apparently involving repression of the cyclin-E promoter and decreased expression of early and late structural proteins necessary for viral replication. In contrast, AdE2Ftr with Adhz60 resulted in increased E2Ftr expression, AdE2Ftr replication, and cancer cell death both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that AdE2Ftr coupled with a CRAd enhances AdE2Ftr-mediated cancer cell death.
