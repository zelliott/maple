Demographic, cancer, physical functioning, and psychological data were collected for 90 late-stage cancer, newly admitted nursing home patients. Those who died within 3 months (28%) more often acknowledged their condition as terminal, anticipated greater environmental stress and adjustment problems, and had poorer self-esteem. For cancer patients undergoing the stress of nursing home placement, feelings of hopelessness and helplessness are associated with earlier death.
