Since the first discovery of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) by Morris et al in 1994, the number of ALK-positive neoplasms, either in the form of translocation or gain-of-function mutations, have been dramatically expanded from ALCL of T- and NK-cell origin, to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, and rare type of sarcomas.

This review covers the major aspects of ALK-immunoreactive neoplasms with emphasis on the pathogenesis of ALK-positive neoplasms. The new advances and rapid-evolving practices using ALK inhibitors for therapy are also discussed at the end of this review.

ALK(+) articles published in English literature are retrieved and critically reviewed.

ALK(+) neoplasia is a rapidly growing field and the list of ALK(+) neoplasms is being expanded continuously. Accurate and correct diagnosis of ALK(+) neoplasms is of paramount importance in guiding the appropriate treatment in the era of personalized medicine using specific ALK inhibitor.
