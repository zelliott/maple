Low megavoltage electrons, because of their limited penetration, have been found very useful in the treatment of generalized superficial malignancies. However, because of the complexity of the human body contour, it is extremely difficult to achieve uniform dose distribution over the entire body surface. To achieve this, various techniques ranging from two to six fields have been used. In this paper, we discuss the disadvantages of these techniques and describe a new technique, "the rotation technique," which is superior.
