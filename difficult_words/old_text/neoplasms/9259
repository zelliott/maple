Life expectancy for people with haemophilia (PWH) has improved and is now approaching that of the general population. The growing population of elderly PWH will therefore increasingly face the age-related morbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, malignant disease, liver disease, and bone and joint related diseases, as well as the lifestyle and psychosocial factors that accompany many of these conditions. For many PWH, frequent contact with haemophilia specialists within the comprehensive care centres supplants the relationship that individuals in the general population have with their general practitioners. As a result, there is a risk that elderly PWH may miss the chronic disease screening opportunities offered to the general population. This review focuses on the screening tests and examinations recommended for age-related comorbidities in the general population that may be applicable to the growing population of older people with haemophilia.
