Medical records of 47 dogs with pulmonary thromboembolism were reviewed. Middle-aged to older dogs predominated and dyspnea and arterial hypoxemia were consistent clinical findings. Thoracic radiographic findings were variable. Cardiac disease, neoplasia, hyperadrenocorticism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and sepsis were identified most frequently. Multiple disease processes were identified in 64% of the dogs.
