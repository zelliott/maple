To provide an overview of the technical aspects and potential clinical applications of microvessel perfusion as depicted by microbubble-enhanced sonography.

Sonographic depiction of microvessel perfusion was obtained by microbubble-enhanced sonography. This technique was used for imaging in vivo murine tumors and was correlated with magnetic resonance and fluorodeoxyglucose autoradiography. Sonographic estimation of microvessel perfusion used parameters derived from time-activity curves.

Preliminary data indicate that accurate and reproducible quantification of microvessel perfusion is possible with the use of microbubble-enhanced sonography.

Microbubble-enhanced sonography can depict microvessel perfusion. This technique has several potential clinical applications, including assessment of tumor blood flow and changes that occur with treatment.
