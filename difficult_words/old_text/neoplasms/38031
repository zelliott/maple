In cryosurgery it is crucial that the performance of cryoprobes is predictable and constant. In this study we tested the intra- and interneedle variation between 17-gauge cryoprobes in two homogeneous mediums. Also, a multiprobe setup was tested. Cryoprobe performance was defined as the time it takes one cryoprobe to lower the temperature from 0 to -20 degrees C as measured by four thermosensors each at 3 mm distance from the cryoprobe. In agar eight cryoprobes were tested during six freeze cycles, and in gel four cryoprobes during four freeze cycles; each freeze cycle in a different cup of agar or gel. Using more accurate 'bare' thermosensors three cryoprobes were tested in gel during two freeze cycles. A multiprobe configuration with four cryoprobes was tested during two freeze cycles in both agar and gel. Statistical analyses were done using ANOVA for repeated measures. There was no significant intraneedle variation, whereas both in agar and gel there was a significant interneedle variation (p&lt;0.05). Mean performance in gel was better than in agar (p&lt;0.001). Also, there was a significant variation between the four thermosensors (p&lt;0.001). Using bare thermosensors mean performance was 2.7 times faster compared to measurements by regular thermosensors (p&lt;0.001). In a multiprobe configuration, overall performance seems less variable and more reproducible compared to a single cryoprobe. In conclusion, the performance of cryoprobes differs depending on the medium and measuring device used. Cryoprobes deliver reproducible freeze cycles, although there is variation between different cryoprobes. In a multiprobe configuration performance seems less variable.
