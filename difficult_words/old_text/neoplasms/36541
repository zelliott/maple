Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has been recommended as a technique for accurate evaluation and diagnosis of childhood malignancies. Very little data exist regarding the limitations and utility of FNA in children. We reviewed our experience over the past 5 years to assess the clinical use of FNA and its limitations. One hundred seventy-three FNAs were performed in 156 patients who ranged in age from 7 months to 18 years. Sixty-three patients were female and 110 were male. Thirty-seven aspirations were obtained to evaluate new masses in children with previously diagnosed malignancies. FNA allowed diagnosis of the malignancy in 90% of patients with solid tumors, whereas only 9 of 19 patients with lymphomas were diagnosed accurately with FNA. The specificity was 99.7%. Inadequate material was obtained in 13 aspirates. Insufficient material was obtained in 14% of patients who had FNA as their initial diagnostic tool. Four false-negatives were obtained while evaluating children for recurrent disease. There were 16 true-negative biopsies. These data suggest that FNA is an excellent tool for diagnosing both recurrent malignancies as well as previously undiagnosed solid tumors in the pediatric population but is inadequate to diagnose children with suspected undiagnosed lymphomas. Negative studies should be considered nondiagnostic and followed by open biopsies when clinical suspicion of malignancy is high.
