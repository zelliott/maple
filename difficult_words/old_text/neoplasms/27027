One new eudesmane-type (1, named solajiangxin A) and two new eudesmane-related sesquiterpenoids (2-3, named solajiangxins B-C) were isolated from the whole plant of Solanum lyratum. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of integrated spectroscopic techniques. In vitro, three new sesquiterpenoids were found to show significant cytotoxicities against three human cancer lines (P-388, HONE-1 and HT-29), and gave ED50 values in the range of 1.9-3.7 Î¼g/ml.
