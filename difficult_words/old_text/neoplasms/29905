During recent years there has been a growing awareness among both the oncologic and nutrition communities about an association between nutrition and cancer causation with the practical implication of manipulating nutrition as a means of preventing cancer. Epidemiologic correlations, prospective studies of selected populations, and dietary histories of cancer cases compared to suitable comparisons all point toward such associations. For some of the more common cancers in this country, it is thought that individuals can exert a certain amount of control over his or her own cancer risk through diet and lifestyle. As more is learned about mechanisms of mutagens and carcinogens, it may be routinely possible to inhibit, block, or reverse the cellular processes involved in carcinogenesis. It has been estimated that up to 35% of cancers may eventually be prevented by dietary modification. Until the final answers are found, it seems prudent to reduce total dietary fat intake and increase total fiber intake.
