The role of thymidine in the treatment of cancer has been under clinical investigation for nearly a decade. Clinical trials have demonstrated that it lacks antitumor activity in its own right. In this review, the mechanism of action and rationale for the use of thymidine as a biochemical modulator of standard agents such as 5-fluorouracil, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, and methotrexate are summarized. With this background, the clinical trials which have been conducted with thymidine, either alone or in combination, are described. We suggest a number of further studies of the role of thymidine in the biochemical modulation of antimetabolites.
