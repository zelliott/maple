To evaluate the occurrence and clinical significance of respiratory virus infections in children during anticancer treatment, we studied 75 consecutive episodes of febrile infection in 32 children during 17 months. Viral antigen detection for 7 respiratory viruses, viral culture for rhinoviruses and enzyme immunoassay serology were used. Evidence for respiratory virus infection was found in 28 (37%) cases. Rhinovirus was the most common virus detected in 13 (17%) episodes. The other etiologic agents were respiratory syncytial virus (6 episodes), parainfluenza virus type 3 (5 episodes), adenovirus (4 episodes), influenza A virus (3 episodes), and influenza B virus (1 episode). Respiratory virus infections were diagnosed as often in leukopenic as in non-leukopenic patients (37% vs. 38%). In 4 cases bacteremic infection was diagnosed. We found no difference in serum C-reactive protein values when episodes positive for respiratory viruses were compared with virus-negative episodes. Our observations show that respiratory virus infections are common in febrile children receiving anticancer treatment. Diagnostic tests for respiratory viruses should be used more often in evaluation of fever in these patients.
