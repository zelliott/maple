Chemokines are a group of small secreted proteins (8-10 kDa) produced and released by a wide variety of cell types. They were originally described as mediators of leukocyte recruitment, which is essential in acute and chronic inflammation. They also play a critical role in many pathophysiological processes such as allergic responses, infections and autoimmune diseases, tumor growth and hematopoietic development. This review introduces the three supergene families of chemokines (CXC, CC and C) with emphasis on their important role in different states in humans and in animal models with parasitic diseases. The concentration of transcription and translation of the cytokines and chemokines in the parasitic diseases may be an important marker for evaluation of the inflammatory state.
