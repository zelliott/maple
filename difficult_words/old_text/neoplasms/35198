Oncogene studies have become an area of general interest in the field of cancer research following the identification of the cellular counterparts of viral oncogenes. It may be possible to attribute some steps in the initiation or progression of cancer to point-mutations or altered expression of proto-oncogenes. Elucidation of the normal functions of proto-oncogene products as growth factors, growth factor receptors or other growth regulatory elements will facilitate biochemical analysis of the mechanisms of normal and malignant cell growth.
