The purpose of this study was to establish criteria to predict the need for emergency hospitalization of patients receiving chemotherapy, based on information at presentation. 158 consecutive patients treated for cancer at the Cancer Chemotherapy Center in the University of Occupational and Environmental Health were examined. The number of emergency hospitalization cases for outpatients undergoing cancer chemotherapy was 14 (8.9%) and including seven lung carcinomas, six hematological carcinomas, and one mediastinal tumor. The reason for emergency hospitalization in twelve (85.7%) of the cases was infection. No significant difference was observed between the cases with and without emergency hospitalization regarding age, gender, cancer type, previous treatment, objective of the chemotherapy, or line of chemotherapy. A significantly higher number of the emergency cases were associated with performance status 2, severe adverse events and comorbidity than with a performance status 0-1 where there were no or only mild adverse events and no comorbidity. Multiple logistic regression models indicated that severe adverse events and comorbidities were independent predictive factors for patients with emergency hospitalization. By combining selected clinical information for outpatients receiving cancer chemotherapy, the need for emergency hospitalization could be predicted.
