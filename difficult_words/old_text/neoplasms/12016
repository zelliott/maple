Epidemiologic and animal studies indicate that chronic exposure to anesthetic gases may consitute a potential health hazard. This is suggested by a higher incidence of spontaneous abortion among female operating room personnel, congenital anomalies in the offspring of operating room personnel, and neoplasia of the reticuloendothelial system. Human data show that performance can be compromised during exposure to anesthetic traces. A direct cause and effect relationship between anesthetic exposure and the alleged hazards will require further prospective studies. Such a study is being planned by the Ad Hoc Committee of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. In the interim, monitoring programs should be established to define adequate clearances of the anesthetic agents. Minimum standards and recommended procedures should be established regarding operating room ventilation and design. The use of effective scavengers and anesthetic techniques not requiring the use of inhalational agents should be encouraged. In this way a clear distinction may be defined by the prosepective study planned by the American Society of Anesthesiologists in 1978.
