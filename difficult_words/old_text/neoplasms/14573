Fibronectins are multifunctional glycoproteins involved in the embryogenesis and in multiple physiological processes. Most of their functions derive from interactions of these glycoproteins with the cell surface. Fibronectin and their cell surface receptor constitute the major cell-substratum adhesion that plays a key role in cell adhesion, cell spreading and cell motility, particularly during embryonic development. Additionally, other functions of fibronectins are due to their ability to ban a great variety of macromolecules contained in an extracellular matrix and in plasma. In particular, the interaction of fibronectins with the cell surface, collagen, fibrin and fibrinogen are involved in physiological processes such as hemostasis, wound healing and phagocytosis.
