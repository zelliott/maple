A knowledge of the precise dose given in a course of radiotherapy is vital to the interpretation of the result. Despite this, an acceptable level of reporting was found in only 72 (36%) of 200 papers published in the two leading journals of radiation oncology. Analysis of the treatment data of the cases with head and neck tumours in the pilot study of CHART showed that the mean of the minimum tumour doses given was 5.1% lower than the mean of those at the intersection points. Had the same total dose been prescribed to the intersection point instead of the minimum there would have been a similar lowering of dose. There is evidence from published clinical data and a suggestion from an analysis of the CHART pilot study data that a dose difference as small as 5% may lead to real impairment or enhancement of tumour response, as well as altering the risk of morbidity. Inadequate reporting may lead to a false interpretation of a study and to its wrongful application. It is strongly recommended that it should be editorial policy to publish only those papers where the radiation dose is fully described.
