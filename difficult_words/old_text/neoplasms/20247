Surgical oncology must consider some new international and national publications: 1. New fascicles of the 2nd edition of the WHO International Histological Classification of Tumors. 2. The 1992 revision of the 4th edition of the UICC TNM Classification and of the UICC TNM Atlas. 3. The TNM Supplement 1992/93 (UICC), which includes, among other things, explanatory notes for uniform use, proposals for further development, and a compilation of prognostic factors other than TNM and R to be considered in clinical studies. 4. The fully revised and enlarged tumor documentation system of the Working Group of German Cancer Centers (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Deutscher Tumorzentren).
