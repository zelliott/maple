Further study of one of the fractions from the wood of Artocarpus elasticus furnished two new prenylated flavonoids artelastocarpin and carpelastofuran as well as ethyl 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate. The two flavonoids and the prenylated flavonoids artelastin, artelastochromene, artelasticin, artocarpesin, and cyclocommunin isolated earlier from this species were tested for cytotoxicity in vitro against three human cell lines. All seven flavonoids were active, the cytotoxic effect varying from strong to moderate and with artelastin showing the most potent activity.
