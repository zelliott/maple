The concept of overexpression of individual forms of cytochrome P450 enzymes in tumor cells is now becoming well recognized. Indeed, a growing body of research highlights the overexpression of P450s, particularly CYP1B1, in tumor cells as representing novel targets for anticancer therapy. The purpose of this review is to outline the novel therapeutic options and opportunities arising from both enhanced endogenous expression of cytochrome P450 in tumors and cytochrome P450-mediated gene therapy.
