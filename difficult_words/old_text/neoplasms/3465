New Zealand has a cancer profile similar to those of Western developed countries, with a high rate of melanoma, similar to Australia. Statistics separating the Maori from the non-Maori population, although open to difficulties in interpretation, show higher rates in Maori of liver, stomach, lung and cervix uterine cancer and lower rates of colorectal cancer and of melanoma. Screening and prevention programmes are limited by resource constraints; there is population screening for cervical cancer and breast cancer screening is being developed. Screening for hepatitis B and liver cancer is proposed, despite conflicting scientific opinions, while screening for colorectal cancer is not planned, despite randomized trial evidence of benefit. There is no clear national cancer control programme at present. Investigation of stomach cancer in Maori families had identified a new gene.
