In the 1983-1988 period, the audition of 17 children was studied prior to and during antineoplastic chemotherapy with cumulative total cisplatin doses from 270 to 1530 mg/m2. The hearing tests were conducted by means of an objective method which doses not depend on patients' cooperation: the recording of fast auditory evoked potentials. Tone threshold audiograms were additionally obtained from cooperative children. Of the 17 patients, 14 showed a dose-dependent symmetric hearing loss which in part was severe and related in particular to the high-frequency domain. Three patients exhibited no hearing impairment even though the total cisplatin dose applied ranged from 630 to 810 mg/m2. To conclude, while allowing for reports in the literature, recommendations are given on how hearing impairment can be minimised in view of the priority of the antineoplastic action of cisplatin.
