Some growth factor receptor genes can be activated to become oncogenic as a result of various mutations. The receptors that are encoded by these genes may deliver constitutive signals independent of ligand binding. The model which is presented here assumes that alterations in the B-cell antigen receptor could have similar effects. Evidence that membrane immunoglobulin alterations contribute to oncogenesis in vivo comes from studies of heavy chain diseases. Moreover, this model could have also implications for other B-cell neoplasias.
