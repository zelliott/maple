Several different disease loci with unknown genetic background map to human Xp11. In a systematic search for novel genes, we identified a novel transcript, UXT (HGMW-approved symbol), close to the ELK1 locus in Xp11.23-p11.22. The gene is composed of seven exons and encodes a protein of 157 amino acids, which is highly conserved in mouse. We showed that UXT is ubiquitously expressed and subject to X-inactivation. No homology to any known genes was found. Database surveys indicate an abundant expression in tumor tissues.
