The detection of blood-borne cancer cells may help in clinical staging and further understanding of cancer metastasis. We developed a cytokeratin-based immunomagnetic method to isolate epithelium-derived cells from the circulating blood of patients. The number of cell clusters positive for cytokeratin/prostate-specific antigen (PSA) from the peripheral blood of prostate cancer patients and cytokeratin/p185c-erbB-2 from the peripheral blood of breast cancer patients has been related to stage of the disease. Breast cancer patients who presented cytokeratin/p185c-erbB-2-positive cell clusters showed a decrease in such cells under adriamycin adjuvant therapy with Further molecular characterization by a highly sensitive microsatellite multiplex-PCR enabled reproducible detection of microsatellite alterations. The impact of these individually targeted results may contribute to an individual diagnostic and therapeutic strategy.
