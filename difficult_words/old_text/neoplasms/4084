While nucleotides have a well-established role in intracellular metabolism, ATP and other nucleotides also have important extracellular roles in receptor-mediated signal transduction (34, 35). Extracellular or cell surface proteins capable of binding ATP and hydrolyzing phosphoester bonds of nucleotides are known to exist but their function has remained obscure. Our recent data point to a structure-function correlation between PDE activity and motility stimulation by ATX, indicating a biologically important functional role for the ecto/exophosdiesterases in the stimulation of cellular motility. Data from studies with PC-1 and gp130RB13-6 have suggested that cell surface PDE's may also play roles in cellular differentiation. Extracellular PDE activities, in combination with other nucleotidases, may result in ecto-nucleotidase cascades (36-38). These data suggest that ecto-/exo-enzymes may catalyze extracellular biochemical reactions that are important in the regulation of cell behavior.
