Twelve patients with intense or very intense pain of the non-incident type, secondary to neoplasia, were divided at random into two groups and treated with an epidural dose of 3 mg of morphine in 10 ml of glucose solution (6 patients = group M) or with 0.3 mg of buprenorphine in the same vehicle (6 patients = group B). None of the patients had previously been treated with opioids by any route. After first determining basal values, the following assessments were carried out: (1) evaluation of the analgesic effect of the drugs with checks at 30 min and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 18 h after administration, using a visual analogue scale, a numerical rating scale and a simple descriptive scale; and (2) evaluation of effects on respiration by means of checks at 30 and 90 min and at 6 and 18 h, on control of breathing indices (P0.1; VE; VA; Ti/Ttot; VT/Ti; RR), gas exchange indices (delta(A-a)O2; VD/VT; pAO2; R) and blood gas and acid-base indices (paO2; paCO2; pH; HCO3-). The data obtained were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance and Student's t test. The study results showed very similar analgesic efficacy for both treatments at a single dosage level of morphine (3 mg) compared to buprenorphine (0.3 mg), which was approximately 3 times greater than an equivalent parenteral dose of morphine (10 mg). Analysis of the results revealed statistically, though not clinically, significant changes in respiratory function indices, only in the buprenorphine-treated group. The effects of buprenorphine on respiratory function, when administered epidurally at the above dosage, are less favourable than those of morphine in the early measurements, probably because of its greater systemic absorption; nevertheless, the risk of delayed respiratory depression appears to be less after buprenorphine than after morphine.
