Neural tumors, Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma and several types of leukemia have been previously described in association with neurofibromatosis (NF). In a nation-wide collection of cases in Italy, 15 children (0-14 years of age) with NF and cancer or leukemia were identified; 13 of them had been diagnosed with cancer between 1976-83. The expected number of children with cancer and NF in 1976-83 was 4.48. The distribution of tumor types was different from that found in the general population, with a higher proportion of tumors of neural crest origin as well as soft tissue sarcomas. In 7/15 the family history was positive for NF; in 5/7 the individuals affected included the mother and/or a maternal relative.
