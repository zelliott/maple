Middle-aged couples play multiple family roles. In addition to supporting each other, they also act as caregivers for their children and elderly parents. When they are diagnosed with a severe illness such as cancer, the impacts on the psycho-spiritual aspects of their lives include fear of death and loss of control. While dealing with these and other disease-related issues, they must maintain intimate relationships with their spouses and try to communicate with their children about their health status. In addition to providing individual care, nurses must make the effort to help their patients make adjustments in their family relationships.
