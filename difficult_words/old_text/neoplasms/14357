In a Medical Support Center (MSC), nurses care for both inpatients and outpatients. For outpatients receiving chemotherapy, nursing support is ended at PS1 or PS0. We also clarified the roles of MSC nurses and the timing for resuming nursing support for outpatients. We found that support was resumed between 53 and 153 days after support was first administered. By considering the services provided at the first instance of support, MSC nurses were able to build a system of medical and nursing care that the patients and their families desired.
