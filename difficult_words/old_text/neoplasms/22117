Extracts of the plant St John's wort, Hyperforin perforatum L., have been used for centuries in traditional medicine, notably for the treatment of depression. One of their main lipophilic components, a natural prenylated phloroglucinol termed hyperforin (HF), has been identified as the major molecule responsible for the antidepressant effects of this plant. Within the last few years, a number of studies have demonstrated that HF displays, in addition, several other biological properties of potential pharmacological interest. They include an antibacterial capacity and inhibitory effects on inflammatory mediators. It is worth noting that HF also promotes apoptosis of various cancer cells from solid tumors and hematological malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, HF inhibits the capacity of migration and invasion of different tumor cells, as well as exhibiting antiangiogenic effects. Altogether, these properties qualify HF as a lead structure for the development of new therapeutic molecules in the treatment of various diseases, including some malignant tumors.
