A model of the relations between spouse support, coping, and positive and negative mood was examined with 221 individuals with cancer using LISREL analyses. A moderating effect for patient life expectancy was predicted for disease prognosis. Results indicated that spouse criticism was associated with negative mood indirectly through avoidant coping strategies, and spouse support was associated with positive mood indirectly through positively-focused coping. Results did not support a moderating influence for life expectancy upon the association between spouse behaviors and patient coping. The results of this study are discussed in terms of their implications for psychosocial interventions to reduce psychological distress among individuals with cancer.
