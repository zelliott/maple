Copper is an indispensable trace element for life. Four points are fundamental: copper is combined with essential enzymatic systems (oxidases, transaminases), copper is necessary for inclusion of iron in the molecule of hemoglobin, copper has a primordial role in the metabolism of molecule of hemoglobin, copper has a primordial role in the metabolism of collagen and elastin and some vascular diseases (aneurysms) are closely related to its lack, finally, there is an increase of plasmatic copper during cancerous diseases, which is significant even at an early time and usually proportional to the evolution.
