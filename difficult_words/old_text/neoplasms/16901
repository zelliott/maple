Posttraumatic inflammation and, much less commonly, mechanical trauma itself may affect the clinical course of cancer. There is no evidence that a single incident of trauma can cause cancer, although posttraumatic chronic inflammation may be associated with carcinogenesis. In patients with cancer at the time of trauma, inflammation and repair processes may inhibit or enhance cancer growth, and trauma and its sequelae may increase the rates of invasion and dissemination.
