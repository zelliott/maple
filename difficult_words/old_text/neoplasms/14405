In the past 20 years, over 2,000 cases of ABO-incompatible living kidney transplantation (ABO-ILKT) have been performed in Japan, expanding the donor pool and overcoming the serious shortage of organ donors. Overall long-term outcomes (&gt;20 years) have been excellent and almost identical to the outcomes of ABO-compatible living kidney transplantation (ABO-CLKT). In the last decade, ABO-ILKT has become accepted as a therapeutic alternative for end-stage renal failure. Recently, approximately 30% of all living donor kidney transplantations in Japan have been ABO-ILKT. In the 1990s, desensitization included preoperative plasmapheresis, splenectomy, and heavy immunosuppression that caused surgical and medical stress on patients and a higher cost than that needed for ABO-CLKT for the preoperative conditioning. However, since 2000, rituximab has replaced splenectomy making ABO-ILKT much easier. It is also less stressful for patients. In the last decade, outcomes have improved significantly and 5- and 10-year graft survival have reached 95% and 90%, respectively-identical to, or even better than outcomes of ABO-CLKT. Our current preconditioning includes plasmapheresis 0-2 times, rituximab injection, and regular immunosuppression. Neither intravenous immunoglobulin nor prophylactic plasmapheresis is used after transplantation. ABO-ILKT is a standard option for kidney transplantation requiring minimal preconditioning and regular immunosuppression after transplantation. It now provides an excellent long-term (&gt;20 years) outcome.
