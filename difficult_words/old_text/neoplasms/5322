The aging of the population will result in more older people with cancer. Thus, it is important to consider mechanisms by which geriatrics content could be incorporated into oncology training. The Oncology Geriatric Education Retreat was held February 21-26, 1997, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, for the discussion of possible approaches to this topic. A series of didactic sessions accompanied by commentaries was held. This was followed by three sets of sessions during which different small groups met simultaneously to discuss approaches to the treatment of specific types of tumors, educational process, and research issues. A general group discussion ensued after each set of sessions. The assembly concluded that incorporating geriatrics content into oncology training was an issue worthy of aggressive pursuit. A number of approaches were suggested, including consultation with the Residency Review Committees, the American Board of Internal Medicine, and other organizations. The importance of developing a research agenda to accompany clinical and educational activities was stressed, as was the importance of acquiring funding for these activities.
