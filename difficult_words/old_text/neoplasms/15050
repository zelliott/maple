Radiation therapy with charged particles, such as protons and heavier ions, provides physical selectivity and therefore allows for favorable dose distributions in comparison with conventional photon radiotherapy. Carbon ions furthermore exhibit biologic advantages related to their high linear energy transfer properties in a number of tumors known to be relatively insensitive to low-linear energy transfer radiation therapy. Over the last 2 decades, major developments in the fields of accelerator technology, diagnostic techniques, and beam delivery methods have been made. These developments formed the basis for the application of particle beams in clinical surroundings. Many clinical centers are already considering the introduction of radiation therapy with charged particles. This article reviews the clinical experience with particle therapy in adults available so far.
