Granulocytic sarcoma is an extramedullary tumor composed of immature granulocytic precursor cells. The most common sites of presentation are bone, periosteum, soft tissue, lymph node, skin, and infrequently small intestine. The tumor may develop during the course of acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia or other myelodysplastic disorders. It can occur without blood or bone marrow manifestations of leukemia and in this case, the diagnosis is difficult. Our patient was initially diagnosed as a case of T-cell non Hodgkin's lymphoma and received one cycle of CHOP with only transient improvement in his symptoms. Subsequently, his biopsy slides were reviewed at our centre and were reported as granulocytic sarcoma.
