In the autopsy material of 2932 men and 3051 women the frequency of fresh myocardial infarct and the severity of coronary atherosclerosis were highly significantly lower in the population suffering from malignancies than in that free of cancer. Lower frequency of myocardial infarct seems to result from lower severity of coronary atherosclerosis. The incidence rate of myocardial infarct was also significantly lower in the cancer--bearing group when both compared populations showed identical, severe (grade 4) coronary atherosclerosis. This observation seems to indicate lesser contribution of coronary spasm in cancerous population and justifies the discussion of possible significance of EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor) and catecholamines.
