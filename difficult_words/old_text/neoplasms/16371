This paper describes the evaluation of questions on a cancer risk factor survey using three different methods: dataset response patterns, qualitative feedback, and questionnaire appraisal. These methods addressed the survey data, procedures and questions. The three methods identified similar issues but also made unique contributions. Dataset response patterns showed missing and out-of-range data, an order effect, and mixed coding. Qualitative feedback revealed lack of clarity, sensitive topics, technical or undefined terms, failure to hear all response options, overlapping response options (as perceived by respondents), coding problems and recall difficulties. Questionnaire appraisal showed technical or undefined terms, complex syntax, hidden definitions, and ambiguous wording. The survey assessment methods described here can improve data quality, especially when limited time and resources preclude in-depth questionnaire development.
