A multifrequency (1 kHz-1 MHz) serial electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system has been developed. It is based on 16 active electrodes and can be extended up to 32. Each active electrode can be programmed for current driving and for measuring either the injected current or the voltage difference between adjacent electrodes, and includes calibration facilities. Real and imaginary parts of the impedance are obtained by applying a parametric identification method (extended Prony), but other techniques are easily adaptable. Image reconstruction is carried out using the Sheffield filtered back-projection algorithm. Characteristic frequency images are under development and should be of great interest to distinguish between normal and tumorous tissues.
