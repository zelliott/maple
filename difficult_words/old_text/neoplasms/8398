The aims of the present paper were: 1. to test a set of parameters suitable for quantifying morphological features; 2. to create a generally valuable strategy for data storage and for a user friendly data management; 3. to examine the parameter set and the conception for an optimal data management by the quantification of cytological specimens of pleural effusions. The significance of a distinction between "primary parameters" (data directly captured during the measurement) and "secondary data" (data calculated from the primary data) is explained. In the first step of classification of the cytological specimens 81.8% of the patients with reactive alterations of mesothelial cells (n = 11) and 100% of the patients with tumours (mesotheliomas and metastasis of adenocarcinomas) (n = 19) were correctly classified with the aid of a little "expert system". In the second step (discrimination between mesotheliomas (n = 6) and metastasis of adenocarcinomas (n = 13] all patients were correctly classified.
