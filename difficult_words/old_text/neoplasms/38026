Tissue factor (TF) is the primary initiator of the coagulation cascade and plays an essential role in hemostasis. TF also contributes to many diseases, including cancer. The correlation between thrombosis and cancer has been recognized for more than a century. However, it is only in the past two decades that we have begun to understand the role of TF in tumor biology. TF expression is upregulated on both tumor and host cells in cancer patients as well as in the circulation. Clinical observations indicate a direct correlation between the levels of tumor cell TF expression and poor prognosis for cancer patients. The role of TF in tumor biology has been extensively studied using various mouse tumor models. It has been demonstrated that tumor cell TF contributes to tumor metastasis, growth, and angiogenesis. The role of host TF in tumor progression is less clear. Recently developed mouse models with altered levels of TF may be useful in further analysis of the role of host cell TF in cancer.
