Brachytherapy presents the anaesthetist with unique problems. Information on anaesthesia for brachytherapy, however, is limited. The aim of this paper is to report on our experience involving a large number of brachytherapy procedures.

A retrospective analysis of records of 1622 anaesthetic procedures in 952 patients is presented. Records were analysed in respect of patient data, tumour localization, brachytherapy treatment and the type and duration of anaesthetic procedures.

More than one-third of patients were at high risk (ASA III or IV) and 40% were more than 60 yr. Repetitive treatments were performed on half of the patients. Breast cancer was the most common indication. The average duration of anaesthesia for pelvic brachytherapy was more than 3 h, with a high degree of variability. Regional anaesthesia was used in 30% of all cases and was the predominant technique for pelvic brachytherapy. Spinal catheter techniques represented a high proportion of those receiving regional anaesthesia. Complications resulting from regional and general anaesthesia were minor and no serious incidents occurred.

Based on a large number of procedures, this study gives an example of anaesthetic management in brachytherapy. A substantial minority of patients would be considered high risk for surgical intervention. Regional anaesthesia was the principal technique used when dealing with tumours of the lower body.
