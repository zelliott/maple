A proportionate analysis of cause of death in 1,401 commercial pressmen was initiated following a report of a cancer cluster in this group. The study found a significant elevated risk of all cancers [proportionate mortality ratio (PMR) = 127] and cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic system (PMR = 122), with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas responsible for much of the excess. Three deaths in the cohort were attributed to myelofibrosis, a rare disease associated with benzene exposure. A significantly elevated PMR was also detected for colorectal cancer (PMR = 171) and, among those employed 20 years or more, for cancers of the liver (PMR = 216) and pancreas (PMR = 162). No excess risk of bladder or lung cancer or leukemia was seen. Proportionate mortality analyses rarely show excess risk of both cancer and heart disease in a working population. Surprisingly, a significantly elevated risk of arteriosclerotic heart disease (PMR = 113) was found in this group. These findings indicate that solvent exposure may be associated with excess mortality risk in commercial pressmen.
