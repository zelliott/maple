A simple tumour-cell radiation-response model was coupled to a dose-calculation routine and applied to a clinical situation in radiation therapy. The dose distributions resulting from various settings of two radiation fields, as well as the tumour response under various assumptions regarding sensitivity and distribution of tumour cells, were calculated automatically. The probability of zero surviving tumour cells after 30 fractions was taken as a measure of goodness of the dose distributions and was found to vary rather smoothly over the parameter intervals considered. For some parameters a distinct optimum was found, rather insensitive to different assumptions regarding cell response. A tolerance factor for healthy tissue, based on a dose-volume relationship, was also considered. It is concluded that a cell kinetic approach to automatic optimisation of field parameters in external radiation therapy might be realistic both from computional and economic points of view.
