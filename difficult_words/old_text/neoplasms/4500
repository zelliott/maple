At present, no social support scale exists that is cancer-specific. The objective of the study was to develop a cancer-specific scale that not only had validity in reflecting the experiences of cancer patients, but also one that was quick and easy to use in a busy clinical environment. Sixty patients with a primary diagnosis of cancer were selected from oncology wards and out-patient clinics, and they were administered the Bottomley Social Support Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The results indicate a valid and reliable social support scale that could be used in conjunction with other measures in a clinical setting. The clinical implications of the measure are that it will allow medical and support staff to assess the levels of social support and implement any appropriate social support interventions.
