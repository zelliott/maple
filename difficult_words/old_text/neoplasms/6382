The p73 gene (1p36-33) is involved in cancer development through cell growth inhibition by inducing apoptosis in a p53-like manner. The p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 dinucleotide polymorphism, consisting of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the non-coding region of exon 2 that are in complete linkage disequilibrium, has been extensively studied in association with cancer risk. We performed a meta-analysis of published studies that examined the association between this p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 polymorphism and cancer by searching for relevant studies on Medline and Embase up to February 28, 2010. Pooling data from 19 case-control studies that included 6510 cancer cases and 5711 controls, we found that carriers of the p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 homozygous variant genotype (AT/AT) had an increased global risk of cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.65]. There was no evidence of an effect modification of p73 AT/AT by age, gender, ethnicity or smoking status in subgroup analyses; however, a 1.35-fold statistically significant increased risk was found among individuals &lt;55 years old. In case-only analysis, the homozygous p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 variant of p73 genotype was associated with the presence of the p53 exon 4 Arg72Pro allele (OR = 1.30, 95% CI, 1.02-1.64), which is suggestive of a biological interaction between the two genes in carcinogenesis. In conclusion, the p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 homozygous variant genotype might be a risk factor for cancer, especially in combination with the p53 exon 4 Arg72Pro polymorphism. Further studies looking at p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 and p53 exon 4 Arg72Pro interaction are required to support our findings.
