Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous group of disorders, characterized by decreased serum levels of immunoglobulins and abnormal antibody response to protein and/or polysaccharide antigens, leading to recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, autoimmunity and malignancies. Meanwhile, several monogenic defects with CVID-like phenotype have been identified during the last decade. There is a need to reach international consensus by modifying criteria for CVID, considering various areas of uncertainty in the field.
