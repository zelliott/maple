Nausea and emesis during cancer chemotherapy are very common, but can often be controlled with repetitive boli of antiemetic drugs. However, some patients, especially those with anticipatory symptoms, experience nausea and emesis despite antiemetic prophylaxis. An increased participation of these patients in the prophylaxis and treatment of these highly subjective symptoms may lead to better palliation. A patient-controlled infusion pump was assessed in nine patients receiving cisplatin, in whom high-dose metoclopramide (5 mg/kg) had failed (greater than 3 emetic episodes) during previous treatment cycles. Improved palliation was achieved in every case with on-demand boli in combination with a continuous infusion of metoclopramide or droperidol. Eight of the nine patients preferred the patient-controlled system to the conventional fixed-dose bolus regimens. The infusion pump functioned safely and reliably. Antiemetic treatment with the patient-controlled device was superior to previous conventional methods in this group of difficult-to-treat patients.
