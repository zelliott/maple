The risks of steroidal contraception as reviewed by the Central Medical Committee of the International Planned Parenthood Federation in April 1970 are presented and discussed.  The causal relationship between the use of steroidal contraceptives and thromboembolic disease is accepted, but the complication is considered very rare.  It is recommended that oral formulations containing less than 50 micrograms of estrogen be used wherever possible, but for those women who need a higher estrogen content, it is still responsible to prescribe it.  No adequate evidence has been obtained linking steroidal contraception in any relationship with cancer or fetal abnormalities.  Estrogen administration possibly produces an adverse change in the quantity and quality of milk and the duration of lactation.  Rare cases of jaundice and hypertension appear to be sometimes associated with oral contraceptive use and are easily reversible.  Changes in glucose tolerance and serum lipids appear to occur under steroidal administration and are reversible.  It is possible that those women with a history of irregular menstruation prior to taking the pill may experience prolonged anovulation after ceasing pill use.  Mental changes reported due to oral contraceptives are highly subjective in nature and difficult to evaluate.  It is concluded that the pill is highly effective as a method of family planning and is a significant factor in world health presenting no risks that justify discontinuation of its use.
