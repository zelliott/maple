Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is one of many interesting triterpenoic acids showing anticancerogenic potential. GA is known to trigger apoptosis in tumour cell lines, although GA has a low cytotoxicity. In our study we were able to prepare derivatives of GA that show lowered the IC(50) values as determined by a sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay using 15 different human tumour cell lines. Thus, combining an ester group combined with the presence of an amino acid moiety led to a ca. 60-fold improved antitumor activity. Experiments on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NiH3T3) revealed that these compounds showed a better selectivity for tumour cells compared to the parent compound GA. An apoptotic effect of some of these compounds was determined using an acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) test and DNA laddering experiments.
