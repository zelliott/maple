Experimental procedures are described for the radiolocalization of human tumors by murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) in animal model systems. Visualization of tumor xenografts was clearer in nude mice as compared to experimentally immunosuppressed mice due to the higher viability of the tumors in nude mice. MAb localization in tumor tissue was greatly enhanced when F(ab')2 fragments rather than intact antibody molecules were used. Although tumors could be visualized with either 131I-, 123I- or 111In-labeled MAb fragments without using background subtraction, tumor-to-background ratios of radioactivity were highest for 131I-labeled fragments. 131I-labeled F(ab')2 fragments of eight MAb against human colorectal carcinoma, melanoma or lung carcinoma localized specifically only in those tumors that bound the MAb in vitro and not in unrelated tumors. Radiolabeled fragments of MAb with other specificities (anti-hepatitis virus MAb) did not localize in tumors. All MAb that inhibited tumor growth in nude mice effectively localized these tumors by gamma-scintigraphy. On the other hand, some MAb were effective in localizing tumors but ineffective in inhibiting their growth. The ability of the specific radiolabeled F(ab')2 fragments to localize in tumor grafts correlated significantly with MAb binding affinity and density of antigenic sites on tumor cells together, but not with either in vitro binding parameter alone. Thus, Scatchard analysis of MAb binding to tumor cells may be an effective means to screen for MAb with tumor radiolocalization potential.
