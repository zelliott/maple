Malignant tumours mortality among residents of the city of Verona (267,703 at 31-12-1980) during the year 1980 is assessed from the ISTAT individual death cards and/or municipal death certificates (especially in the case of deaths outside the municipality). The figures are broken down by site, apparatus or system (in accordance with the VIII-ICD), sex, age at death, and compared with the Italian mortality figures for 1976 (indirectly standardised) and those for the province of Verona for 1976-77 (directly standardised). Tumour mortality per site was generally higher than the Italian level. This is line with the differences noted between geographical areas and the similarity of the rates in more industrialised areas. A salient finding was that lung tumour mortality exceeded that for the province of Varese, which is among the highest in Italy entered on the Register of Tumours. Genital and breast tumours were responsible for the highest number of deaths in women, while stomach cancer was the second cause of death in both sexes. The study will be completed with an analysis of tumour deaths during 1980 and 1981 in the province of Verona as a whole.
