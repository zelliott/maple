Teniposide and etoposide are third-generation semi-synthetic derivatives of epipodophyllotoxin. Following the initial clinical introduction of teniposide in the 1970s, investigations focused almost exclusively on its analogue, etoposide, because of its formulation, which was felt to have advantages in addition to oral administration. Despite consistently inadequate dosing and scheduling, early phase I and II trial results with teniposide were promising, and current trends encourage a second look. The substantial antitumor activity of teniposide is comparable with that of etoposide, and clinical interest was rekindled when it was shown to have considerable activity against small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In view of the inadequacy of early trials and the premature cessation of clinical study, it is recommended that teniposide be reevaluated for its activity against malignant lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease, leukemias, and SCLC, against all of which its early results were encouraging. In addition, consideration should be given to its activity against brain tumors, neuroblastomas and other childhood solid tumors, and ovarian cancer; its potential value against gastric, hepatocellular, breast, and bladder cancers also should be investigated. Other areas that warrant further study include elucidation of the exact mechanism of action of teniposide, its role in both single- and multiple-agent chemotherapeutic regimens, and resolution of its optimal dose and schedule. Finally, it is suggested that with new routes of administration and improved formulations, teniposide may be expected to play a significant role in the treatment of malignant lymphomas, SCLC, and pediatric lymphocytic leukemia and neuroblastoma.
