Cancer mortality peaked in the European Union (EU) in the late 1980s and declined thereafter.

We analyzed EU cancer mortality data provided by the World Health Organization in 1970-2003, using join point analysis.

Overall, cancer mortality levelled off in men since 1988 and declined in 1993-2003 (annual percent change, APC = -1.3%). In women, a steady decline has been observed since the early 1970s. The decline in male cancer mortality has been driven by lung cancer, which levelled off since the late 1980s and declined thereafter (APC = 2.7% in 1997-2003). Recent decreases were also observed for other tobacco-related cancers, as oral cavity/pharynx, esophagus, larynx and bladder, as well as for colorectal (APC = -0.9% in 1992-2003) and prostate cancers (APC = -1.0% in 1994-2003). In women, breast cancer mortality levelled off since the early 1990s and declined thereafter (APC = -1.0% in 1998-2003). Female mortality declined through the period 1970-2003 for colorectal and uterine cancer, while it increased over the last three decades for lung cancer (APC = 4.6% in 2001-2003). In both sexes, mortality declined in 1970-2003 for stomach cancer and for a few cancers amenable to treatment.

This update analysis of the mortality from cancer in the EU shows favorable patterns over recent years in both sexes.
