In view of the fact that conventional therapies continue to yield unsatisfactory results, a therapy based on tumor immunology is of increasing interest. The results of some clinical immunotherapy studies have shown that the mechanism of tolerance induced by tumors is of critical importance. There are several mechanisms to be recognized by the tumor, such asanergy, immunosuppressive cytokines, immunodeviation and dysfunction of the T-lymphocytes. The so-called tumor escape mechanisms, which often refer to molecules that contribute to the recognition of antigens and activation of specific T cells, also lead to immunological tolerance. Immunotherapies based on gene-modified tumor cells, peptide-pulsed antigen presenting cells (APC) or antibody therapies to activate immune cells, have a fairly reasonable chance of being successful if immunological tolerance can be understood and influenced. Time will show if combining all sorts of immunotherapy that are based on different strategies, can induce tumor rejection more efficiently. In the scope of multimodal therapy concepts, immunotherapy only seems to be reasonable if the immunological tolerance that was induced by tumors can be overcome. Immunological markers are of crucial importance, not only for the therapy but also for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer patients.
