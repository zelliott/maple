A 4-month-old infant with a congenital, darkly pigmented, macular lesion involving the subungual and periungual areas of the right ring finger is described. The lesion was excised when the infant was 6 months old in order to rule out a congenital pigmented nevus as well as a congenital acrolentiginous melanoma. Histopathologic examination revealed a compound nevus. Nevi in this location are very rare in Caucasians at any age and should probably be excised to rule out malignant melanoma.
