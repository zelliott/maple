This review presents an overview and discussion of the potential synergistic strategies of radiation therapy and gene transfer for treating neoplastic disease. Topics discussed include radiation-inducible promoters coupled to genes which produce proteins that are cytotoxic or enhance radiosensitivity, employment of molecular chemotherapy approaches in conjunction with radiation therapy, and genetic induction of radiosensitization through modification of DNA repair, signal transduction, and cell cycle control genes. Additional topics discussed relate to gene transfer augmentation of radioimmunotherapy of cancer. Specifically, gene transfer methods to genetically induce tumor cells to express enhanced levels of cell surface antigens and receptors to increase radiolabeled antibody and peptide targeting and thus increase their therapeutic effect, selection of radionuclides for therapeutic ligand labeling, and computer simulation of genetic tumor-specific delivery of radiolabeled ligands are proposed.
