The objective of the study is to evaluate the importance of home care for patients with advanced tumor diseases and for their families.

The analysis was based on structured interviews with relatives of patients with terminal tumor diseases. They had participated in the home care of 50 consecutively treated patients 2 years previously. The value of home care was evaluated on the basis of the personal experience of those concerned.

The answers were largely consistent. The holistic concept of palliative therapy could be implemented by a specialized home care team at a high quality level. Under the favorable conditions of the familiar surroundings, an atmosphere of trust developed as a result of the cooperation with the family members, people close to the patients and with family doctors. It contributed to a relatively high quality of life and to alleviate the emotional stress. Most of those involved were able to accept the hand of fate. On this basis, the terminal phase could be satisfactorily arranged and preparations made for a good quality of death. During the home care, appreciation of the value of the family increased. The intensified family relations were mostly sustained after the patient's death. The results document the great personal importance of home care for patients, their caretakers and families.

The positive experience and the awareness of having contributed substantially to coping with the life crisis made it easier for the bereaved to grieve and to rearrange their life.
