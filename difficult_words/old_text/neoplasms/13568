Exatecan mesylate (DX-8951f) is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that has increased solubility and antitumor activity compared with other topoisomerase I inhibitors. The purpose of this study was to establish a safe dose of DX-8951f given as a weekly 24-h infusion 3 of every 4 weeks. DX-8951f was administered as a 24-h continuous infusion in escalating doses. Twenty-seven patients were treated with 81 courses of the drug. Dose-limiting toxicities included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and inability to administer all three doses in the first cycle. In minimally pretreated patients, a dose of 0.8 mg/m(2) was tolerable. In patients who were heavily pretreated, a slightly lower dose, 0.53 mg/m(2), was tolerated without any severe toxicities. Nonhematological toxicities were mild and consisted of mild diarrhea, asthenia, mild nausea, and constipation. Pharmacokinetic parameters could be well described with a one-compartment model in most patients, although the application of the one-compartment model probably resulted in an underestimated elimination half-life. In conclusion, the recommended Phase II dose for DX-8951f administered as a weekly 24-h infusion on a 3-of-4 week schedule is 0.8 mg/m(2) in minimally pretreated patients and 0.53 mg/m(2) in patients who are heavily pretreated.
