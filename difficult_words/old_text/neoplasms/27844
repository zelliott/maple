The present-day problem is the development of effective methods of general anesthesia and postoperative anesthesia on the basis of nonopiate central analgesics possessing no hazardous side effects of opiates. A study was made of synthetic analgesics of the last generation as agents for intra- and postoperative anesthesia as compared with conventional opiates. It has been established that synthetic analgesics belonging to the class of opiate agonists-antagonists, namely moradol and norphine, compare favourably enough with fentanyl. They are superior to fentanyl in antistressor properties, provide for a more powerful and longer analgesic effect and can replace conventional opiates in all the stages of surgical treatment of the patients. This is particularly important for the oncological clinic where opiates are to be preserved as reserve for the treatment of chronic painful syndrome.
