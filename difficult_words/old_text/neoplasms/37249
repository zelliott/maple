The elderly population is rapidly increasing in Western countries. Old age indirectly represents one of the most important risk factors for the development of neoplasias. In Italy in 1991 a total of 14,572 deaths from tumours were recorded, equivalent to 27% of all deaths; of these over 66% affected individuals aged over 65 years old. In the 65-74 age bracket mortality caused by tumour is the prime cause of death in Italy and is undergoing an exponential increase over time. The most frequently found tumours and above all the cause of the greatest number of deaths in the elderly population are lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, stomach cancer. To date the only weapon that has proved efficacious in some tumours (breast, colon-rectal, prostate, melanoma) is early diagnosis through screening and adequate treatment. The elderly are an extremely heterogeneous population and it is therefore not easy to provide guidelines that are applicable to the entire population. Firstly, it is important to provide more information in order to permit effective and targeted prevention. In order to fulfil this objective, structures offering the necessary equipment and skills will have to be create; training must be provided for personnel in this type of preventive medicine; lastly, the awareness of doctors towards this type of medicine must be increased by providing the correct information.
