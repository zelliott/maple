Mosaic variegated aneuploidy is a rare recessive condition characterized by growth retardation, microcephaly, childhood cancer and constitutional mosaicism for chromosomal gains and losses. In five families with mosaic variegated aneuploidy, including two with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, we identified truncating and missense mutations of BUB1B, which encodes BUBR1, a key protein in the mitotic spindle checkpoint. These data are the first to relate germline mutations in a spindle checkpoint gene with a human disorder and strongly support a causal link between aneuploidy and cancer development.
