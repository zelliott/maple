The PEA3 group is composed of three highly conserved Ets transcription factors: Erm, Er81, and Pea3. These proteins regulate transcription of multiple genes, and their transactivating potential is affected by post-translational modifications. Among their target genes are several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), which are enzymes degrading the extracellular matrix during normal remodelling events and cancer metastasis. In fact, PEA3-group genes are often over-expressed in different types of cancers that also over-express these MMPs and display a disseminating phenotype. Experimental regulation of the synthesis of PEA3 group members influences the metastatic process. This suggests that these factors play a key role in metastasis.
