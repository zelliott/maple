to observe the effect of ICA on the immunosuppressive and bone-marrow-suppressive mice after chemotherapy, and explore the machanism of hematopoietic and immunologic function in mice accentuated by ICA.

mice were injected Cy intraperitoneally except control group , then randomly divided into mode group(saline), positive (Shenqi, 1 mL/d)group, ICA groups(150, 80, 40 mg/kg.d). All mice were treated respectively for 10 successive days. The pathological changes of thymus were observed by HE staining. Killing activity of peritoneal macrophage were measured by LDH kits and its production of TNF-Î± and IL-12 was measured by ELISA kits. Population of white blood cells (WBC), red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) in the peripheral blood were detected with automated blood cell counter (ABCC). Hemogram of peripheral blood and bone marrow morphology were observed under the microscope.

ICA could protect the thymus and bone marrow from damage. The proliferation of lymphocyte and killing activity of macrophage cells in ICA treatment groups was all enhanced, moreover, the population of WBC, RBC and PLT were increased significantly.

ICA can improve the state of immunosuppressive and myelosuppressive mice caused by Cy thus could alleviate the side effect of chemotherapy effectively.
