In an investigation of correlation and factor analysis the relations between cell-mediated stromalreactions and immunological parameters are checked in 63 patients with malignant tumours. The stromalreaction is determined semi-quantitatively as a cell-mediated infiltration of the tumour by neutrophiles, lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. In regard to immunological parameters circulating immuncomplexes, K-cell-activity, auto-antibodies, B- and T-cells and immunglobulins are determined among others. It is shown that the stromalreaction is to be regarded as a part of an immunological answer of the organism against the tumour.
