Many molecular target drugs have been developed based on the progress in the study of molecular biology. Majority of treatment for common malignancy include molecular target drugs. Patients selection has become possible by pharmacogenomical tests in some molecular target therapy. Development of active molecular target therapy will enable the increment of curative populations even in advanced malignancies. Intensive proof of principle study will open doors for the identification of new molecular targets.
