Totally implantable central venous access devices (ports) have been available for over 10 years but have not achieved widespread use in paediatric oncology patients. We reviewed our experience with these devices over 9 years to assess their safety and acceptability.

We conducted a retrospective review of insertion technique and reasons for removal of all ports placed in paediatric oncology patients in this hospital between 1989 and 1996, with follow-up until 1998. Acceptability of both ports and external catheters was assessed by a questionnaire in a subgroup of families attending the oncology clinic.

One hundred forty-nine ports were inserted during the study period. The median catheter life was 399 days (4-1,406), with a total of 69,342 catheter days. Sixty-nine percent of ports were removed electively at the end of treatment; 8% required removal because of infection and 5% because of blockage. No ports were accidentally dislodged or damaged. Children experienced significantly less restriction of activity with a port compared to an external catheter and greatly preferred the cosmetic appearance. The need for needle insertion to access the port was not seen as a disadvantage by most families.

Ports can provide satisfactory central venous access for the majority of paediatric oncology patients, with a low risk of line-related complications and a high degree of acceptability to children and their parents.
