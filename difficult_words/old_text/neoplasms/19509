To evaluate the extent to which adenocarcinomas in body cavity fluids express GLUT-1 in comparison to currently available markers for adenocarcinomas.

Archival paraffin-embedded cell blocks of serous fluids from 25 cases of benign effusions containing reactive mesothelial cells and 39 cases of malignant effusions with metastatic adenocarcinoma (11 ovarian, 11 pulmonary, 9 gastrointestinal and 8 breast) were retrieved from the surgical pathology files. All cases were stained with antibodies for GLUT-1, Ber-Ep4, B72.3 and CEA. Positive staining was defined as distinct linear membrane staining for GLUT-1 and Ber-EP4, cytoplasmic staining for CEA, and cytoplasmic or membrane staining for B72.3. Strong staining in at least 10% of the tumor cells was required in order to consider the case positive for the particular marker.

GLUT-1 was expressed in 72% (28 of 39) of cases of malignant effusions: 100% (11 of 11) from the ovary, 91% (10 of 11) from the lung, 67% (6 of 9) from the gastrointestinal tract and 12% (1 of 8) from the breast. None (0 of 25) of the benign effusions expressed GLUT-1. Malignant effusions expressed CEA in 74% (29 of 39), Ber-Ep4 in 85% (33 of 39), and B72.3 in 62% (24 of 39). Benign effusions expressed CEA in 3 cases and B72.3 in 2 cases.

GLUT-1 is a useful marker that can be applied to cytologic specimens. It can be used as a reliable component of an antibody panel to distinguish reactive mesothelial cells from metastatic adenocarcinoma in particular adenocarcinomas of body cavity effusions, in particular adenocarcinomas of ovarian and pulmonary origin.
