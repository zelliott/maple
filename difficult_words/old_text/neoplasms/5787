Progressive muscle relaxation combined with guided imagery has the potential to promote relief of cancer pain. The techniques appear to produce a relaxation response that may break the pain-muscle-tension-anxiety cycle and facilitate pain relief through a calming effect. The techniques can be taught by nurses and readily learned by patients. The techniques provide a self-care strategy that, to a limited extent, shifts the locus of control from clinician to patient.
