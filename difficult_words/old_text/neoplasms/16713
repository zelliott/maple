The bone scintigrams of 600 patients performed over a 12-month period were reviewed. Thirty-six demonstrated abnormalities of the urinary tract of which six cases of intense renal parenchymal activity ("hot kidneys") were found. Two cases were related to treatment with the new antineoplastic agent mitoxantrone. In one patient it was related to treatment with calcitonin. Neither of these associations has been previously reported. Recognized causes of hypercalcemia and recent radiotherapy were present in two patients. No cause could be found in the final patient.
