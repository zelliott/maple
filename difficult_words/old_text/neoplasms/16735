Efficacy of the cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, was compared with that of the combination of the aminoglycoside, netilmicin, and the penicillin, azlocillin, in the treatment of febrile episodes in immunocompromised neutropenic children undergoing chemotherapy for neoplastic disease. During 100 separate febrile episodes, 40 strains of bacteria were isolated from the blood of 34 patients and a further 55 strains from other sites. Nine strains (four of which were staphylococci) to both netilmicin and azlocillin. There was no difference in clinical response between the two therapeutic regimens as assessed 4 and 7 days after treatment began. Ceftriaxone had the considerable practical advantages of once daily dosage without a need for blood monitoring. Ceftriaxone would appear to be effective as initial monotherapy in the treatment of bacterial infections in severely neutropenic children.
