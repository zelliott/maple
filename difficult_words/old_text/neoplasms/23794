In paediatric oncology, the surgeon working in a multidisciplinary team can be called upon to intervene at all stages of the disease. At the time of diagnosis, he performs the biopsy, with or without excision of the tumour. He can also intervene for removal of a residual lesion or to evaluate the response after initial chemotherapy. He occasionally is required for metastatic surgery, or more rarely, for palliative surgery.
