Carcinomatous ascites (CA) is not an uncommon manifestation of a metastatic neoplasia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of peritoneovenous shunt (PVS) in patients with CA refractory to conventional management. Twelve patients in whom a PVS was placed with palliative intention were studied. One patient died in the postoperative period. Permanent control of the ascites was achieved in 7 (63.6%) of the remaining patients. PVS obstruction occurred in 4 patients (36.4%) and no other complications related to the shunt were seen. Results were better in CA of gynecological origin but without reaching significant statistical differences. We conclude that PVS can be useful for palliation of CA with a low complication rate.
