This paper deals with the physician-patient encounter. In France, the current legal framework allows patients to be informed (patients' rights to health information) and to participate to decisions regarding their own health. In such a context, this paper aims to give the reader the broad key components of the so-called 'patient treatment preferences elicitation process' in breast cancer, our research area.

We first present the general context, with a definition of the different physician-patient models. We then present decision aids, tools that aim to provide high-quality information to patients in the decision-making process. Finally, based on our previous studies and on examples drawn from the international literature, we present the empirical process of patients' preferences elicitation, which not only increases patients' knowledge of and satisfaction with the decision made, but also allows patients to be part of their disease management.

Far from being a phenomenon in the air supported by a legal system, this method developed in the 90s allows patients and more generally healthcare users to be autonomous without constraining them to a choice.
