The measurement of apoptosis in peripheral blood might represent a useful tool in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and cancer research. Among the many assays that are currently used to identify apoptotic leukocytes, flow cytometric methods are the most valuable in terms of rapidity, simplicity, and level of analytical detail. Some flow cytometric assays may also offer the additional advantage of detecting the earliest phases of apoptosis, which is paramount importance for measuring apoptotic cells in vivo before they are destroyed by phagocytes.
