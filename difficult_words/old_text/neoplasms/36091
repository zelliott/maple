Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in China. The study aimed to examine the temporal trend of cancer mortality rate during 1989-2008 in urban and rural areas of China.

The mortality data of all cancers from 1989 to 2008 from National Cancer Registry database were sorted and checked. Age standardized mortality rates were calculated by the direct methods using the China population of 1982 and World Segi's population. Joinpoint regression was performed to obtain the annual percentage changes (APC) in mortality rates. The top ten cancer sites were calculated and analyzed. The mortality rates were compared with statistics of the United States.

From 1989 to 2008, the trend of crude cancer mortality increased with an annual percentage change (APC) of 1.0%. After age standardization, the mortality rate was significantly decreased, with an APC of -1.2%. In urban areas, lung cancer was the most common cancer of death, whereas in rural areas, stomach cancer and esophageal cancer remained top cancers of death. Especially, in both urban and rural areas, the mortality of lung cancer was on increase. The mortality rates of stomach and esophageal cancers showed a decrease in urban areas. Compared with the cancer mortality rates of the United States, the Chinese cancer mortality rate in males remained highest. The decreasing trend of cancer mortality in females of China was less obvious than that of the United States.

The crude mortality rates of cancer in China show an increase whereas the age standardized mortality raters has declined between 1989 and 2008. Cancer is still a major public health issue threatening people's life in China. Effective intervention for cancer control and prevention is needed in the future.
