To obtain an optimal premedication protocol for paclitaxel liposome (Lipusu) in the treatment of solid tumors.

From February 2005 to September 2007, 53 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (16 cases), breast cancer (14 cases), esophagus cancer (six cases), gastric cancer (16 cases), head and neck cancer (one case) were recruited from the Department of Chemotherapy, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital and Research Institute. Lipusu was delivered at 175 mg/m(2) (triweekly or divided into weekly) as a component of combined chemotherapy. Several premedications were attempted (detailed in the text).

The toxicity profile of premedications included: insomnia (five cases), dysphoria (three cases), hyperglycemia (two cases), fatigue (two cases), abdominal distension (one case), and vertigo (one case). No treatment-related death occurred.

Our recommendations for the premedication of Lipusu in the treatment of solid tumors are: (1) methylprednisolone 40 mg, administered intravenously 30 min before Lipusu, and granisetron 30 min before chemotherapy, (2) dexamethasone 2.25-3 mg taken orally 12 h and 2 h before Lipusu, and granisetron 30 min before chemotherapy.
