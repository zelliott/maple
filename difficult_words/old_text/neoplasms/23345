Patients with cancer are at high risk to develop venous thromboembolism as well as arterial thrombosis. Well established treatment patterns of these vascular complications are often hampered in cancer patients by disturbances of coagulation or thrombocytopenia. Therefore standardized interventions or medical treatment can be difficult to perform. As data from clinical trials or recommendations from guidelines are sparse, complicated cases have to be dealt with an interdisciplinary single patient approach. Thus in patients with STEMI application of a drug eluting stent which might be the best treatment in a non-cancer patient may not be feasible. In cancer patients with venous thromboembolism and bleeding the implantation of a vena cava filter might be necessary.
