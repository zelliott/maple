Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neoplasia. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has recently been shown to be a predominant regulator of IGFBP-2 at the protein level in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. However, there are gaps in knowledge with respect to the molecular mechanisms that underlie this regulation. Here, we show that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulates IGFBP-2 protein levels by modulating IGFBP-2 mRNA abundance in MCF-7 cells. This change is achieved by regulating transcription through a critical region present in the first 200&#x00A0;bp upstream of the transcription initiation site where Sp1 transcription factor binds and drives transcription. IGF-1 treatment leads to increased nuclear abundance of Sp1 and increased IGFBP-2 mRNA and protein levels. Rapamycin and LY294002 induce a decline in Sp1 nuclear abundance and IGFBP-2 mRNA and protein levels. This work provides a mechanistic explanation for the observed effects of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway on IGFBP-2 levels in MCF-7 cells.
