A 3-5-min spontaneous hyperventilation caused normalization of initially altered electroencephalogram and inactivation of hypothalamic structures in 14 patients with malignant tumors, as well as negative dynamics of bioelectrical brain activity and activation of diencephalic area in 6 healthy subjects. In hyperventilation ACTH plasma concentration increased 13-fold on average (from 14.2 +/- 12.1, to 185 +/- 82 pg/ml) in normal subjects and 2.4-fold (from 45.5 +/- 19.8 to 110 +/- 17 pg/ml) in oncological patients. It is assumed that changes in hypothalamo-hypophyseal reactivity in patients with malignant neoplasias can be associated with generalized intracellular metabolic acidosis, partially, compensated by gas alkalosis in the plasma due to hyperventilation.
