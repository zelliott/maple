Vasculitis is the inflammation of blood vessels that leads to loss of perfusion and ischemia with necrosis. When this occurs in the orbit, the consequences are typically very conspicuous and can be devastating with decreased quality of life and loss of vision. Systemic vasculitides are often related to ophthalmic disorders, which can serve as the first diagnostic manifestation of potentially life-threatening disease. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis), Behcet's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus are a few of the diseases commonly associated with ocular vasculitis. Collaboration between ophthalmologists and rheumatologists is important in the successful diagnosis and treatment of patients with vasculitis.
