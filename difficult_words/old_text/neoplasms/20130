The preparation of a number of amines related to haematoporphyrin (HP) and haematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) have been studied and their composition and structure discussed through examination of their 1H, 13C NMR and mass spectral data and other physical properties. In vitro biological studies have been carried out and have shown these amines to have a similar photodynamic efficiency to that of HPD. One of these showed cytotoxic properties at exceptionally low light energy levels.
