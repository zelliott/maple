The investigation was concerned with the role of enzymouria in the assessment of nephrotoxic effects identified in 19 children with malignant solid tumors who received cisplatin polychemotherapy in a dose of 100 mg/sq.m or iphosphamide in a dose 9 g/sq.m. Chemotherapy application was followed by a persistent hyperenzymouria involving significantly higher levels of N-acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidase, beta-glutamyl transferase and alanine aminopeptidase in the urine, as compared with basal indices. Iphosphamide treatment showed significantly higher levels of enzymouria than those in cisplatin-treated patients. Higher than normal creatinine and urea concentrations were recorded only in 2 out of 9 patients receiving iphosphamide. Enzymouria evaluation was shown to be an effective method of nephrotoxic diagnosis.
