EcoRI restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) at the human c-mos locus were analysed in DNAs of normal individuals and tumour patients. Two alleles with fragment lengths of 2.6 kb (A1) and 5.6 kb (A2) respectively were detected. The allele distribution among the tumour group was similar to that of the control group. No difference was found between the allele frequencies in leucocytes and tumour tissue DNA of the same patients.
