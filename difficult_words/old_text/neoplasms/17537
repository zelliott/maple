In order to reduce the lipoprotein-related risk of coronary heart disease, nutritional recommendations have been formulated for use by communities prone to atherosclerosis and its complications. As such recommendations are potentially of widespread application they require careful scrutiny to assess possible risks as well as benefits. Epidemiological, clinical and experimental data concerning relationships between these nutrients and non-cardiovascular diseases are reviewed with emphasis on cancer mortality. Changes in intake of fats, including polyunsaturated fat, of cholesterol, carbohydrate, fibre, sodium and beta-carotene are discussed, and evidence of a relationship between serum cholesterol concentration and cancer is examined. These considerations offer reasonable reassurance as to the safety of recent dietary recommendations for the reduction of coronary heart disease.
