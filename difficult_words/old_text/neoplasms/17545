A sensitive method for human lectin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (LDCC) is presented using HEp-2 adherent human epipharynx carcinoma cells as targets. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by detachment from the monolayer of 3H-TdR-prelabelled HEp-2 cells. Maximal LDCC was obtained in a 24 h assay with a Con A dose of 25 micrograms/ml for 50 : 1 effector-target cell ratio requiring only 2500 target cells per well. Testing of five different lymphocyte fractions: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), monocyte-enriched adherent cells (AC), monocyte-depleted non-adherent cells (non-AC), T and non-T lymphocytes as effector cells from 25 normal individuals, suggests that LDCC to HEp-2 targets is mediated by T lymphocytes.
