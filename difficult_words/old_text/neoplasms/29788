This report discusses the optical and thermal distribution during photoradiation therapy of malignant tumors. Emphasis is put on the therapeutic procedure with the light dose delivered through an inserted optical fiber. Theoretical predictions and experimental results indicate that the temperature rise during the procedure may give rise to hyperthermal cell kill. The report discusses the extent of the regions with hyperthermal bioeffects in terms of tissue parameters as optical absorption and scattering, thermal conductivity, specific heat, blood flow, and optical dose parameters as optical power and exposure time.
