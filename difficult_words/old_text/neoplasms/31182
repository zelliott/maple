The Australian Cancer Society has published guidelines for recommended risk reduction strategies for breast, cervical, smoking-related and skin cancer. While knowledge may not be sufficient for change, it is argued to be necessary for change to occur. A measure of the level of health knowledge in the community can be useful for health promotion practitioners, identifying where health messages are not reaching their proposed targets. Our aims were to examine the level of knowledge about risk reduction practices for breast, cervical, smoking-related and skin cancers, for a rural New South Wales sample, and to examine sex and age effects on knowledge levels. A survey of 2846 women and 1732 men from rural New South Wales, which used an unprompted recall strategy, revealed some notable deficits in recall of cancer risk reduction practices: only 26 per cent of women identified mammograms as a risk reduction strategy for breast cancer; only 5 per cent of women knew at which ages mammograms should start and stop; only 6 per cent of women could identify when Pap tests should be discontinued; less than half of the sample could identify common solar protection strategies; and less than one-third of people identified passive smoking as a lung cancer risk.
