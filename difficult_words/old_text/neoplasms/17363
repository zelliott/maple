Tumour cell-selective activation of apoptosis by recombinant human TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (rhTRAIL) is enhanced through co-activation of p53 by chemotherapeutic drugs. The novel anticancer agent nutlin-3 provides a promising alternative for p53 activation by disrupting the interaction between p53 and its negative feedback regulator MDM2.

We examined whether nutlin-3 enhances apoptosis induction by rhTRAIL and the DR5-selective TRAIL variant D269H/E195R in wild-type p53-expressing ovarian, colon and lung cancer cell lines and in an ex vivo model of human ovarian cancer.

Nutlin-3 enhanced p53, p21, MDM2 and DR5 surface expression. Although nutlin-3 did not induce apoptosis, it preferentially enhanced D269H/E195R-induced apoptosis over rhTRAIL. Combination treatment potentiated the cleavage of caspases 8, 9, 3 and PARP. P53 and MDM2 siRNA experiments showed that this enhanced apoptotic effect was mediated by wild-type p53. Indeed, nutlin-3 did not enhance rhTRAIL-induced apoptosis in OVCAR-3 cells harbouring mutant p53. Addition of the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin to the combination further increased p53 and DR5 levels and rhTRAIL- and D269H/E195R-induced apoptosis. As a proof of concept, we show that the combination of D269H/E195R, nutlin-3 and cisplatin induced massive apoptosis in ex vivo tissue slices of primary human ovarian cancers.

Nutlin-3 is a potent enhancer of D269H/E195R-induced apoptosis in wild-type p53-expressing cancer cells. Addition of DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin further enhances DR5-mediated apoptosis.
