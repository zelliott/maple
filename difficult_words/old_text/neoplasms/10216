Adenovirus (Ad)-based gene transfer has been successfully utilised in gene therapy and vaccine applications. To date, an increasing number of human clinical trials utilise recombinant Ad-based vectors as a gene transfer platform. In particular, progress has been made recently in utilising Ad-based vectors as a vaccine platform in HIV, cancer immunotherapy approaches and in vaccination for other infections. Despite these successes, the scientific and bio-industrial communities have recently recognised that innate and pre-existing immunity against Ad vectors can constitute a serious obstacle to the development and application of this technology. It is essential to overcome vector-mediated immune responses, such as production of inflammatory cytokines and pre-existing immunity to Ad, because the induction of these responses not only shortens the period of gene expression but also leads to serious side effects. This review focuses on the biology of Ad infection and the approaches that are being adopted to overcome immunity against the Ad-based vectors.
