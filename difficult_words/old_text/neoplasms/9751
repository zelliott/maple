Computerized tomography (CT) was used in the evaluation or follow-up of 89 patients with malignant tumors. Excellent correlation was found between the preoperative CT findings and those at surgical resection of the tumor in 52 patients. Ct scan was the only test demonstrating the tumor mass in 18% and was superior to other tests in 67% of patients. When used as a follow-up test to detect recurrence in 74 patients, it was the first test to reveal recurrence in 30.5% of 36 patients who developed recurrence. It was false negative in one patient, and gave rise to false positive interpretations in seven patients. Overall, the CT scan was superior to conventional radiologic techniques, but the latter are not replaced completely and remain essential in the pertinent anatomical situations.
