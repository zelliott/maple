Economics has been described as the science of allocating scarce resources. Given the magnitude of the cancer problem and the obvious impracticality of eliminating every carcinogen or screening every person for every disease, our success in preventing cancer will depend greatly on our ability to use available resources efficiently. This paper will illustrate the principles of economics applied to the early detection of cancer of the lung, breast, colon, and cervix. The objective is to deliver the highest benefit possible. The available options include choice of the population to be screened (e.g., ages and risk factors), the tests to be used, and the frequency of examinations. The issues to be considered in making these choices include the expected benefits of early detection, the risks and side effects of the tests, the acceptibility of the program, the costs of the tests, the consequences of false positives, changes in therapy, and decrease in disability and lost earnings. The final choice of an "optimal" early detection protocol requires estimating and comparing these and other outcomes. This is a question of expectations and values; there is no "correct" answer or "best" program. These issues also have implications for the feasibility and prospects for third-party reimbursement for cancer prevention activities.
