Eleven young patients with relapsed childhood malignancies received continuous infusions of 5-10 mg/m2/day doxorubicin. 30 infusions were given via a central venous access until signs of mucositis showed up (7-52 days). Other toxicity was low, both bone marrow depression and fever and neutropenia occurred in 7/30 and 5/30 courses of therapy, respectively. No signs of liver or cardiac toxicity were seen in these heavily pretreated patients. In 8/11 patients tumor regression was documented, though only two partial remission were noted. Continuous infusions of doxorubicin are an effective and relatively non-toxic treatment for relapsed childhood malignancies. Since this form of therapy enables good quality of life and medical care on ambulatory basis, a phase II-study of low-dose doxorubicin for relapsed tumors is justified.
