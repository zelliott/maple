Monoclonal antibodies specific for 3 distinct epitopes of the species-specific determinants of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) p27 were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for measurement of serum p27 in cats infected with FeLV. Group-specific antigen (GSA) of FeLV in peripheral blood leukocytes was also determined by an immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies to FeLV and the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) were also measured. Thirty-six cats were surveyed and assigned to 4 categories. Five developed persistent viremia (category 1), characterized by continuous expression of p27, GSA, and low antibody titers to FeLV and FOCMA. Eleven cats with transient viremia (category 2) and 13 cats that were never detectably viremic (category 3), as judged by absence of GSA and p27, developed increased antibody titers to FeLV and FOCMA. Seven cats were never viremic, as judged by the GSA in the peripheral blood leukocytes, but still had detectable serum p27 (category 4). Most category 4 cats developed high antibody titers against FOCMA and/or FeLV. Of 307 field cats examined, 7% of the healthy cats and 10% of the sick cats could be assigned to category 4. However, this difference was not significant (P greater than or equal to 0.05). Of 26 cats with neoplasms 2 (1 of 12 with lymphosarcoma) could be classified as category 4. Because virus could be isolated from 2 category 4 cats, they were considered immune carriers.
