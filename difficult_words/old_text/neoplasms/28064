Tumor cells usually express antigens which are distinguishable from normal "self" antigens and are thereby recognized by the host immune system. However, the host immune system barely responds to tumors in patients. Supplementation with adjuvant (such as BCG-CWS) in patients with cancer contributes to regression of intrinsically growing cancer. The adjuvant targets antigen-presenting cells, i.e. innate immunity, but not lymphocytes, and promotes up-regulation of MHC, co-stimulators and initial cytokines in antigen-presenting cells. We hypothesized that the role of the adjuvant is to provide conditions suitable for antigen-presentation where antigens are available and the lack of adjuvant-induced priming of antigen-presenting cells results in unresponsiveness to tumor antigens. Here, we report innate immune therapy applicable to cancer patients by supplementation with adjuvants for induction of potent immune responses against tumors.
