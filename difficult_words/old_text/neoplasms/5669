A frequent complication of venous access devices (VADs) is axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis. To study this problem we have compared blood drawn through VADs with peripheral blood samples in a group of oncology patients with venographically demonstrated venous damage (N = 14) and a group with normal venograms (N = 21). The samples were assayed for a battery of proteins believed to be involved in thrombogenesis. After approximately six weeks of catheterization the venographically abnormal patients had significantly less thrombomodulin (P = 0.0055) and significantly higher PAI:tPA (P = 0.022) in catheter-drawn samples as compared with the venographically normal group. Although the data are inconclusive, it is hypothesized that these changes resulted from local endothelial injury.
