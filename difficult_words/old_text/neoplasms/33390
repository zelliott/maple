Evidence from many recent studies has linked uncontrolled inflammatory processes to aging and aging-related diseases. Decreased a nuclear receptor subfamily of transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) activity is closely associated with increased levels of inflammatory mediators during the aging process. The anti-inflammatory action of PPARs is substantiated by both in vitro and in vivo studies that signify the importance of PPARs as major players in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases. In this review, we highlight the molecular mechanisms and roles of PPARalpha, gamma in regulation of age-related inflammation. By understanding these current findings of PPARs, we open up the possibility of developing new therapeutic agents that modulate these nuclear receptors to control various inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, vascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer.
