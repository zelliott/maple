Parvoviruses comprise a group of single-stranded DNA viruses with greater potential for gene therapy applications. Unique characteristics of paroviruses, such as non-pathogenicity, antioncogenicity and methods of efficient recombinant vector production, have drawn more attention towards utilising parvovirus-based vectors in cancer gene therapy. Although &gt; 30 different parvoviruses have been identified so far, recombinant vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV), minute virus of mice (MVM), LuIII and parvovirus H1 have been successfully tested in many preclinical models of human diseases, including cancer. The present article will focus on the potential of non-replicating and autonomously replicating parvoviral vectors in cancer gene therapy, including strategies that target tumour cells directly or indirectly.
