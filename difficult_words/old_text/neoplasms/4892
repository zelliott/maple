Cell growth is a prerequisite for cell proliferation, and ribosome biogenesis is a limiting factor for cell growth. In mammalian cells, the tumor suppressor p53 has been shown to induce cell-cycle arrest in response to impaired ribosome biogenesis. Recently, p53-independent mechanisms of cell-cycle arrest in response to alterations of ribosome biogenesis have been described. These findings provide a rational basis for the use of drugs that specifically impact ribosome biogenesis for the treatment of cancers lacking active p53 and extend the scenario of mechanisms involved in the relationship between cell growth and cell proliferation.
