Cancer has a complex etiology and displays a wide range of cellular escape pathways that allow it to circumvent treatment. Signaling molecules functionally downstream of the circumvented pathways, and particularly at checkpoints where several of these pathways intersect, provide valuable targets for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs. Bcl-2, a pro-survival signaling molecule, is one such protein. This review examines the efficacy, potency, and function of several small molecule inhibitor drugs targeted to the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The review focuses on the compounds with most available data within the literature and discusses both the anti-cancer and the recently unveiled anti-angiogenic potential of this new class of drugs.
