Previous studies have suggested that schizophrenia is associ-ated with a             reduced risk of cancer. Genes that are involved in cell cycle regulation seem             to have additional functions in post-mitotic neurons involved in neuronal migration             and synaptic plasticity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a dominant role in the regulation             of gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS). Due to their involvement             in a large number of CNS pathways, miRNAs pose as appealing molecules for further             investigation, with potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value. In             the present study, we investigated the potential association between cancer and             schizophrenia in 2Â patient sample groups. We analyzed a large number of miRNAs             in a control group of 6 schizophrenic patients and a study group of 8 schizophrenic             patients with a solid tumor. A comparison between the control and study groups             showed that only miR-183 was differentially expressed. Specifically, a significant             downregulation of miR-183 in the samples of the study group was observed. Although             a larger sample size is required to validate this result for the general patient             population, our findings provide a first indication that miR-183 may play a role             in regulating the expression of other genes with onco-suppressor activity. Our             results are in agreement with the theory that patients with schizophrenia may             have a tumor suppressor gene or enhanced neuronal apoptotic activities. Further             studies are required in order to shed light on the role of miRNAs and particularly,             on the suppressive role of miR-183 in the neurobiological pathways involved in             schizophrenia.
