A questionnaire about attitudes and knowledge in palliative care treatment was sent to 185 general practitioners who participated such a seminar some months before. The response rate was low (69/185). Pain is the most frequent symptom. All the responding doctors assume they can treat pain adequately. However, none of them can answer the knowledge questions correctly. They appreciate the palliative care organizations for the help in symptom control or for difficulties in psychological symptoms. A multifactorial etiology might explain the difficult control of asthenia. This survey agrees with other studies that knowledge in symptom control and palliative care should be improved.
