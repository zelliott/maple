Despite years of international effort, cancer remains a major cause of death in developed countries, claiming more than 500000 lives per year in the United States alone. Recombinant DNA technology and high throughput screening methods have recently increased the pace of cancer research. In this review, we will examine the impact and contribution of phage display technology to this area of research. As a biological combinatorial system, the strength of phage display lies in its flexibility and its ability to efficiently study protein-protein interactions. The technology has also facilitated the discovery of molecules that have potential roles in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
