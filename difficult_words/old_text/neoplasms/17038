Cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome characterized by skeletal muscle and adipose tissue loss and is frequently associated with emaciation, anorexia, systemic inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. Lack of a clear understanding of the cause of cancer cachexia has impeded progress in identifying effective therapeutic agents. This review summarizes recent publications on the role of gut barrier function, intestinal microbiota, and inflammation in the etiology of cancer cachexia and new therapeutic interventions that may benefit treatment strategies.

Significant advances have been made in understanding the composition and metabolic capabilities of the intestinal microbiota and its impact on gut barrier function with implications for certain inflammatory-based diseases. Recent studies reported associations between intestinal permeability and endotoxemia with development of cancer cachexia and other metabolic disorders. Improvements in intestinal function and weight gain along with decreased inflammation have been reported for potential therapeutic agents such as eicosapentaenoic acid, immunoglobulin isolates, and probiotics.

Continued progress in the scientific understanding of the complex interplay between the intestinal microbiota, gut barrier function, and host inflammatory responses will uncover new therapeutic targets to help avoid the serious metabolic alterations associated with cachexia.
