We had given the service to the patients who desired home care. And now we made inquiries about 16 cases died at home. They were satisfied with our service and death at home. But in regard to the question "If you die at home, Are you satisfied?Â¿, half the number answered "NO". We should recognize the present condition that we can not fulfill the needs of patients and their families.
