This study describes the development and psychometric evaluation of the Basic Documentation for Psycho-Oncology (PO-Bado), an expert rating scale designed for the comprehensive assessment of psychosocial and physical distress in cancer patients. While there are many self-report measures (usually used for screening purposes), the PO-Bado is the first standardized clinician-administered instrument to guide professionals in a focused and structured psycho-oncological assessment.

The validation procedure was performed in 596 patients from different settings of cancer care, including all cancer sites and stages of the disease. The psychometric evaluation included (a) determination of the factorial structure, (b) homogeneity of scales and interrater reliability, (c) convergent and discriminant validities, and (d) examination of sensitivity to change.

The final version of the PO-Bado includes two scales: the physical distress scale (four items) and the psychological distress scale (eight items). A manual and an interview guideline were developed alongside. The psychometric properties suggest that the PO-Bado is a reliable and valid tool used to assess and to differentiate the distress of patients with cancer, as well as treatment-related changes in distress.

We suggest that the PO-Bado is a useful tool that is applicable in different oncology settings. It complements self-report measures and provides a structured format for focused psycho-oncological assessment and intervention. The two-dimensional structure allows differentiation between physical and psychological problems, assisting professionals in their diagnostic efforts and in providing appropriate support or treatment. When used consistently across professions and settings, the PO-Bado can form the basis for audit and interdisciplinary communication.
