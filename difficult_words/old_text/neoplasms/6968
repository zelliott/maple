Individualized therapeutic regimes are almost exclusively based on the rapid developments in molecular pathology. Application of (additional) molecular pathological investigations may thus offer the unique opportunity to improve the classical morphologic diagnosis as well as to routinely evaluate the parameters ("biomarkers") required for therapeutic decision making. Pathologists are thus facing the cogent necessity to perform and develop molecular pathological investigations in high quality and to establish biobanks, as well as to adjust their specialist training accordingly in order to meet these requirements.
