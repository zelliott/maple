MicroRNAs regulate self-renewal, differentiation, and division of cells via post-transcriptional gene silencing. Aberrant microRNA levels, specifically an overall downregulation, are present in many cancers, as compared to their normal tissue counterparts. Therefore, a potential therapeutic use of microRNAs is to correct these aberrant transcript levels involved in the signaling pathways of cancer. This review focuses on the current knowledge of microRNAs and their involvement with cancer cells and cancer stem cells. The methods currently being used to develop miRNA-based cancer therapeutics are examined, and the limitations halting further progress are also discussed.
