Neoplasia is an important form of disease in saurians. According to previous reviews, the organs most commonly affected by neoplastic disease are the hematopoeitic system, the hepatic system, and the skin. However, our own review suggests that tumors of the musculoskeletal system are also prevalent. Neoplasia should be considered as a significant differential diagnosis when presented with a lizard that has nonspecific clinical signs. The previously described diagnostic techniques should be applied to obtain a rapid and accurate definitive diagnosis. As more cases of neoplastic disease in saurians are reported, a comprehensive study of the data, including detailed examination of environmental factors, may bring forth causative agents. According to Withrow, cancer is one of the leading killers of pet animals, and thus has become a real concern for dog and cat owners [67]. Given that most people will either know someone with cancer or experience cancer first hand, the general public is more educated than ever on neoplastic disorders. As veterinarians, it is important to become familiar with the neoplastic diseases in all species, and to be educated in tumor pathophysiology and treatment. The public expects veterinarians to be dependable sources of knowledge and compassion.
