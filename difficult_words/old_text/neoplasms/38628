The relationship between QT interval and serum calcium concentration (s-Ca) was examined in 9 hypercalcemic (s-Ca greater than 11 mg/dl) patients. Three QT intervals corrected by Bazett's formula were used for the analysis: the intervals from the beginning of the QRS to the onset (QoTc), the apex (QaTc), and the end of T wave (QeTc). The measurements of s-Ca and other electrolytes were made on the blood sample taken on the same day of the electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. The normal range of s-Ca and three QTc intervals was determined in 50 outpatients with no cardiac disease. Three QT intervals in the hypercalcemic patients were significantly shortened with a diminution in the s-Ca. The QTc intervals showed significant negative correlation with s-Ca. Sensitivity of QoTc, QaTc, and QeTc in predicting high s-Ca was 83%, 57%, and 39%, respectively, and specificity was 100%, 100%, and 89%. The PQ interval tended to be prolonged in the case of hypercalcemia, but the change was statistically insignificant. These observations suggest that QT intervals can serve as an indicator of high s-Ca and that the QoTc seems to be a good indicator of the three QTc's.
