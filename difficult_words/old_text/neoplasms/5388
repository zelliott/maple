To assess possible health risks associated with the manufacture of paper, we carried out a retrospective analysis of mortality among 4,242 men and women employed at a Scottish paper mill between 1955 and 1992. During follow-up to 1994, 959 subjects had died giving an SMR of 0.85 (95% CI 0.80-0.90) in comparison with the national population. Mortality from all cancer (SMR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.88) and particularly from lung cancer (SMR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.81) was lower than expected. An excess of lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer (11 deaths, SMR 2.17) was observed in the making department. These findings do not support an occupational hazard of lung cancer as suggested by several earlier studies. The excess of lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer in the making department was unexpected, and may be a chance occurrence.
