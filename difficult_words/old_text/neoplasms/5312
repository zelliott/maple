There is very convincing evidence that a high dietary level of selenium substantially reduces the incidence of a wide variety of animal cancers. The human epidemiological evidence is less clear cut, but overall suggests that selenium may be protective: the evidence is strongest in men in relation to gastro-intestinal cancers. There is evidence that dietary selenium compounds reduce the formation of DNA adducts by carcinogens. Selenium compounds also inhibit growth in vitro and induce apoptosis. In general, there is a good correlation between the effectiveness of selenium compounds in chemoprevention and growth inhibition, implying that the mechanisms of growth inhibition and chemoprevention may be similar and that a major factor in the chemopreventive effects of selenium compounds in vivo is their ability to retard outgrowth of pre-malignant cells. Various hypotheses have been advanced as to how selenium compounds might prevent tumour cell growth. One is that they cause apoptosis by inducing oxidative stress. However, we have shown that the most potent selenium compound, selenodiglutathione (SDG), a natural metabolite of selenite, does not induce oxidative stress, at least not in the same way as other oxidants such as H2O2 and diamide. Firstly, a partially selenium-resistant variant cell line does not show increased resistance to H2O2. Moreover, SDG does not induce widespread tyrosine phosphorylation, including MAP and SAP kinases, like other oxidants such as H2O2 and diamide and its effects are not reversed by pretreatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin. Our experiments with the selenium-resistant variant suggest that a novel selenium-binding protein may be involved in growth inhibition by selenium.
