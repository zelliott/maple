Taiwan is an island country, with a small area and a dense population. Cancer has been the leading cause of death for over 15 years, and the number of cancer deaths is increasing year by year. The hospice movement started in 1983, and the first hospice was set up in 1990. There are more than ten hospices at present. Three foundations and one other organization have joined in with the hospice movement. The capacity of the hospice service cannot meet the needs for care. Education together with training is becoming necessary. Research is highlighted with an indigenous model. The curriculum for palliative medicine has recently been confirmed for education in the future. The Government has been a great help in the development of palliative care, and more service needs are identified. The situation with the hospice movement in Taiwan is positive and promising.
