A mathematical description is developed to demonstrate the effects of uncertainty on complication-free local tumor control. Responses of tumors and normal tissues are modeled by conventional radiobiological models. Uncertainties are considered in the delivery of absorbed dose to the target volume and the normal tissue at risk for complications. The degree by which uncertainties compromise complication-free local control for target volumes with various tumor cell burdens is calculated.
