Tumor growth and metastasis are dependent on angiogenesis. Therefore, certain angiogenesis markers may be useful as metastasis markers and/or the targets for antiangiogenic therapy. We and others have been studying endoglin(EDG; CD105) for such purposes. EDG is a proliferation-associated antigen of endothelial cells and essential for angiogenesis. In addition, EDG is a component of the transforming growth factor(TGF)-beta receptor complex. Expression of EDG is up-regulated in tumor-associated angiogenic vasculature compared with normal tissue vasculature. Microvessel density detected for EDG expression in breast cancer tissues showed a statistically significant correlation with overall and disease-free survival. In addition, elevated serum EDG was associated with metastasis in patients with colorectal, breast, and other solid tumors. On the other hand, We have been targeting EDG on tumor vasculature to suppress tumor growth and metastasis by systemic(i.v.) administration of anti-EDG monoclonal antibodies(mAbs) and immunoconjugates(IMCs). To thid end, we have been using three animal models, i.e., severe combined immunodeficient(SCID) mouse model of MCF-7 human breast cancer, human skin/SCID mouse chimera model bearing MCF-7 tumor, and syngeneic metastasis model of colon-26 adenocarcinoma cells in BALB/c mice. In addition, antiangiogenic activities of anti-EDG mAbs and IMCs were evaluated in mice using the dorsal air sac assay. The IMCs were prepared by coupling deglycosylated ricin A-chain or 125I to individual anti-EDG mAbs. These anti-EDG IMCs and mAbs showed substantial antitumor efficacy and antimetastatic activities without showing severe toxicity. Recently, we generated a recombinant human/mouse chimeric anti-EDG mAb to facilitate clinical application of the mAb.
