It is first reported the hygienic epidemiological assessment of electrodialysis drinking water with multidiscipline methods including environmental epidemiology, toxicology, chemistry and clinical medicine. The results showed that the occurrence of malignant tumours in residents drinking electrodialysis water did not directly associate with their drinking water, we also did not find that there was any influence of electrodialysis water on residents' liver and gastrointestinal function, and the rate of thyroid enlargement, prevalence rates of dental fluorosis and dental caries as well as the level of saliva lysozyme in children. However, the morbidity rate of hypertension in the residents drinking electrodialysis water was higher than that in those drinking non-electrodialysis water.
