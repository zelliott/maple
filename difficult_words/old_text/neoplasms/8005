Ribozymes are RNA molecules with the capacity to effect sequence-specific cleavage of other transcripts. Since their initial discovery, there has been considerable interest in the development of ribozymes and other RNA therapeutics for gene therapy, particularly in the realm of cancer. However, as with other gene therapy applications, the delivery of ribozyme-based therapeutics to the target tissues of interest has represented a significant obstacle to the maturation of this technology to the clinical arena. This review will discuss the progress made so far in the use of non-viral methods for the systemic delivery of ribozymes for cancer gene therapy.
