The survivorship of children diagnosed with cancer has risen during the last decade. After the end of treatment those children and their families return to the community where another period of crisis unfolds. In this article, the findings of a larger qualitative study in Puerto Rico related to the return to the community of these patients and their families are discussed, including financial difficulties, the burden of responsibility, and transition to school. These findings provide a rationale for the implementation of a bio-psycho-social model of health that emphasizes reciprocal interactions among the multiple systems in which these families are embedded.
