An increased incidence of lethal mutations, visible mutations, chromosomal losses, chromosomal nondisjunctions, and tumors resulted when drosophila were placed in medium containing Rous-sarcoma virus. In the group treated, a few mosaics of the eye and translocations appeared as well. There is a suggestion, from preliminary data, that the size of chromosomal puffs may be reduced by this RNA virus, but the difference is not significant. Tests for the persistence of virus in progeny have been negative so far.
