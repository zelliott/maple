The prevalence of nausea and emesis among a series of out-patients (n = 95) receiving mainly mild-to moderately-emetic cytotoxics, was assessed, along with levels of psychological morbidity. Particular focus was given to the rates of psychologically-based (anticipatory) nausea and emesis. Results indicated that 23% of patients experienced anticipatory nausea and the majority reported that this occurred before at least half of the previous treatment cycles. Both emetic challenge of chemotherapy regimen and younger age were linked to this anticipatory effect. The data clearly indicated that nausea and emesis, both post-treatment and in anticipation of treatment, carried a psychological cost with anxiety being highest in those experiencing anticipatory nausea and/or emesis. The role of anxiety in the aetiology of psychologically-based nausea and emesis was not evaluated and it is considered that a prospective study is needed to clarify the exact contribution of psychological factors in the incidence of both post-treatment and anticipatory side-effects.
