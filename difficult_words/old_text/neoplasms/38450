A novel technique was developed for the formation of ligand-targeted polymeric micelles that can be applicable to various ligands. For tumor-specific drug delivery, camptothecin (CPT)-loaded polymeric micelles were modified by folate to produce a folate-receptor-targeted drug carrier. Folate-linked PEG5000-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (folate-PEG5000-DSPE) was added when preparations of drug-loaded polymeric micelles, resulting in folate ligands exposed to the surface. Folate-modified CPT-loaded polymeric micelles (F-micelle) were evaluated by measuring cellular uptake using a flow cytometer, fluorescence microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy, and by cytotoxicity measurement. The results revealed that F-micelle showed higher cellular uptake in KB cells overexpressing folate receptor (FR) and higher cytotoxicity compared with non-folate modified CPT-loaded polymeric micelles (plain micelles) in KB cells, but not in FR-negative HepG2 cells. This result indicated that polymeric micelles were successfully modified by the folate-linked lipid.
