The regulation of toxic substances present in the environment requires that carcinogens be distinguished from noncarcinogens on the strength of the available toxicological and epidemiological evidence for carcinogenicity. In this article, we consider the difficulties associated with establishing strong evidence against carcinogenicity. In particular, the ability of both animal and human studies to detect small increases in tumor occurrence rates is evaluated in statistical terms. Consideration is also given to resolving apparent conflicts between the toxicological and the epidemiological sources of data.
