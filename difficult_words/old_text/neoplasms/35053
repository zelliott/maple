Previous reports on twin cancer have been reviewed. Especially, cancer in later adulthood has been focused. There have been done several large scale twin studies on cancer in Europe and the U.S.A., but not in Japan.

Methodology of twin research in epidemiology has been described. Epidemiological research methods in Japan have been described through the authors' past experience.
