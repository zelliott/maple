Recent advances in RNA biology reveal unexpected diversity and complexity of cellular RNA metabolism. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential players in RNA metabolism, regulating RNA splicing, transport, surveillance, decay and translation. Aberrant expression of RBPs affects many steps of RNA metabolism, significantly altering expression of RNA. Thus, altered expression and dysfuncting of RBPs are implicated in the development of various diseases including cancer. In this minireview, we briefly describe emerging roles of RBPs as a global coordinator of post-transcriptional steps and altered RBP as a global generator of cancer related RNA alternative splicing. Identification and characterization of the RNA-RBP network would expand the scope of cellular RNA metabolism and provide novel anti-cancer therapeutic targets based on cancer specific RNA-RBP interaction.
