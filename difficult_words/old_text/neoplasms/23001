Pheochromocytoma scanning using 131J-meta-benzylguanidine was done in one patient with metastasizing paraganglioma, one patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIb. No activity of tumour tissue could be demonstrated in the patient with metastasizing paraganglioma, whereas the pheochromocytoma could be clearly defined in the patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIa. The female with multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIb showed a suspect space-occupying lesion of the left adrenal using computed tomography. Pheochromocytoma could be excluded by 131J-benzylguanidine scanning, selective estimation of catecholamines in adrenal venous blood as well as the glucagon stimulation and clonidine suppression.
