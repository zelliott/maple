Specific chromosome changes are consistently observed in numerous types of neoplasms. These chromosome changes are generally seen only in malignant cells and are not present in somatic cells. Associations of an increased incidence of cancer following exposure to certain chromosome breakage agents, in chromosome instability syndromes, and in patients with gene or constitutional chromosomal imbalances, suggest that chromosomal changes play a role in the etiologies of malignancies. The purpose of this paper is to review briefly chromosomal aberrations in cancer in relation to etiology. Awareness of the probable multiple causes of human cancer and the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in the investigation of these diseases are essential for a better understanding of this complex group of diseases.
