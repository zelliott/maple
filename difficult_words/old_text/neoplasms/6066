Anxiety is a dynamic response to perceived threat that is common among patients with cancer and fluctuates at critical points in the disease trajectory. A substantial minority of patients may experience clinically significant anxiety resulting from a range of potential etiologic factors. This review summarizes evidence-based recommendations for treatment of anxiety in oncology settings. Recommendations are based on the nature and time course of anxiety and the results of meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and individual trials in cancer populations. The evidence-based literature supports the use of psychosocial and psychopharmacologic treatments to prevent or alleviate anxiety symptoms.

are tempered by study heterogeneity and methodologic limitations and a lack of trials that included patients with clinically significant anxiety. In oncology settings, accessibility and acceptability of evidence-based treatments vary, and patients may seek a variety of resources to manage cancer concerns. Treatment planning should incorporate contributing factors to anxiety and patient preferences for psychiatric care.
