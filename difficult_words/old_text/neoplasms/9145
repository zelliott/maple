The purpose of this study was to describe child coping and parent coping assistance with cancer-related stressors during treatment. Fifteen children (age 6-12) with cancer and their parents (N = 17) completed semistructured interviews and self-report measures to assess coping and coping assistance. Results suggest families utilized a broad array of approach and avoidance strategies to manage cancer and its treatment. Quantitative and qualitative assessments provided complementary and unique contributions to understanding coping among children with cancer and their parents. Using a mixed methods approach to assess coping provides a richer understanding of families' experiences, which can better inform clinical practice.
