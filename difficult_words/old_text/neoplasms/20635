Thromboembolic venous disease, which includes both peripheral venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a frequent disorder in patients with cancer. Although thromboembolic manifestations may precede the diagnosis of cancer, the value of extensive clinical search for potential underlying cancer when faced with venous thromboembolic manifestations has not been demonstrated.

Clinical and biological studies have demonstrated that acquired abnormalities in blood hemostasis, especially procoagulant factors, account for the onset of thromboembolic manifestations in patients with cancer. Classical anticoagulant therapy is associated with low efficacy and tolerance in patience with cancer who are at high risk for hemorrhagic complications and recurrence of thromboembolic disease.

Recent data suggest the value of anticoagulant therapy using either low molecular weight heparin or warfarin at low doses (INR &lt; 2) according to the specific surgical or medical context.
