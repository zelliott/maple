To examine group differences and predictors of externalizing behavior and substance use during the transition to emerging adulthood (i.e., ages 18-25) among survivors of childhood cancer and comparison peers.

Peer acceptance and social behavior were assessed in classrooms of 55 children (ages 8-15) during cancer treatment. Children with cancer, comparison peers (n = 60), and parents completed measures of externalizing behavior and/or substance use during an initial home visit and soon after participants turned 18.

At follow-up, survivors and peers exhibited similar externalizing behaviors and substance use, except peers were more likely to use marijuana. Substance use was associated with earlier peer acceptance and social behavior. Survivors who were older at diagnosis were at greater risk for later externalizing behavior and substance use.

Mean externalizing behaviors and substance use generally fell within normative ranges for both survivors and peers. Some survivors may benefit from interventions to reduce risk behavior.
