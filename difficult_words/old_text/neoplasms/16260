Myeloma expression systems have been utilized successfully for the production of various recombinant proteins. In particular, myeloma cell lines have been exploited to express a variety of different antibodies for diagnostic applications as well as in the treatment of various human diseases. The use of myeloma cells for antibody production is advantageous because they are professional immunoglobulin-secreting cells and are able to make proper post-translational modifications. Proper glycosylation has been shown to be important for antibody function. Advances in genetic engineering and molecular biology techniques have made it possible to isolate murine and human variable regions of almost any desired specificity. Antibodies and antibody variants produced in myeloma cells have been extremely helpful in elucidating the amino acid residues and structural motifs that contribute to antibody function. Because of their domain nature, immunoglobulin genes can be easily manipulated to produce chimeric or humanized antibodies. These antibodies are less immunogenic in humans and also retain their specificity for antigen and biologic properties. In addition, novel proteins in which antibodies are fused to non-immunoglobulin sequences as well as secretory IgA have been produced in myeloma cells.
