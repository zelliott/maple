Not fully successful therapy of carcinomas makes us search for new methods of antitumor treatment. Beside radiotherapy and chemotherapy, immunotherapy is the method we put our hopes on. Since its isolation in mid 70s TNF-alpha has been the subject of careful studies investigating its clinical usefulness. In phase I and II clinical trials dose- and manner of administration-dependent side effects were observed, which considerably limited the use of TNF-alpha in clinical practice. Topical (intratumoral) therapy eliminated most systemic side effects. Synergic antitumor efficacy of TNF-alpha, cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), and cytostatic drugs (etoposide, cyclophosphamide) was proved.
