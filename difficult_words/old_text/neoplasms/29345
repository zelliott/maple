Recent studies on cancer stem cells (CSCs), a special subpopulation of tumor cells, promote our understanding of tumorigenesis, neovascularization, invasion, drug resistance and tumor recurrence, which establishes new concepts for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the biological features and behaviors of CSCs have become an exciting frontier of cancer research. CSCs initiate tumor neovascularization and promote invasion with yet to be defined mechanisms. In this review, we provide evidence for the role of CSCs in tumor vascularization and discuss the potential mechanisms and therapeutic significance based on the interaction between CSCs and their vascular niches.
