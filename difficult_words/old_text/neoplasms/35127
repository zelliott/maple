Affiliation preferences of 150 cancer out-patients were assessed in the waiting-room and day-to-day life. Results indicated the vast majority avoided fellow patients, preferring to be alone or with healthy people. Similarly, patients tended to avoid the topic of illness in their social contacts. Moreover, those desiring to be with the healthy displayed the highest levels of negative emotion. Finally, avoidance of fellow patients was higher among males, the elderly, and the more highly educated. Overall, the findings were inconsistent with the thesis that those under stress seek out others in similar straits, as suggested by Schachter's emotional comparison theory or Will's downward comparison theory. Rather, they support Rof√©'s utility theory of stress and affiliation.
