Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common occurrence in patients with cancer and is a frequent indicator of a gastrointestinal malignancy. Rapid evaluation and treatment is key for the hemodynamically unstable patient. Endoscopy remains the cornerstone of diagnosis and management for cancer patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. The emergency physician should also be aware of other diagnostic and treatment modalities that may be needed to take care of these patients.
