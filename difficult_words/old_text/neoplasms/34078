The incidence of cancer increases with age but we do not know why. As a working hypothesis we propose here that cells somehow initiated in vivo in the course of life and finally engaged in the aging program, which involves a drop of connexins with loss of cell-to-cell communication (equivalent to the promotion phase in the multistep process of carcinogenesis), may recover their growth potential, thus allowing cancer to progress. This is supported by evidence that: (i) connexin 43 (Cx43) acts as a tumor suppressor; (ii) cx43 and gap junction intercellular communication drop in precancerous lesions and in tumors of various origins, as well as in aging cells; (iii) telomerase is activated in cancerous somatic cells.
