Fatty acid synthase (FASN), an enzyme capable of de novo fatty acid synthesis, is highly expressed and activated in most human carcinomas. FASN is associated with poor prognosis in prostate and breast cancer and its inhibition is selectively cytotoxic to human cancer cells. Thus, FASN and fatty acid metabolism have become an important focus for the diagnostic and treatment of cancer. In this sense, there is an increasing interest in identifying and developing new antitumor compounds that inhibit FASN.
