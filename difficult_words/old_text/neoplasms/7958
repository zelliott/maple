Bidirectional signaling along the B7-CTLA-4 coreceptor pathway enables reciprocal conditioning of T cells and dendritic cells. Although T cells can instruct dendritic cells to manifest tolerogenic properties after CTLA-4 engagement of B7, such a B7-mediated signaling is not known to occur in response to CD28. Here we show that mouse dendritic cells were induced by soluble CD28 to express interleukin 6 and interferon-gamma. Production of interleukin 6 required B7-1 (CD80), B7-2 (CD86) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and prevented interferon-gamma-driven expression of immunosuppressive tryptophan catabolism. In vivo, an adjuvant activity of soluble CD28 was demonstrated as enhanced T cell-mediated immunity to tumor and self peptides and protection against microbial and tumor challenge. Thus, different ligands of B7 can signal dendritic cells to express functionally distinct effector responses.
