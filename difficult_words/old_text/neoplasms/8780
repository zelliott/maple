In its classical form, autophagy is an essential, homeostatic process by which cytoplasmic components are degraded in a double-membrane-bound autophagosome in response to starvation. Paradoxically, although autophagy is primarily a protective process for the cell, it can also play a role in cell death. The roles of autophagy bridge both the innate and adaptive immune systems and autophagic dysfunction is associated with inflammation, infection, neurodegeneration and cancer. In this review, we discuss the contribution of autophagy to inflammatory, infectious and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cancer.
