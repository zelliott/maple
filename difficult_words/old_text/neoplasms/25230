Severe oral mucositis induced by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is associated with intolerable pain and risk of systemic bacteremia infection. Differences between conventional HCT and reduced-intensity regimens for allogeneic HCT (RIST) may influence the occurrence and severity of oral mucositis. Here, we evaluated oral mucositis in patients undergoing RIST and compared the results with those in conventional allogeneic HCT patients to facilitate predictive measures for mucositis.

A total of 127 consecutive patients undergoing HCT (conventional, 63; RIST, 64) were included in this study. Severity of oral mucositis during HCT period was evaluated daily. Differences in severity of mucositis among HCT types were analyzed. Use of morphine to control pain due to oral mucositis was evaluated in each HCT method.

The severity of oral mucositis was reduced in patients undergoing RIST. Worsening of oral mucositis was delayed in patients receiving RIST. Use of morphine to control pain due to oral mucositis was significantly decreased in patients undergoing RIST compared with those receiving conventional allogeneic HCT.

The severity of oral mucositis was reduced and the peak day of oral mucositis was delayed in RIST patients compared with those receiving conventional HCT.
