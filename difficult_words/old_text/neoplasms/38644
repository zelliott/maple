At the University of Utah Medical Center the thrusts of the effort with respect to the NCl Hyperthermia Equipment Evaluation Contract have been threefold. The first objective was the development of a reliable thermometry system for collecting temperature information as a function of space as well as time. The second objective was the evaluation and comparison of a number of hyperthermia devices, particularly with respect to deep-heating devices, and specifically as pertains to the BSD annular phased array system (AA) and its various configurations. The third objective was to develop methodology for analysing hyperthermia data which could be easily adapted toward device comparison. In the period from 10/81-1/86, a total of 137 patients were treated with one or more of 10 devices, totalling 199 device evaluations at the University of Utah Medical Center or the subcontracting institution, LDS Hospital. Of these, 132 device evaluations involved deep-seated tumours. The AA was found to be feasible for deep pelvic regional hyperthermia, although the frequency of reversible acute toxicity was high, and achievement of desired temperatures was frequently limited by one of several factors. The radiative electromagnetic wave applicators which were evaluated for treatment of superficial tumours were found to be mostly feasible for tumours of the thoracic and extremities regions, although the heating patterns were frequently too shallow or too small in area, when compared with the size of the lesion.
