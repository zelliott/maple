A total of 20 children with recurrent or unresponsive tumours (10 Wilms' tumours, 3 rhabdomyosarcomas, 4 Ewing's sarcomas, 1 osteosarcoma, 1 hepatoblastoma, 1 hepatoma) were given ifosfamide as a 24-h infusion (5 g/m2), with mesna as a uroprotector. The number of courses ranged from 1 to 13 (median, 3), and the interval between them was 2-3 weeks. In all, 16 of these patients had previously received cyclophosphamide. Complete clinical responses (CRs) were seen in 3 cases (2 Wilms' tumours and 1 Ewing's sarcoma) and lasted 5, 7, and 9 months. Partial responses (PRs) were seen in 3 instances; mixed response or stable disease, in 4; and progressive disease, in 10. Treatment was well tolerated in most patients, with no cystitis or severe myelosuppression, but two children developed transient neurological symptoms and one became hypertensive. Nausea and vomiting were controlled by high-dose dexamethasone in most children.
