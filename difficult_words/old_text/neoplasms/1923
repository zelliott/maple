Intraspinal analgesia can provide relief to patients suffering from intractable pain. Nurses following patients receiving intraspinal analgesia need to be familiar with care of the long-term intraspinal catheter, side effects that occur with spinal analgesia, interventions with acute tolerance, and use of drug combinations in the intraspinal infusion. Eighteen patients were observed for 1 year, using the epidural portal system. This method of intraspinal delivery permitted long-term epidural access without complications of system breakdown or catheter migration. With intraspinal infusions, the patient remained alert and could die at home with dignity, free from pain.
