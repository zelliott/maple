Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a multifunctional cytokine with both immunosuppressive and anti-angiogenic properties and play an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer. IL-10-1082A&gt;G polymorphism is the most extensively studied polymorphism in the IL-10 gene in cancer susceptibility. To date, a number of case-control studies were conducted to investigate the association between IL-10-1082A&gt;G polymorphism and cancer risk in humans. However, the association between the IL-10-1082A&gt;G polymorphism and cancer risk is still ambiguous. In an effort to solve this controversy, we performed a meta-analysis based on 61 case-control studies, including 14,499 cancer cases and 16,967 controls. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of the association. In the stratified analyses by specific cancer type, increased risk was found in lung cancer (OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.16-8.63 for GA versus AA; OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.16-3.70 for GG versus AA; OR = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.31-7.68 for GA/GG versus AA) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.02-1.36 for GA versus AA; OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.02-1.35 for GA/GG versus AA). The meta-analysis also indicated that the variant genotypes were associated with a moderately increased risk in Asians in all genetic models (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.17-2.76 for GA versus AA; OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.62-6.82 for GG versus AA; OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.07-2.60 for GA/GG versus AA; OR= 2.93, 95% CI = 1.43-6.03 for GG versus AA/GA). The meta-analysis suggested that the IL-10-1082A&gt;G polymorphism was associated with increased risk of cancer in Asians and lung cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. To draw comprehensive and true conclusions, more researches with larger numbers of worldwide participants are needed to examine associations between IL-10-1082A&gt;G polymorphism and cancer risk.
