Multi-facility joint randomized clinical trials for cancer treatment are the most common method of current clinical study. However, the difference in the rate of participation in multi-facility randomized clinical trials may damage the resulting general validity. Therefore, we studied whether the rate of participation in randomized clinical trials is different between university hospitals and other general hospitals using a questionnaire (with anonymity preserved). There were 744 subjects from university hospitals and 339 from general hospitals participating in the study. The results showed that 10.9 percent of those from university hospitals were willing to participate, against 28.1 percent who were not. Of those from general hospitals (public hospitals in this study) 10.6 percent answered that they would participate and 27.4 percent that they would not. Little difference was found in the rate of participation in randomized clinical trials between university hospitals and other general hospitals. The focus is thus on doctors to solve the possible differences between the facilities in further multi-facility joint studies.
