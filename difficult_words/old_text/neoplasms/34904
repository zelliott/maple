The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can degrade various components of the extracellular matrix and are implicated in the development and progression of cancer. There is evidence suggesting an association of MMP gene polymorphisms with cancer susceptibility and/or metastasis. This paper reviews the findings on several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the collagenase, stromelysin and gelatinase genes in lung cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer.
