A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the role of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as adjuvant therapy for fungal infections in patients with cancer. GM-CSF was added to amphotericin B in the treatment of cancer patients with proven major-organ or disseminated fungal infection. The dose of GM-CSF ranged from 100 to 750 micrograms/(m2.d). Of eight evaluable patients, six had a neutrophil response to GM-CSF. Four of these patients were completely cured of the fungal infection, and two had a partial response. However, a capillary-leak syndrome developed in three patients, an adverse effect suggesting that the dose of GM-CSF was excessive.
