The highly toxic gas carbon monoxide (CO) displays many physiological roles in several organs and tissues. Although many diseases, including cancer, hematological diseases, hypertension, heart failure, inflammation, sepsis, neurodegeneration, and sleep disorders, have been linked to abnormal endogenous CO metabolism and functions, CO administration has therapeutic potential in inflammation, sepsis, lung injury, cardiovascular diseases, transplantation, and cancer. Here, insights into the CO-based therapy, characterized by the induction or gene transfer of heme oxygenase-1 and either gas or CO-releasing molecule administration, are reviewed.
