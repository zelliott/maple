A chimeric protein, consisting of streptavidin fused to a cyclic decapeptide with potent inhibitory activity for matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), has been produced in Escherichia coli and purified. The purified chimera formed a tetramer and showed full biotin-binding ability. The chimera was also capable of both binding to MMP-2 and inhibiting its activity. Thus, both the streptavidin moiety and the decapeptide of the chimera are fully functional. This bifunctional nature of the chimera should facilitate the application of the decapeptide since the streptavidin moiety can be used as a specific conjugation site for almost any materials upon biotinylation.
