Sixty cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy at an outpatient Oncology Centre were surveyed for their views on a list of treatment-related toxicities. The severity of each toxicity was assessed using a visual analogue scale. Sixty percent of patients felt that the overall toxicity was acceptable. Ten percent felt like giving up. Problem with venous access was named the worst toxicity by 37% of patients, followed by nausea and vomiting (19%), and long waiting time (11%). Male patients tended to tolerate chemotherapy better. The female patients were significantly more affected by hair loss than their male counterpart. Better understanding of the toxicities of chemotherapy as perceived by the patients themselves allows them to take appropriate measures in improving their quality of life.
