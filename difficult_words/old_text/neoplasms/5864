Indeterminate and interdigitating cell tumors are rare proliferations of immunoregulatory cells that demonstrate morphologic, immunologic, and ultrastructural features similar to their cells of origin. Although an association of lymphoproliferative disease with Langerhans' cell histiocytosis is well described, only sporadic cases of non-Langerhans' dendritic cell proliferations have been published. The authors describe three patients with low grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disease who developed subsequent indeterminate cell or interdigitating cell tumors. When the two cases of indeterminate cell tumor are added to those previously described in the literature, it appears that 4 of 13 cases (31%) are associated with a history of low grade B-cell malignancy. Possible explanations for the relationship between these two disorders are discussed.
