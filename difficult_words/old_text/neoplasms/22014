Data on 15,399 adolescents diagnosed with cancer at age 15-19 years during 1978-1997 in Europe were extracted from the database of the Automated Childhood Cancer Information System (ACCIS). Total incidence in Europe as a whole was 186 per million in 1988-1997. Incidence among males was 1.2 times that among females. Lymphomas had the highest incidence of any diagnostic group, 46 per million, followed by epithelial tumours, 41 per million; central nervous system (CNS) tumours, 24; germ cell and gonadal tumours, 23; leukaemias, 23; bone tumours, 14; and soft tissue sarcomas, 13 per million. Total incidence varied widely between regions, from 169 per million in the East to 210 per million in the North, but lymphomas were the most frequent diagnostic group in all regions. Cancer incidence among adolescents increased significantly at a rate of 2% per year during 1978-1997. Five-year survival for all cancers combined in 1988-1997 was 73% in Europe as a whole. Survival was highest in the North, 78%, and lowest in the East, 57%. Five-year survival was generally comparable with that in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries of the United States of America (USA), but for Ewing's sarcoma it was below 45% in all European regions compared with 56% in the USA. Survival increased significantly during 1978-1997 for all cancers combined and for all diagnostic groups with sufficient registrations for analysis.
