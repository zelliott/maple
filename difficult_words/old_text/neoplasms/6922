The doctor-parent-adolescent triad is a unique communication challenge, particularly in the area of fertility preservation for adolescents with cancer. This paper provides a preliminary exploration into the barriers experienced by physicians in discussing cancer related fertility issues with patients aged 12-18.

This study used a subset of the data from qualitative interviews with pediatric oncologists.

The majority of physicians agreed that fertility preservation conversations were awkward because of limited options and resources for the technology as well as the existence of a fine line between establishing a sense of trust between doctor and patient, while not excluding parents.

Healthcare providers need training on how and when to broach fertility issues with patients, emphasizing open communication and early disclosure.
