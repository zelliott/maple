We report the possibility to transfer marker genes coding for beta-galactosidase activity using retroviral vectors into human peripheral blood CD34+ cells, peripheral blood T-lymphocytes and into the growth factor-dependent human hematopoietic cell line TF-1. Using the MFG-nisLacZ and the FLac vector and various packaging cell lines, we demonstrated retroviral transfer and high expression of a bacterial beta-galactosidase activity induced by the nisLacZ gene or the Sh-ble/LacZ gene. Kinetics of expression of the transgenes were analyzed both in primary cells and cell lines. Absence of cytotoxicity related to the expression of the bacterial beta-galactosidase was assessed in both cell types. These results open interesting prospectives for the use of the beta-galactosidase activity to mark and follow the fate of genetically modified cells isolated from patients prior to reimplantation.
