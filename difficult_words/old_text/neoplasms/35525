The canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels constitute one of the three major families within the large transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily. TRPC channels are the closest mammalian homologues of Drosophila TRP, the light-activated channel in Drosophila photoreceptor cells. All TRPC channels (TRPC1-7) are activated via phospholipase-C-coupled receptors and were, therefore, proposed to encode elusive native receptor-activated cation channels in many cell types. A physiological role has been established for all of the known TRPC channels, including the control of vascular tone (TRPC1, TRPC4 and TRPC6) or lymphocyte activation, which is essential for immune competence (TRPC1 and TRPC3). The emergence of TRPC channels in controlling a variety of biological functions offers new and promising targets for drug development.
