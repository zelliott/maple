This study was conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the i.v. pan-aurora kinase inhibitor PHA-739358, danusertib, in patients with advanced solid tumors.

In part 1, patients received escalating doses of danusertib (24-hour infusion every 14 days) without filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF). Febrile neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity without G-CSF. Further dose escalation was done in part 2 with G-CSF. Blood samples were collected for danusertib pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Skin biopsies were collected to assess histone H3 phosphorylation (pH3).

Fifty-six patients were treated, 40 in part 1 and 16 in part 2. Febrile neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity in part 1 without G-CSF. Most other adverse events were grade 1 to 2, occurring at doses &gt;or=360 mg/m(2) with similar incidence in parts 1 and 2. The maximum tolerated dose without G-CSF is 500 mg/m(2). The recommended phase 2 dose in part 2 with G-CSF is 750 mg/m(2). Danusertib showed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in parts 1 and 2 with a median half-life of 18 to 26 hours. pH3 modulation in skin biopsies was observed at &gt;or=500 mg/m(2). One patient with refractory small cell lung cancer (1,000 mg/m(2) with G-CSF) had an objective response lasting 23 weeks. One patient with refractory ovarian cancer had 27% tumor regression and 30% CA125 decline.

Danusertib was well tolerated with target inhibition in skin at &gt;or=500 mg/m(2). Preliminary evidence of antitumor activity, including a partial response and several occurrences of prolonged stable disease, was seen across a variety of advanced refractory cancers. Phase II studies are ongoing.
