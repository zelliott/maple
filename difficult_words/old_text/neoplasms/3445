Because of suggestions that hypertension may increase the long-term risk of cancer, we assessed the relation between hypertension and malignancy.

We conducted a MEDLINE search of English-language articles published between January 1966 and January 2000 using the terms hypertension or blood pressure, and neoplasm or cancer or malignancy. We reviewed prospective studies that reported cancer incidence or mortality in hypertensive and nonhypertensive patients, case-control studies that reported the prevalence of hypertension in cancer patients and controls, and references from identified articles.

We identified 10 longitudinal studies that evaluated the association between blood pressure and cancer mortality in 47 119 subjects. Subjects with hypertension experienced an increased rate of cancer mortality during durations of follow-up ranging 9 to 20 years, with an age- and smoking-adjusted pooled odds ratio of 1.23 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11 to 1.36). In 13 case-control studies, including 6964 cases of renal cell cancer and 9181 controls, the adjusted odds ratio for renal cell cancer among hypertensive patients, relative to normotensive counterparts, was 1.75 (95% CI: 1.61 to 1.90). No clear association was found between hypertension and cancer of other sites.

Hypertension was associated with an increased risk of mortality from cancer, particularly renal cell carcinoma.
