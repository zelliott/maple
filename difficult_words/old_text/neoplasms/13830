Biological effectiveness of low LET radiations is dependent on the partial oxygen pressure in the tissues at the time of energy deposit. Direct pO2 measurements demonstrate a low oxygen tension in tumours compared with surrounding normal tissues. Tumour hypoxia mediates response to treatment (radiotherapy and chemical modifiers), and modulates gene expression and angiogenesis, a key factor for metastases. The knowledge of these microenvironmental factors will allow new treatment strategies.
