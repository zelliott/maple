The latest developments of epidemiologic and biochemical research suggest that current upper limits of intake for dietary selenium and for overall selenium exposure may be inadequate to protect human health. In particular, recent experimental and observational prospective studies indicate a diabetogenic effect of selenium at unexpectedly low levels of intake. Experimental evidence from laboratory studies and veterinary medicine appears to confirm previous epidemiologic observations that selenium overexposure is associated with an increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and a recent large trial indicated no beneficial effect in preventing prostate cancer. Moreover, the pro-oxidant properties of selenium species and the observation that the selenium-containing enzymes glutathione peroxidases are induced by oxidative stress imply that the increase in enzymatic activity induced by this metalloid may represent at least in part a compensatory response. Taken together, the data indicate that the upper safe limit of organic and inorganic selenium intake in humans may be lower than has been thought and that low-dose chronic overexposure to selenium may be considerably more widespread than supposed.
