The advent of endoluminal aortic repair has gained increasing popularity as an alternative to traditional open surgery in the setting of multiple comorbid disease states. This study analyzes a single center experience of excluding aortic disease in patients with concomitant malignancy. As part of a Federal Drug Administration FDA-approved trial, 318 patients underwent aortic stent-graft repair between June 1996 and February 2001. During that period five patients with advanced-stage neoplasia were treated. Endovascular management of symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) with a mean diameter of 7.8 cm (range, 6-10 cm), was performed in four patients. In the fifth patient, a custom-made aortic prosthesis was utilized to exclude a paraanastamotic abdominal aneurysm (PAAA) from a previous open AAA repair. Malignancies included esophageal, lung, renal, prostate, and urinary bladder cancers. A mean follow-up of 10.1 months was available. Successful endoluminal repair was accomplished in all five patients with minimal in-hospital morbidity. Mean length of stay was 3.4 days. There were no device-related mortalities and no persistent endoleaks detected for the duration of follow-up. Aneurysm sac enlargement was not seen in any of the patients and complete resolution of the PAAA was noted at one year. Exclusion of AAA and other aortic pathology in patients with an associated malignancy can be performed with a relatively low procedure-related morbidity and mortality. In this population, stent-graft repair remains an individualized option with a multidisciplinary team necessary to explore this therapeutic approach.
