Functional imaging is becoming increasingly important in both research and clinical diagnostic radiology. Perfusion computed tomography (CTP) is a readily available and widely used tool that allows an objective measurement of tissue perfusion through the mathematical analysis of data obtained from repeated scans performed after administration of contrast agent. Recently, CTP has been increasingly used in the oncological field, being studied as a potential marker of neoplastic angiogenesis, which is one of the main targets of new tumour therapies. The aim of this paper was to provide the theoretical background and practical guidance for accurately performing CTP and interpreting results of examinations in solid-body tumours. CTP could be a valid tool for functional imaging of tumours if the acquisition technique is robust, if image and data analysis is accurate and if interpretation of results is adequately inserted within a clinical context.
