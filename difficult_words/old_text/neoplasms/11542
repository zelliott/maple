Over a recent 3-month period in our oncology practice, we became aware of multiple patients reporting domestic abuse. We present three selected cases, review the literature on domestic violence, and explore issues of diagnosis and management in a cancer population. Domestic violence against cancer patients may be more common than initially appreciated, and further awareness and research are indicated.
