Fibrosis in oncology concerns iatrogenic pathology, after radiotherapy or bleomycin, and also after surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Specificity of certain etiologic conditions are described in detail. Some therapeutic attitudes are discussed. Corticoids are useful in the management of inflammatory fibrosis attacks. Other drugs under study are used in an attempt to reduce the late fibrotic process, namely liposomal superoxide dismutase.
