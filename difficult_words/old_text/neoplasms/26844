This is the second of a two-part overview of the fundamentals of oncology for interventional radiologists. The first part focused on clinical trials, basic statistics, assessment of response, and overall concepts in oncology. This second part aims to review the methods of tumor characterization; principles of the oncology specialties, including medical, surgical, radiation, and interventional oncology; and current treatment paradigms for the most common cancers encountered in interventional oncology, along with the levels of evidence that guide these treatments.
