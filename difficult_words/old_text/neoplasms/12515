The aim of this multicenter study was to explore associations between psychosocial factors (general self-efficacy, perceived availability of social support, cancer-related distress) and health-related quality of life, among individuals at risk for hereditary cancer. One-hundred and twenty one participants with a family history of breast-cancer or colorectal cancer answered a questionnaire 2-4 weeks prior to genetic counseling. The two dimensions of the health-related quality of life measure, mental and physical health were both used as outcome variables. Multiple regression (linear) analyses revealed that increasing degrees of cancer-related distress was related to decreasing degrees of mental health whereas increasing degrees of self-efficacy and social support were related to increasing degrees of this outcome variable. Self-efficacy, self-esteem support and tangible aid seemed to moderate the relationship between cancer-related distress and mental health. These results suggest that self-efficacy and certain resources of social support buffer the negative association between cancer-related distress and mental health, and might be suitable for interventional efforts. Implications for genetic counseling practice are discussed.
