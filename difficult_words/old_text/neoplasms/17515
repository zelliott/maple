Sixty-nine patients with a superior vena cava syndrome were treated by radiotherapy. Forty were also given chemotherapy before or after irradiation. Twenty-nine had bronchial carcinoma, thirteen had other solid tumors, fourteen had lymphosarcoma and thirteen had no histological diagnosis. Subjective improvement was recorded in 86% of cases and the objective response rate was 41%. The response was obtained in a mean period of 4 weeks and its duration was 39 weeks for lymphosarcomas and only 6 weeks for solid tumors. Overall 1 year survival was 18%. Poor results obtained in superior vena cava syndrome incites recommendation of more intensive radiochemotherapeutic management.
