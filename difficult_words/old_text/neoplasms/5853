In this review, the role of extracellular factors in the stimulation and regulation of tumor cell motility are discussed. Tumor cells respond in a motile fashion to a variety of external ligands including autocrine motility factors, growth factors, and components of the extracellular matrix. Since tumor cell motility is a necessary component of tumor invasion and metastasis, we speculate that these protein factors could play important regulatory roles in tumor motility at different stages of the metastatic cascade.
