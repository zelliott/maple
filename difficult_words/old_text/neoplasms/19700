Magnetic resonance (MR) studies of the therapeutic efficacy of fluorinated drugs have recently become possible due to improvements in detection including the application of very strong magnetic fields up to 9.4Tesla (T). These advances allow tracking, identification, and quantification of (19)F-labeled biopharmaceuticals using (19)F MR imaging ((19)F MRI) and spectroscopy ((19)F MRS). Both techniques are noninvasive, are nondestructive, and enable serial measurements. They also allow for controlled and systematic studies of cellular metabolism in cancerous tissue in vivo (small animals and humans) and in vitro (body fluids, cells culture, tissue extracts and isolated tissues). Here we provide an overview of the (19)F MRI and (19)F MRS techniques used for tracking (19)F labeled anticancer chemotherapeutics and antibodies which allow quantification of drug uptake in cancer cells in vitro.
