Trofosfamide is an alkylating agent that is derived from the oxazaphoshorines. It has found application in a broad spectrum of malignancies in the last three decades. The main indications for application were in the palliative situation and as maintenance therapy. Good results were reported from the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and soft tissue sarcomas. A lot of small studies and casuistic contributions are available giving treatment results of several solid carcinomas (malignant gliomas, ovarian, lung and prostate cancer, and others). Due to its oral formulation and good tolerability trofosfamide is an attractive candidate for the palliative situation because treatment on an outpatient basis is possible. However, there is still a lack of randomized clinical studies with trofosfamide. Thus, evidence-based conclusions on the therapeutic value of the drug cannot be drawn. In the future, phase III trials should be undertaken.
