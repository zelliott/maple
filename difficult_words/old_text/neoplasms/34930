The Immunodeficiency Cancer Registry (ICR) contains nearly 500 case records regarding patients with primary immunodeficiencies who have developed malignancies. There is a proportional excess of lymphomas (50.7%) among the ICR cases and more than one-half of these cases were diagnosed at less than 10 years of age. Information in the ICR database is accessible to investigators conducting research on the biology or epidemiology of cancers associated with immunodeficiency.
