The diagnosis of cancer and the treatment of cancer patients are initially an interdisciplinary entity. Progress has been achieved through oncological multimodal cooperation between various forms of organisations. The ensuing problems confirm the following two main points. (1) The continuing delay in diagnosis of cancer still prevents most patients from benefitting from the implementation of optimal therapeutic possibilities and interdisciplinary cooperation. (2) What the surgeon does not achieve or neglects during the primary operation cannot be compensated for through conservative oncological measures.
