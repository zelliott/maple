Cdc25 phosphatases have been considered as attractive drug targets for anticancer therapy due to the correlation of their overexpression with a wide variety of cancers. We have been able to identify 32 novel Cdc25 phosphatase inhibitors with micromolar activity by means of a structure-based de novo design method with the two known inhibitor scaffolds. Because the newly discovered inhibitors are structurally diverse and have desirable physicochemical properties as a drug candidate, they deserve further investigation as anticancer drugs. The differences in binding modes of the identified inhibitors in the active sites of Cdc25A and B are addressed in detail.
