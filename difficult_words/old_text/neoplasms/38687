The characteristics and feasibility of combination therapy of cytotoxic agents and cytokines were discussed from the theoretical as well as experimental basis. The content was divided into two parts depending upon requirements and elements for tumor cells to proliferate. One was concerning the in vitro conditions in which tumor cells were supplied all of them sufficiently. The other was concerning the host conditions in which cells were not necessarily supplied all of them freely and sufficiently. On the basis of characteristic tumor cell and host modifications achieved through receptor binding of cytokines, the combination of cytotoxic agents with cytokines, particularly with interferons, would produced the therapeutic effects that are distinct from those produced by the combination among cytotoxic agents. The clinical and experimental findings were reviewed and summarized along with this proposal.
