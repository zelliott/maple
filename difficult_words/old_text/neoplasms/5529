Initially described as a unique entity, protein kinase C (PKC) is now represented by a family of 11 isoforms which differ in their structural and biochemical properties as well as in their tissular distribution, subcellular localization and substrate specificity. So far a lot of studies have attempted to approach the role of each of these PKC isoforms in the deregulation of growth signaling that leads to carcinogenesis. Among the various strategies developed, the surexpression of specific isoforms in different cellular models is the strategy which led to major advances as concern the PKC-cancer relationship. This review reports the main results obtained in this field especially in that of colorectal cancer.
