We have developed a rapid and sensitive method to measure oxygen consumption of tumor cells by acrylamide polymerization. This method could be used as an in vitro screen for potential chemotherapeutic agents. Previous techniques have lacked either the sensitivity or the speed required for use as an effective clinical tool. This method was modified from a technique previously developed in our laboratory for measuring oxygen in blood. Standard anticancer agents were tested against Walker 256 ascites tumor. Ascites was harvested from 20 rats on each of 50 days, incubated briefly with drugs, and acrylamide polymerization time was measured hourly. Individual controls were established for each drug-treated group, and oxygen uptake measured after one hour of incubation. Actinomycin, cyclohexamide, and cytosine arabinoside inhibited tumor cell oxygen consumption by 80%, 40%, and 30%, respectively. These results correlated with the known in vivo effects of these drugs on Walker carcinosarcoma. Therefore, this sensitive method could potentially be used directly on tumor cells removed from biopsy material so that the testing of anticancer drugs could be completed on the day of biopsy.
