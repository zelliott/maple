LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) is a gene of unknown function that has been linked to a number a human diseases, including PD (Parkinson's disease), IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), leprosy and cancer. The papers from the LRRK2: Function and Dysfunction meeting in this issue of Biochemical Society Transactions explore our growing knowledge of LRRK2's normal function, the role that it plays in disease and emerging strategies to exploit LRRK2 as a therapeutic target.
