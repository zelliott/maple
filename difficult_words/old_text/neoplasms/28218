The aim of this inquiry was to question 50 patients before a traditional hospitalization in a regional center, in order to know their opinion about one-day surgery. Among 44 answers from 41 women and 3 men, 29 were against, 11 favourable and 4 without opinion. After their hospitalization, only 4 changed their mind. The main reasons, in case of unfavourable answer, were lack of security and fear of pain. Psychologic aid in traditional hospitalization is frequently cited (34%). This has to be taken into account in ambulatory cases.
