2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is carcinogenic in male and female rats and probably also in mice. Male and female rats ingesting 2,4-D developed increased incidences of malignant neoplasms. Lymphosarcomas were increased in rats of both sexes, and neoplasms of the mammary gland in female rats. Male rats also had carcinomas of the endocrine organs. 2,4-D isooctyl ester was carcinogenic for the lymphoreticular system in female mice. 2,4-D and 2,4-dichlorophenol also were promoters of neoplasms of the skin in mice. Male mice given 2,4-D isopropyl ester developed an increased incidence of neoplasms of the lung. 2,4-D also is mutagenic and teratogenic in animals and causes poisoning in animals and human beings.
