In a 1 year follow up study, we assessed the life situation of 33 siblings of childhood cancer patients and 357 healthy controls. The hypothesis was that siblings have more behavioural and health related problems just after the cancer diagnosis. Validated assessment methods were used.

Siblings below school age tended to have conduct problems, psychosomatic problems, and a mixed group of other behavioural problems, when assessed 3 months after the cancer diagnosis. These symptoms became less evident during follow up. Among the school aged siblings, however, conduct problems, learning problems, psychosomatic problems, impulsive-hyperactive symptoms, and other behavioural symptoms remained unchanged during follow up. In their self assessments, the school aged siblings showed both state and trait anxiety more often than controls at the first assessment, but later these symptoms settled to the same level as the controls. The overall Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) depression scores did not show differences between the study groups.

The ratings of the parents were in keeping with the self assessment of the school aged siblings only in a few aspects; the emphasis of findings can be changed when proxies are used. The siblings have symptoms and adverse feelings which probably could be relieved by targeted, early information about the illness, and possibly by group discussions or activities, soon after the cancer diagnosis. In order to obtain necessary support for the siblings with educational problems, school personnel need to be informed about the sibling distress.
