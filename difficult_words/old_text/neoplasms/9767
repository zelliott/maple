Two monoclonal antibodies have been produced that react with antigens present on human white cells. These reagents differ from other monoclonal antibodies of similar specificity in that the antigens they recognize are resistant to conventional tissue-fixation and embedding procedures. These reagents can therefore be used in immunocytochemical staining of paraffin-embedded tissue sections. We assessed the practical usefulness of this technique in the histopathological diagnosis of human lymphoid neoplasms by staining a wide range of routine surgical biopsy specimens of normal and neoplastic tissue (gathered from five institutions), using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. In all 40 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, positive labeling of neoplastic cells was obtained with one or both antibodies. In contrast, no staining of neoplastic cells was observed in 60 samples of nonlymphoid neoplasms. We conclude that many of the difficulties encountered by histopathologists in distinguishing between lymphoid and nonlymphoid neoplasms may be overcome by immunohistologic labeling with monoclonal antibodies such as the ones we have studied.
