A single center's procedural and follow-up results of radiological chest port placement in pediatric oncology patients are presented. Between July 2002 and December 2003, 37 children (20 boys, 17 girls; age range, 4 months to 16 years; mean 6.7 years) underwent chest port placement. All patients received only one port through the internal jugular vein access, and all of the implantations were performed in the interventional radiology suite. Our database and electronic charts were retrospectively reviewed to obtain follow-up data. All chest ports were successfully implanted. The mean catheter life was 223 days (range: 15-450 days), with a total of 8,258 catheter days. Twenty-eight ports are still in use, four patient deceased, one port was prematurely removed because of a late infection, and four patients were lost to follow-up. Infection rate was 2.7% (0.12/1,000 catheter days). Malfunction due to partial catheter thrombosis and fibrin sheath formation was observed in three patients (8.1% or 0.36/1,000 catheter days), and all were relieved with rt-TPA dwell. None of the ports were revised or removed because of blockage, malposition or difficulty accessing the port. The peri-procedural complication rate was 0%. Chest ports in children can be inserted in interventional radiology suites under imaging guidance with high rates of technical success. The rates of infection and complications are comparable to that of surgically placed ports.
