In Japan, a nationwide palliative care education program for primary palliative care (the Palliative care Emphasis program on symptom management and Assessment for Continuous medical Education: PEACE) was established in 2008. Effective delivery of such programs relies on adequate evaluations of program efficacy; however, such an instrument does not exist.

This study aimed to develop and validate a measurement tool to quantify knowledge level of physicians about broader areas of palliative care, by which the effect of an education program could be measured.

We conducted a cross-sectional, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire survey with a group of 801 conveniently sampled physicians in October 2010. To examine the test-retest reliability of items and domains, the questionnaire was reissued two weeks after the first survey was completed. This study used psychometric methods, including item response theory, intraclass correlation coefficients, and known-group validity.

The response rate was 54% (n=434). We included 33 items across the following 9 domains: (1) philosophy of palliative care, (2) cancer pain, (3) side effects of opioids, (4) dyspnea, (5) nausea and vomiting, (6) psychological distress, (7) delirium, (8) communication regarding palliative care, and (9) community-based palliative care. For these items, the intraclass correlation was 0.84 and the Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) test of internal consistency was 0.87. There was a significant difference in the scores between palliative care specialists and other physicians.

We successfully validated a newly developed palliative care knowledge questionnaire to evaluate PEACE effectiveness (PEACE-Q). The PEACE-Q could be useful for evaluating both palliative care knowledge among physicians and education programs in primary palliative care.
