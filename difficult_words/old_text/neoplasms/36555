A diagnosis of cancer creates multiple problems for families, including major changes in life-styles, relationships, communication, roles, and living patterns. This article describes the results of a qualitative study of child-rearing stressors of 13 parents: 10 patients with cancer and 3 of their spouses. Data were collected using open-ended interviews. The major categories derived from the data were parent stressors and coping strategies, and parents' perceptions of child stressors and coping strategies. Parent stressors were related to the parents' knowledge and feelings, to their children, and to parent-child communication. Parent coping strategies included seeking support, making decisions, talking with the children, making alternative childcare arrangements, and trying to be supportive to child and spouse. Child stressors identified by the parents included changes in family life-style, embarrassment over the parent's appearance, hospital visiting, and obtaining information. Nursing interventions based on the identified stressors are suggested.
