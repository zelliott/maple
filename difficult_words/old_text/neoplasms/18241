In November, 2008 the AACR held the Seventh Annual Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research meeting in Washington, DC. At this meeting, a wide range of cutting-edge cancer prevention research was presented. This summary highlights some of the most impactful presentations with a focus on the interaction between inflammation, infections, the immune system, and tumor microenvironment in promoting cancer. Several of these presentations described targeting host-tumor interactions as a means for cancer prevention. As discussed below, this meeting continues to represent all phases of cancer prevention research including epidemiologic studies, behavioral and lifestyle interventions, carcinogenesis research, preclinical studies testing novel preventive interventions, and the results of early- and late-phase cancer prevention trials. Major advances presented at the 2008 meeting included studies showing that immune cells can be either protumorigenic or antitumorigenic, efforts to develop more comprehensive human papillomavirus vaccines to more effectively prevent cervical cancer and other human papillomavirus-related cancers, controversial studies of vitamin D and cancer risk, and studies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms to better assess cancer risk. These and the other presentations at this meeting continue to provide strong support for the concept that cancer will be most effectively controlled by applying modern cancer prevention strategies.
