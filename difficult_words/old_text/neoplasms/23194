Due to constant progress in oncology, survival rates of patients (children and adults) with cancer are increasing. Consequently, the reproductive future of young cancer patients needs to be addressed carefully. Fertility preservation techniques are available and issues such as the time available for fertility treatments, patients' age, presence of a partner and patients' personal wishes have to be considered. In Switzerland, a first therapeutic network (Réseau Romand de Cancer et Fertilité), was created in the French speaking part of Switzerland in 2006. Since 2010, a global Swiss network (FertiSave) has been created. The goal of these networks is to maximise the safety and efficacy of fertility preservation options offered to cancer patients without compromising their oncological prognosis. Patients' needs have to be identified, the therapeutic options evaluated rapidly and the optimal treatment promptly implemented in these urgent situations. This article reviews the fertility preservation options currently available and makes recommendations for different specific cancer situations, consistent with the latest scientific evidence and in general agreement with international recommendations.
