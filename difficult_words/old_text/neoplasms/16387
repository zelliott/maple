Many adolescents with cancer are denied the benefits of protocol inclusion and optimal supportive care. More than 70% of older adolescent patients are not treated at institutions representing pediatric cooperative groups and are not enrolled in clinical trials, despite a demonstrated survival advantage for patients registered in protocols. Failure to refer adolescent cancer patients to specialized pediatric oncology treatment centers also has an impact on their quality of care. The challenge before both the medical and pediatric health care communities is to assure adolescent patients the benefits of inclusion in clinical trials and treatment in age-appropriate settings.
