Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were selected for specific binding inhibition of KM01 to the KM01 antigen, which was detected in the serum of colorectal and other gastrointestinal carcinoma patients. Out of 91 MoAbs tested, 8 were found to have the inhibiting activity. The reactivity of these MoAbs with glycolipid antigen, which was isolated from cancer cell line, corresponded well with that of cancer patients sera. These monoclonal antibodies are thought to be useful in combination with KM01 for the construction of the second generation of the KM01 antigen-detecting system.
