Cancer immunotherapy utilizes vaccines targeting tumor antigens or tumor endothelium to prevent or regress tumors. Many cancer vaccines are designed to induce antigen-specific effector T cells that migrate to the tumor site. In an optimal situation, the effector T cells penetrate the tumor, release their effector molecules, induce tumor cell death and tumor regression. However, the tumor microenvironment is frequently immunosuppressive and contributes to a state of immune ignorance, impacting on the vaccine's ability to break tolerance to tumor antigen/s. This review discusses the factors in the tumor microenvironment that can affect the efficacy of cancer vaccines. In particular, the review focuses on pathways leading to effector T cell penetration of tumors or the inhibition of this process.
