The angiogenesis inhibitor dalantercept (formerly ACE-041) is a soluble form of activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ALK1) that prevents activation of endogenous ALK1 by bone morphogenetic protein-9 (BMP9) and BMP10 and exhibits antitumor activity in preclinical models. This first-in-human study of dalantercept evaluated its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity in adults with advanced solid tumors.

Patients in dose-escalating cohorts received dalantercept subcutaneously at one of seven dose levels (0.1-4.8 mg/kg) every 3 weeks until disease progression. Patients in an expansion cohort received dalantercept at 0.8 or 1.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression.

In 37 patients receiving dalantercept, the most common treatment-related adverse events were peripheral edema, fatigue, and anemia. Edema and fluid retention were dose-limiting toxicities and responded to diuretic therapy. No clinically significant, treatment-related hypertension, proteinuria, gross hemorrhage, or gastrointestinal perforations were observed. One patient with refractory squamous cell cancer of the head and neck had a partial response, and 13 patients had stable disease according to RECISTv1.1, eight of whom had prolonged periods (â‰¥12 weeks) of stable disease. Correlative pharmacodynamic markers included tumor metabolic activity and tumor blood flow, which decreased from baseline in 63% and 82% of evaluable patients, respectively, and telangiectasia in eight patients.

Dalantercept was well-tolerated at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg, with a safety profile distinct from inhibitors of the VEGF pathway. Dalantercept displayed promising antitumor activity in patients with advanced refractory cancer, and multiple phase II studies are underway.
