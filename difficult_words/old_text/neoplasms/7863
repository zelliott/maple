The ICC is fortunate to have obtained legislative support for cancer control and other components of the SCP. Through ongoing development, implementation and evaluation of program components, the ICC will continue to investigate the causes of cancer, seek effective methods of prevention, and deliver treatment throughout the state. The ICC has a long-range commitment to the SCP and to the reduction of cancer incidence and mortality in the state of Illinois.
