Ethnicity is an important factor not only in the incidence of cancer but also in relation to symptom management. Inadequate pain management at home has been demonstrated to result in associated physical symptoms as well as great distress to patients and family.

The study purpose was to evaluate a structure program to educate patients about cancer pain management. The City of Hope quality-of-life (QOL) tool was used to measure patient outcomes in the QOL domains of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. The Patient Pain Questionnaire was used to assess knowledge and beliefs about pain.

A total of 369 patients were enrolled in the study. The three largest groups, Caucasians, Hispanics, and African Americans, were compared. There were several significant differences between groups; overall; Hispanics had the worst pain and QOL outcomes.

The findings demonstrate significant differences among the three ethnic groups, which indicates a continued need for cultural considerations in patient education.
