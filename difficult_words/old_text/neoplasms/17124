AT9283 is a potent inhibitor of the mitotic regulators, Aurora-kinases A and B, and has shown anti-tumor activity in patients with solid and haematological malignancies. This phase I study assessed safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of AT9283.

Patients with advanced, incurable solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received AT9283 as a continuous 24-hour infusion on days 1, 8 of a 21-day cycle. A 3 + 3 dose escalation design was used with a starting dose of 1.5 mg/m(2)/day. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected from all patients on cycle one, and pharmacodynamic samples were collected from 4 patients at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).

35 patients were evaluable for toxicity and 32 were evaluable for response. AT9283 was well tolerated, with main toxicities being reversible dose-related fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbance, anemia, lymphocytopenia and neutropenia. The dose limiting toxicities were febrile neutropenia (two patients) and neutropenia with grade 3 infection (1 patient) at 47 mg/m(2)/day (established as the maximum tolerated dose). The RP2D was 40 mg/m(2)/day. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed AT9283 appeared to follow linear kinetics, with a mean elimination half-life of 8.2 h. Pharmacodynamic analyses showed no consistent or significant changes, but trends suggested evidence of AT9283 inhibition and anti-proliferative activity. One patient had partial response and four patients experienced RECIST stable disease (median 2.6 months).

In this study, AT9283 was well tolerated. The RP2D is 40 mg/m(2)/day on days 1, 8 of a 21-day cycle. Ongoing AT9283 trials will assess efficacy and safety in solid and haematological cancers.
