Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Glivec, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) is a small molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase c-abl, c-kit and the platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Imatinib was developed for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) but was approved both in Europe and the US fro the treatment of CML and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Given its activity against both c-kit and PDGFR kinases and its remarkable safety profile, imatinib has been 'tried' in several solid tumors; results however have often been deceiving. We review the current data regarding the activity of imatinib in solid tumors, including GIST.
