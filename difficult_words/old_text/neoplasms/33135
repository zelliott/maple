Cancer chemotherapy regimens which had been used at a ward and outpatient chemotherapy in various departments were collected and made available to everybody in October, 2003. However, it was difficult to manage cancer chemotherapy regimens in real time, from the viewpoint of risk management. Then, the Cancer Chemotherapy Center took the leading part and established a chemotherapy exploratory committee, which consists of 4 doctors, 2 nurses and 2 pharmacists, in June, 2006. The department of pharmacy could control all cancer chemotherapy regimens by this system, and lead the proper use of increasing anticancer agents. Inquiries on prescription by the pharmacist contributed to proper medical treatment. The role of the cancer chemotherapy exploratory committee and its outcome are described for the purpose of the prevention of medical accidents in this paper.
