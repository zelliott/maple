While the importance of providing individualised communication to cancer patients is now well recognised, little is known about the stability and validity of patients' expressed preferences for information and involvement in decision-making. This study explored the stability and possible predictors of such preferences over time.

Cancer patients seeing two Medical Oncologists in an out-patient clinic at an Australian teaching hospital completed a questionnaire battery before and directly after one consultation, and before their next consultation. Eighty consecutive patients with heterogeneous cancers participated in the study. Preferences for general and specific information, involvement and support were elicited at each assessment. Locus of control and patient familiarity with the clinic were measured before the first consultation. Patient satisfaction with the consultation was assessed directly after the consultation. Demographic and disease data were recorded for each patient.

General preferences for information and involvement were relatively stable, at least in the short term; however there was considerable variability in preferences for specific topics of information. Patients whose condition had recently worsened were more likely to want progressively less involvement in decision-making. Gender, the doctor seen and religion were also predictive of patient preferences.

Situational factors, such as change in disease status, may alter a patient's preferences for information and involvement. If we wish to match the provision of information and support to the expressed needs of patients, we must ask patients at each consultation what those needs are.
