To describe a novel method by which small tissue fragments found in routine cytology specimens can be processed for histologic slides without destroying or damaging the cytologic specimen.

To develop a method by which small tissue fragments (microbiopsies) are removed from cytologic slides and processed through paraffin or plastic, after which histologic slides can be prepared.

In all cases described, the histologic sections from the microbiopsies were of excellent quality. Microscopic examination gave additional important information. Furthermore, immunochemistry could be performed on paraffin-processed microbiopsies.

This method can be of great value in cytologic specimens in which microbiopsies are present, not only in those cases in which cytologic information is insufficient for diagnosis, but also in cases with conclusive diagnostic information. Routinely applied, this method could make biopsies unnecessary in some cases.
