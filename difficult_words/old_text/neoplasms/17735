RNA rich preparations from lymphoid tissues of appropriate immunized donors, namely immune RNA (I-RNA), can transfer specific immune reactivity to normal recipients or to their cells. Because of this ability, I-RNA was considered as a good candidate for the immunoprophylaxis and immunotherapy of different diseases. Its use in neoplasic processes is reviewed here. The regression of small tumors, as well as the effective prevention of metastasis appearance after primary tumor surgery has been obtained in animal models. The results from human cancer therapy with I-RNA are still very confuse; however the data suggest that I-RNA has altered the natural history of the studied tumor. An intensification of better planned immunotherapy in animals and humans tumor models will lead to a deeper knowledge of the usefulness of this therapy.
