Cryoglobulinaemia is an infrequent process and has been classified in types I, II and III. Type I corresponds to monoclonal cryoglobulinaemia; types II and III are comprised in the group of mixed cryoglobulinaemias (MC). In MC type II, cryoglobulinaemias are made up of a monoclonal rheumatoid factor vs. a polyclonal IgG. In MC type III all compounds are polyclonal. Monoclonal cryoglobulinaemias are usually associated to malignant haematological processes, while MC are associated to systemic diseases and infection. More research is needed on the natural history, causes, treatment and evolution of cryoglobulinaemia. This revision analyses a more recent knowledge on this entity, as well as its association to neoplastic diseases.
