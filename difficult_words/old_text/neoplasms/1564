DC-based immunotherapy has shown early promise in clinical cancer trials, and efforts are being made to determine the optimal method of delivery of cells to achieve the best outcome. While it is accepted that mature DCs are required for stimulation of tumor-specific immunity, the route and frequency of injection and the optimal number of cells needed for clinical success are issues that are still being debated. To solve these questions controlled clinical trials are needed.
