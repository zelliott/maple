The Notch signaling plays a key role in cell differentiation, survival, and proliferation through diverse mechanisms. Thus, alterations of the Notch signaling can lead to a variety of disorders including human malignancies. Of considerable interest, recent evidence indicates that there is a significant cross-talk between Notch and microRNAs. As a key component of the Notch-mediated transcription complex, Notch can regulate expression of a number of microRNAs; at the same time, Notch ligands, Notch receptor or Notch effectors are also subject to regulation by microRNAs. Thus, a better understanding of how Notch signaling interacts with microRNAs in the context of cancer will help identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this review, we update on recent findings on microRNAs interacting with Notch signaling at various levels, leading to tumorigenesis or chemoresistance. We also highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting Notch signaling and related microRNAs.
