Among a new series of 28 3-carboxy or carbethoxy quinoxalines bearing a substituted benzylamino or N-[4-(aminomethyl)benzoyl]glutamate group on position 2 of the ring and various substituents at C-6, 7 positions, 21 were selected at the National Cancer Institute for evaluation of their in vitro anticancer activity. The results obtained seem to confirm that the carboxy or carbethoxy group on position 3 is not helpful, with a few exceptions, for the anticancer activity.
