Neuropathy is a common, often debilitating complication of cancer and its treatment. Effective management of this disorder depends on early diagnosis and an understanding of its underlying causes in the individual patient. In January 2009, NCCN gathered a multidisciplinary group to review the literature and discuss intervention strategies currently available to patients as well as areas that require research efforts. The task force, which comprised experts in anesthesiology, medical oncology, neurology, neuro-oncology, neurophysiology, nursing, pain management, and rehabilitation, was charged with the goal of outlining recommendations for the possible prevention, diagnosis, and management of neuropathy. This report documents the proceedings of this meeting with a general background on neuropathy and neuropathy in oncology, followed by discussions on challenges and research issues, evaluation criteria, and management of different symptoms associated with this disorder.
