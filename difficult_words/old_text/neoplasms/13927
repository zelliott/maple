Current concepts on oncogenes, "antioncogenes" and their role in tumorigenesis are presented. Normal functions of proto-oncogenes, mechanisms of their conversion to oncogenes and inactivation of "antioncogenes", effects of oncogenes in model systems in vitro and in vivo are considered. Special attention is paid to the nonrandom proto-oncogene and "antioncogene" alterations in human tumours and the possibilities of their use as diagnostic or prognostic criteria.
