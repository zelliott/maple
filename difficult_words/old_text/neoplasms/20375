Coping with cancer from the patient's or counselor's viewpoint means that strengths and resources depend on assessing predominant problems and acting appropriately to alleviate them. It does not always mean resolution of problems, but it does require understanding where the pressure points are that lead to more distress. Thus, counselors anticipate as well as understand actual distress; visualize various outcomes of different interventions, medical or otherwise; and narrow the gap between what is hoped for and what might be possible. Pastoral counseling needs a viewpoint that maintains morale in the utmost phase of terminal illness. Facing mortality is difficult for the counselor as well as significant others. Therefore, they must deal directly with bereavement and potential loss, if possible, indicating their willingness to confront ultimate questions, even without answers. Overall, the purpose of quality counseling is in the counselor: limitation is not futility. The job of counseling is not to figure out the universe or explain the unexplainable. Rather, the purpose of counseling is to help a suffering individual to come back within the range of normalized behavior and to become acceptable and credible. In this way, out of the web of vulnerability can come further strengths and resources.
