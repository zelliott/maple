The artificial selection of the directly acting or acute RNA tumor viruses for high transforming ability has led to the isolation of defective retroviral genomes that have picked up, by accidental recombination, some of the important genes that influence, trigger or regulate cell division. These genes belong to at least four functionally different groups. Each of them can contribute to tumor development and/or progression after activation by structural or regulatory changes. Growth factor genes may act as oncogenes following constitutive activation in a cell that normally responds to, but does not produce, the corresponding growth factor (the autocrine model, exemplified by sis). Growth factor receptors may be fixed in a state of continuous, faulty signalling by the truncation of their external, ligand binding portion (examples: erb-B, fms). Genes coding for proteins involved in signal transduction may be activated by point mutations in certain, important domains (example: the ras-family). DNA binding proteins, presumably involved in DNA replication may drive cell division after constitutive activation by retroviral insertion, chromosomal translocation or gene amplification (example: the myc-family).
