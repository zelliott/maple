In the broad field of radiation therapy optimization, both simple and complex problems have their origins in the interaction of the radiation beams with the biological structures of normal and malignant tissues of the human body. Therefore, it is no great surprise that many treatment optimization problems are best handled by the use of well-designed radiobiological models. The classic way of quantifying dose-response relations for tumors and normal tissues as well as their cross-correlation with each other and their dependence on the underlying genetic and molecular biology of the cell are first briefly reviewed. Radiobiological objective functions, such as the probability of achieving complication-free cure and its expectation value under influence of stochastic processes during the course of treatment, are defined and shown to solve many of the problems of radiation therapy planning. Finally, it is shown through the use of these quantifiers that, simply by introducing biologically optimal intensity modulated dose delivery, the treatment outcome can be improved by about 20% or more in cases with a complex spread of the disease. Once radiobiological optimal plans have been developed, they can be approximated by ordinary physical planning, but the biological objective functions are still needed to have a figure of merit for the quality of the treatment.
