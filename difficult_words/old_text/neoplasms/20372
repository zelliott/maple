Ehrlich's test, serum mucoproproteins, phosphohexoisomerase (PHI), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were studied in patients with cancer and age matched controls. All parameters studied were found to be significantly increased in cancer. Evaluation of Ehrlich's test, PHI and LDH for their validity as screening tests revealed that Ehrlich's test is better suited as a screening test for cancer. A positive correlation observed in the study between serum mucoproteins and Ehrlich's test strengthens the postulation that mucoproteins are responsible for the colour development in Ehrlich's test.
