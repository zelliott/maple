To examine social and romantic outcomes among survivors of childhood cancer and comparison peers during the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood.

Families were recruited when the children with cancer were 8-15-years-old and on initial treatment for a malignancy that did not primarily affect the central nervous system (i.e., non-CNS). At that time, each child with cancer was matched to a classmate of similar age, gender, and race for inclusion in a comparison group. For the current follow-up (7.29 years post-diagnosis), 56 survivors, 60 comparison peers, and their parents completed questionnaires after the youth's 18th birthday. Severity of treatment and late effects were rated by health care providers.

Survivors and comparison peers were similar on a variety of outcomes, including family background, social self-concept, social competence, family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships. Mothers reported that survivors engaged in fewer activities than comparison peers. The proportion of participants who lived with their parents, were dating, and expressed plans to marry or have children was similar between groups. Initial treatment intensity, time since diagnosis, and severity of late effects were associated with some indices of social adjustment.

The social and romantic outcomes of survivors of non-CNS cancer were similar to comparison peers during the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood. Disease and treatment factors had limited associations with outcomes. Clinical interventions to assist social development may not be necessary for all survivors, but additional research is needed to identify subgroups at risk for difficulties.
