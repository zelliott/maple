The efficacy of measurements of large granule-containing lymphocytes (LGL) as a screening test for population screening has been certified. Liquidators of the Chernobyl accident aftermath in 1986 and 1987, residents of the Tomsk district exposed to radiation as a result of accident, and patients with general somatic and malignant diseases were examined. The LGL level was fit for dividing the examinees into healthy and ill, but not for selecting subjects at a high risk of cancer. The reaction of the natural killer system to endogenic and exogenic injury is similar.
