Versican is a component of the extracellular matrix, which interacts with several matrix and cell surface molecules. Versican plays central roles in tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis and is implicated in the development of numerous diseases. The expression of versican by multiple cell types is differentially regulated in a temporal and spatial manner in physiological and pathological processes. It participates in various biological events such as tissue organization, cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. The physiology of versican and its role in the progression of diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and central nervous system injury are discussed.
