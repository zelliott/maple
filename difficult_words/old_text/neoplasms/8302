A genome scan was conducted to seek evidence for polymorphic genes that influence cause of death in mice produced by a cross between CB6F1 females and C3D2F1 males. Loci on chromosomes 1 and 4 were found to modulate risk of lymphoma. A locus on chromosome 4 influenced risk of mammary adenocarcinoma among multiparous female mice, but had no significant effect in virgin females. A chromosome 4 locus was found to modulate risk of death from either hemangiosarcoma or fibrosarcoma. A suggestive linkage was noted (at p =.09) between a marker on chromosome 11 and hepatocellular carcinoma. Lastly, a locus on chromosome 6 was noted to influence the likelihood that pulmonary adenocarcinoma would be present at death. The collection of normal and neoplastic tissues from 1004 terminal necropsies, together with genetic information, provides a valuable resource for further studies of the genetic influences on late-life diseases in mice.
