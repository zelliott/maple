Current cancer care focuses on procuring the most up-to-date therapy to prevent cancer death. However, the majority of cancer survivors will not die from cancer but from cardiovascular disease.A cancer diagnosis presents a 'teachable moment' for lifestyle behavior change.Changes in key behavioral risk factors reduce cardiovascular risk; yet, this potential for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease among cancer survivors is often overlooked.Evidence now exists for both individual clinic-based approaches and complementary community-based strategies to induce successful behavior change.We propose a systematic re-alignment of clinical and research focus to complement cancer surveillance and adjuvant treatments with key patient-and community-based strategies to improve lifestyles in cancer survivors [added].
