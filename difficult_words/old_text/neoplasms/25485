The authors study the action of ionizing radiations upon some aspects of the humoral and cellular immune responses in cancer patients. Both humoral and cellular responses are altered in patients having malignant neoplasms; the therapeutic irradiation diminishes the phagocytic activity of monocytes and granulocytes, the number of lymphocytes, the formation of E rosettes, and the lymphocytes blastic transformation, and produces some changes in immunoglobulins. However, the irradiation-induced changes are such that radiation therapy does not conditionate negatively the neoplastic process evolution.
