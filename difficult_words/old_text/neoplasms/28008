The failure of chemotherapy to eradicate tumor cells is often due to the development of drug resistance. MDR(multidrug resistance) whose one form of resistance results from a decreased intracellular accumulation of the drugs, most often mediated by the overexpression of P-glycoprotein. MRP also related to pump function of cell membrane in acute leukemia. We have developed the new quantitative assay based on real-time PCR to measure expression of drug-resistance related genes such as MDR-1 and MRP in clinical samples. These results indicates that real-time PCR system is a reliable method to quantitatively determine drug resistant genes expression, it may be to predict responsiveness to chemotherapy by using this technique.
