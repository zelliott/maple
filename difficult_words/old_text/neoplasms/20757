Garlic (Allium sativum) and onion (Allium cepa) are among the oldest of all cultivated plants. Additionally, both plants have been used as medicinal agents for thousands of years. Both garlic and onion have been shown to have applications as antimicrobial, antithrombotic, antitumor, hypolipidaemic, antiarthritic and hypoglycemic agents. In recent years, extensive research has focussed on the beneficial and medicinal properties of garlic and onions. In particular, the use of these agents in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer is an area of considerable investigation and interest.
