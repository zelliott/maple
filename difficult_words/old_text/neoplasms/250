The mean percentage of cells forming rosettes with 2-aminoethyl isothiouronium bromide-treated sheep erythrocytes (EAETRFC) in the peripheral blood of 10 horn cancer-affected cattle (40.05 +/- 2.91) was significantly low in comparison to the value in unaffected control animals (58.61 +/- 1.68). Immunotherapy with a saline phenol extract of allogeneic tumour tissue resulted in a gradual increase in the mean percentage of EAETRFC on each subsequent week. The increase was statistically significant from the second week onwards and on the sixth week, the percentage of EAETRFC in horn cancer affected cattle (56.80 +/- 1.38) closely approximated the value in unaffected controls.
