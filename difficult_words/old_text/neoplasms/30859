Clinicians use ethical decision making in their practice by applying professional and societal values in an organized way to solve moral dilemmas. Moral dilemmas are those situations in which a decision must be made between conflicting goods or evils or rights or wrongs. Clinicians must understand the medical profession's and society's values and be able to apply them within ethical systems.
