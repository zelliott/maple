To describe hospital bed utilization in the final 6 months of life in patients dying of cancer in Ontario, Canada.

Hospital separation records were linked to a population-based cancer registry to identify factors associated with hospitalization in the 203,713 patients who died of cancer in Ontario between 1986 and 1998.

Between 1986 and 1998, 5.3% of all acute care beds in Ontario were devoted to the care of cancer patients in the last 6 months of life. The mean time spent in hospital in the last 6 months of life decreased from 34.3 days in 1986 to 22.7 days in 1998. Hospitalization rates increased exponentially during the last month of life. Patients younger than 50 years of age, women, and residents of poorer communities spent significantly longer in hospital than others. Hospitalization rates differed very little among the common solid tumors, but patients with CNS malignancies, the lymphomas, and the leukemias spent significantly longer in hospital than the other groups. There was significant interregional variations in hospitalization that were not explained by differences in case mix. There was a statistically significant inverse correlation between the rate of use of palliative radiotherapy and the hospital bed use in the county in which the patient resided.

The total time spent in hospital in the last 6 months of life has decreased over the last decade, but acute care hospitals continue to play a large role in the care of patients who are dying of cancer.
