Cancer is second only to trauma as the leading cause of death in children 1-15 years of age. Pediatric cancer patients have unique physiologic, pharmacologic, and psychologic considerations that present a unique challenge to plan anesthesiologist. A thorough understanding of pediatric tumors, along with chemotherapeutics and their complications, is necessary to plan anesthetic management properly. Special attention is directed to the psychologic needs and preparation of both the patient and parents. Close cooperation and coordination among the pediatric oncologist, surgeon, and anesthesiologist are necessary for safe and expeditious operative care.
