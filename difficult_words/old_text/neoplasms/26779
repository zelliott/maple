Inflammatory processes involving polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) play an important role in cancer. PMNL can affect the formation and growth of the tumor. Cancer cells produce significant amounts of hyaluronans (HA), which pass into the extracellular space and are responsible for the inhibition of PMNL function through TLR4 receptor, and increase in the production of IL 10 the immunosuppressive cytokine as well as the other proinflammatory cytokines. HA supported the metastasis of cancer cells by binding to the CD44 receptor on endothelial cells. Increased PMNL--Lymphocyte ratio as a negative prognostic factor indicates also the important not defined role of PMNL in carcinogenesis.
