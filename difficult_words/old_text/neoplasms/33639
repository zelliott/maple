Multiple endocrine neoplasis type 2A (MEN2A) is one of several kinds of cancers that appear to be inherited in an autosomally dominant fashion. We have assigned the MEN2A locus to chromosome 10 by linkage with a new DNA marker (D10S5). The linkage led us to investigate other chromosome 10 markers and demonstrate linkage between the disease locus and the interstitial retinol-binding protein (IRBP) gene. The D10S5 locus was sublocalized to 10q21.1 by hybridization in situ and the IRBP gene to p11.2----q11.2 with a secondary site at q24----q25. The linkages were established using 292 members of five families, three different restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) at D10S5 and two RFLPs recognized by the IRBP probe. The recombination frequencies from pairwise linkage analysis between the disease and two marker loci D10S5 and IRBP were 0.19 and 0.11, with maximum lod scores of 3.6 and 8.0 respectively. Ordering of the three loci by multipoint analysis placed the IRBP gene approximately midway between the disease and D10S5 loci.
