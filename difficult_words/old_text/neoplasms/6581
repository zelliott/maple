This paper reviews the experimental results of our research in the past several years and other related papers that have been directed toward the occurrence, biotransformation and epidemiological significance of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds in biosphere. Endogenous carcinogens are a group of cancer-causing compounds produced in vivo from harmless precursors. This category has been exemplified by the well-known carcinogens, N-nitroso compounds. The significance of naturally occurring amines and amides as precursors of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds in vivo and their implication in the incidence of human cancer have been investigated and emphasized. Extremely high levels of trimethylamine-N-oxide and dimethylamine were detected in squids and other seafoods. More than 90% of trimethylamine-N-oxide were converted to dimethylamine and trimethylamine on pyrolysis. Low levels of dimethylamine and methylamine were also detected in the fermented soybean products, wines and sauces. Both dimethylamine and trimethylamine are excellent precursors of dimethylnitrosamine. Several naturally occurring aromatic amines especially 2-carboline derivatives such as harman, norharman, harmaline, harmalol, harmine and harmol are mutagenic and become more mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium after nitrosation. Appreciable amounts of piperidine were detected in the popular spice white and black pepper powders. Under acidic condition, piperidine reacts readily with nitrite to form carcinogenic N-nitroso-piperidine. N-Nitrosophenacetin was formed from the reaction of nitrite with the amide drug phenacetin. This new compound showed strong mutagenicity to Salmonella typhimurium and Sarcina lutea and strong teratogenic activity to Leghorn chicken embryos. Studies have shown that the majority of N-nitroso compounds in the body come from in vivo conversion. Most investigators believe that this endogenous pool of N-nitroso compounds may prove to be a major exposure route in man. The presence of naturally occurring amines and amides in the diet then becomes one of the crucial limiting steps in the formation of endogenous N-nitroso compounds in vivo.
