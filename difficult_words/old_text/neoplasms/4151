The present study investigated the ability of supernatants collected from cultures of healthy donor-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HD-PBMCs) stimulated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb) (allogeneic CD3 supernatants; ACD3S) to induce, upon brief exposure, tumour-reactive cytotoxic lymphocytes in cancer patients' PBMCs. ACD3S enhanced natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity. ACD3S contained increased levels of interleukins (IL) 1, 2, 6, 7 and 12, as well as of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). MAbs against these cytokines significantly reduced the ACD3S-induced cytotoxicity. ACD3S-induced cytotoxicity was not inhibited by anti-CD4, CD8 and MHC class I MAbs, but was markedly reduced in the presence of MAb against CD18. In contrast to HD-PBMC, ACD3S derived from cancer patients' lymphocytes exhibited lower levels of the above-mentioned cytokines and exerted reduced biological activity. In conclusion, ACD3S are able to activate, upon short-term incubation, tumour-reactive lymphocytes from cancer patients' PBMCs that lyse a variety of tumour targets, including autologous tumours. ACD3S contain high levels of certain cytokines that positively influence the induction of autologous tumour-reactive lymphocytes. Such supernatants can be collected easily from healthy donors and stored until use in clinical trials for adoptive cellular therapy of cancer. They may also be indicated in the construction of cytokine cocktails that have the ability to induce anti-tumour cytotoxicity.
