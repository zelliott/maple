The primary objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a population-based tumor registry to identify occupational groups at high risk of developing cancer. The study group comprised 6,424 union members residing in the San Francisco/Oakland Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) who represent six occupations: asbestos workers, bakers, painters, plasterers, plumbers and roofers. Computer linkage of union rosters to the California Tumor Registry (CTR) file identified incident cases of cancer. The CTR's age-sex-year-specific incidence rates were used to calculate the expected number of cancer cases, and estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). The results demonstrate, as expected, increased cancer incidence (SIR = 498) for trachea, bronchus, lung and pleura among asbestos workers, a group widely recognized as having high risk for respiratory cancers, and among painters (SIR = 199). Strengths and weaknesses of such an approach are discussed.
