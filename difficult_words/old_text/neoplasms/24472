Cellular senescence is an anti-cancer mechanism and may contribute to organismal aging. A change in paradigm has been proposed that cellular senescence may reduce cancer mortality rather than promote it late in life, and thus positively contributes to longevity in organisms with renewable tissues as a common mechanism across the species.
