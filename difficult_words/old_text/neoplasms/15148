Results of investigations performed to obtain data on genomic instability in subjects with increased risk of cancer are reported. People at risk for environmental or genetic factors included in this study were: 1) individuals from the Seveso population exposed to dioxin; 2) psoriatic patients exposed to photochemotherapy; 3) members of a family with a high incidence of colonic cancer; 4) patients affected by nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome; 5) patients with photosensitivity. The following cellular parameters were analyzed in peripheral blood lymphocytes: (i) frequency of chromosome aberrations and of sister chromatid exchanges; ii) sensitivity to different DNA damaging agents; iii) efficiency of DNA repair after UV irradiation and iv) frequency of spontaneous mutations.
