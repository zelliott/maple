Acquired or spontaneous resistance is a major clinical problem in the treatment of cancer. Low levels of MDR gene expression or P-glycoprotein have been correlated with a high level of drug resistance in vitro and a poor response to chemotherapy in some tumors. A strong correlation between MDR mRNA, P-glycoprotein levels and degree of drug resistance has not been found in several resistant model tumor cell lines. In some cell lines at low and high level of resistance different mechanisms seem to be involved.
