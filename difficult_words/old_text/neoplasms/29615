Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) are an exciting new group of targeted therapies under active clinical research in many solid tumors, in particular, lung cancer. Small-molecule VDAs are the focus of current clinical research, and consist of the flavonoids and the tubulin-binding agents. Toxicities of single-agent VDAs are characterized by acute, transient, and generally noncumulative side effects including headaches, nausea and vomiting, tumor pain, hypertension, and tachycardia. Flavonoid agents can also cause infusion site pain, visual disturbances, electrocardiac abnormalities, and symptoms consistent with an acute release of serotonin. Tubulin-binding agents can result in cardiac ischemia, abdominal pain, neuromotor abnormalities and cerebellar ataxia, and acute hemodynamic changes. Clinical trials investigating VDAs in combination with traditional chemotherapy have also shown the potential for significant pharmacologic and adverse toxicity interactions. Further research will need to focus on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters to optimize dosing schedules, determine effective combinations with chemotherapy, and minimize toxicities associated with VDAs.
