The work in biomedical laboratories is associated with exposure to a mixture of known and potential chemical carcinogens, mutagens, and teratogens. Previous studies have suggested an excess of brain tumors and hematopoietic system malignancies as well as breast cancers in women.

This retrospective cohort study investigated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for cancer in biomedical research laboratory personnel in Swedish universities 1970-1992. The cohort comprised 5,035 laboratory and, as an internal reference group, 2,923 nonlaboratory employees.

The overall death rate was lower in both groups than in the general population. The SIR for brain tumors among male laboratory workers was 1.69 (0.62-3.68) and among male laboratory scientists, after more than 10 years of work (4 cases), it was 3.11 (0.85-7.56). There was an elevated SIR for malignant melanoma among female scientists in laboratories (3.51, 0.96-8.98) and for male scientists in nonlaboratory departments (2.86, 1.05-6.22). The SIR for breast cancer among female laboratory scientists was 1.62 (0.78-2.98).

The present findings lend some support to an excess of brain tumors among male scientists and of breast cancer in female scientists in biomedical research laboratories.
