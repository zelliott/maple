We have used the AO unreamed femoral nail for stabilization of impending and complete pathological fractures since March 1994. 27 patients with 30 pathological fractures (23) or impending fractures (7) of the femur were retrospectively analyzed. These included 18 subtrochanteric fractures, 11 shaft fractures and 1 distal fracture. The mean age of the patients was 68 (51-84) years. All patients were treated with a solid femoral nail inserted by an unreamed technique. The nail was inserted through a minimally invasive approach and with a median surgical time of 55 (35-70) minutes. A reconstructive proximal locking option (spiral blade) was used in 25 cases. There were no intraoperative complications, no operative mortality. Reliable skeletal stability was obtained in all cases and most were able to mobilize early with minimum discomfort. 1 case was revised for a secondary fracture through a distal metastasis at 6 months. The median survival was 5 (2-9) months. Unreamed nailing with the AO solid femoral nail appears to be a good option for the stabilization of pathological femoral fractures.
