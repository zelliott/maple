This study was designed to investigate the predictive role of 5-FU metabolic enzymes in malignant ascites. Forty-three malignant ascites were collected and primary cancer cells were isolated. Gene expression was detected by quantitative RT-PCR. We found that DPD mRNA was higher in patients with pancreatic cancers than those with gastric cancers, colon cancers, and liver cancers. Significant correlations were found between expression of DPD and TP, and between TS and OPRT. mRNA levels of TS and OPRT correlated significantly with the chemosensitivity of 5-FU. Assessing gene expression would be useful in predicting 5-FU sensitivity for patients with malignant ascites.
