The pharmacokinetic parameters of ceftazidime were determined in 25 patients with neoplastic diseases. A group of 13 patients each received 1 g of ceftazidime over 15 min as a single intravenous dose. The mean peak drug concentration in serum was 77.4 micrograms/ml, and the serum half-life was 144 min. Urinary excretion at 12 h was 64.5%. These 13 patients also received 2 g of ceftazidime over 15 min at 8-h intervals for 7 or 8 days. The mean peak drug concentrations in serum were 103.6 micrograms/ml on day 1 and 87 micrograms/ml on day 7 or 8. A second group of 12 patients received 1 g of ceftazidime over 30 min, followed by 1 g over 2 h and every 4 h thereafter. The mean peak drug concentration in serum at 30 min was 57.5 micrograms/ml. Average peak and trough levels obtained on day 2 or 3 were 65 and 34.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, and remained in this range thereafter. The above-mentioned dose schedules produced high and adequate ceftazidime concentrations in serum.
