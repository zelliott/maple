Twenty-one patients undergoing either adjuvant or palliative intraperitoneal (ip) chemotherapy had repeated scintigraphic peritoneographies. Significant scintigraphic ip changes were recorded in 11 patients (52%). In patients without residual disease at the time of ip chemotherapy, the rate of ip mal-distribution reached 70%. These alterations did not correlate with clinical complications. Our study suggested that, independently of clinical assessment, scintigraphic peritoneography is a useful test for identifying patients who are no longer suitable for ip treatment, due to inadequate locoregional distribution.
