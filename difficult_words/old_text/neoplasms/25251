It is well known that the use of a microwave oven greatly reduces the time for histoprocessing.

Apply the microwave-based histoprocessing method "Fast Track Biopsy" (FTB), previously described for breast needle-core biopsies, to samples of other organs.

From 01/09/2008 to 31/12/2008, 125 normal and neoplastic tissue samples (thickness from 0.2 and 1.2 cm) were collected, processed according to the FTB technique, stained with haematoxylin/eosin (H/E) and analysed with tissue-specific immunohistochemical (IHC) markers.

The quality of both H/E and IHC stained sections was comparable to that obtained with standard methods. Sample thickness less than 0.5 cm gave better results.

the FTB method is suitable for most tissue types, and is thus useful for preoperatory diagnoses.
