Cancer patients have a great need for information. Besides the attending physician as the most valued source of information they use various other sources. The broad avail-ability of information raises the need for "meta-information" for assessment, explanation and integration into the individual context. Here, a telephone information ser-vice meeting high quality standards can of-fer substantial support, combining the advantages of mass media with interpersonal communication. The cancer information ser-vice (KID), established at the German Can-cer Research Center in 1986 with funding by the Federal Ministry of Health, has implemented this concept of health information for the first time on a national basis. The KID provides comprehensive and up-to-date information on all cancer-related issues tailored to individual needs as well as address-es and resources of institutions and organisations of cancer care. Around 40% of KID users are patients. Major concerns are reassurance, assessment and integration of information from other sources, the need for guidance through the health care system and for supportive communication.Tele-phone information can bridge information gaps and deficits and enhance the doctor-patient relationship by building a basis for in-depth discussions. To meet the needs and new information preferences, the KID also publishes brochures and offers information via the Internet and an e-mail service. The KID is integrated in a network of can-cer care resources and, through documentation and evaluation of the calls, contributes to cancer information tailored to the needs of patients.
