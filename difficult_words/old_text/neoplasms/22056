Since the original discovery of telomerase, a clear association with cancer has been demonstrated. Cell-cycle dysregulation is a hallmark of tumor cells. The ability of normal cells to undergo cell-cycle arrest after damage to DNA is crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. The biochemical pathways that stop the cell cycle in response to cellular stressors are called checkpoints. Defective checkpoint function results in genetic modifications that contribute to tumorigenesis. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the relation of telomerase activity, dysregulation of Cell-cycle and tumorigenesis.
