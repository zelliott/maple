Vinflunine is a novel second generation of Vinca alkaloid. The binding of vinflunine to tubulin and subsequent cellular arrest in mitosis is the core mechanism of this antineoplastic agent. In addition, its potential vascular-disrupting and antiangiogenic activities uphold further clinical development of this compound.

To review and summarise the pharmacological and latest clinical data, and discuss the impact of vinflunine on current treatment regimens.

A review of published literature and conference abstracts for results of previous preclinical and latest clinical studies in all cancer types was performed.

Noteworthy results from Phase II studies for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer and bladder cancer supported Phase III studies. One of the Phase III studies for treatment of advanced NSCLC showed important results. Encouraging results of combination use of vinflunine and other biologic agents also opened areas to investigate its synergistic or auxiliary role to existing therapies.
