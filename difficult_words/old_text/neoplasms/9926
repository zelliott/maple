Sural nerves from six patients with polyneuropathy as a remote accompaniment of malignancy were studied by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and immuno-electron microscopy. Sural nerves also were studied in twelve control patients with malignant diseases without peripheral neuropathy and in fifteen with neuropathy associated with nonmalignant conditions. Only nerves from the first group of six patients showed immune deposits of immunoglobulin M, C3, and C1q as granular or confluent layers in the inner laminae of the perineurium as well as in and around endoneural capillaries. The findings are similar to those in published studies of Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia, chronic relapsing polyneuropathy, and neuropathy of monoclonal gammopathy and extend the list of conditions to include several forms of carcinoma and Hodgkin's disease.
