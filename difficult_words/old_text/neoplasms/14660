Retinoids clearly show both prophylactic and therapeutic effects against many kinds of neoplasm. Vitamin A deficiency and vitamin A excess, which are very different states clinically and metabolically, should be separately considered relative to carcinogenesis. The anticancer effects of retinoids and related compounds may be more closely related to their chemical structure than to their similarity to the structure and function of vitamin A. Retinoids act on cells and tissues in a number of ways. Although many interesting ideas have been proposed to clarify their mode of action, no single hypothesis adequately explains their many molecular interactions and responses. Investigation of early molecular interactions between retinoids and cells and the subsequent metabolism of retinoids in neoplastic and normal cells may aid in the clarification of their action as antineoplastic agents.
