Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a DNA mimic with a pseudopeptide backbone composed of aminoethyl glycine units. Several features of PNA, such as superior hybridization affinities to RNA and DNA, high biological stability, and convenient solid-phase synthesis, make it a promising candidate for use as a gene targeting drug. Here we review the chemical and biological properties of PNA in relation to its potential as an anti-cancer drug.
