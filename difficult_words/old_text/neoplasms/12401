Akt plays a central role in the regulation of cellular anti-apoptosis underlying various human neoplastic diseases. We have demonstrated previously that TCL1 (a proto-oncogene underlying human T cell prolymphocytic leukemia) interacts with Akt and functions as an Akt kinase co-activator. With the aim to develop an Akt kinase inhibitor, we hypothesized that a peptide, which spans the Akt-binding site, binds to Akt and modulates Akt kinase activity and its downstream biological responses. Indeed, we demonstrated that a peptide, named "Akt-in" (Akt inhibitor, NH(2)-AVTDHPDRLWAWEKF-COOH, encompassing the betaA strand of human TCL1), interacted with Akt and specifically inhibited its kinase activity. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies suggested that interaction of Akt-in with the pleckstrin homology domain (PH) of Akt caused conformational changes on the variable loop 1 of Akt, the locus mediating phosphoinositide binding. Consistently, interaction of Akt-in with the Akt PH domain prevented phosphoinositide binding and hence inhibited membrane translocation and activation of Akt. Moreover, Akt-in inhibited not only cellular proliferation and anti-apoptosis in vitro but also in vivo tumor growth without any adverse effect. The roles of Akt, which possesses a PH domain, in intracellular signaling were well established. Hence, Akt inhibitors create an attractive target for anticancer therapy. However, no effective inhibitors specific for Akt have been developed. Akt-in, which inhibits association of phosphatidylinositol with Akt, is the first molecule to demonstrate specific Akt kinase inhibition potency. This observation will facilitate the design of specific inhibitors for Akt, a core intracellular survival factor underlying various human neoplastic diseases.
