Four policy challenges that face the rehabilitation community in providing services to surgical cancer patients are reviewed: (1) achieving capacity to meet the complex rehabilitation needs of a growing population of cancer patients and long-term survivors; (2) identifying effective models for delivering cancer rehabilitation services; (3) understanding complex insurance coverage and payment policies and determining their effects on access to rehabilitation services; and (4) investing in clinical and health services research to guide rehabilitation practice. Recommendations are made to increase the recognition of cancer rehabilitation as an essential component of cancer survivors' care, improve access to appropriate rehabilitation services, and accelerate the pace of cancer rehabilitation research.
