The diagnosis and treatment of cancer is complex. Multidisciplinary tumor board discussions optimise the care of patients suffering from cancer. The most promising and rational treatment is chosen taking into account the opinion from all participants. Quality of life is important if only a palliative approach can be offered. The final decision concerning the treatment will be taken by the patient because he/she has the right to refuse the best treatment for personal reasons.
