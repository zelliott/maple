Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) plays an important role in a number of cellular processes including DNA repair. Since poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation occurs in response to radiation- or drug-induced DNA damage, inhibitors of the enzyme may enhance the antitumour activity of radiotherapy or cytotoxic drug treatment. In this review the development of PARP inhibitors is discussed, and structure-activity relationships amongst inhibitors of the enzyme are presented. Studies to date regarding the in vitro and in vivo activity of PARP inhibitors, as resistance modifying agents in cancer therapy, are also overviewed.
