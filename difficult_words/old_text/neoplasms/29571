The objective of this study was to determine whether a standardized, commercial wellness protocol (Creating Wellness) that focuses on diet, exercise, vitamin supplementation, and one-on-one coaching improves anthropometric and physiologic function and reduces health risk factors.

Using a retrospective analysis of subject data collected through a central data repository, several measures of anthropometric and physiologic function were analyzed for changes in outcome.

There were 197 private chiropractic clinics in the United States utilizing the Creating Wellness protocol in 2007. A total of 178 subjects completed an 18-week protocol and had initial and final assessments. All anthropometric and physiologic measures showed improvement following the intervention; therefore, this standardized wellness protocol was shown to improve weight, heart rate, blood pressure, strength, body-mass index, and forced vital capacity. Paired sample t tests and significance testing for the entire sample, and for both genders separately, determined that these changes were statistically significant.

The Creating Wellness protocol leads to improved health risk factor outcomes based on improvement in anthropometric and physiologic measures in this study population. The results of these tests are generally accepted measures of risk for cardiovascular events, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. There are little evaluative data on health outcomes related to programs designed to reduce risk of lifestyle-related diseases. For those clients utilizing the program evaluated in this study, there appears to be evidence suggesting improved health risk factor outcomes from participation in this specific protocol. The results of this study have implications related to a broad number of public health issues related to management of chronic lifestyle diseases.
