NEW STRATEGIES: Fever in a neutropenic patient requires the rapid initiation of a broad spectrum antibiotic and continued until correction of the neutropenia. Several studies have been conducted recently in order to define the populations of children in whom the antibiotherapy could be suspended early without risk of relapse of fever and/or severe infection. Moreover, the high costs of hospitalisation and the limited number of beds in the departments of Paediatric Oncology Haematology have led to studies on the feasibility of an antibiotherapy at home. THE EARLY SUSPENSION OF THE ANTIBIOTHERAPY: The criteria retained in several studies for the early suspension of the antibiotherapy have been: apyrexia for at least 24 hours, a satisfactory clinical status, the absence of positive haemocultures and haematological signs showing the end of aplasia in patients in remission of their disease. Studies have confirmed the possibility of early suspension of intravenous antibiotics in low-risk patients, without fever and without microbiological signs. THE PLACE OF ORAL ANTIBIOTICS: In several comparative studies, the success rate with intravenous antibiotics and oral antibiotics was comparable. The rate of failures was greater in patients with severe initial neutropenia. OUTPATIENT ANTIBIOTICS: In children, 2 types of studies have been conducted. The first studied the feasibility of an antibiotherapy at home following antibiotherapy in the hospital in order to reduce the costs and duration of hospitalisation. The others proposed an antibiotherapy at home from the start, either with the intravenous or the oral route. Following all these studies, it appeared that, in certain low-risk neutropenic children with fever, not only the antibiotics could be suspended before the complete correction of the neutropenia, but also a large spectrum oral antibiotherapy could replace the intravenous antibiotherapy and outpatient treatment would therefore be feasible.
