Little is known about the molecular machinery that contributes to site-specific copy number variations or how CNVs fit into the chronology of tumor progression. Black etÂ al. (2013) now demonstrate that the overexpression of a histone demethylase induces transient copy gain of specific genomic loci known to harbor proto-oncogenes.
