Due to the successes of kidney transplantation, patients with allografts are enjoying long-term survival. In addition to care of the allograft with lifelong administration of immunosuppressive medications, common medical conditions must be recognized and managed appropriately. With constraints on the transplant centers and patient considerations of finance and geography, it is recognized that community providers will play an ever increasing role in the care of the kidney transplant recipient.
