In three patients on cytostatic drugs acute bilaterally symmetrical pulmonary infiltrates developed. Bacterial, viral or mycotic infections were excluded. The histological findings in the lungs of two had died were those of nonspecific alveolitis. Clinical and radiological findings, as well as the rapid regression of the infiltrates after stopping the cytostatic drugs in the third patient and the marked similarity of the X-ray picture to some similar cases reported in the literature, suggest that these infiltrates resulted from an acute allergic reaction to the cytostatic drugs.
