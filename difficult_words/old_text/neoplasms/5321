Changing economic circumstances have brought increased pressure to bear on the traditional revenue sources of oncologists. Practice standards and settings are being challenged to generate cost savings both for third-party payers and for oncology practices. Add to this the growing number of patients older than 65 years, and particularly older than 85 years, and the profession is facing a forced reconsideration of its approach to patient treatment. The current and future training of oncologists needs to incorporate both a multidisciplinary approach of cancer subspecialties and an enhanced ability to evaluate the use and cost-effectiveness of new therapies, second-line and third-line therapies, and palliative treatments.
