Gastrointestinal obstruction is a common problem in advanced malignant disease, but its management remains controversial. In those patients for whom surgery is not appropriate, medical intervention is the only remaining option. We present a series of 14 patients with intestinal obstruction who were managed with subcutaneous injections of octreotide, a somatostatin analogue which reduces the volume of gastrointestinal secretions. Good control of vomiting was achieved in 12 patients, and no major side effects were observed. Octreotide would appear to be a useful drug in this clinical situation.
