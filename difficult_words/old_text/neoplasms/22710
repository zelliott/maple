Tramadol and dihydrocodeine (DHC) are analgesics of step 2 WHO analgesic ladder (opioids for mild to moderate pain, weak opioids) frequently used in the treatment of cancer pain of moderate intensity. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of tramadol and DHC treatment on quality of life (QL) and performance status (PS) of patients with cancer pain.

Randomised, cross-over, clinical study of 40 opioid-naive patients with nociceptive cancer pain who received tramadol or DHC controlled release tablets for 7 days, and then drugs were switched and administered for another 7 days. Pain was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS), QL by EORTC QLQ C 30, and PS by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and Karnofsky.

From 40 patients recruited, 30 completed the study. DHC treatment provided better analgesia (VAS). In QL functional scales, better emotional functioning in tramadol group and better global QL and cognitive functioning in DHC group were observed. In symptom scales, less fatigue, pain and sleep disturbances, less nausea and vomiting and better appetite in DHC group were noted. In tramadol group, less constipation and less financial problems were observed. No differences in dyspnoea and diarrhoea were noted. ECOG and Karnofsky PS were low and did not differ between tramadol and DHC groups.

Dihydrocodeine treatment was associated with better global QL, cognitive functioning, analgesia and appetite, less fatigue, sleep disturbances, nausea and vomiting. Tramadol therapy was connected with better emotional functioning, less constipation and financial problems. PS deteriorated in both tramadol and DHC groups.
