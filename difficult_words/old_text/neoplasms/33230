Children's pain is undertreated worldwide. Using a model of pediatric cancer pain management in Amman, Jordan, the authors demonstrated that an action research approach to pain service development resulted in a sustainable program of pain control. Barriers to care were due more often to health professionals' misconceptions concerning pain and opioid use than to concerns related to cultural, religious, or societal beliefs. Successful implementation of a pain management program requires education, policy development, and support from several levels of hospital administration. Role-modeling and mentorship are important factors. Established knowledge translation theories explained some but not all of the findings. Outcomes included consistent pain assessment and documentation by nursing staff, increased consultation for pain management, and increased use of intravenous opioids.
