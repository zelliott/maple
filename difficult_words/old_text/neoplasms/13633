For decades, cancer therapy has focused on DNA-directed mechanisms of cytotoxicity, utilising agents with limited efficacy and significant toxicity. Recent advances in tumour biology have elucidated the molecular pathways implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of cancers and have resulted in the discovery of a variety of novel molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Promising novel agents targeting signal transduction pathways, cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis and apoptosis are in clinical testing and are discussed in this review.
