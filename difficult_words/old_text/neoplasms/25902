KW-2149 is a new, semisynthetic, C-7-N-Substituted, mitomycin C analog showing antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo, equal or superior to mitomycin C. In a phase I study, KW-2149 was administered as an i.v. bolus injection every 21 days and at a dose of 100 mg/m2 pulmonary toxicity was dose limiting. Animal studies have indicated since that KW-2149-induced pulmonary toxicity can be prevented by pretreatment with corticosteroids. This paper presents the results of a further phase I study of KW-2149 with corticosteroid pretreatment. Patients were treated with oral dexamethasone 8 mg every 12 h, starting 24 h before KW-2149 administration, for 5 days. KW-2149 was given as an i.v. bolus injection every 21 days. Seventeen patients were treated with a total of 48 courses. Six patients received 60 mg/m2 and 11 patients 75 mg/m2. Two courses were not evaluable for toxicity. Significant lung toxicity was observed in at least three patients treated with a dose of 75 mg/m2 KW-2149 and pulmonary toxicity was therefore considered the dose-limiting toxicity at 75 mg/m2. No other important side effects were noted. One partial response was observed in a patient with colorectal cancer. Pretreatment with dexamethasone failed to suppress KW-2149-induced lung toxicity.
