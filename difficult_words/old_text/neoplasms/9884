In 38 patients with FUO, celiotomy provided a definitive or tentative diagnosis for which specific therapy could be prescribed in 19. No pattern of signs, symptoms or laboratory findings could be defined which might improve the diagnostic yield. In evaluating the outcome in nonoperated upon patients with FUO, prolonged observation or therapeutic trials have been no more successful in reaching a definitive diagnosis. The current process of selection of patients with FUO for celiotomy, although imperfect, has brought about a diagnosis in almost all patients with treatable malignant neoplasms and has not resulted in excessive morbidity or mortality in those who did not undergo operation.
