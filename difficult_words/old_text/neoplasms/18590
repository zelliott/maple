There is ample mounting evidence that reactive oxidant species are exacerbated in inflammatory processes, many pathological conditions, and underlying processes of chronic age-related diseases. Therefore there is increased expectation that therapeutics can be developed that act in some fashion to suppress reactive oxidant species and ameliorate the condition. This has turned out to be more difficult than at first expected. Developing therapeutics for indications in which reactive oxidant species are an important consideration presents some unique challenges. We discuss important questions including whether reactive oxidant species should be a therapeutic target, the need to recognize the fact that an antioxidant in a defined chemical system may be a poor antioxidant operationally in a biological system, and the importance of considering that reactive oxidant species may accompany the disease or pathological system rather than being a causative factor. We also discuss the value of having preclinical models to determine if the processes that are important in causing the disease under study are critically dependent on reactive oxidant species events and if the therapeutic under consideration quells these processes. In addition we discuss measures of success that must be met in commercial research and development and in preclinical and clinical trials and discuss as examples our translational research effort in developing nitrones for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and as anti-cancer agents.
