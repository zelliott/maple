ACOS 2010 was held last August 25 through 27, with the president of doctor Shigetoyo Saji (Professor emeritus of Gifu University) at a beautiful Nagara River side of Gifu city, Japan. This ACOS was first proposed and organized by doctor Tetsuo Taguchi, Professor Emeritus of Surgical Department of the Medical School, Osaka University. Professor Yan Sun, a well known medical oncologist of The Peoples, Republic of China has had a major rule to develop this academic meeting in various sites of Asia in last 20 years with Dr. Taguchi. According to Dr. Saji, more than 500 papers were presented and more than 1, 000 participants from many Asiatic countries attended at this Congress. Since there were many presentations(symposium, workshop, special presentations, oral and paper presentations and others)it was impossible to cover all of the contents, so that in this paper, outline of this congress 2010 was introduced only. However, it is recommended to refer to a booklet, Recent Advances of Cancer in Asian Countries published by Gan to Kagakuryoho-sha (Cancer and Chemotherapy Publishers Company, Tokyo).
