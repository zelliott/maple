Cell suspensions from the cervix may or may not contain EA-rosette-forming cells. In the case of non-rosette formation no further cytological examination is required. In case of rosette formation of moderate degree (10 cells per counting chamber) further cytological examination is necessary since in these cell populations atypical cells might be present. This procedure reduces the number of cytological examinations for about 50% and therefore entails considerable reduction of the load for cytological laboratories.
