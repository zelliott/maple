A newly available Tracker-325 catheter (Target Therapeutics, Fremont, CA, USA), modified from the Tracker-18 catheter, has the same outer diameter but a larger lumen. This catheter was used in 15 patients during a 7-month period for superselective arterial catheterization when conventional catheters could not be placed successfully. Arterial embolization (n = 7), chemoembolization (n = 5), and chemoinfusion (n = 3), were performed. The increased luminal diameter of the Tracker-325 allowed an increased flow rate for diagnostic arteriography, accommodated larger embolic particles, and improved the ability to achieve a super-selective position.
