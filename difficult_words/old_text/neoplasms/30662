Over the past 16 years, there has been an explosion of knowledge in the field of monoclonal antibody technology. There is an enormous potential for the use of monoclonal antibodies in the diagnosis and treatment of malignancies, and many clinical trials are under way. This paper serves as an introduction to monoclonal antibody concepts for the oncology nurse. Antibody/antigen principles, production of monoclonal antibodies, common side effects of use, and nursing implications are discussed. Results of a recent clinical trial and a patient case study are used to illustrate the application of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies as a cancer diagnostic technique.
