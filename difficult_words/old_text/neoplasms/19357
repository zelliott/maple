Evidence has indicated that low doses of anti-tumor regimens can induce cell apoptosis in vitro, although different regimens induce apoptosis by different mechanism and pathway. In recent years, new tumor treatment strategy has been mainly focused on inducing tumor cell apoptosis. The present review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of inducing tumor cell apoptosis. The benefit of inducing apoptosis is not to cause inflammatory reaction, but as its disadvantage, it inhibits immune responses, and the phagocytosis of apopotic bodies may result in horizontal transfer of genes (including oncogenes and other oncogenic materials), which can be one of the causes of tumor relapse. This paper proposes that the tumor treatment strategy should be turn into promoting tumor cell necrosis and inducing anti-tumor immune responses.
