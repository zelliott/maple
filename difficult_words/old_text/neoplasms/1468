The efficacy of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) employing radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies (MAb) is currently limited in most solid tumours. The combination of local hyperthermia (HT) with RIT has the potential to enhance tumour targeting of MAb; moreover, this approach may add an antitumour effect to radioresistant hypoxic and S-phase cells and may inhibit the cells from repairing sublethal damage or potentially lethal damage caused by ionizing radiation. There are distinct types of protocols in this combination. Hyperthermic temperature and timing relative to RIT administration appear to affect the efficacy of the combination therapy. Responses to heating at any particular condition are not always the same among different tumour types. There are many papers describing influence of HT on the biodistribution of radiolabelled MAb, but only limited information is currently available on 'therapeutic' outcomes regarding the dependency of combination protocols. A previous study suggested that the best therapeutic improvement would be achieved when HT was combined immediately after the administration of MAb, which significantly increases the radiation absorbed dose to tumours and produces a uniform intratumoural dose distribution. Further therapeutic investigation should be required to reach the optimal protocol of combining these two modalities.
