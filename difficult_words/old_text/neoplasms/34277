Serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 49 patients receiving adriamycin were analyzed for the development of persistent changes. The ECG changes were compared with those of a control group of 20 patients receiving other chemotherapeutic drugs, which were comparable to the additional chemotherapy received by the adriamycin patients. The only chronic ECG changes noted with adriamycin over control were the loss of P wave amplitude in the greater than 500 mg/m2 dose subgroup and the clockwise rotation of the precordial QRS in the 250-500 mg/m2 dose subgroup. In contrast, systolic time intervals demonstrated a gradual diminution in left ventricular function at increasing doses of adriamycin. The electrocardiogram itself appears to be of limited value in the assessment of cardiac toxicity with adriamycin therapy.
