Some advanced cancer patients suffer from pungent sulfury malodor. To determine the chemical identity of the odorant, we performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry analysis of volatiles from fungating cancer wounds. We identified the source of the characteristic smell as dimethyl trisulfide, a compound that is known to be emitted from some vegetables and microorganisms. Controlling the production of dimethyl trisulfide should improve quality of life of patients.
