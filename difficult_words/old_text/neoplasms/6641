Hemosorption and enterosorption were employed in 83 and 15 patients, respectively, as a component of complex treatment for tumors of various sites (mainly, hemoblastosis). The procedures were intended to control tumor intoxication, cytostatics-induced myelodepression and complications of chemoradiation and operative treatment. Hemosorption showed the best results in combatting chemotherapy- and radiation-induced toxic complications and when used for preparation for surgery. An apparent clinical response and improvement in patients condition as evidenced by laboratory tests permitted to step up antitumor therapy without deviating from standard dosage schedules.
