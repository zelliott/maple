Prostanoids are substances which are of great regulatory importance for the organism. Recently not only their active participation in the metabolism of malignant tissue is discussed, but also the possibility of their use in the comprehensive treatment of malignant diseases. At present the effect on a reduction of metastases after prostaglandin I2 administration (= prostacycline) as well as of prostaglandin E2 is tested experimentally as they inhibit the capacity of primary tumours to form metastases. The possibility is also considered of using quantitative estimation of some prostanoids for evaluation of the severity of invasion of the organism by a malignant process.
