This paper describes the global cancer mortality and the specific mortality patterns for the main neoplasms among adult members of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS).

Using official death certificates and information about the population of the IMSS members during 1991-1995, national and regional annual global cancer mortality as well as specific mortality rates for the 10 most important malignant neoplasms by sex were estimated among people older than 20 years of age. The trends for these neoplasms during the study period were estimated by means of Poisson regression. The rate differences in specific cancer mortality by region and sex, for the two major neoplasms, were calculated subtracting specific regional rates from the respective national rate in 1995.

The global mortality rate for cancer among men increased from 76.2 in 1991 to 94.8 x 100000 IMSS' members in 1995; and among women from 85.6 to 105.8 x 100000 IMSS' members, representing an increment of 24.4 and 24% men and women, respectively, during the study period. Among men, neoplasm of kidney, leukemia, pancreas, prostate and lung showed the major increment; among women, neoplasm of colon, breast, pancreas, leukemia and liver showed the most significant increment.

In the IMSS it is necessary the integration of a population based cancer registry. The registry will play a main role in disease surveillance and control; will give basic information over incidence and temporal variation, and could be the main source of information for epidemiologic research, as well as planning and evaluation of the quality of medical attention services such as prevention and early diagnosis and treatment.
