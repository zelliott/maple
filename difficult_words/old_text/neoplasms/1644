The sequencing of the human genome will have a major impact on the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and outcome of cancer. Progress will most likely occur in a stepwise fashion with the biggest initial impact in diagnosis and molecular targeting of new medicines. Advances in genomics and proteomics have already resulted in major findings that are facilitating earlier cancer diagnosis and disease stratification. New treatments that target specific pathways are well underway for many cancers and likewise, molecular analyses aimed at finding medicines with reduced toxicities are being conducted. Close interaction with the Food and Drug Administration will be very important to integrate these new technologies into product development and the approval of new medicines and diagnostics. Clearly, we are now approaching the era of personalized medicines in which one has the opportunity to maximize the efficacy and minimize the side effects of the cancer treatments. The ability to translate this new technology into improving cancer patient care and outcomes will require that scientists from academia, industry, and govemment work together closely to develop the framework and standards necessary to maximize the benefit of the human genome project.
