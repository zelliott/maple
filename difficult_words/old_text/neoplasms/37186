Suitable intermediate end-point biomarkers are needed in order to reduce the time and expense associated with cancer chemoprevention studies. Because of the multi-step nature of cancer intermediate biomarkers reflect a continuum of events associated with different stages of disease development, and range from genetic damage linked to cancer initiation, to tumor growth and expansion during disease progression. With tea, experimental evidence points to potential protection at several stages of carcinogenesis including endogenous carcinogen formation, carcinogen activation and detoxification, DNA damage and destabilisation, cell proliferation, neoplastic growth and metastatic spread. If used effectively in tea research, biomarkers should contribute to a better understanding of the possible extent of cancer protection afforded by tea, as well as the putative mechanisms involved and the principal components of tea with prophylactic potential.
