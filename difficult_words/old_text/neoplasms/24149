To assess the possibility of increasing the detection rates of cytological examination in malignant effusions by the selection of specific tumor markers for a given type of tumor, we measured CEA, CA 19.9, CA 15.3, MCA, PSA, and AFP in malignant effusions from 89 patients with the following primary malignancies: colon, stomach, breast, liver, prostate, lung, and kidney. Cytological examination was positive in only 35 of 89 patients (40%), while the tumor markers were positive in 72 of 89 cases (80%). However, apart from small cell lung and kidney cancers, where the lack of a specific tumor marker resulted in no advantage, in the other types of tumors, the specific marker for each tumor identified correctly malignant effusions in 72 of 74 cases (97%). In fact, CEA was positive in 11 of 11 effusions induced by colorectal cancer; CA 19.9 in 28 of 30 gastric cancer effusions, while MCA and CA 15.3 were positive in breast cancer effusions (16/22 and 20/22). Finally, elevated AFP and PSA indicated hepatocellular and prostate cancer, respectively. In conclusion, in cancer patients with elevated effusion levels of specific tumor markers, the effusions could be considered of a malignant nature even without cytologically demonstrable tumor cells.
