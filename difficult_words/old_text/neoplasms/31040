Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a prime regulator of endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and vascular permeability. Its activity is mediated by the high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors, KDR/Fik-1 and Fit-1. In this article, recently discovered structural, molecular and biological properties of VEGF are described. Among the topics discussed are VEGF and VEGF receptor structure and bioactivity, the regulation of VEGF expression, the role of VEGF and its receptors in vascular development, and the involvement of VEGF and its receptors in normal and pathological (ocular and tumor) angiogenesis.
