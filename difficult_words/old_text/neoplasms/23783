Recent investigations have demonstrated the ability of leukocytes to metabolize promutagens or procarcinogens into their genotoxic forms. As a possible explanation for the association between inflammation and cancer, we and others have hypothesized that local accumulations of leukocytes could take up nearby promutagens, metabolize them, and release genotoxic agents that may cause damage in the surrounding tissue. Using a modified, two-step preincubation protocol with Salmonella, we have tested this hypothesis. We have shown that total human peripheral blood leukocytes, cultured in the presence of 2-aminofluorene for 18 hr, can metabolize 2-aminofluorene into agents mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. Furthermore, experiments in which polymorphonuclear leukocytes were separated from mononuclear leukocytes demonstrated that the PMNs metabolized 2-aminofluorene to a much greater extent than the MNs.
