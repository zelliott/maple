It is now just 10 years since it was first appreciated that NO is endogenously synthesized in mammals. In this period, two constitutive and one inducible isoform of NOS have been isolated, sequenced, and characterized with respect to their protein chemistry and catalytic mechanism. A wide variety of NOS inhibitors, most targeted to the arginine binding site in the oxygenase domain, have been synthesized and used to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological roles of NO. It is now clear that NO is involved in signal transduction (e.g., in neurotransmission and blood pressure homeostasis), and that these roles are mediated by low concentrations of NO synthesized by nNOS or eNOS. The NO receptor is the heme cofactor of soluble isoform of guanylyl cyclase. Higher amounts of NO, typically but not always synthesized by iNOS, are often cytotoxic. At a minimum, high concentrations of NO derange the signal transduction pathways normally served by nNOS or eNOS. In addition, NO or its nitrosative products (RSNO, N2O3, or ONOO-) inhibit or damage cellular constituents, interfering with DNA synthesis, energy metabolism, and the structural integrity of the cell. Such cytotoxicity can be beneficial to the host if pathogens or tumor cells are destroyed, but is detrimental to the host if it results in inappropriate inflammation, hypotension, or immunosuppression. Therapeutic utility of NOS inhibitors has been demonstrated in sepsis and cytokine-induced hypotension; additional applications are being identified in a treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.
