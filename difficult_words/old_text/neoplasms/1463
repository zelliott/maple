There has been a lack of powerful tools for systematic analysis of mammalian gene function, but RNA interference (RNAi) may now provide such a strategy. Stable transcription of RNAi triggers from suitable expression cassettes integrated into the host cell genome by viral gene transfer can induce long-term and heritable gene silencing in mammalian cells. However, the use of RNAi as a genetic tool is limited by difficulties in identifying efficient RNAi triggers, the problem of effective delivery and off-target effects, as well as potential genotoxic side effects of viral gene transfer strategies. Recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of silencing processes mediated by either siRNA or miRNA will allow further optimization of RNAi triggers as genetic tools.
