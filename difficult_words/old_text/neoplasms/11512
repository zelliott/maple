Allelic loss of chromosome 8p21-22 is a frequent event in various human cancers including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), prostate cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and bladder cancer. The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors, including TNFRSF10A and TNFRSF10B, are located within this chromosomal region. Since recent studies demonstrate that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and prostate cells are TRAIL induced apoptosis, TRAIL-receptors are strong tumor suppressor candidate genes in human cancers exhibiting loss of chromosomal material in 8p21.3. However, no mutation of the TRAIL receptor genes has been reported in CLL, MCL, prostate cancer, HNSCC so far. In this study we analyzed the complete coding region of TNFRSF10A and TNFRSF10B in a series of 32 MCL and 101 CLL samples and detected a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TNFRSF10A (A683C) with tumor specific allele distribution. We examined allele distribution in 395 samples of different tumor entities (prostate cancer, n = 43; HNSCC, n = 40; bladder cancer, n = 179) and compared them to 137 samples from healthy probands. We found the rare allele of TNFRSF10A is more frequent in CLL, MCL, prostate cancer, bladder cancer and HNSCC. The A683C polymorphism did not cosegregate with other TNFRSF10A polymorphisms previously described. Thus screening for 683A--&gt;C nucleotide exchanges may become important in diagnosis and/or treatment of these malignancies.
