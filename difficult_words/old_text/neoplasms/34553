This review will document that the selectin-selectin ligand axis is actively involved in tumor progression and drives this process. The involvement of selectins and their ligands in tumor progression takes place at three levels which will be reviewed: Interaction of tumor cells with platelets and leukocytes resulting in the formation of circulating emboli; interaction of tumor cells with endothelial cells leading to extravasation of the tumor cells; and utilization of reciprocal pro malignancy signals delivered by the selectins or by their ligands to interacting cells that express the corresponding co-receptor. We propose that the selectin-selectin ligand mediated interactions between cells in the tumor microenvironment constitute an axis of evil, that it be included in the list of pro malignancy factors, and that molecules associated with this axis serve as targets for cancer therapy.
