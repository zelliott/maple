Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) has been identified as a multifunctional signal protein. It is produced by a variety of tissues, and is secreted into the bloodstream in glycosylated, oligomerized, native and cleaved isoforms to modulate physiological events such as angiogenesis, cell differentiation and the crosstalk between liver, brain, adipose and muscle tissue in lipid and glucose metabolism. In addition, the expression and isoform appearance of ANGPTL4 are modified by the intestinal microbiota. With an eye on an effective strategy to improve health using ANGPTL4, we will focus on: health issues associated with ANGPTL4 expression, including obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer; several modulators of ANGPTL4 of chemical, microbiological, food and host origin; and the correlation of the specific ANGPTL4 isoforms with these modulators and their health effects.
