This paper reports on the evaluation of a Carers Complementary Therapy Project on a Haematology and Transplant Unit.

To evaluate the project using quantitative and qualitative data.

Data was collected on consultation forms and entered into a spreadsheet for a study period of 24 months. Data was also collected from questionnaires.

15 min chair massages given to carers of the inpatients.

The total number of complementary therapy treatments in the 24 months period was 227. Of these interventions 138 carers presented with stress, 115 with sleep disturbance, 92 with worry and 88 with anxiety. The average pre-therapy 'feel good' score was 5/10 and the average post therapy score was 8/10. The carers' feedback included positive comments about changes in their physical, mental and emotional states.

The data suggests that the Carers Project facilitates positive change in the physical, mental and emotional states of carers.
