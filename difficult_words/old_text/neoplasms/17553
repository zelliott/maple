A clinical trial of NPT 15392, a purine derivative, was run in ten head and neck cancer patients presenting signs of immunosuppression and undergoing repeated chemotherapy. A battery of ten tests was used to assess the immune status of the subjects. Those tests included skin tests, lymphocyte investigations (count, E-rosetting, membrane fluorescence and lymphoblastic transformation) and determination of serum levels of C'3 fraction of complement and IgA. The drug induced transitory, immune stimulation during or after treatment without any side effects. NPT 15392 seemed to selectively exert an action on T lymphocytes. Inasmuch as transitory, immune stimulation and secondary immune depression were noted after treatment, the therapeutic protocol for use of this drug should be reexamined.
