Vaginal contraception is enjoying a revival among women who fear the side effects of the pill or of the IUD.  Vaginal contraception by vaginal diaphragm or by cervical cap is totally reversible and never causes complications; there may be short term reversible side effects with the diaphragm, such as cystitis, uretritis, and hemorroids; no side effects are associated with the use of cervical caps.  Vaginal contraception has the added advantage of exercising a notable prophylactic actions on the diffusion of verereal diseases and of other vaginal infections such as trichomoniasis and candidosis.  It is also possible that vaginal contraception offers protection against cervical neoplasia.  Failure rate of diaphragm use is an average 10/100 women years, and for the cervical cap it is about 7.6/100 women years, when both devices are properly used.  Vaginal contraception needs to be used in conjunction with spermicidal agents.  Spermicidal agents can be used alone and can be very effective; they are, however, not well accepted by most couples, who resent the interruption of the sexual act.  Two experimental models of vaginal sponge are now under study; vaginal sponges can be left in place for some time, and insertion is very easy.
