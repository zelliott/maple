Depo-Provera, the Upjohn Company's trade name for depo-medroxy-progesterone acetate (DMPA), is a progestin which is presently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of endometrial cancer.  Clinical trials of DMPA as an injectable contraceptive were initiated in 1963, and many trials continue to be conducted abroad at the request of foreign governments.  The contraceptive regimen consists of 150 mg administered intramuscularly every 3 months.  DMPA has twice been denied FDA approval as a contraceptive in the United States, despite the advice of FDA advisory committees.  The most recent evidence concerning the effectiveness and complications of DMPA as a contraceptive comes from 5000-8000 users in clinical trials at Atlanta's Emory/Grady Family Planning Program and from 86,511 users in Chiang Mai and Lumpoon provinces in Thailand.  Contraceptive failure rates were 0.26 pregnancies/100 woman years of use in Atlanta and 1.2 pregnancies/100 woman years of use in Thailand.  A recent study of breast cancer found that women who used DMPA had no increased risk of developing breast cancer within the 12 year followup period.  In another study it was found that estrogen supplementation was given during only 0.2% of the total 15,615 woman-months of DMPA use.  Further, it was found that when DMPA was available for contraception, it was chosen by 11.5% of patients desiring contraception.  This was 2nd only to oral contraceptives in frequency as a method choice.  Regarding counseling patients who ask about DMPA, private physicians retain the discretionary ability to prescribe FDA-approved drugs for indications other than those for which the drugs are approved.  Although there is little hard evidence in support of denial of approval, approval is questionable because drug approval has become more of a political than a scientific process in the United States.
