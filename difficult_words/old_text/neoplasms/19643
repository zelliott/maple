Malignancy following renal transplantation is an important medical problem during the long-term follow-up. The overall incidence of cancer at this group of patients is 3 to 5 times higher than the expected incidence in general population by age. The most common malignancies are skin carcinomas and Iymphomas. There is retrospective experience in many reports about the association between the intensity of immunosuppression and the higher frequency of malignancy, besides other factors. In our Institution we found similar experience than other series, with 8.28%, of development of malignancies in a follow-up of 7.28 years. We found lower latency with three-drug immunosuppression than with two. To reduce the development of malignancies after renal transplantation must be one of the objectives in future immunossuppressive therapy, mainly in the setting of new immunosuppressive drugs like rapamycin.
