Cancer-related fatigue has a significant impact on patients' physical and psychosocial functioning, symptom distress, and quality of life, yet it remains under-recognized and undertreated. The Oncology Nursing Society's Putting Evidence Into Practice initiative sought to improve patient outcomes relative to this important problem by critically examining and summarizing the evidence base for interventions to prevent and manage fatigue during and following treatment. This article critically reviews and summarizes the available empirical evidence regarding interventions for cancer-related fatigue. In addition to offering patients and clinicians a tool to facilitate effective management of the distressing symptom, this evidence-based review identifies gaps in knowledge and research opportunities.
