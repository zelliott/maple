Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play important roles in the regulation of cellular growth, and mutated or overexpressed RTKs have been implicated in various human cancers. Sunitinib malate is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antitumour and antiangiogenic activity that recently received approval from the FDA for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and of gastrointestinal stromal tumours after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesilate therapy. Sunitinib has also demonstrated promising clinical activity in the treatment of other advanced solid tumours. The present review provides an updated summary of emerging clinical experience with this promising new anticancer agent.
