Endothelium has an immense impact on the tissue regeneration, regulation of atherosclerosis and tumour growth. Therefore, modification of endothelial cell differentiation and function seems a promising target for many therapies. MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules, which recognize and inhibit specific mRNAs. In that way, they can regulate and orchestrate whole signalling pathways. It has been shown that microRNAs can fine-tune endothelial cell functions since they have either pro- and antiangiogenic activity, regulate expression of e.g. adhesion molecules or nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, microRNAs modulate differentiation of embryonic stem cells to endothelial cells and their further specialization towards specific vascular bed. This review focuses mainly on the influence of microRNA on the angiogenesis and endothelial cell differentiation.
