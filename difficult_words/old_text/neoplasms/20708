Evidence concerning a role for metallothionein (MT) in human disease is reviewed. Current knowledge of MT is juxtaposed with our understanding of the pathogenesis of disease. MT is known to modulate three fundamental processes: 1) the release of gaseous mediators such as hydroxyl radical or nitric oxide; 2) apoptosis, and 3) the binding and exchange of heavy metals such as zinc, cadmium or copper. The capability to specifically manipulate MT levels in cells and in mice is beginning to provide answers regarding how MT could impact complex disease scenarios. Associations among MT and several diseases, including cancer, circulatory and septic shock, coronary artery disease, and Alzheimer's disease have been made. Strong evidence exists that MT modulates the immune system. The primary function of MT remains unknown.
