Children of a parent diagnosed with cancer, experience severe emotional distress, which may have important repercussions later, in adult life. However, responses of children to a parent with a serious illness vary, depending on the functioning of the family unit, and more especially, the capacity of the family to communicate openly and effectively about the parent's illness. A support group has now been established at IGR for children of parents undergoing treatment for cancer, in order to help foster intra-familial communication about coping with illness. The group is open to children and other family members and consists of a non-structured discussion of approximately 2 hours. The support group is animated by a psychologist and a doctor. In 4 years, 175 children, aged from 6 months to 23 years, from 98 families have participated in the programme. The emotional and behavioural conduct of the children and their family were analysed. Children were encouraged to express their fears concerning their parent's illness and age-appropriate medical information was given in response to their questions. As a result of this opportunity to express and share feelings with others, children's anxiety was shown to be considerably lessened and a renewal of discussion within the family followed in the majority of cases. Nevertheless, the dynamics of these groups can be delicately balanced. It is therefore paramount that the animation of such groups be confined to experienced professionals.
