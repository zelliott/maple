The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src is inactivated by the C-terminal Src kinase Csk. In a recent paper in Developmental Cell, Vidal et al. show that loss of Drosophila Csk (dCsk) in a large field of cells results in cell proliferation and disorganization of tissue architecture. In contrast, local inactivation of dCsk in a small field of cells results in loss of cells that are adjacent to normal tissue. This loss occurs by basal migration and death by apoptosis. These findings may shed light on mechanisms that restrain tumor initiation.
