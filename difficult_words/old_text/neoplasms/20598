The use of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in Spain began in 1995 but its introduction has been slow. The Interregional Council of the National Health Care System, based on the last report of the Health Technology Evaluation Agency of the Carlos III Health Institute, has recently approved the reimbursement of PET studies in oncological situations well defined in the Consensus Document "Controlled Use Protocol for the compilation of information on the utilization of the 18FDG-PET". This Document does not completely satisfy the experts' expectations, but it can accelerate the acceptance of the PET technique.
