The performance of nuclear medicine methods in radiation therapy tactics determination was analyzed in patients receiving therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL, n=556), breast cancer (BC, n=230), treatment-naive patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=86). In HL patients the nuclear medicine methods were used to determine the irradiation fields for spleen irradiation (67%) and abdominal lymph nodes (27%). The bone marrow scan data had significant influence on radiation therapy tactics in 10-27% of cases. The visualization of primary tumor lymphatic drainage lead to changing the irradiation field topography in 75% cases of external BC and 85% of internal BC localization. Tumorotropic isotope mammal scan data lead to the changes in planned irradiation volume in 16% of BC patietns. In NSLC patients the results of "positive" scintigraphy with lipophilic 99mTc-marked cations lead to the change in irradiation tactics in 16% of cases. Therefore, the results of diagnostic investigations suggest the important role of nuclear medicine diagnostic methods in patients with various tumors of different localizations.
