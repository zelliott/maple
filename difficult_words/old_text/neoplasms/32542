The physiological function in living organisms of amine oxidases, is not completely established but is certainly related to the biogenic amines metabolism and therefore involved in essential processes such as the cell growth and differentiation. A correlation between degree of tumor malignancy and level of AO activity has been reported. The catalytic products of oxidative deamination of amines (hydrogen peroxide and aminoaldehyde) exert a cytotoxic effect and are considered cell growth inhibitors. The biogenic amines in same way could be considered in the cells as both poisons and protectors. A balance of oxidant and antioxidant enzymes appears to be very important in carcinogenesis and cell growth regulation.
