Raltitrexed ('Tomudex') is a new anticancer agent which inhibits thymidylate synthase. To provide a rational basis for clinical trial design of the combination of raltitrexed and cisplatin, we studied the cytotoxic effects of this combination using various schedules in vitro and four human colon cancer cell lines, Colo201, Colo320, LoVo, and WiDr. Cell growth inhibition after 5 days was determined by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay. The effects of drug combinations at the concentration producing 80% cell growth inhibition (IC(80)) level were analyzed by the isobologram method. Simultaneous exposure to raltitrexed and cisplatin for 24 h, and sequential exposure to raltitrexed followed by cisplatin produced additive effects in the Colo201, Colo320, and LoVo cells, and additive and synergistic effects in WiDr cells. Sequential exposure to cisplatin followed by raltitrexed produced additive effects in the Colo201 cells and antagonistic effects in other three cell lines. Simultaneous and continuous exposure to both agents for 5 days produced additive effects in all four cell lines. These findings suggest that the simultaneous administration of raltitrexed and cisplatin, or the sequential administration of raltitrexed followed by cisplatin, generally produce the expected cytotoxicity at the cellular level and are optimal schedules, while the sequential administration of cisplatin followed by raltitrexed produces antagonistic effects and is inappropriate for this combination. Further in vivo and clinical studies will be necessary to determine the toxicity and antitumor effects of this schedule.
