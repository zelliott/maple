Quality of life is a very complex phenomenon in the life of cancer patients. Individual perceptions might change with the state of disease and with necessary interventions. Some definitions seem to be more useful in cancer care than others. There has been considerable controversy in the quantity versus quality debate. Some confusion in the measurement of quality of life concerns "objectivity and subjectivity", referring either to the content of information or to persons other than the patient eliciting it. The relation between quality of life and quality of care has to be further explored: some dimensions of care might be of little or of potential relevance to the patient's quality of life. The dimensions of proven relevance concern psychological well-being through, for example, promotion of self-care or an enhanced perception of self-worth. These findings emphasise the importance of the concept of care, which is the essence of nursing. Contemporary professional and political difficulties require critical analysis.
