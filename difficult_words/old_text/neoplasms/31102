The toxicity associated with chemotherapy is significant and dose limiting. Multiple organ systems can be affected, with both acute and chronic side effects producing adverse effects. The concept of cytoprotection, or the selective protection of normal tissues is a strategy now being investigated in preclinical and clinical models. Systemic approaches have included the use of compounds such as sodium thiosulphate, diethyldithiocarbamate and amifostine. The most promising results have been obtained with the organic thiophosphate compound amifostine (Ethyol, WR-2721).
