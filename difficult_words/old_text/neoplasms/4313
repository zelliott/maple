We investigated the preference and perceived efficacy of coping strategies used to manage chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis in 57 pediatric oncology patients. Over 85% of children preferred "Wishful Thinking," "Emotional Regulation," and "Distraction" to cope with nausea, and "Emotional Regulation" to manage emesis. Stepwise logistic regression analyses revealed that the coping strategy used and its perceived efficacy depended upon patient age and gender, severity of symptom distress, time elapsed from last chemotherapy, experience, and whether nausea or emesis was the identified problem. Successful copers, defined as those reporting high coping efficacy and minimal distress, composed only 25% of the sample. These children most often used "Problem Solving" combined with "Social Support" for symptom management. Successful coping was also associated with lower emetogenic potential of chemotherapy. The significance of these results is discussed for identifying high-risk children who may benefit from coping interventions.
