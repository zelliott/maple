Regazell-Energen (RE) is a combination of drinking vials which contain gel√©e royale, ginseng, hawthorn, wheatgerm extract solved in mead, and capsules filled with mixed pollen. RE is recommended for revitalization and regeneration, regulation and stimulation of the immune system and in the early metaphylaxis of treated cancer patients. Two courses during 40 days per year should be taken. RE has practically no side effects. Only individuals with pollen allergy or alcohol intolerance should be cautious. A package for a 14-day course costs 170 Swiss francs. RE is produced by Bio-Naturkraft in Poing, Munich, and research is supported by the German Society for Matrix Research. The president is Prof. H. Heine from the Institute of Anatomy of the anthroposophic University Witten-Herdecke. The bioactivator RE ist claimed to be a 'new, autonomous therapeutic system' to 'increase physical and mental well-being ... helping to overcome stress and immune defects'. Heine claims that RE acts decisively on the 'regulation of the matrix' and fights cancer by activating the fibroblast-macrophage system via the healthy tissue. The three clinical investigations on the effect of RE in the oncological aftercare contain severe flaws in the collection of data and interpretation.
