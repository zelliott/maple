Interferons (IFNs) are biological response modifiers with antiviral and antitumoral efficacy. They are produced by almost all cells and the IFN system as a whole is an integrated part of body regulation and defence. Exogenous IFN therapy has been used since 1970 and some viral and tumor diseases respond to such therapy. Doses and schedules giving optimal effects are being worked out. IFNs are probably most valuable for the treatment of some chronic viral diseases and their effects on some benign and malignant tumors hold considerable promise for future improved applications.
