As many as 5% of human cancers appear to be of hereditable etiology. Of the more than 50 characterized familial cancer syndromes, most involve disease affecting multiple organs and many can be traced to one or more abnormalities in specific genes. Studying these syndromes in humans is a difficult task, especially when it comes to genes that may manifest themselves early in gestation. It has been made somewhat easier with the development of genetically engineered mice (GEM) that phenotypically mimic many of these inheritable human cancers. The past 15 years has seen the establishment of mouse lines heterozygous or homozygous null for genes known or suspected of being involved in human cancer syndromes, including APC, ATM, BLM, BRCA1, BRCA2, LKB1, MEN1, MLH, MSH, NF1, TP53, PTEN, RB1, TSC1, TSC2, VHL, and XPA. These lines not only provide models for clinical disease and pathology, but also provide avenues to investigate molecular pathology, gene-gene and protein-tissue interaction, and, ultimately, therapeutic intervention. Possibly of even greater importance, they provide a means of looking at placental and fetal tissues, where genetic abnormalities are often first detected and where they may be most easily corrected. We will review these mouse models, examine their usefulness in medical research, and furnish sources of animals and references.
