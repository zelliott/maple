There is a well-documented synergistic cytotoxic effect when heat is combined with ionizing radiation. An integral component of hyperthermia treatments is the placement of thermocouple probes used for thermal dosimetry. With the surge in interest in the clinical use of hyperthermia, our department is performing an increasing number of thermocouple placements under computed tomographic (CT) guidance. We describe our technique for CT-guided thermocouple placement with two different systems: a trocar introduction system and a peel-away needle introduction system. We discuss the rationale for thermocouple placement, our early experience with this technique, and some potential complications.
