The advent of proteomics has brought with it the hope of discovering novel biomarkers that can be used to diagnose diseases, predict susceptibility, and monitor progression. Much of this effort has focused on the mass spectral identification of the thousands of proteins that populate complex biosystems such as serum and tissues. A revolutionary approach termed proteomic pattern analysis has emerged as an effective method for the early diagnosis of diseases such as ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer. Proteomic pattern analysis relies on the pattern of proteins observed and does not rely on the identification of a traceable biomarker. Utilizing this technology, hundreds of clinical samples per day can be analyzed with the potential to be a novel, highly sensitive diagnostic tool for the early detection of diseases or as a predictor of response to therapy.
