An original method of automatic titration of dual bindings by ozone was made use of to show the functional role of alcohols, i.e. glycerin and cholesterol, in the transfer, within the lipoproteins' composition, and in the receptor absorption of saturated and essential polyene acids by cells. The values of correlations dual bindings/glycerin and dual bindings/cholesterol are indicative of that the saturated fat acids are etherified by glycerin in blood serum, and the essential polyene fat acids are etherified by cholesterol. The presence of dual bindings in lipids of some lipoproteins shows that lipoproteins of a very low density are carriers of saturated fat acids (in the form of non-polar triacilglycerides), and lipoproteins of low density are the key carrier of essential polyene fat acids (in the form of non-polar ethers of cholesterol). The cells absorb passively the fat acids (in the form of polar lipids); and they absorb actively the fat acids (in the form of non-polar lipids and by means of receptor endocytosis). A stable correlation dual binding/cholesterol at alterations of the alcohol content in the blood serum by 20 times, and similar correlation values in man, rats and mice demonstrate that the cells absorb, be means of receptor endocytosis, the essential polyene fat acids (in the form of ethers of cholesterol). The level of cholesterol depends on a content of fat acids, mainly of the omega-3 and omega-6 essential polyene fat acids, in the blood serum.
