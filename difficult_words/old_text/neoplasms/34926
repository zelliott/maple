Anxiety about managing the financial costs of cancer is equaled only by fear of the disease itself. In addition to the rising cost of medical care, nonmedical costs contribute a large share of the financial burden. A number of studies, which are reviewed in this article, document the significance of costs incurred in the areas of food, family care, clothing, transportation, lodging and other miscellaneous items, and, in addition, loss of wages. Four factors account for variability in financial cost: level of care, performance status of the patient, family size, and distance from the hospital. Concern is expressed about the high cost of cancer treatment and the question posed as to who should be responsible for payment.
