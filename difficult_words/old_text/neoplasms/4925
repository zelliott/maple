Cancer often arises when normal cellular growth goes awry due to defects in critical signal transduction pathways. A growing number of inhibitors that target specific components of these pathways are in clinical use, but the success of these agents has been limited by the resistance to inhibitor therapy that ultimately develops. Studies have now shown that cancer cells respond to chronic drug treatment by adapting their signaling circuitry, taking advantage of pathway redundancy and routes of feedback and cross-talk to maintain their function. This review focuses on the compensatory signaling mechanisms highlighted by the use of targeted inhibitors in cancer therapy.
