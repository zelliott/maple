This paper presents the first one year's experience of nerve blocking procedures carried out for the relief of intractable pain. The control of pain is complex and has led to the development of Pain Clinics employing the skills of different specialties. The scope and organisation of such a clinic developed at Auckland Hospital is outlined. Some 103 patients were referred with intractable pain from cancer, musculo-skeletal disorders, neurogenic causes and ischaemic causes and ischaemic problems. Of these, 55 percent derived complete relief. Breakdown of results demonstrate that over 70 percent of patients in the groups of pain of neurogenic and ischaemic origin had complete relief of pain. Recognised complications of major nerve blocking procedures were encountered in a small percentage of patients, but these caused no great concern. Nerve blocks have a definite place in the treatment of chronic pain and form an important adjunct to the overall management.
