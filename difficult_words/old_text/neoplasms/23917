Although people of color and low-income groups bear a disproportionate share of the health risks from exposure to pesticides, research attention has been meager, and data on acute and chronic health effects related to their toxic exposures are generally lacking. Increased resources are needed both to study this issue and to mitigate problems already identified. People of color should be a major research focus, with priority on long-term effects, particularly cancer, neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral effects, long-term neurological dysfunction, and reproductive outcome. Suitable populations at high risk that have not been studied include noncertified pesticide applicators and seasonal and migrant farm workers, including children.
