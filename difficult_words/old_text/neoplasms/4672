Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia (WM) is a B-cell disorder resulting from the accumulation, predominantly in the bone marrow, of clonally related lymphoplasmacytic cells. LPL/WM is a very rare disease, with an incidence rate of 3-4 cases per million people per year.Currently, the causes of LPL/WM are poorly understood; however, there are emerging data to support a role for immune-related factors in the pathogenesis of LPL/WM. In addition, data show that genetic factors are of importance in the etiology of LPL/WM. In this paper, we will review the current knowledge about familiality of LPL/WM and provide novel data on solid tumors and myeloid malignancies in first-degree relatives of LPL/WM patients.
