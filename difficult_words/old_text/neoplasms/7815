The data on the effect of immunomodulators (IM) of the biologic origin on hematopoietic responses are reviewed. Up-to-date classification of immunomodulators is given. The correlation between the proliferative stem cell response induced by certain immunomodulators, accidental thymus involution, suppressor T cell activity enhancement and the development of transient anemia are analyzed from the standpoint of its possible significance. A conclusion is drawn on the necessity to develop systemic criteria which permit evaluating shifts induced by immunomodulators in the hematopoietic system.
