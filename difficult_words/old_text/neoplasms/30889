Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in coke oven workers were estimated in order to detect early biological effects of carcinogenesis. CEA, AFP and HCG concentrations were measured in 30 coke oven workers (group I) occupationally exposed to very high concentrations of BaP and tar substances. One of the control groups (group II) consisted of 64 inhabitants of a highly industrialized city whereas the second one comprised 35 persons living in a relatively unpolluted region (group III). Mean serum levels of CEA and AFP in group I were significantly higher than in the control groups. Furthermore, mean CEA level was significantly higher in group II than in group III. HCG concentrations only in a few cases exceeded the threshold of detectability. The effect of tobacco smoking was revealed only in the control groups. No correlation was found between the exposure time and the examined tumour marker levels. It is supposed that the obtained results were the consequence of enhanced expression of genes responsible for the markers synthesis, initiation of early stage of oncogenesis and were due to long-term exposure to carcinogenic PAHs.
