An adenoma of the islets of Langerhans may be found anywhere in the pancreas but is more common in the body and tail, and more than one tumor may be present. When such a tumor produces insulin the symptoms observed are those of hyperinsulinism, varying from pallor, sweating, weakness and amnesia in mild cases to coma and convulsions in the more severe. The diagnosis rests largely on Whipple's triad, namely, the onset of symptoms during the fasting period or after exertion, sugar content in the blood of less than 50 mg. per 100 cc. during an attack, and immediate relief of symptoms upon the administration of glucose in one form or another. Surgical removal of an adenoma is the only known cure, and unless it is done the patient will eventually die of the effects of prolonged hyperinsulinism. The procedure entailed may be relatively simple, or fraught with great difficulties and postoperative complications of a major nature. The literature indicates that there has been a mortality rate of 8 or 9 per cent associated with the surgical treatment of this condition.
