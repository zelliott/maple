Inadequate pain relief remains a problem for many patients with cancer. Narcotic administration by the epidural or subarachnoid route is a relatively recent innovation and is indicated when pain is poorly controlled with high doses of systemic narcotics, or when patients experience limiting narcotic side effects. When given by the epidural or intrathecal route, narcotics have a longer duration of action and a lower dose is effective. These techniques involve personnel trained in catheter insertion and maintenance. Epidural and intrathecal administration of narcotics is an alternative when oral narcotics are ineffective. In this report the term "intraspinal" refers to epidural and/or subarachnoid placement of catheters and drugs.
