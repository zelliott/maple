The primary cause of failure of the pharmacological treatment of cancer is the occurrence of intrinsic or acquired resistance to drugs in tumor cells. Drug resistance occurs through a variety of mechanisms and usually results from mutation or amplification of genes. Biochemical and genetic mechanisms by which tumor cells may become resistant clinically to chemotherapeutic agents are reviewed. Strategies for preventing or circumventing drug resistance are also discussed.
