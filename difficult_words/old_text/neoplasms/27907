Cancer and aging are approached from the standpoint of damaging agents affecting target cell, local cellular environment, and the organism as a whole. The effects of exogenous agents are represented in a model emphasizing absorption, organismic disposition, and cellular disposition. Endogenous agents are represented similarly. The extent of endogenous damage is illustrated. Factors in the expression of damage as a toxic endpoint are emphasized, with the example of caloric restriction used as an example of environmental modulation of response.
