Research  has shown that genetic polymorphisms in biotransformation enzymes, such as  CYP1A1 and GSTM1, are related to a greater or lesser susceptibility to various  cancers. We made an analysis of CYP1A1m1 SNP and GSTM1 null  genotypes in a family group (71 members) related by consanguinity who had an  unusually high incidence of cancer and a high frequency of smokers. There were  no significant differences in genotype frequencies in this family when compared  to data for Brazilian populations. Possibly, the high incidence of cancer in  this sample is associated with smoking and/or other factors not detected in  this survey.
