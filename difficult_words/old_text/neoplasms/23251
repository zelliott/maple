The unique characteristics of the mitochondrial genome, such as short length, simple molecular structure, and high copy number, have made monitoring aberrant changes of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) quantity an interesting molecular tool for early tumor detection with many advantages over the nuclear genome-based methods. Recently, circulating cell-free (ccf) mtDNA in blood has emerged on the platform as a non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for many forms of solid tumors. Accumulating evidence demonstrate that plasma or serum ccf mtDNA levels are significantly different between cancer patients and healthy individuals. Furthermore, quantification of ccf mtDNA levels in circulation may assist in identifying patients from cancer-free healthy population. This minireview attempts to summarize our recent findings in this very promising field of cancer research. The potential technical challenges that we have encountered during the quantitative analysis of ccf mtDNA and mtDNA in general are also briefly discussed. Prospective studies with a larger cohort of patients in various cancer entities are beneficial to precisely define the clinical importance of assessing the ccf mtDNA amount for diagnosing and tracking malignant diseases and their progression.
