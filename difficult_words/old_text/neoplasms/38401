The biomedical need for streamlined approaches to monitor proteome dynamics is growing rapidly. This study examined the ability of a knowledge-based triplex-profiling strategy (i.e., three functionally distinct chaperones, ERp29/PDI/BiP) to clarify uncertainties about how cancer affects the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteome. Investigating a wide range of samples at the tissue and cellular levels (&gt;114 samples from 9 tissues of origin), we obtained consistent evidence that the ER proteome undergoes a major but variable expansion in cancer. Three factors having a strong influence on the ER proteome were identified (cancer-cell type, growth rate, culture mode), and the functionally enigmatic chaperone ERp29 was linked distinctively to histogenetic aspects of tumorigenesis. These findings justify pursuit of the ER-proteome as a medical target in cancer, validate ERp29/PDI/BiP profiling as a streamlined yet powerful measure of ER-proteome dynamics, and suggest that biomarker sets based on distinct functionalities could have broader biomedical utility.
