The effect of three ifosfamide/mesna regimens on urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity and beta-2-microglobulin (beta 2 M) was studied. All regimens produced significant increases in these urinary proteins, indicating nephrotubular damage. In regimen A (n = 15), plasma nitrobenzylpyridine (NBP) alkylating activity area under the curve (AUC) on day 1 correlated with the percentage increase above baseline of maximum urinary NAG activity (r2 = 0.538, P = 0.0022) and maximum beta 2 M concentration (r2 = 0.413, P = 0.0097). In regimen B (n = 5), plasma NBP alkylating activity AUC correlated with the percentage increase above baseline of maximum NAG activity (r2 = 0.843, P = 0.03) and beta 2 M (r2 = 0.78, P = 0.046). In these two regimens the renal exposure to ifosfamide metabolites correlated with the increases in urinary NAG and beta 2 M. The relation of these urinary protein abnormalities to longer term effects on renal function with different ifosfamide/mesna schedules requires further study.
