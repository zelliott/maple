Regulation of tissue redox status is important to maintain normal physiological conditions in the living body. Disruption of redox homoeostasis may lead to oxidative stress and can induce many pathological conditions such as cancer, neurological disorders and ageing. Therefore, imaging of tissue redox status could have clinical applications. Redox imaging employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with nitroxides as cell-permeable redox-sensitive contrast agents has been used for non-invasive monitoring of tissue redox status in animal models. The redox imaging applications of nitroxide electron paramagnetic resonance imaging (EPRI) and MRI are reviewed here, with a focus on application of tumour redox status monitoring. While particular emphasis has been placed on differences in the redox status in tumours compared to selected normal tissues, the technique possesses the potential to have broad applications to the study of other disease states, inflammatory processes and other circumstances where oxidative stress is implicated.
