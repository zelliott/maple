Because of the many ethnic cultures in Hawaii, there is great dietary variation in the population, even within individual ethnic groups. Epidemiologic studies in this setting are providing useful information on the role of macro- and micronutrients in the risk for certain cancers. The results of several recent and ongoing case-control studies are described, especially with regard to the influence of dietary fat, vitamin A, and vitamin C. The degree of consistency of the findings with other reports in the literature is discussed.
