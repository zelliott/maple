Cancer is an important issue within the German health care system with an estimated annual number of 435 000 incident cases and almost 210 000 deaths. Data of population-based cancer registries enable us to identify improvements of survival in oncological patients due to progress in therapeutic care and secondary prevention, as well as to investigate regional and international differences of this outcome. Comparing cancer survival rates, however, requires considering the impact of both methodical approaches and data quality. Potential factors of influence like algorithms, reference population, completeness of case ascertainment and quality of follow-up are discussed. For the first time harmonized proceedings are recommended in order to achieve comparability of population-based cancer survival rates in Germany.
