p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) belongs to a Ser/Thr kinase family containing four members, RSK1 - 4, which play an essential role in a number of cellular functions including cell cycle, survival and proliferation. Recent advances reveal a crucial role of RSK2 in oncogenesis and tumor progression, making RSK2 an attractive therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

Recent findings identifying the role of RSK2 in human cancers, including hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors. Therapeutic implications of targeting RSK2 are also discussed with regard to clinical circumstance.

A better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying RSK2 activation and its contribution to human cancers and also insight into the development of novel targeted cancer therapy.

The significance of RSK2 in cancer cell survival, proliferation, invasion and tumor metastasis varies amongst human malignancies and depends on the signaling properties of the oncogenes and cellular microenvironment of the transformed cells. Thus, further exploitation of RSK2 signaling and its dynamic interaction with other crucial oncogenic and pro-metastatic pathways in different human malignancies is needed for more effective therapeutic interventions.
