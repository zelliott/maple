The destruction of hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis by total body irradiation or high dose chemotherapy for the treatment of malignancy can be reversed by the transplantation of allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cells. In primary disorders of bone marrow or immune system, allogeneic stem cells replace deficient cells. Acute leukemias can be cured, with in 50 to 80% disease free survival after 5 to 8 years. The allogeneic graft versus leukemia effect by immunoreactive cells reduces the relapse rate in myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. 40 to 70% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia remain disease free after more than 5 years. Patients with malignant lymphoma have a 40 to 70% chance of cure with autologous transplantation, which is not increased by allogeneic cells, because of a higher incidence of severe complications. An increasing number of patients without option for cure is treated with the aim of prolonging remission or retarding disease progression, such as in chronic myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma and certain solid tumors. New studies suggest in breast cancer with axillary lymph node metastases, that adjuvant high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support will significantly improve disease free survival from 30 to over 60% after 3 to 5 years. In congenital metabolic and storage diseases deficient enzymes are substituted by the allogeneic cells. Clinical trials explore the use of stem cell transplantation after myeloablative therapy in autoimmune disorders as well as in gene therapy with transfected hematopoietic stem cells.
