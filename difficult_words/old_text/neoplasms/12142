Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a central role in tumour angiogenesis. In a mouse intramuscular tumour model using VEGF-transfected HT1080 human fibrosarcoma, we investigated the morphological features and patterns of remodelling in size-matched tumours. Compared with the control tumours (C group), the VEGF-transfected tumours (V group) showed vigorous neovascularization with larger vessels. Fenestrations and disruptions of endothelia were specific to the V group. Three types of vascular remodelling, i.e. sprouting, luminal division and intussusceptive microvascular growth, were present in both groups. Morphometric analyses revealed that mural cell coverage of the endothelial cells was significantly smaller in the V group compared with that in the C group (V group, 28.2 +/- 18.6%; C group, 41.6 +/- 21.1%; P &lt; 0.0001). To determine the prevalence of remodelling patterns, the occurrences of abluminal and luminal processes on endothelial cell surfaces were quantified. Abluminal processes are defined as cytoplasmic protrusions of the abluminal membrane of endothelial cells, which can vary from tiny spurs to solid sprouts of the cell. On the other hand, luminal processes are defined as intraluminal protrusions of the endothelial cell membrane, including various membranous changes from filiform processes to rather thick cytoplasmic bulges. An abluminal process is thought to represent an initial morphological change in sprouting type angiogenesis, and a luminal process to be a sign of implementation of luminal division. The frequency of abluminal processes was significantly higher in the V group than in the C group (V group, 0.243 +/- 0.138/microm; C group, 0.114 +/- 0.101/microm; P &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, the number of luminal processes on the endothelial cells per micrometre was statistically comparable between the groups (V group, 0.285 +/- 0.252/microm; C group, 0.309 +/- 0.236/microm, P = 0.381). These results indicate that sprouting is the main mode of VEGF-induced tumour angiogenesis.
