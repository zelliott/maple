Cancer cells show a greater capability than normal cells do to break down proteins in the surrounding tissue. This tissue destruction involving proteolytic enzymes is probably essential for the invasion and metastatic spread of malignant cells. The process takes place through an interplay of proteolytic enzyme systems where plasmin-mediated proteolysis plays an important role. Plasminogen activator activity and receptors for plasminogen activators have been discovered in tumors, mainly in areas with invasive growth and tissue degradation. Patients with malignant diseases often demonstrate abnormalities in their blood coagulation, including hyperaggregability of platelets. Experimental research has shown that therapy with antiplatelet drugs, and prophylaxis with protease inhibitors, can limit spread of tumors.
