Determination of optimal clinical target volume (CTV) margins around gross tumour volume (GTV) for modern radiotherapy techniques, requiring more precise target definitions, is controversial and complex. Tumour localisation has been greatly improved using molecular imaging integrated with conventional imaging techniques. However, the exact incidence and extent of microscopic disease, to be encompassed by CTV, cannot be visualised by any techniques developed to date and remain uncertain. As a result, the CTV is generally determined by clinicians based on their experience and patients' histopathological data. In this article we review histopathological studies addressing the extent of subclinical disease and its possible correlation with tumour characteristics in various tumour sites. The data have been tabulated to facilitate a comparison between proposed margins by different investigations and with current margins generally accepted for each tumour site. It is concluded that there is a need for further studies to reach a consensus on the optimal CTV pertaining to each tumour site.
