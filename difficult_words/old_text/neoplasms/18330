This paper provides a review of literature on the effects of shift work on physical health, mental health and well-being. In Europe, 20% of the workforce is involved in irregular work schedules. Up to 70% of workers report problems, with increasing age, associated with more difficulties in adjusting to shift work. Epidemiologic studies on large populations have suggested a relation between employment in shift work and the incidence of sleep disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, reduced fecundity, preterm births, low birth weight, spontaneous abortion, work and traffic accidents, etc. Shift work exerts major influences on the physiological functions of the human body, mediated by the disruption of circadian rhythms.
