In the past years, statins have emerged as the most important class of lipid lowering agents. Through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, they restrict the rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis, which leads to upregulation of LDL receptors on the cell membrane and thus reduction of atherogenic LDLs. This effect translates into clinical benefit by reducing cardiovascular events both in primary and secondary prevention settings. As an approximate rule, statin therapy leads to a relative risk reduction of 25-30% in most of the large randomised controlled trials. Stroke risk is reduced to a similar degree. Despite initial concerns, the currently available statins have a favourable safety profile; however, potential interactions with other drugs must be considered. Recently, characteristics unrelated to LDL lowering have been intensively studied. These pleiotropic statin effects result from decreased levels of isoprenoid intermediates of cholesterol synthesis. They include--among others--anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and immunomodulatory actions. Pleiotropic effects favourably influence pathomechanisms of plaque formation. Furthermore, they may prove beneficial in the prevention or treatment of diseases unrelated to atherosclerosis, eg rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, or cancer.
