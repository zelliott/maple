High molecular weight heat shock proteins (HSPs), hsp110 and grp170, derived from cancer cells have been previously shown to elicit tumor-specific immunity. This phenomenon is attributed to the antigenic peptides associated with the HSPs. Based on the unique chaperoning properties of these HSPs, a new vaccination strategy has been recently developed to elicit antigen-specific antitumor immunity. This approach utilizes tumor-associated antigens naturally complexed to these highly efficient molecular chaperones under heat shock conditions. This chapter focuses on the methodologies of these two vaccine strategies: I. purification of hsp110 and grp170 from tumor tissue or cell lines; II. generation and characterization of in vitro HSP-antigen complexes by heat shock using recombinant HSPs derived from a baculovirus protein expression system.
