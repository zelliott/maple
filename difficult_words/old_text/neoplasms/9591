Tumor angiogenesis is a complicated process in which VEGF and the members of Ang family have been proposed to play an important role. Ang family is the only vascular growth factor family including activators and inhibitors. They can all bind with specific tyrosine kinase receptor Tie-2 and participate in angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is secreted by tumor cells and coordinates with Ang to promote angiogenesis. Further research on the structure and functional mechanism of VEGF and Ang will contribute to develop a new type of antiangiogenesis medicine, which might have good perspect in clinical practice. In this paper, the structure and action mechanism of Ang family and its receptor Tie-2, the application of Ang family and Tie in tumor therapy, and the synergic mechanism between Ang and VEGF were summarized.
