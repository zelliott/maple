The inelastic thermal spike model is applied to liquid water in relation to high-energy 12C6+ beams (hundreds of MeV/u) used for cancer therapy. The goal of this project is to calculate the heat transfer in the vicinity of the incident-ion track. Thermal spike calculations indicate a very large temperature increase in the vicinity of ion tracks near the Bragg peak during the time interval from 10(-15) to 10(-9) s after the ion's passage and an increase in pressure, as large as tens of MPa, can be induced during that time. These effects suggest a possibility of thermomechanical pathways to disruption of irradiated DNA. An extension of the model for hydrogen, beryllium, argon, krypton, xenon, and uranium ions around the Bragg peak is presented as well.
