Due to the high mortality of cancer a large number of patients pass a preterminal phase of their illness. Within this phase medical care aims at maintaining patients' quality of life (QOL) and reducing symptom burden. Our study investigated the patient-reported severity of QOL impairments during the last year of life, with a special focus on their course at the end of life.

All patients with cancer receiving palliative care at Natters State Hospital (Austria) were considered as eligible for the study. QOL data were collected with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire as part of computerized patient-reported outcome monitoring (ePROM) within clinical routine. QOL was investigated longitudinally in regard to its course toward death as well as to changes in determinants of global QOL.

Eighty-five patients participated in the ePROM (255 assessments in total). Regarding trajectories, physical, role and cognitive functioning, fatigue and global QOL worsened sharply during the last 3 months of life. A steady decline was found for emotional functioning, pain, appetite loss and taste alterations. The impact of role functioning, sleep disturbances, and taste alterations on global QOL increased within the last 3 months of life.

Our results indicate that most aspects of QOL are considerably impaired in patients with advanced cancer. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of assessing QOL in general and taste alterations in particular within palliative care.
