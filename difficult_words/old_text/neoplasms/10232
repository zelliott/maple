This volume provides a small sampling of the rapidly growing science of cancer immunology. Growth in the field includes advances on the requirements for immunization or vaccination and the ways in which immunity can be suppressed or blocked, including active tumor-based mechanisms. I would like to introduce the papers in this volume and then deal with a subject that pervaded many discussions among symposium participants. The subject is the need for a much better supported and organized effort to design optimal studies of immunology in cancer patients so that cancer vaccines can become a major means to prevent and treat this disease.
