The paper is devoted to the development of a mathematical model for describing probabilities of occurrence of radiation complications on the skin (as well as in other normal organs and tissues) during its irradiation with homogeneous and inhomogeneous dose fields as a function of an irradiated skin area. The model naturally necessitates the isolation of an equivalent dose (an equidosimetric value) introduced by I. B. Keirim-Marcus which can be effectively used for comparison of homogeneous and inhomogeneous dose fields in normal organs and tissues. The development of mathematical models describing probabilities of occurrence of radiation complications in normal organs and tissues opens up new opportunities for improvement of methods of cancer radiotherapy design.
