Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) is an autosomal dominantly inherited cancer syndrome characterized by medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism. Almost all gene carriers can be detected by screening tests before the age of 40, but the nature and location of the predisposing gene are unknown. Simpson et al. recently reported preliminary evidence for linkage between the DNA probe p9-12A on chromosome 10 and MEN2A. We now report linkage between the MEN2A locus and the interstitial retinol-binding protein gene, which is located on chromosome 10p11.2-q11.2.
