Telomeres are the special heterochromatin that forms the ends of chromosomes, consisting of TTAGGG repeats and associated proteins. Telomeres protect the ends from degradation and recombination, and are essential for chromosomal stability. Both a minimal length of telomere repeats and the telomere-binding proteins are required for telomere protection. Telomerase is a DNA polymerase that specifically elongates telomeres, in this way regulating telomere length and function. A minimal telomere length is required to maintain tissue homeostasis. On one hand, critically short telomeres trigger loss of cell viability and premature death in mice deficient for telomerase activity. Furthermore, altered functioning of telomerase and telomere-interacting proteins is present in some human premature ageing syndromes and cancer. A new mouse model with critically short telomeres has been generated by overexpressing the TRF2 telomere-binding protein, K5-TRF2 mice. These mice show short telomeres in the presence of telomerase activity, leading to premature aging and increased cancer. Short telomeres in TRF2 mice can be rescued in the absence of the XPF nuclease, indicating that this enzyme rapidly degrades telomeres in the presence of increased TRF2 expression. K5-TRF2 mice represent a new tool to understand the consequences of critical telomere shortening a telomerase-proficient genetic background, more closely resembling human cancer and aging pathologies.
