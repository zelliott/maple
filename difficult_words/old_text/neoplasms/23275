Interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8) was originally discovered as a powerful attractor and activator of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It was soon recognized that IL-8 also affects proliferation and migration of cancer cells, tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, and that it is expressed in many cancerous cell types. IL-8 protein expression is usually increased in serum of cancer patients, but markedly higher concentrations are found in cancer-associated non-vascular extracellular fluids, such as pleural effusion, ascites and cyst fluid. Elevated concentrations of IL-8 are indicative of malignant processes also in cerebrospinal fluid, urine, saliva, interstitial fluid and cervicovaginal secretions. Higher IL-8 levels are typically found in high-grade peritumoral fluids rather than low-grade tumors and benign conditions, with the exception of inflammatory processes. In line with recent molecular biology investigations, it appears that the local IL-8 production is related to its malignant origin and to tumor progression. Hence, IL-8 in peritumoral fluid is to be taken into consideration while assessing tumor character and monitoring the tumor progression/remission status. Besides, the data here collected justify the attempts to find an IL-8-targeted inhibitory therapy
