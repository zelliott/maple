Approximately 150,000 children with congenital anomalies are born annually in the United States. Antenatal detection of these disorders would help to improve not only postpartum management but also the management of labor and delivery in the early neonatal period. With the current widespread availability of real-time ultrasound equipment, 40% of obstetric practices have all of their patients undergo scanning at least once during the antepartum period, and 75% of such practices have 50% of their patients undergo ultrasonography. Ultrasound standards for normal fetal growth and development at various gestational ages have been or are being developed. Hence, as the experience of the sonographer continues to grow, the potential for diagnosing the ever-increasing number of congenital anomalies will likewise increase. If the obstetrician suspects or is looking for a specific congenital anomaly, an initial sonogram should be obtained by 16 to 18 weeks' gestation. Serial scanning may be necessary before a definitive diagnosis can be made or a particular anomaly can be excluded.
