Chemotherapy and radiotherapy of different malignancies may be complicated by a variety of side effects, some of which may be related mucosal damage.

There is increasing evidence that sucralfate reduces the severity of radiation-induced mucositis in the head and neck, esophagus, and the lower gastrointestinal tract. Sucralfate also seems to protect the skin during radiotherapy and to reduce chemotherapy-induced mucositis.

Further studies could be of interest to define the clinical significance of sucralfate in reducing the mucosal damage and increasing quality of life during an following cancer therapy.
