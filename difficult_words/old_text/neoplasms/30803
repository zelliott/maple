In recent years, the countries of central and eastern Europe, the Baltic States, and the newly-independent countries (established in place of the former Soviet Union), have experienced a much heavier burden of cancer as compared to other subregions of Europe. This appears to be the result of a decline in the standard of health care services, environmental neglect and the high prevalence of health-damaging behaviour, smoking in particular. Their anti-cancer potential falls short of their needs. The existing and still widening gap between what are considered best and worst patterns, practices and prospects in cancer control in Europe has posed a challenge to both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the international cancer community. On WHOs initiative, a group of major European cancer organizations is determined to use their considerable potential, both moral and scientific, in supporting national efforts in all possible ways in those countries that need progress. Recently, WHO has initiated an all-European alliance with the intention of narrowing the gap between what are regarded as best and worst patterns, practices and prospects in cancer control in Europe.
