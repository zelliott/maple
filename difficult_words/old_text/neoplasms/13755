Fibronectin is an extracellular matrix component which appears in different isoforms, due to alternative mRNA splicing of the ED-A, ED-B and III-CS regions and subsequent post-translational modification. It is composed of multiple homologous repeats and contains many functional domains. Because of its ability to interact with many ligands including cells, heparin, fibrin, collagen, DNA, immunoglobulin, fibronectin can play the role in variety of biological processes.
