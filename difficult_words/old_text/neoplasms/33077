In the more than 20 years, since the informed consent movement was begun, and 36 years later than the US, at last the Japanese government enforced the Cancer Control Act in April of 2007. Japan has at last taken the right direction toward cancer control. Cancer is a systemic disease. The right diagnosis, standard treatment and expectation of risks, and prevention or therapy are crucial.
