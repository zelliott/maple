1. 3H-, 125I-, and 32P-labeling methods were developed for base composition and sequence analysis of minute amounts of nonradioactive nucleic acids containing modified constituents. 2. Base composition analysis showed tRNA from two "liver-like" minimal deviation hepatomas, Morris hepatomas 5123D and 7777, to exhibit typical alterations when compared with liver tRNA. Our observations, which were made for different transplant generations of the tumors, indicated a trend toward undermethylation and undermodification of tRNA. 3. Sequence analysis of several cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs from hepatoma 5123D showed partial lack of m2G and complete lack of Gm and Q. 4. Sequence analysis of mitochondrial tRNAs from hepatoma 5123D indicated several instances of alterations of primary structure, a phenomenon not previously observed for cytoplasmic tRNAs from neoplasms. 5. Biochemical mechanisms underlying these alterations, as well as their functional implications, have yet to be investigated. 6. Modification patterns, but not primary structures, of mitochondrial tRNAs have been highly conserved when compared to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytoplasmic tRNAs. This implies that (a) post-transcriptional modifications must play a crucial role in tRNA function, and (b) alterations of post-transcriptional modifications in tumor tRNAs have to be regarded as highly significant deviations from the norm.
