Age-related diseases deprive individuals of a higher quality of life and therefore therapeutics for their treatment provide significant potential. An overview of the observations of nitrones as potential therapeutics in several age-related diseases is presented. Treatment of acute ischemic stroke is one condition where a nitrone (NXY-059) is in late phase 3 clinical trials now. Also presented is a summary of the most recent work we have accomplished on the anticancer activity of the nitrones in a hepatocellular carcinoma. The mechanistic basis of action of these compounds in several animal models is not yet understood at the molecular levels; however, it does appear clear that their anti-inflammatory properties are central to their action, which is based on their ability to down-regulate exacerbated signal transduction processes.
