N-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) is an essential eukaryotic enzyme that catalyzes the co-translational and (or) post-translational transfer of myristate to the amino terminal glycine residue of a number of important proteins, especially the non-receptor tyrosine kinases whose activity is important for tumorigenesis. Human NMT was found to be phosphorylated by non-receptor tyrosine kinase family members of Lyn, Fyn, and Lck and dephosphorylated by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin. In this review, we discuss the cross-talk that exists between NMT and their N-myristoylated protein substrates. The cross-talk among NMT, tyrosine kinases, and phosphatases may be determined by their subcellular localization and by the physiological state of the cell.
