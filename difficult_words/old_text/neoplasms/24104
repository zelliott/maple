To determine the prevalence of constipation and the use of laxatives in terminal patients.

Retrospective.

Hospice Rozenheuvel, Rozendaal, the Netherlands.

Of patients who were admitted for terminal care between 1 January 1995 and 15 July 1996 the anamnestic data were recorded about presence of constipation and use of medicines, notably opioids and laxatives.

The study population (n = 121) consisted of 65 male and 56 female patients. 95 patients (79%) suffered from cancer. The median survival time was 18 days (spread from 1-180 days). 58 (48%) of the patients were constipated at the time of admission and 62 (51%) used opioids. The opioid users were more often constipated (68% versus 27%; p &lt; 0.001). 35 out of 62 (56%) opioid users were given laxatives. The laxative users, however, were more often constipated (65% versus 36%; p &lt; 0.01). Neither in users nor in non-users of opioids did laxatives have any effect on presence of constipation. Of the laxative users 37 (73%) were given lactulose in a fixed dosage.

Present laxative policy in terminal patients is ineffective. Monotherapy with fixed lactulose doses is not effective as a laxative in either users or non-users of opioids.
