Many malignant tissues, including human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated cancers, express SerpinB2, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 (PAI-2). Whether SerpinB2 is expressed by the HPV-transformed cancer cells, and if so, whether SerpinB2 is mutated or behaves aberrantly remains unclear. Here we show that HPV-transformed CaSki cells express high levels of constitutive wild-type SerpinB2, with cellular distribution, glycosylation, secretion, cleavage, induction and urokinase binding similar to that reported for primary cells. Neutralization of secreted SerpinB2 failed to affect CaSki cell migration or growth. Lentivirus-based over-expression of SerpinB2 also had no effect on growth, and we were unable to confirm a role for SerpinB2 in binding or regulating expression of the retinoblastoma protein. CaSki cells thus emerge as a useful tool for studying SerpinB2, with the physiological function of SerpinB2 expression by tumor cells remaining controversial. Using CaSki cells as a source of endogenous SerpinB2, we confirmed that SerpinB2 efficiently binds the proteasomal subunit member Î²1.
