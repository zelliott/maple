This study reviews cases discussed at radiology departmental discrepancy meetings and retrospectively determines patterns of radiological error. All cases discussed since the inception of our departmental discrepancy meetings (20-month period) were reviewed. Discrepancies were classified according to the RADPEER score. The imaging method from which the discrepancy arose was recorded. An attendance log at all meetings was kept. 111 discrepancies were identified in 104 patients. 52 (46.85%) of the 111 discrepancies arose in relation to plain film radiography, 46 (41.44%) to CT, 11 (9.9%) to magnetic resonance imaging, and 2 (1.8%) to nuclear medicine examinations. Several repeating discrepancies were identified. Discrepancy Meetings facilitate collective learning from radiology discrepancies and thereby improve patient safety. They provide radiologists with the invaluable opportunity to reconsider current practice and when indicated to change and improve practice. The majority of discrepancies are due to false negative interpretation and occur primarily in plain film and CT reporting.
