Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most active anticancer drugs, while its cumulative dose-dependent side effects compromise the anticancer efficacy. Nanoparticles, an emerging platform for cancer therapy, have been shown to increase intracellular uptake of DOX with reduced side effects compared with conventional DOX formulations. While large numbers of clinical and preclinical studies have been published, the purpose of this review is to draw attention to the developments of DOX-loaded nanoparticles for cancer therapy, with special a focus on enhanced intracellular uptake and reduced side-effects strategies.
