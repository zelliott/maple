Tumours express proteins not commonly found in normal cells, or over-express certain proteins. These may in some cases serve as target antigens for immunological attack. It is therefore essential to improve our understanding of the nature of these target epitopes and the cells which recognize them, in order to develop immunotherapy as a realistic treatment for cancer. A small group of around 40 investigators recently came together at the Heinrich Fabri Institute of the University of TÃ¼bingen to discuss the identification of human tumour antigens and the exploitation of this knowledge for effective immunotherapy.
