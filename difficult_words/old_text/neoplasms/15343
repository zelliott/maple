A solid phase, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) competition kit was developed to detect circulating native ras gene-related products in sera of 151 healthy volunteers and cancer patients. This assay uses monoclonal antibody (mAb) BST-6A generated against a yeast-derived, native ras-related polypeptide Yp20. Only 2% (1 of 58) of normal control sera showed strong competition, as compared to 15% (5 of 34) of patients with early stage or no evidence of disease, and 44% (26 of 59) of patients with advanced disease. These differences were statistically significant (x2, P less than 0.05-0.001). Eleven sera samples of cancer patients found to be strong competitors in the ELISA competition kit were tested for the presence of anti-ras antibodies by ELISA. None showed higher ELISA values as compared with pooled normal human serum and control sera. It is thus suggested that our procedure detected circulating ras-related onco-proteins in sera of cancer patients mainly with advanced disease.
