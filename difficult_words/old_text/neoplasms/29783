The outpatient procedure of CO2 laser surgery has been recently integrated into the routine activity of the National Cancer Institute, Milan. Specific operative protocols that are codified for laser outpatient selection after adequate staging by pathology are presented. Specific indications for gynecologic disease (preneoplastic disorders, CIN, VAIN, and VIN), and general-surgery neoplastic disorders (soft tissue sarcomas, lip and oral cavity lesions, breast lesions) are described. Details of the safety procedures, rules of application, laser instrumentation accessories and wattages, both with vaporization and excisional technique, are reported. An overall rate of 30% out of the 4,000 cases treated yearly are selected for laser treatment procedures on the basis of the evaluation of real advantages. The general advantages of laser surgical applications such as reduction of bleeding and postoperative pain, early and late complications; no-touch method; and patient acceptability--have been emphasized in the routine outpatient procedures. Reduction of the total costs and of the waiting list for hospitalization by the new procedures are finally considered.
