The development of malignant tissue in vivo is partially favored by the immunosuppression that occurs in cancer patients. However, the signals between tumor and immune tissues remain to be identified. We present evidence that prostaglandins may act as one of these signals by a direct action on cells of the immune system, or by inhibition of insulin secretion which in turn suppresses immune function, or both.
