Iron-oxide-containing double emulsion capsules carrying both hydrophilic and hydrophobic therapeutic molecules can deliver drugs and energy on demand in vivo. Magneto-chemotherapy/hyperthermia involves a burst-like release of hydrophilic doxorubicin and hydrophobic paclitaxel, remotely triggered by a high frequency magnetic field, which also releases energy via internalized iron oxide nanoparticles, all contributing to cell kill.
