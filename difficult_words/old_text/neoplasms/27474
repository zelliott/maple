To compare the cancer knowledge and skills of interns in 2001 who graduated from graduate medical program (GMP) courses with those from non-GMP courses, and to compare the cancer knowledge and skills of interns in 2001 with those who completed a similar survey in 1990.

Questionnaire survey of recently graduated interns in a random sample of Australian and New Zealand hospitals. The questionnaire was designed to allow direct comparison with the 1990 survey, and was guided by the Australian Cancer Society's Ideal Oncology Curriculum for Medical Schools.

443 interns completed the survey (response rate, 62%; 42 were excluded, leaving 401 surveys for analysis: 118 from GMP courses and 283 from non-GMP courses). Interns from GMP courses felt more competent than those from non-GMP courses at discussing death (P = 0.02), breaking bad news (P = 0.04) and advising on smoking cessation (P = 0.02), but less competent at preparing a patient for a hazardous procedure (P = 0.02). More GMP interns would refer a breast cancer patient to a multidisciplinary clinic (83% versus 70%; P = 0.03). Knowledge about cancer risks and prognosis was significantly less in GMP interns, but GMP interns rated their clinical skills, such as taking a Pap smear, higher than non-GMP interns. The GMP and non-GMP groups did not differ in their exposure to cancer patients, but compared with 1990 interns recent graduates had less exposure to patients with cancer.

GMP curricula appear to have successfully introduced new course material and new methods of teaching, but have not always succeeded in producing doctors with better knowledge about cancer. Recent graduates have less exposure to cancer patients than those who trained 10 years ago.
