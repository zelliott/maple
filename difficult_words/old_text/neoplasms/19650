Infection is the main cause of severe complications and death in oncologic patients. The paper presents the results of a 3-year (2002-2004) local (regional) microbiological monitoring of hospital infections that complicated the main disease in patients of a regional oncologic hospital (Moscow region). The 3-year monitoring revealed the leading microorganisms being the etiological agents of the hospital infections. The dynamics of the resistance of the main hospital microflora to the antibiotics used in the hospital within the above mentioned period was studied. The results served as the basis for recommendations on optimization of the antibacterial therapy of oncologic patients with infectious complications under conditions of a regional oncologic hospital.
