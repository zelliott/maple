I hypothesize that chronic reduced microcirculation, even limited to micro areas of tissue, may lead to respiratory deficiencies, to a proliferation of simplified cells as a result of a lack of energy, and to defects in immune control. In these situations, reduce resistance and specific hypofunction might occur in organs (should the entire organ be involved) and cell alterations might come about, as several authors have described experiments in conditions of hypoanoxia. The mutated cells, possibly in these areas as well, could more easily emerge as neoplasia because they are removed from immune control and surrounded by a terrain of reduced resistance. Infant leukaemias would be easier to control than adult forms because it is harder for antineoplastics to reach the latter's site of origin.
