The effects of heat treatment on the viability and fibrinolytic potential of four cultured human carcinoma cell lines, fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080), lung adenocarcinoma cells with highly metastatic potential (HAL-8), melanoma cells (Bowes) and osteosarcoma cells (NY), determined by measuring their levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and its specific receptor (u-PAR), were investigated by comparing them with those of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs incubated at 43 degrees C for 120 min exhibited no decrease in viability but exhibited an increase in both u-PA and u-PAR. HT-1080 and HAL-8 showed a moderately high heat-resistance (viability, 60-90%) that correlated with the reduction of u-PAR but not u-PA. On the other hand, Bowes and NY cells, with poor heat-resistance (viability, 20-50%), exhibited stronger cell-associated u-PA activity when they survived at 43 degrees C for 120 min. Since the u-PA/u-PAR system is directly involved in the invasiveness and metastatic potential of carcinoma cells, hyperthermia would alter the biological activity of these carcinoma cells.
