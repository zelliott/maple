Epidemiological studies indicate a close association between smoking and cancer. Biological activity of many chemical carcinogens and of their metabolites is induced by covalent binding of their reactive derivatives to DNA, which consequently causes mutations in critical genes. Carcinogen-DNA adducts formed by exposure to tobacco smoke have a key role in the initiation of various types of cancer including lung cancer. Presence of tobacco smoke-related carcinogen-DNA adducts in various tissues of smokers proves the DNA damaging effect of smoking. DNA adducts are important biomarkers for the biomonitoring of human genotoxic exposures to tobacco smoke. The paper gives a short overview on the role of smoking-related DNA adducts in carcinogenesis.
