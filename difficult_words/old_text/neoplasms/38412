With improving survival following solid organ transplantation, clinicians must be aware of post-transplant complications. One increasingly frequent complication is the development of malignancy after transplantation. The most common malignancies encountered in the post-solid organ transplant setting are nonmelanoma skin cancers, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). The pathogenesis of these tumors is likely related to the immunosuppressive drugs used post-transplantation and subsequent viral infection. Treatment involves modification of the immunosuppressive drug regimen, resection of localized disease, and chemotherapy. We present the second reported case of a patient with lung transplantation who developed KS in the lung graft.
