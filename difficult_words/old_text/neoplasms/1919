The purpose of this study was to elicit the circumstances of occurrence and organism sensitivities of Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in the community hospital, since data on this illness from the community hospital are rare. All records of documented Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia (46 cases) at Alachua General Hospital, Gainesville, Florida, over the period July 14, 1982, through July 27, 1985, were reviewed in detail. Fifty-nine percent (27 organisms) were nosocomial, whereas 41% (19 organisms) were community acquired. The most common predisposing disorders in these patients were, in decreasing order, malignancy; following gastrointestinal or biliary surgery; biliary tract obstruction; diabetes; and unknown. Twenty-two percent (10) of the patients died from bacteremia. The majority of organisms tested were sensitive to mezlocillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, tetracycline, tobramycin, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and ceftizoxime. Therapy was considered to be appropriate in 89% (41) of the patients and inappropriate in 10.9% (5) of the patients. Contrary to previous thought, Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia is a relatively common problem in the community hospital and may be community acquired as well as nosocomial. There are many characteristics of this disease in the community that are different from those reported in studies on Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia from large referral centers.
