As the prognosis for children and adolescents with cancer improves, we must reconsider how we will provide care to the adolescents and young adults who have survived these conditions. On the premise that the global needs of adults are best served by health care obtained in the adult health-care system, the case is made for transition from pediatric to adult-oriented health care for adolescents and young adults with cancer. The benefits of transition, barriers to implementation, and models of care are discussed.
