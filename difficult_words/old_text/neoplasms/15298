Based on anatomical and dye injection observations, since 1984 42 cases of hand tissue defects (due to injury or surgery) have been reconstructed using a reverse flow unlar artery forearm island flap. Of the 42 cases, aetiology has included extensive crushing (25 cases), electric saw injuries (7 cases), burn scars (4 cases) and tissue defects following tumour or chronic ulcer resection (6 cases). Only one flap developed necrosis. The survival rate was 97.6%, including 4 cases of distal marginal necrosis. This procedure, therefore, offers a useful alternative in the repair and reconstruction of extensive tissue defects in the hand, whether caused by accidental injury or by surgery.
