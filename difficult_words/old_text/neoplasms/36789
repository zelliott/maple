Experiments were conducted to elucidate the relationship between the changes in oxygen partial pressure (pO2) and blood flow in heated tumors with an ultimate goal of using mild temperature hyperthermia (MTH) to increase tumor oxygenation.

The blood flow and pO2 in the R3230 adenocarcinoma grown (subcutaneously) in the right hind limbs of Fischer rats were measured immediately or 24 h after heating at 40.5 degrees-43.5 degrees C for 30 or 60 min. The blood flow was measured with the radioactive microsphere method and the tumor pO2 was measured polarographically using an Eppendorf pO2 histograph.

The tumor PO2 significantly increased immediately and 24 h after heating for 30 min at 40.5 degrees-43.5 degrees C or for 60 min at 40.5 degrees and 41.5 degrees C. On the other hand, in tumors heated at 42.5 degrees C for 60 min, the tumor pO2 immediately after heating was similar to the control value whereas that 24 h after heating was about threefold greater than the control tumor pO2. Heating at 43.5 degrees C for 60 min resulted in a significant decline in pO2 immediately after and 24 h after heating. The increase in tumor pO2 immediately after heating appeared to be due to an increase in tumor blood flow. However, the changes in tumor pO2 and tumor blood flow 24 h after heating, particularly after high thermal doses (e.g., 60 min heating at 42.5 degrees or 43.5 degrees C), were not correlated.

Heating at mild temperatures (i.e., 40.5 degrees-42.5 degrees C for 30-60 min), caused thermal dose-dependent increases in pO2 in the R3230 AC tumors of Fischer rats during 0-24 h after heating. Such an increase in tumor oxygenation after MTH appeared to be due to an increase in tumor blood flow.
