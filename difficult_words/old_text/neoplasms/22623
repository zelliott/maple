Ovarian cancer remains the deadliest gynecological malignancy in the Western world and is most often diagnosed at a rarely curable late stage. Examination of protein end points has been employed as an investigative mechanism to guide targeted therapy and to stratify ovarian cancer. Proteomics allows characterization of the proteins and the associated protein and peptide modifications. This has given us insight into the perturbations of signaling pathways within tumor cells and has improved the discovery of new drug targets and possible prognostic indicators of outcome and disease response to therapy. Development of validated assays that survey the genetic and/or proteomic make-up of an individual tumor will add greatly to the histological classification of the tumor and may lead to different treatment approaches tailored to the unique expression pattern of each individual patient. It is anticipated that application of proteomics may bring to reality the clinical adoption of molecular stratification, e.g. not, 'is the gene overexpressed?', but 'is the pathway upregulated?' This will be successful if validated peptide biomarkers are applied for patient selection prospectively and with inclusion of preplanned biological correlates. These events will guide future directions of proteomics as a selector and as a validator and will guide how we integrate proteomics information daily into patient care and into selecting therapy of advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer and other cancers.
