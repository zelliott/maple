High affinity somatostatin receptors (SS-R) have been identified in membrane homogenates or tissue sections from several hundred human tumors. SS-R were found in most tumors originating from SS target tissues, i.e. GH- and TSH-producing pituitary tumors, endocrine gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) tumors (including metastases) and brain tumors, including gliomas and neuroblastomas. SS-R were also expressed in several tumors originating from various other tissues, i.e. breast and small cell lung carcinomas, some colorectal cancers, and medullary thyroid carcinomas. In general, most of the SS-R+ tumors are well-differentiated and/or have neuroendocrine features. They often have low or absent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) expression. In some tumors (i.e. breast tumors) SS-R are not homogeneously distributed, making SS-R autoradiography a particularly useful tool for assessing SS-R status. SS-R are functional in pituitary and GEP tumors where they mediate hormone secretion inhibition. In these and in the other SS-R+ tumors, SS-R may also mediate antiproliferative effects of SS, as evidenced in animals where growth of SS-R+ tumor xenografts is inhibited by SS analogs. For diagnosis, SS-R+ tumors and metastases can be localized in vivo by scanning techniques after 123I-labelled SS analog injection.
