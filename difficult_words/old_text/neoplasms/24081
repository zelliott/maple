Cancer and heart disease display spatial patterns that suggest the possible involvement of calcium and selenium deficiencies and mercury excess in their aetiologies. As a consequence, longevity tends to be most common in regions where the environment is calcium- and selenium-enriched but contains only low levels of mercury. Examples are cited from West Africa, China, England and the USA.
