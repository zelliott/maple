Twelve cases of malignant tumor (mean age 64 years) underwent the cardiac operation. The procedure of cardiac operations were 10 coronary artery bypass grafting and 2 mitral valve replacement. The detail of malignant tumors were 4 gastric cancer, 3 colon cancer, 3 lung cancer, 1 esophageal cancer and 1 lip cancer. The cardiac operations followed the operations of malignant tumor in 4 cases and the cardiac operations were followed by the operations of malignant tumor in 7 cases. The former cases did not recur the tumor from 10 to 30 months follow up period. The all latter cases survived except 1 case from 1 month to 21 months. Our management for the cases associated with malignant tumor and cardiac diseases as next. We perform the cardiac operation for the case whose life expectancy is longer than 1 year. We perform the cardiac operation before the operation of malignant tumor. We perform the operation for malignant tumor as soon as the patient had recovered from the cardiac operation. We would not perform any adjuvant therapy before completion of the operation for the heart and tumor.
