That diet exerts an influence on the development of tumors in humans and in experimental animals has been recognized for over 60 years. From 1940 to 1960, a number of essential nutrients were shown to significantly alter the carcinogenic activities of specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and aromatic amine and aminoazo dye carcinogens. Diet has been shown to modify the carcinogenic process at many stages. Since 1970, the number of known interactions between carcinogens and essential nutrients has increased markedly. It is hoped that this volume will provide a comprehensive evaluation increasing our understanding of the multiple effects of the essential nutrients on carcinogenesis.
