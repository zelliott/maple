More children with cancer are receiving effective treatment, which allows for increased participation in everyday settings. Yet, little information is available about people's acceptance of children with cancer. This study examined young adults' acceptance ratings for a child receiving chemotherapy for cancer, a child with cancer in remission, and a physically healthy child. Findings did not provide support for a cancer stereotype and call into question whether results of studies using total or global scores from attitude scales should be taken at face value. Adults' responses suggested that they perceived children with cancer as experiencing primarily physical limitations (e.g., less strength and agility). Exposure to information about cancer was related to higher acceptance ratings for children described as having cancer, providing support for the importance of continued efforts to improve knowledge about the effects of this disease.
