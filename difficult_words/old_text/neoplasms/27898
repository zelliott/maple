1. Significant increases in tumors of kidney, liver, and other tissues and organs following exposure to gasoline provide sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity. 2. Benzene, a significant component of gasoline, has been established without question as a human carcinogen by IARC, EPA, and WHO. 3. 1,3-Butadiene, a component of gasoline, is a powerful carcinogen in both animals and humans. 4. Sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of alkyl benzenes, very significant components of gasoline, has also been established. 5. Human epidemiologic studies show important increases in cancers of the kidney, stomach, brain, pancreas, prostate, lung, and skin as well as hematopoietic and lymphatic leukemias as a result of exposure to gasoline, its components, and its vapors. 6. Stage 2 controls are being implemented to reduce exposure of the human population to gasoline vapors.
