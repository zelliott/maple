Nanocarriers can penetrate the tumour vasculature through its leaky endothelium and, in this way, accumulate in several solid tumours. This is called the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. Together with nanocarriers whose surface is tailored for prolonged blood circulation times, the concept is referred to as passive targeting. Targeting ligands, which bind to specific receptors on the tumour cells and endothelium, can be attached on the nanocarrier surface. This active targeting increases the selectivity of the delivery of drugs. Passive and active drug targeting with nanocarriers to tumours reduce toxic side-effects, increase efficacy, and enhance delivery of poorly soluble or sensitive therapeutic molecules. In this review, currently studied and used passive and active targeting strategies in cancer therapy are presented.
