In Italy only a small proportion of all cancers is reported to the national labour insurance board and recognized as having an occupational origin. Cancers with a lower etiological fraction such as lung or bladder cancer have a lower rate of recognition than mesotheliomas or sino-nasal tumours either because of a lack of information obtained via specific occupational anamnesis or because knowledge concerning occupational carcinogens is still uncertain.

To interpret findings and advance new working hypotheses, within the framework of an occupational monitoring survey project (OCCAM) we performed an extensive bibliographical search in the scientific literature on occupational cancer.

We built an on-line "literature matrix" (www.occam.it) containing positive" results from 685 cohort, case-control and cross-sectional epidemiological studies on occupational cancer, from which 1870 citations were obtained describing risk increases by type of cancer and industry. Production cycles or type of industry (iron foundry, leather and shoe manufacturing, etc.) constitute one axis of the matrix and the other consists of type of cancer by site.

This tool is not only useful for interpretation of evidence arising from occupational cancer surveys but was also intended to be a fast and easy-to-use working tool for occupational physicians, general practitioners and many other specialists to investigate and ascertain the possible occupational origin of a cancer case.
