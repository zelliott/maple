The usefulness of radioiodinated fibrinogen in tumor localization and of coagulation in 80 cancer patients was investigated. Tumors externally detected demonstrated positive localization in 63% of all cases and in 100% of osteosarcomas of limbs. Fibrinogen half-life was reduced in cancer patients particularly in cases with lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and osteosarcoma irrespectively of basal plasma fibrinogen levels. In lymphoma and ovarian cancer, fibrinogen degradation products were correlated to radiofibrinogen T/2 reduction. In patients with the lowest fibrinogen T/2 and platelet count, heparin infusion therapy returned the fibrinogen half-life to normal range. Present results suggest the existence of enhanced coagulation both inside and around the tumor and/or dissemination in early cancer as well as in the more advanced stage.
