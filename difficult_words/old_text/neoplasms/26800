Several reviews on specific topics related to positron emission tomography (PET) ranging in complexity from introductory to highly technical have already been published. This introduction to the analysis of PET data was written as a simple guide of the different phases of analysis of a given PET dataset, from acquisition to preprocessing, to the final data analysis. Although sometimes issues specific to PET in neuroimaging will be mentioned for comparison, most of the examples and applications provided will refer to oncology. Due to the limitations of space we couldn't address each issue comprehensively but, rather, we provided a general overview of each topic together with the references that the interested reader should consult. We will assume a familiarity with the basic principles of PET imaging.
