Recent improvements in prognosis necessitate considering the emotional responses of children with malignant diseases and of their parents. This prospective study assessed 20 children and adolescents and their 36 parents within 2 weeks of diagnosis and after 1 and 6 months. Fifty-three percent exhibited moderate to severe posttraumatic symptoms right after diagnosis that decreased significantly after 1 month. Children with high-risk disease reported the most severe symptoms. Unexpectedly, children with low-risk disease exhibited more severe symptoms than those with moderate risk. Depressive symptoms decreased significantly during the period, but anxiety symptoms did not. Moreover, quality of life did not change. Twenty percent of parents exhibited posttraumatic symptoms on initial evaluation. Mothers' symptoms did not change, but fathers' symptoms decreased with those of their children. Several procedures and experiences were identified as causes of traumatic stress responses.
