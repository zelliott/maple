Src tyrosine kinase was the first protooncogene described. It has been found to be overexpressed and activated in a large number of different cancers. Cellular Src has been shown to activate a number of different effectors that are involved in different aspects of cancer biology such as metastasis, cell cycle regulation and cell survival. Despite this, Src inhibitors have not entered the regular arsenal of chemotherapeutics. This article reviews some of the biology, rationale, in vitro and in vivo preclinical evidence, and some very early clinical trials demonstrating efficacy of Src inhibitors.
