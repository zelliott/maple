The technique of percutaneous implantation of a pain-relieving stimulator reduces the surgical procedure considerably. This advantage is, however, lessened by the absence of precision in placing epidural electrodes, and by the risk of their later displacement leading to inadequate stimulation. To reduce this disadvantage the authors suggest a technique that is a modification of the classical open procedure: it is particularly suitable for implantation at the cervico-dorsal junction. In 12 patients treated by percutaneous implantation, 5 received, from epidural electrodes, an anterior medullary electrical stimulation which caused analgesia without paraesthesiae in the painful ares. The results, however, do not justify a conclusion that anterior medullary stimulation is better than posterior column stimulation.
