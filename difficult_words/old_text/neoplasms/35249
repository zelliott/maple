Immune reconstitution is critical for the long-term success of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We prospectively analysed immune reconstitution parameters after transplantation of autologous (group 1; n = 10) and allogeneic (group 2; n = 12) highly purified CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and unmanipulated allogeneic bone marrow (BM) (group 3; n = 9) in children. Median follow-up after HSCT was 56 (group 1), 61 (group 2), and 40.5 months (group 3). Median CD34-cell dose transplanted in the three groups was 9.4 x 10(6)/kg, 20.3 x 10(6)/kg, and 4.25 x 10(6)/kg recipient's body weight (BW) respectively. Complete haematopoietic engraftment was seen in all patients without any significant differences between the three groups. T-cell reconstitution at 6 months was significantly delayed in autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) compared with allogeneic BM transplantation (P &lt; 0.028) and allogeneic PBSCT (P &lt; 0.034). At 3 months after transplantation numbers of CD56+/3- natural killer cells were higher in the allogeneic PBSC group (P &lt; 0.01) compared with the BM group. The numbers of proven bacterial and viral infections were equally distributed between the three groups. In conclusion, recipients of allogeneic highly purified CD34+ PBSC or unmanipulated BM have higher lymphocyte subset counts at 6 months after transplantation than recipients of autologous CD34-selected PBSC. Infection rates and outcome, however, were not significantly different.
