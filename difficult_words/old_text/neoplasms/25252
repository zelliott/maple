Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting remains a significant problem for cancer patients.

Patient factors such as polypharmacy, medication costs, mucositis, and depression may hinder good antiemetic control, while high workloads, poor communication, and underestimation of the problem on the part of healthcare professionals also play a role. Improving outcomes requires accurate assessment of risk factors, use of guidelines, and better adherence to antiemetic regimens.

Extended-release formulations and new delivery systems such as transdermal patches, nasal sprays, and pumps provide a new strategy that may improve patient outcomes.
