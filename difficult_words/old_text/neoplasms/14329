The article discusses results of the structural and functional analysis of molecular genetic abnormalities in various malignant tumors. Investigations have discovered more than 20 new markers for sporadic breast cancer. Several of them formed the test system, allowing the diagnosis with a specificity of 100%. Appearance of TMPRSS2/ERG4 chimeric gene is a frequent tumor-specific event, its expression is correlated with more aggressive forms of prostate cancer, may serve as a molecular marker for tumor cells and androgen assessment of tumor response to hormonal therapy. The effective systems for the early diagnosis of cervix and endometrium cancer were developed as well. Mutations in the VHL, deletions of chromosome 3 and methylation of several genes can predict the course and selection of effective therapy of clear cell kidney cancer, a number of molecular markers were identified for early diagnosis and prognosis of recurrence of bladder cancer. For diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of brain tumors we developed an effective complex system of markers. Protocol of molecular genetics investigation reveals the cause of the disease by more than 90% of patients with retinoblastoma. In order to study abnormal methylation in tumor genomes an innovative technology AFLOAT has been developed that allows to efficiently identify new markers with diagnostic value. Test systems of molecular genetic and epigenetic markers for early diagnosis and prognosis as well as for cancer therapy optimization have shown to be effective, have been approved for use in clinical practice and are being introduced into practical healthcare.
