The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and evaluate the evidence available for oral supplementation with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to improve the tolerability of cancer treatments.

Searches for all published and unpublished controlled trials were carried out on seven databases. Manufacturers of CoQ10 were identified and contacted. Controlled clinical trials of monopreparations of CoQ10 administered orally to cancer patients were included. No language restrictions were imposed. Data were extracted independently by two authors according to predefined criteria.

Six studies were included in the review, including three randomized clinical trials and three nonrandomized clinical trials. Patients in five of six studies received anthracyclines. The results suggested that CoQ10 provides some protection against cardiotoxicity or liver toxicity during cancer treatment. However, because of inadequate reporting and analysis, as well as questionable validity of outcome measures, the results are not conclusive.

Suggestions that CoQ10 might reduce the toxicity of cancer treatments have not been tested by rigorous trials. Further investigations are necessary to determine whether CoQ10 can improve the tolerability of cancer treatments.
