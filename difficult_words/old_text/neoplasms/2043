The recent progress in immunology has shown depression of immunological competence, especially cellular immunity in tumor bearing host due to anesthesia, blood transfusion and operative trauma itself and disappearance of host's concomitant immunity caused by removal of primary tumor, resulting the enhancement of growth of residual tumor or metastatic foci. The prophylactic lymph node dissection in cancer operation must be reconsidered through immunological studies of lymph node as immunological surveillance system. Splenectomy combined with the operation of stomach cancer must also be reconsidered. Therefore, the main aims of this society are to suppress the negative aspect in connection with the cancer operation by means of immunotherapeutic approach and to prevent the recurrence and/or metastasis of cancer. Research society, met for the first time in 1980, and has since discussed the following main themes at 9 occasions of meetings up to 1988: 1. Pre- and postoperative immunological competence in cancer patients. 2. Surgery and immunological competence for cancers. 3. Antitumor activity of regional lymph nodes. 4. Splenectomy and tumor growth. 5. Surgical treatment and immunochemotherapy. 6. Serum immunosuppressive factors in cancer patients. 7. BRM and immunotherapy. 8. Diagnosis and treatment of cancer using monoclonal antibody. 9. Cancer treatment using IL-2, TNF. 10. Host defense factors and cancer metastasis. In addition, 14 educational lectures dealing with recent immunology have been given by immunological specialists.
