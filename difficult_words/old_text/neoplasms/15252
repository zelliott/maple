Cell metabolism and the metabolism of drugs can be monitored noninvasively and in vivo by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). At present, tumors cannot be differentiated by means of 31P MRS. This method can be used in tumor therapy follow-up for early detection of metabolic tumor response. 31P MRS is not helpful in determining whether patients respond to therapy or not. The first clinical results have been obtained using 1H MRS; however, no clinically relevant results have been obtained as yet. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that 19F MRS can be used to observe the metabolism of drugs.
