The analysis of 783 monkeys has revealed all varieties of malignant and benign tumors, being typical of human beings. These were most frequently tumours of the digestive tract and hemopoietic organs. The highest tumour incidence was observed in the older age groups. Spontaneous tumours were found more often in macaques and baboons, the malignant epithelial tumours prevailing.
