Histone deacetylase inhibitors reside among the most promising targeted anticancer agents that are potent inducers of growth arrest, differentiation, and/or apoptotic cell death of transformed cells. In October 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first drug of this new class, vorinostat (1, Zolinza, Merck). Several histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors more are in clinical trials. HDAC inhibitors have shown significant activity against a variety of hematological and solid tumors at doses that are well tolerated by patients, both in monotherapy as well as in combination therapy with other drugs. This paper reviews the most recent developments in HDAC inhibitor design, particularly in the context of anticancer therapy, and other possible pharmaceutical applications.
