The purpose of our study was to describe and review the accuracy of a novel technique for difficult biopsy of arterial tumor encasement using simultaneous IV contrast enhancement and helical CT guidance for coaxial core needle biopsies.

Diagnostic biopsy specimens can be obtained safely using simultaneous IV contrast-enhanced CT guidance during difficult biopsies of unresectable tumors encasing the celiac, superior mesenteric, or left renal arteries.
