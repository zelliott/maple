Chemical synthesis of homogeneous human glycoproteins exhibiting bioactivity in vivo has been a challenging task. In an effort to overcome this long-standing problem, we selected interferon-β and examined its synthesis. The 166 residue polypeptide chain of interferon-β was prepared by covalent condensation of two synthetic peptide segments and a glycosylated synthetic peptide bearing a complex-type glycan of biological origin. The peptides were covalently condensed by native chemical ligation. Selective desulfurization followed by deprotection of the two Cys(Acm) residues gave the target full-length polypeptide chain of interferon-β bearing either a complex-type sialyl biantennary oligosaccharide or its asialo form. Subsequent folding with concomitant formation of the native disulfide bond afforded correctly folded homogeneous glycosyl-interferon-β. The chemically synthesized sialyl interferon-β exhibited potent antitumor activity in vivo.
