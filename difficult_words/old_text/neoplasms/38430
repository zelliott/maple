ZRANB2 was identified originally in a differential display experiment on 2-day and 10-day primary cultures of rat juxtaglomerular cells. During prolonged culture it was found to undergo down-regulation in concert with renin, the archetypical constituent of these cells. ZRANB2 has two zinc fingers that form a novel fold and show striking homology to Ran-binding protein domains. Human ZRANB2 mRNA is alternatively spliced to give two variants with different 3' ends. ZRANB2 has homologues across a range of species, the N-terminal end being particularly conserved. ZRANB2 is present in the nucleus of human cells. It binds to mRNA, as well as the essential splicing factors U170K and U2AF35 and the novel splicing component SFRS17A (formerly known as XE7). ZRANB2 is one of 20 genes up-regulated in grade III ovarian serous papillary carcinoma. Here, we review current knowledge surrounding ZRANB2.
