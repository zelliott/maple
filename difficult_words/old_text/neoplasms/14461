alpha- and gamma-enolase isoenzyme substance concentrations were measured in serum and plasma from healthy subjects and from 174 patients with different solid tumours. While alpha-enolase was found to be increased in the plasma of patients with tumours of quite different origin, gamma-enolase apparently reflected malignancies of the neuroendocrine system. Before the beginning of the cytotoxic therapy gamma-enolase was increased above the upper limit of the reference range (10 micrograms/l) in 27/27 patients (100%) suffering from small cell lung cancer. Most patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung or with prostatic cancer exhibited normal gamma-enolase, while both tumour types produced high plasma substance concentrations of the alpha-isoenzymes of enolase.
