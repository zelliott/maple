A decoction is prepared from 14 Mexican medicinal plants.

The following indications are mentioned: all stages of cancer, following surgery, during radiotherapy or chemotherapy in order to alleviate side effects and stimulate the immune system and hematopoiesis, detoxification in all other diseases. The initial fasting period is followed by a diet, phytotherapy and the ingestion of nutritional supplements. The only side effects are caused by tumour degradation products as a result of excessively rapid tumour degradation. The documentation brochure costs Fr. 30.-. The patient pays what he likes for the tea bag of a cure. F.A. Grüninger is a chemist living in the Bernese Oberland (Switzerland). He spends most of his time in Mexico, where he himself collects the individual plants. According to Grüninger, cancer is an intoxication of the entire body as a result of an inappropriate diet (demineralized, poor in cellulose, high in hormone levels). The intoxication in counteracted by fasting, phytotherapy and dietary measures. Only subjective statements are available about the Mexican medicinal plants. Toxicity studies in rats revealed no signs of toxicity. There are no preclinical or clinical data in man.
