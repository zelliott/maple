Cancer patients are a high-risk population for venous thromboembolism (VTE); the natural history of gonadal vein thrombosis (GVT) occurring in cancer patients is not well described in the medical literature.

Utilizing a software program the computerized tomographic scan reports of patients at a single cancer center from January 1, 2004 to June 30, 2011 were searched for the term GVT. Patients included in this analysis had a diagnosis of cancer, an isolated GVT (i.e. no evidence of thrombosis at another site), no symptoms referable to the GVT, and at least six months of follow-up information. All subsequent recurrent VTE events were confirmed by imaging studies.

196 cancer patients with GVT were identified. The majority of patients in this analysis had metastatic disease (118, 61.2%) as well as active cancer (167, 85.2%). Twenty patients (10.8%) developed recurrent VTE (median follow-up 14.5 months); median time to recurrent VTEs was 5.5 months (range 0-19 months). When considering only patients with without a recent history of gynecologic surgery, VTE recurrence rates were 14.3%. Active cancer was the only risk factor significantly associated with recurrent VTE (P=0.047).

Based upon the patient's risk factors for VTE, treatment of an incidentally detected GVT in cancer patients with anticoagulation, as per guidelines for other VTE sites, may be indicated in certain high risk subgroups, especially those patients with active cancer who have not had prior pelvic surgery.
