Despite dramatic improvements in patient survival and drug tolerability, nephrotoxicity remains an important complication of chemotherapy. Adverse renal effects occur because of innate drug toxicity and a number of patient- and drug-related factors. To provide cutting edge care for these patients, nephrologists and oncologists must be familiar with the nephrotoxicity of these drugs, particularly their associated clinical and laboratory manifestations. Rapid diagnosis, targeted treatment, and supportive care are critical to improving care for these patients. Unfortunately, some patients who develop nephrotoxicity will be left with long-term complications such as chronic tubulopathies and CKD. Onco-Nephrology is a new area that is rapidly expanding and requires a close working relationship between oncologists and nephrologists.
