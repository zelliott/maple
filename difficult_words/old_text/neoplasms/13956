By pre-stimulating the lymphocytes of cancer patients with BCGF plus anti-mu chain specific antibody, we have generated human X human hybridomas. The resulting hybridomas preferentially produced IgG class antibody compared with those obtained from non-stimulated lymphocytes. With non-stimulated lymph-node lymphocytes, from stomach cancer patients we selected a hybrid (TOS/H8) producing IgM with broad reactivity against human tumor cells. In contrast, with pre-stimulated lymph-node lymphocytes from hepatoma patients we selected a hybrid (TOH/D5) producing IgG having a specific reactivity with HuTu80 (duodenum carcinoma).
