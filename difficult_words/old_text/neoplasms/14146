Adhesion of tumor cells to matrix components and endothelial cells is essential for tumor metastasis. Investigation of the adhesion molecules required and the signals which induce tumor cell adhesion and migration are crucial in order to increase our understanding of this process. This chapter describes protocols which may be used to study tumor cell adhesion to purified matrix elements and tissue sections. It also details methods used to investigate cell adhesion to endothelial cells, both under static and flow conditions. In addition, there is a section detailing the use of endothelial cell cultures on three-dimensional collagen gels which are useful when studying adhesion to endothelial cells and onward invasion through a protein matrix.
