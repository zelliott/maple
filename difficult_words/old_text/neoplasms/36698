As You Like It, Part 2, is a continuation of the lecture given at UltraPath VIII in 1996. It is meant to be a critical historical review of some topics of interest to electron microscopists that will show what went wrong and perhaps also why. Topics are presented under the following headings : (1) Amianthoid Fibers and Giant Collagen Fibrils, (2) Ribosome-Lamella Complex, (3) Globular Filamentous Bodies, and (4) Siderosomes, Hemosiderin vs. Ferritin.
