Ultrasound (US) is used in the clinical setting not only for diagnosis but also for therapy. As a therapeutic US technique, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can be applied to treat cancer in a clinical setting. Microbubbles increased temperature and improved the low therapeutic efficiency under HIFU; however, microbubbles have room for improvement in size, stability, and targeting ability. To solve these issues, we reported that "Bubble liposomes" (BLs) containing the US imaging gas (perfluoropropane gas) liposomes were suitable for ultrasound imaging and gene delivery. In this study, we examined whether BLs and HIFU could enhance the ablation area of the tumor and the antitumor effect. First, we histologically analyzed the tumor after BLs and HIFU. The ablation area of the treatment of BLs and HIFU was broader than that of HIFU alone. Next, we monitored the temperature of the tumor, and examined the antitumor effect. The temperature increase with BLs and HIFU treatment was faster and higher than that with HIFU alone. Moreover, treatment with BLs and HIFU enhanced the antitumor effect, which was better than with HIFU alone. Thus, the combination of BLs and HIFU could be efficacious for cancer therapy.
