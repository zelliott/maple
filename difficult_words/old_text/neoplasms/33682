Control of anti-cancer chemotherapeutic management is facilitated by the use of micro-computers. The authors have devised a program in which are entered, as separate records, all data required concerning the patient, the drugs administered, the therapeutic regimens and the controls to be applied during treatment. The computer commands appointments, examinations to be performed, prescriptions and protocols, making all the calculations needed and taking into account those data which restrict the use of drugs. At the end of each course, each record is updated by entering control parameters and new events, so that a detailed history of all the treatments received by all patients is obtained. This last record can be used for statistical purposes and to test compliance with, and response to treatment. The program, produced and distributed by a data-processing service firm, can be used with various micro-computers. It is available to medical groups interested in the treatment of cancer.
