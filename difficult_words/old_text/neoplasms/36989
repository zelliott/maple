Thrombomodulin (TM) is a proteoglycan present on the surface of endothelial and mesothelial cells where it acts as a strong anticoagulant. TM is also located in other cells (keratinocytes, osteoblasts, mononuclear phagocytes...) where it might be involved in cell differentiation or inflammatory processes. The damage of endothelial cells releases cleavage fragments. Plasma TM appears to be a marker of endothelium damage. Plasma TM has been investigated in several disorders: it is usually increased in the case of diffuse endothelial damage.
