A number of new approaches are currently being investigated throughout the world which aim at the better simulation of immunoregulation by different BRM's. However it must be accepted that a remarkable difference exists between the positive results obtained with BRM's in experimental tumor systems and current clinical experiences. It is suggested that the treatment of preneoplastic lesions and immunoprevention of cancer could be a more rational aim for the application of BRM's than the treatment of advanced neoplastic diseases. This hypothesis is based primarily on the theoretical understanding of the immune system as a biological mechanism whose "natural" function is to eliminate "minimal deviation" cells when they occur as regular biological events during cell multiplication. BRM's should be considered first of all as bioregulators for the maintenance and restoration of cellular and tissue homeostasis.
