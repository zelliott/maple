The association of cancer and venous thromboembolism (VTE) becomes increasingly important. VTE has been recognised as an increasingly frequent complication in cancer care. Furthermore, recent clinical trials have shown that therapy and prophylaxis of VTEs with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is, in general, superior to oral anticoagulation with warfarin. Also, prolonged therapy of or prophylaxis for VTE in cancer patients seems to be associated with an improved outcome.

Research on patient preferences for therapy and prophylaxis of VTE is still rare; but it seems clear that, as in other areas, cancer patients wish to be involved in the decision-making process. Patients seem to accept LMWH over oral anticoagulation despite the need for subcutaneous injections.

Cancer and thrombosis/hypercoagulability is an increasingly important association. The use of antithrombotics in cancer patients warrants increased attention since it's importance seems underrecognized.
