To evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of oxoglaucine (OG) complexes: [Sm(OG)2(NO3)3]•H2O (1), [Eu(OG)2(NO3)3]•1.5CH3OH (2) and [Er(OG)2(NO3)3]•H2O (3) through comparison to oxoglaucine and lanthanide salts.

The reactions of OG with corresponding lanthanide salts gave rise to complexes 1-3. The crystal structures of complexes 1-3 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The in vitro cytotoxicity of oxoglaucine and complexes 1-3 against five human cancer cell lines were evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) method.

Complexes 1-3 have similar mononuclear structures. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of complex 1 against SGC7901 cells was 32.1 μM; that of complex 2 against MCF-7 cells was 3.2 μM; those of complex 3 on HeLa and MCF-7 cells were 8.3 and 1.4 μM, respectively.

The three OG-lanthanide complexes exhibited significantly enhanced cytotoxicity vs. OG and corresponding lanthanide salts.
