The objective of this exploratory study was to evaluate the impact of advanced parental cancer on adolescents' psychological status. A sample of 28 adolescents, having a parent with advanced cancer, was recruited and compared with a sample from the general population (N = 2,346). Late adolescents (age 15 to 18) experienced significantly more psychological distress than early adolescents (age 12 to 14). Moreover, late adolescents experienced significantly higher psychological distress than the general population for the same age group, which was not the case for early adolescents. Implications for adolescents living in families touched by advanced cancer are discussed.
