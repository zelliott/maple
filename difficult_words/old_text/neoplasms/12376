The rapid response radiotherapy program (RRRP) at Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Center (TSRCC) provides quick access to palliative radiotherapy for patients with a life expectancy of less than 12 months. Patients then return to their referring physician for continued oncologic management. After the initial RRRP consultation, we fax an interim consultation report to the referring physician. The purpose of this study was to assess how useful referring physicians perceive this interim report and whether this report needs to be modified to meet their information needs.

Physicians who referred patients to the RRRP and who were faxed an interim consultation report were identified over a 4-month period. These physicians were then faxed a questionnaire that asked how useful the interim report was in patient management, about their satisfaction with the information provided, to critique the report format, and whether the RRRP physician and nurse were easily accessible by telephone.

Forty physicians referred patients to the RRRP clinic over the 4-month study period. The response rate to our survey was 58% (23/40). The vast majority of physicians (95%) stated that the interim consultation report was useful in patient management. They felt that treatment details were adequately discussed in the report. The report format was perceived to be clear and concise. Referring physicians wished to be informed about any medication changes. RRRP physicians and nurse were perceived to be easily accessible by telephone if needed.

Results showed that referring physicians found the faxed interim consultation report useful in patient management. Suggestions were made on how to improve the report, and they will be used to further enhance physician communication and ultimately patient care.
