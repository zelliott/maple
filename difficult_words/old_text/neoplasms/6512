F(ab')2 fragments of several murine monoclonal antibodies have been labeled with 99mTc by a direct, pretinning method. The fragments were incubated with stannous ions overnight to split disulfide groups--a process which converts dimeric F(ab')2 to monomeric fragments. The pretinned fragments were then either directly labeled with 99mTc, frozen for subsequent labeling, or lyophilized to make kits for 99mTc-labeling at some later date. The 99mTc-labeled fragments were shown to be stable against transchelation when challenged with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, retained immunoreactivity, and were capable of binding to human tumor xenografts in nude mice.
