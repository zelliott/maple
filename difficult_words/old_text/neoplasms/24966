Novel amphiphilic copolymers based on poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and hyperbranched poly (amine-ester) (HPAE) with various compositions were synthesized. The amphiphilic copolymers can self-assemble into nanoscopic micelles and their hydrophobic cores can encapsulate doxorubicin (DOX) in aqueous solutions. The DOX-loaded HPAE-co-PCL nanoparticles diameter increased from 121 to 184 nm with the increasing PCL segment in the copolymer composition. An in vitro study at 37°C demonstrated that DOX-release from nanoparticles at pH 5.0 was much faster than that at pH 7.4. The cytotoxicity for HeLa cells study demonstrated that DOX-loaded HPAE-co-PCL nanoparticles exhibited the anti-tumor effect was enhanced significantly, suggesting that the DOX-loaded HPAE-co-PCL nanoparticles have great potential as a tumor drug carrier.
