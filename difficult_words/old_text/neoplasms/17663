A model for predicting the occurrence of disease endpoints from a knowledge of baseline variables and intermediate events is described and illustrated with numerical examples. Maximum likelihood equations are developed and maximum likelihood estimates of coefficients in risk functions of variables included in a stepwise upward procedure are applied to a small set of data for illustrative purposes.
