Prevention of hepatitis B infection is an important factor in the successful management of cancer and aplastic anaemia cases. Our result suggested that children with Hodgkin's disease and solid tumors vaccinated during early stage of immunosuppressive therapy are good responders to hepatitis B vaccine. Active immunisation with hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix B), was also effective in children with leukaemia after completing immunosuppressive therapy. Protective levels of antibodies remained 6 years after vaccination. Vaccination according to shortened schedule (0-10-20 days) was not effective in these children. Passive immunisation is indicated in children with chronic neoplastic haematological diseases during immunosuppressive therapy. In 6 children the lack of seroconversion after vaccination was due to immune disorders.
