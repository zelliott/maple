Metastasis is a multistep process characterized by the ability of tumor cells to "communicate" and to interact with their microenvironment to establish tumors in distant organs. A significant proportion of the metastatic microenvironment consists of leukocytes, mostly of the innate immune system, contributing to tumor invasion and outgrowth.
