We have shown previously that sera of cancer patients (CPS) possess ethanol-extractable substances which can inhibit the catabolism of cortisol by lymphocytes (CCL). In the present study an attempt was made to purify the inhibitory material by gel filtration. Chromatography of normal serum and CPS on a Sephadex G-10 column showed one peak of CCL inhibition with control serum and two peaks with CPS. The one peak which was common to both sera appeared with the void volume and was identified as albumin. The second peak which was present with CPS only, appeared at a molecular weight range of 300-350 daltons. We postulate that CPS may contain a relatively high concentrations of small molecules which are not bound to proteins and which might modulate the normal function of the immune system.
