The fact that the immune response to cancer is compromised has been convincingly demonstrated in murine tumor models as well as in cancer patients. The unresponsiveness of the host immune system is one of the major mechanisms of tumor escape as well as an important factor that limits the success of cancer immunotherapy. Inadequate function of professional antigen presenting cells dendritic cells (DC) in cancer is one of the major elements of compromised anti-tumor immune response. Despite substantial progress in recent years, the mechanism of inadequate DC function in cancer still remains unclear. The tumor microenvironment has emerged as an important component contributing to DC malfunction. In this review we will discuss the potential role of tumor microenvironment in DC dysfunction.
