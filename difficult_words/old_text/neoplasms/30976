Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and cancer immunology have inspired many new approaches to vaccine development. Many subunit antigens and peptides that are effective for vaccination have been discovered. These subunit antigens in tum stimulate synthesis of effective adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity. Controlled-release technology offers the potential of further improving the efficacy of conventional vaccine formulations by optimizing the temporal and spatial presentation of the-antigens and adjuvants to the immune system. The combination of sustained release and depot effect may also reduce the amount of antigens or adjuvants needed and eliminate the booster shots that are necessary for the success of many vaccinations. This review examines the contribution controlled release technology can make in various areas of vaccination, with an emphasis on tumor vaccines.
