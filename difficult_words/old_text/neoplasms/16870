Since its development in 1975, monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology has greatly enhanced our ability to analyse complex antigenic systems as well as improve the sensitivity and speed of many diagnostic tests. In particular, the study of tumour associated antigens using mAbs have revealed that many transformed cell phenotypes have useful markers on their plasma membrane, cytoplasm, or as secreted forms which can be used in developing diagnostic assays. Therapeutic application of these anti-tumour mAbs has however, been slow relative to the research and diagnostic applications. This article will discuss how the therapeutic effectiveness of anti-tumour mAbs can be enhanced by coupling them to drugs, toxins or radionucleids; and review the current advances and problems related to the application of these mAb conjugates.
