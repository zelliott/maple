During the past few decades, particles of various compositions have been engineered in ever smaller sizes to function in both diagnostic and therapeutic capacities. Nanoparticles are now available on a scale similar to many biological molecules and infectious agents, thereby opening the possibility of biological intervention on the molecular level. Several recent timely reports summarize nanoparticle properties and potential clinical applications in early-stage clinical trials.
