In the past 20 years, several papers have been published concerning healthcare transition from pediatric after-care to long-term follow-up in adult health service for childhood cancer survivors. Initially, the papers were optimistic and included guidelines and models of care. However, after this optimistic beginning, more recent research has found that transitional care is not a successful process.

Although the number of papers regarding transition in the past 2 years is few, they include revealing results about barriers and facilitators of the transition process.

There is some evidence that joint pediatric/adult transition clinics are more successful in providing transitional care. The use of tools to assess individual psychological factors is important for the transition process and could lead to more individualized models of transition.
