The first descriptions of apoptosis were made over 150 years ago, although the implications for tumor development were not appreciated until the 1970s. Natural cell death is a critical part of development of multicellular organisms, and also counter-balances the cell generating effects of mitosis. Disruptions in the highly regulated apoptotic pathway can lead to disease, such as tumors, due to the accumulation of excessive numbers of cells. Restoring normal apoptosis in cancer cells is one of the current challenges of cancer research.
