The Metastasis Research Society (MRS) has held its International Congress every two years since 1986, and alternates between European and North American meeting venues. The next MRS International Congress will be held in London, UK in the year 2000, and will be hosted by the current MRS President, Dr. Suzanne Eccles (Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK). Dr. Eccles took over from the out-going President, Dr. William Stetler-Stevenson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), at the San Diego meeting. Information on joining the Metastasis Research Society, which includes a subscription to the Society's journal, Clinical and Experimental Metastasis, can be obtained from Dr. Eccles (suzan@icr.ac.uk) or from the newly-elected Secretary/Treasurer Dr. Danny Welch (Hershey, PA, USA; drw9@psu.edu). The meeting was organized by Darwin Medical Communications Ltd (Gill Heaton, Oxford, UK), who have placed the full program on the meeting web site (http:@www.sparks.co.uk/mrs). It is envisaged that full abstracts of all the presentations will be placed on the Metastasis Research Society web site, which is currently under construction.
