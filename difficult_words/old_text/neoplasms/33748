Histological analyses of the subrenal capsule assay (SRCA) carried out with modification of Bogden's original method revealed that the major portion of cancer tissue implanted were almost replaced by the host immune cells and reactive tissue by day 6. For the purpose to find a more improved condition, the following experiments were performed using human cancer lines xenografted in nude mice. No prominent differences in the host reaction to xenograft were found between 3 kinds of immunocompetent mice. Subrenal space of the athymic nude mice allowed cancer tissue to grow well until 15 days after inoculation, and then chemosensitivity test to judge the growth inhibition rates. The similar condition as in nude mice was achieved in CDF1 mice by daily injection of 60 mg/kg of cyclosporin A.
