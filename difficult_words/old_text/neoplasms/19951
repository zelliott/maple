GATA3 is a member of a group of zinc-finger transcription factors that is involved in cell development and differentiation. Recent studies have shown that, among tumors, GATA3 is commonly expressed in both urothelial tumors and breast epithelial neoplasms. With the exception of salivary gland and parathyroid tumors, GATA3 has been reported to be either absent or only rarely expressed in other epithelial tumors. Owing to its restricted expression in urothelial and breast carcinomas, GATA3 has proved to be a useful immunohistochemical marker for assisting in distinguishing these 2 groups of neoplasms from other malignancies with which they may be confused.
