Significant improvement in the survival rates of children with pediatric cancers has been achieved over the last 25 years, so the number of long-term survivors is increasing and their subsequent quality of life is of increasing importance. One of the most serious side effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy is damage to the ovarian function, which can lead to loss of fertility. The degree of this damage depends on the substances used, the dose of radiotherapy reaching the ovaries, and the age of the girl at the time of treatment. Up to now, the only established method of fertility preservation has been cryoconservation of fertilized egg cells or embryos, but this is not possible in prepubertal girls because of their sexual immaturity. Removal of ovarian tissue and subsequent cryoconservation with the option of later orthotopic retransplantation is therefore an option to these girls. This method can lead to pregnancy and birth in adult women. Up to now there are no studies about the retransplantation of ovarian tissue which was removed before puberty. Displacement of the ovaries away from the radiation field before radiation to the pelvic area can be considered; however, the data is controversial. One problem in the use of fertility preservation methods in these very young patients is that they undergo procedures which, because of their age, they mostly do not understand and the parents must make a decision based on the assumed later wishes of their daughter.
