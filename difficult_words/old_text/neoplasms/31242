The relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters of unchanged cisplatin (CDDP) and several markers for nephrotoxicity after CDDP infusion (80 mg/m2) over 2 and 4 h were quantitated in patients with various cancers (lung, stomach and colon cancers and mediastinal tumor).

Plasma and urinary levels of unchanged CDDP were measured using a specific high-performance liquid chromatography method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated according to the model-independent method. The nephrotoxicity markers, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr), plasma and urinary beta2-microglobulin (BMGp and BMGu), urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and creatinine clearance (CCR) were monitored for 30 days following CDDP administration.

The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), maximum urinary excretion rate (dAe/dt(max)), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC), cumulative amount excreted in urine from time zero to infinity (Ae), total clearance (Clt), renal clearance (Clr) and plasma half-life (t1/2) of unchanged CDDP were not significantly different between the 2-h and 4-h infusion schedules. The values of the nephrotoxicity markers changed significantly following CDDP administration, suggesting that CDDP chemotherapy (80 mg/m2) caused nephrotoxicity. The Cmax of unchanged CDDP was the most informative pharmacokinetic parameter for nephrotoxicity. Cmax was related to maximum BUN, maximum SCr and minimum CCR levels in 27 CDDP treatments according to an exponential model.

In order to attain more effective CDDP chemotherapy with minimum nephrotoxicity, the present pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies suggest that the Cmax or steady-state plasma level of unchanged CDDP should be maintained between 1.5 and 2 microg/ml in a standard continuous infusion schedule over 2 h and 4 h.
