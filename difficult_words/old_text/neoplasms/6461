Pyruvate kinase isoenzymes type M1 and M2 from dog muscle, lung and tumor have been isolated. The K0.5 for phosphoenol pyruvate have been determined to be 0.04 mM for dog muscle type M1, 0.24 mM for lung type M2 and 0.28 mM for tumor type M2 isoenzymes. The activator constant ka of L-serine is 240 nM from lung and 70 nM from tumor isoenzyme. Consistent with the assumption of a special form of pyruvate kinase M2 in dog tumor cells different isoelectric points and amino acid compositions have been found for the isoenzymes of lung and tumor.
