Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a polypeptide important for normal development of the nervous system and promotion of survival and differentiation of sensory and sympathetic neurons in culture. The cellular effects of NGF are mediated by a specific cell surface molecule, nerve growth factor receptor (NGF-R). In the present study we have used a monoclonal antibody against human NGF-R to examine, by the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase method, the receptor distribution in a wide range of normal tissues and in more than 200 malignant tumors. Our results show that (a) human NGF-R is expressed in the peripheral nervous system but not in any of the central nervous system areas tested; (b) NGF-R expression is not restricted to neural tissues but is also found in a number of normal epithelial, mesenchymal, and lymphoid tissues; (c) NGF-R expression changes during normal development; and (d) NGF-R expression in malignant tumors generally parallels its normal tissue distribution. Thus, NGF-R is detected in a proportion of neuroectoderm-derived tumors, carcinomas, and lymphomas, and also in a characteristic group of small round-cell tumors (Ewing's sarcomas and embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas). These findings suggest a normal regulatory role for NGF in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and identify a range of human tumors in which the NGF/NGF-R system may contribute to the malignant phenotype.
