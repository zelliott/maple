We report the evaluation of an information booklet aimed to explain the purpose of follow-up to survivors of childhood cancer. Evaluations drew on theoretical concepts in the elaboration likelihood and stages of change models. We predicted that survivors who adopt central rather than peripheral processing would show greater understanding and increased readiness to change health behaviour. Forty-eight survivors were shown an example page of the booklet in the clinic and then completed questionnaires about attitude to clinic, readiness to change behaviour, and the importance and scariness of the information. They were then given the whole booklet and asked to complete a second questionnaire at home. After reading the booklet, survivors reported a more positive attitude to clinic. Survivors using central processing rated information as more important and were more ready to change health behaviour than peripheral processors. We recommend that methods to encourage central processing should be routinely included when providing children with health information.
