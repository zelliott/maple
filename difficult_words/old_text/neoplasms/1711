China is a very large developing country covering vast territories and having a complex natural environment. It has an enormous population and numerous endemic diseases. The total population of China is 14 x 10(8) of which 3 x 10(3) live in endemic disease-affected areas and 0.48 x 10(3) suffer from these diseases. The distribution of the endemic diseases has obvious geographical characteristics. Among the most harmful and widely distributed of the endemic diseases are Kaschin-Beck disease, Keshan disease, iodine deficiency, endemic fluorosis and hepatic carcinoma. The geographical environments have a close relationship to endemic diseases and are influenced by climate, geology, landform, soil, food and drinking water. Drinking water is the key issue, since polluted water, or water lacking in or having an excess of certain minerals and elements, as well as water containing certain organic components, has been shown to be harmful to human health. Research has shown that some diseases can be reduced or eliminated by paying attention to the way drinking water is obtained, as well as by improving the nutritional values of the food by eliminating negative components. Fifty years of research has already gone into this subject and there is still much research to be done. This paper puts forth a model of health problems related to geographical environment and the importance of continued research in this field.
