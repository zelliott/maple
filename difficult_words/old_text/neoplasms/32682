We used the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database to analyse the association of histology-specific brain tumours with other cancers in family members. Among 0-68-year-old offspring, 9414 patients with brain tumours were identified from 1961 to 2000, of whom, 3387 parents were diagnosed with any primary neoplasm. Astrocytoma, meningioma and neurinoma were the main histological types. Increased standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were found for brain tumours in association with cancers at sites that are known features in recognised syndromes, such as haemangioblastoma and renal cancer in von Hippel-Lindau disease. In addition, an association between astrocytoma and melanoma was recognised. Among as yet unknown clustering, neurinoma was associated with testicular cancer and myeloma; meningioma was associated with cervical cancer; astrocytoma was associated with prostate cancer; ependymoma was associated with breast cancer. Although some of these may feature a true tumour cluster, they need to be confirmed in another setting.
