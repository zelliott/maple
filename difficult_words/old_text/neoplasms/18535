There are clear preclinical data that support the involvement of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway in oncogenesis and cancer progression. Such evidence has led to the design and conduct of drug development programs targeting the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) over the past 10 years.

This review details the structure and function of different members of the IGF system and related pathways, describes the rationale for targeting IGF-IR in cancer and updates the current advances in drug development. The preclinical development of figitumumab, the furthest developed mAb against IGF-IR, is examined as well as the reported data from Phase I - III clinical trials. Future prospects for this target and pathway are also discussed.

While there have been both successes and failures in the development of novel targeted therapeutics targeting the IGF pathway, the evaluation of such agents should continue, with greater emphasis placed on combinatorial strategies and the development of predictive biomarkers that enhance antitumor responses through appropriate patient selection.
