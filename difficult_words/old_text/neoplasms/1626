A practically useful measure of quality of life should be simple and quick to complete. A shortened Chinese version of the Functional Living Index - Cancer (FLIC) was recently proposed and was called Quick-FLIC. This study aims to assess the measurement properties of the Quick-FLIC. A total of 190 patients who received care from the National Cancer Centre of Singapore completed a questionnaire package at baseline. Patients filled in a retest questionnaire on average 2 weeks after baseline to assess test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change. The Quick-FLIC scores correlated well with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Therapy - General scores (r=0.78). Patients with different treatment status, performance status and self-rated health had significantly different Quick-FLIC scores in the expected directions (ANOVA; each P&lt;0.001). Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.87) and 2-week test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation=0.81) were also satisfactory. The measure was responsive to changes in health status (P&lt;0.001). The Quick-FLIC is a valid and reliable measure of health-related quality of life of cancer patients. The shortening of established health-related quality of life instruments should be considered in order to reduce the burden of having patients to answer lengthy questionnaires.
