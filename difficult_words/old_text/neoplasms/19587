The French national cancer prevention plan launched in 2003 led many smokers to quit; however, no data is available on the rates of French adolescents who have begun smoking.

Every year since 1991, the Paris without Tobacco (PST) organisation carries out a cross-sectional survey among Parisian teenagers. The data from 2003-2004 have been compared with data from years prior to the implementation of the cancer prevention plan.

Of a total of 54,781 youth questioned, quasi-stability in tobacco consumption (4%) was observed. Tobacco consumption has dramatically decreased since the launch of the national cancer plan: - 80% in 12-13 year olds, - 61% in 14-15 year olds, and - 55% in 16-17 year olds. This drop is linked to the decrease in numbers of adolescents who start to smoke before the age of 16. After 16 years of age, one-quarter of this decrease is explained and accounted for by the increase in the rate of ex-smokers.

There are numerous reasons available to elucidate this rapid "denormalisation" of tobacco and smoking in general. The data testify to the success of the establishment and implementation of tobacco prevention campaigns and interventions called for within the framework of the National Cancer Plan.
