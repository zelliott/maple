To describe a cohort of 12 Danish women who received autotransplantation of frozen-thawed cryopreserved ovarian tissue because of premature ovarian failure after cancer treatment.

Retrospective study.

University hospitals.

Twelve women with autotransplanted frozen-thawed ovarian tissue.

Monitoring of hormonal parameters and results of 56 IVF cycles in 10 women.

Levels of gonadotropins and sex steroids, functional life span of the grafts, and results of IVF.

All 12 women regained ovarian function between 8 and 26 weeks (mean 19 weeks) after transplantation. Ten women underwent a total of 56 IVF cycles, 76 follicles developed, 49 oocytes were aspirated, 18 were fertilized, and 16 embryos were transferred resulting in six pregnancies: two biochemical, one clinical that miscarried in week 7, and two ongoing resulting in the delivery of two healthy infants born at term to two women. One of these women subsequently conceived spontaneously and delivered another healthy infant. The life span of the transplanted tissue has been between 6 months and still functioning after 54 months.

Autotransplantation consistently leads to recovery of ovarian function after treatment-induced ovarian failure. Four women became pregnant, after IVF or spontaneously, resulting in the delivery of three healthy infants.
