Any significant change in the pharmacokinetics of an anticancer drug would have a bearing on its therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. Nutritional deficiencies have been shown to affect the pharmacokinetics of a drug. Since malnutrition and undernutrition are widely prevalent in India, the effect of initial nutritional status on the overall kinetics of methotrexate (MTX) administered to cancer patients appeared to be of practical importance. A study of 6 Indian children with malignancies was made to examine the pharmacokinetics of low dose MTX and its relationship to the nutritional status. The results indicate that the relative weight correlates well with the anthropometric parameters, nutritional parameters and dietary intake and may be used as a marker of nutritional status.
