The expression of SPANX (sperm protein associated with the nucleus in the X chromosome) gene family has been reported in many tumors, such as melanoma, myeloma, glioblastoma, breast carcinoma, ovarian cancer, testicular germ cell tumors, and hematological malignancies. However, no systematic approach has so far been devised to estimate the percentage of cancer cells expressing SPANX. This study was undertaken to quantify the expression of SPANX proteins in melanomas. The expression of SPANX proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in normal skin (n = 12), melanomas (n = 21), and benign nevi (n = 10), using a polyclonal antibody raised in our laboratory. Seventeen of the 21 melanomas (80.9%) examined expressed SPANX proteins. A high percentage of their cells (49.0% +/- 5.5%) stained positively for SPANX proteins compared with no expression found in normal skin cells. Benign nevi had an intermediate number of cells expressing SPANX proteins (25% +/- 8.5%), which resulted significantly higher than normal skin cells and significantly lower than skin melanoma cells. In melanoma cells, the labeling was mostly nuclear, sometimes incomplete or limited to the perinuclear wall, even if cytoplasmic staining was also seen in SPANX-positive tumor cells. In contrast, the 5 of 10 SPANX-positive nevi had a clear nuclear localization of the signal. These data suggest that the SPANX protein family is expressed in the vast majority of the melanomas tested. The mechanism(s), which brings up SPANX gene expression and the role of these proteins are not known.
