During the past 3 years and 6 months, serial 67Ga-citrate scintigraphy have studied in 113 patients. 22 patients of these showed absent liver uptake. All cases had malignant tumors. 41% in malignant lymphoma and 20% in lung cancer showed absent liver uptake scintigraphy in their progress. This ratio is more frequent than reported ratio. There was significant relationship between therapy with antineoplastic agents and absent or increased liver uptake scintigraphy. 4 cases, treated by irradiation, showed absent liver uptake scintigraphy. In 3 cases, elevated liver uptake, one was administered renal toxic agent and all were given 5-FU. Mild change of accumulation in liver may be beyond reported ratio. 67Ga-citrate scintigraphy is repeatedly used in course of malignant patients. We must know given agents and past history of treatment when 67Ga scintigraphy is evaluated.
