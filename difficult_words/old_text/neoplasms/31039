The role of TNF receptors (TNF-Rs) is not limited to signal transduction but includes extracellular regulatory functions affecting systemic TNF bioavailability. This review summarizes the regulation of TNF-R shedding and its kinetics, the complex interaction between the soluble receptors and their ligand in vitro and in vivo, and the potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value of the soluble receptors in malignant, inflammatory, infectious and autoimmune disorders.
