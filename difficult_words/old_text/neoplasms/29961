Biochemical investigations show a decreased bioavailability of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolic acid in vitamin B12 deficient human cell cultures and bone marrow cells. Tetrahydrofolic acid cannot be liberated from its storage form. This so-called methyl-folate-trap results in a functional folic acid deficiency which is the pathogenetic principle of the defect in the cell proliferation in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. This knowledge of biochemical mechanisms leads to the identification of rare disorders in the metabolism of vitamin B12 and folic acid. After methotrexate treatment a rescue effect with its antidote Leucovorin can only be achieved, if the ratio antidote: methotrexate is at least 10:1. This ratio is important in cell cultures as well as in bone marrow cells in vivo. The results lead to a formula for the calculation of the optimal dosis to reach a secure rescue for individual patients after high-dose methotrexate treatment. This makes the high-dose methotrexate regimen a treatment modality for malignant tumors without any side effects.
