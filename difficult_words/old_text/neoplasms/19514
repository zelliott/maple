We generalized the results of our own researches of the mechanisms, determined the high (90% BALB-line mice were survived) radioprotection activity by 1,3,4-thiadiazine derivatives. It was determined that this preparat achieves the highest concentrations in the critical for the acute radiation influence tissues. The preparate bind with the cell's membranes, nucleus and mitochondries, blockade the development of the radial reactions on the tissues level. Small quantity passes to the brain marrow, takes part in the regulative processes, which central nervous system is produced, reduces the metabolitical processes in the organism. It doesn't possess the election accumulation in the tumour and it is perspective for the prevention of damage health tissues under irradiation cancroid's therapy.
