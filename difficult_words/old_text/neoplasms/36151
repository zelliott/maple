Information obtained by different methods of image-guided radiotherapy now allows us to reposition the target volume. This evolution causes a change in practice and positioning control. In order to control positioning errors, a systematic control during the first three to five sessions is required. Random repositioning errors and clinical target volume motions can be mastered only by performing a daily imaging. Finally, image-guided radiotherapy allows assessing anatomical changes occurring during treatment, and opens the field of adaptive radiotherapy.
