Twenty-six patients with advanced cancer received monthly intramuscular recombinant leukocyte A interferon (IFN-alpha 2A), 12 X 10(6) U/m2 daily X 5 with escalating doses of doxorubicin, 25 to 40 mg/m2 on day 3. As anticipated, dose-limiting toxicities were an influenza-type syndrome and myelosuppression. A clinically meaningful and dramatic partial response of hepatocellular carcinoma persisted for 11.5 months associated with an alpha-fetoprotein reduction from 39,000 to 299 ng/ml. For Phase II investigations, the authors recommend the above IFN-alpha 2A dose with doxorubicin, 40 mg/m2, in patients with a performance score of 0 or 1 and no prior chemotherapy or significant radiation therapy which would enhance myelosuppression.
