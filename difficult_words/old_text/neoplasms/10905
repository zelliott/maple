There has been little qualitative research in Taiwan on the experiences of nurses who encounter the moment of child's death from their own perspective.

Using a phenomenological approach, this study worked to understand the essence of the caring experience for nurses at the moment of a cancer child's death from the nurses' own perspectives.

Researchers used Colaizzi's (1978) phenomenological method and collected data using purposive sampling and in-depth, tape-recorded interviews. Data were analyzed using the Colaizzi (1978) method. Ten registered nurses from a medical center participated into this study. The trustworthiness of the study was examined using Lincoln and Guba (1985) principles.

Five major themes emerged, including introspection on caring for dying children after their death; coping patterns of nurses; toleration and ability to help to ensure the child has a good death; facing death and consoling the soul; and accompanying parents though the moment of death.

Study findings provide evidence-based information on nurses to care for cancer children and their families facing the moment of death.
