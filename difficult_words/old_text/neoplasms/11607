Forty-two children with various systemic malignancies in continuous remission for 1 to 3 years after the completion of chemotherapy had CT scans with normal ventricular dimensions, similar to a noncancer "control" population. Seventeen of these patients had acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) treated either with prophylactic cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate [7] or intrathecal methotrexate alone [10] and the remaining 25 patients had soft tissue sarcomas. Sixteen other patients with sarcomatous meningitis had enlarged ventricles while on chemotherapy. Nine had ALL. Seven had soft tissue sarcomas, none of whom received any prior CNS irradiation or intrathecal chemotherapy. In this retrospective study no evidence of hydrocephalus or significant white matter hypodensity was detected in long-term survivors of childhood cancer, regardless of whether prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy and/or cranial irradiation was given. Direct involvement of the CNS with meningeal cancer was the most important association with ventriculomegaly.
