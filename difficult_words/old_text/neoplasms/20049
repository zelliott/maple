Proper sleep is associated with reduced cancer risk. For example, multiple studies have found that habitual sleeping pill usage is related to death from cancer, suggesting that sleep derangement may increase cancer mortality. However, other studies have not found a definite connection between sleep and cancer deaths. For this reason, we analyzed US cancer mortality data and sleep quality data to see if there was relationship.

Age-adjusted data on sleep disturbance in 50 US states and the District of Columbia are from Perceived insufficient rest or sleep among adults--United States, 2008. Age-adjusted all-cancer mortality data are from American Cancer Society Cancer Facts and Figures. Obesity data are from Vital signs: state-specific obesity prevalence among adults--United States, 2009. Data on race by state are from the 2010 US Census (http://www.census.gov).

There was a significant correlation between percentage of persons who reported insufficient sleep every day in the preceding 30 days versus all-cancer mortality in 50 US states and the District of Columbia (p &lt; 0.001). Because cancer survival is higher in whites than blacks and lower in obese individuals, multiple linear regression was performed. The association of insufficient sleep every day in the preceding 30 days with all-cancer mortality was significant (p = 0.017), independent of the percentage obese (p &lt; 0.001), and unrelated to percentage white population (p = 0.847).

Alterations in endocrine function, perhaps abnormal cortisol metabolism resulting from deranged sleep, may be in part responsible for the increased all-cancer mortality we report here. Further studies would be worthwhile.
