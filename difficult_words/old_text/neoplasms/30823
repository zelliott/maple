American Cancer Society (ACS)-funded research projects in the 1980s were significant in the development of current school intervention programs for children and adolescents with cancer. These programs need to be part of the psychosocial service of every pediatric hematology/oncology center, not only for those student/patients with highly visible problems but for all children; first, to ensure a smooth re-entry into school after diagnosis; and second, to identify any cognitive and academic dysfunctions that may result from treatment. The restructuring of special education services in the public schools in the United States and decreasing budgets are a challenge to the ACS to join with other health organizations to lobby at the local, state, and national level for services for all children regardless of diagnosis. Classroom teachers need to be empowered by parents and hospital personnel to develop creative, situation-specific interventions on behalf of each child and to work with the school psychologist to assess and make appropriate recommendations for students with cognitive late effects. This population needs ongoing support as they progress through the educational system and make transitions from one level of education to the next.
