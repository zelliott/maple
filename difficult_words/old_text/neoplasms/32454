The authors aimed to investigate the efficacy of epoetin-alpha on hemoglobin levels and red cell transfusion requirement in children with both hematologic malignancy (HM, n = 27) and solid tumors (ST, n = 14). Epoetin-alpha was given (150 U/kg or 250 U/kg, thrice weekly) for 12 weeks. Epoetin alpha significantly increased the hemoglobin levels at the 2nd and 3rd months of therapy (p &lt;.05). At the 3rd month, the patients required less red cell transfusion. At the dose of 150 U/kg, only three patients with HM, but none of the ST patients, required red cell. However, none required red cell transfusion after 2nd month on epoetin alpha 250 U/kg. Epoetin-alpha administration increases hemoglobin levels and decreases red cell transfusion requirement in children with malignancy.
