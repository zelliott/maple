Two methods have so far been proposed for staining samples by the argyrophil technique of Grimelius for electron microscopy. For HÃ¥kanson glutaraldehyde prevented argyrophilia, so the author stained sections from samples previously fixed by double formaldehyde/osmium tetroxide treatment and embedding. Vassallo used en bloc staining after fixation with glutaraldehyde-formaldehyde mixtures. We examined each factor which could directly interfere in argyrophil staining en bloc and on section. In the present experiment we compared effects of fixatives after staining en bloc. Glutaraldehyde prevented argyrophilia in 1 case out of 15, that of A-like cells in the oxyntic gland of the rat positivity was maintained in EC-like cells of this gland and adrenalin cells of the adrenal gland contrary to the previous description.
