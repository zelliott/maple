The aim of this study is the interpretation of the available bibliography concerning the present information about the mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of epichlorohydrin and epoxy resins. An intervention study on 141 exposed workers shows the necessity of an investigation about the well-timed perception of the carcinogenic risk. The development of an electrophoretic method is recommended to detect the alkylated hemoglobin by way of the biological monitoring.
