The European Code Against Cancer is a set of ten recommendations which, if followed, can be the best measure that an individual can take to avoid developing and dying from cancer. Primary and secondary prevention are considered as an important part of cancer control if their use is rational, based on scientific evidence. Six recommendations have to do with primary prevention (smoking, alcohol, diet, overweight, sun exposure, industrial carcinogens), two with secondary prevention, preferably consisting in organized screening programmes (uterine cervix, breast), and two with early diagnosis based on initial symptoms. Considering that smoking is the most important single cause of cancer in Europe tobacco control should be a priority. It is never too late to stop smoking: stopping even in middle age, prior to the onset of tobacco related illness, has a beneficial effect on life expectancy. If the entire population of Europe were to follow these guidelines a minimum of 40% reduction in cancer incidence and an even greater decrease in mortality could be achieved. The revised recommendations are the result of an agreement following 6-year experience of initially practising the original rules, comments and views of cancer experts throughout Europe; they were approved by the European Community Cancer Experts at their meeting in Bonn on 28-29 November 1994. Comprehension and implementation of these principles is of importance both for medical professionals and the general population of all European countries, in particular for members and candidates of the European Union, including the Czech Republic.
