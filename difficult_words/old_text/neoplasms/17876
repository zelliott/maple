In France, teenagers with cancer are managed mainly in paediatric units, given that there are only few teenage cancer units. This situation leads to the following question: are teenagers with cancer provided with tailored patient education? The object of this study was to identify education programmes specifically designed for teenagers in French paediatric oncology units. This study was conducted first by questionnaires, second by interviews with health care providers in units where information programs had been implemented. Nine information programmes or projects were identified: 2 booklets, one log book, one Web chat, one video, one DVD, one educative muppet, one peer based education group project, one nursing education session project and one qualitative study project. Only 5 from these programmes or project were specifically designed for teenagers. Four approaches can be identified: conception of education materials, individual patient education, group patient education, informal patient education.
