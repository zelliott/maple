Statistical procedures were used to estimate lectin receptor distribution on the surface of ascite lymphoma cells, neuroblastoma C-1300 cells and of transformed human T- and B-derived lymphoid cell lines. Relationships between the arithmetic means and mean square variances for sample populations from each cell and ferritin- or colloidal gold-lectin combination were used to define four types of topographical distributions: uniform-ordered, uniform-random, random and clustered.
