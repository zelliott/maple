A hyperbranched conjugated polyelectrolyte (HCPE) with a core-shell structure is designed and synthesized via alkyne polycyclotrimerization and click chemistry. The HCPE has an emission maximum at 565 nm with a quantum yield of 12% and a large Stokes shift of 143 nm in water. By virtue of its poly(ethylene glycol) shell, this polymer naturally forms spherical nanoparticles that minimize nonspecific interaction with biomolecules in aqueous solution, consequently allowing for efficient bioconjugation with anti-HER2 affibody via carbodiimide-activated coupling reaction. The resulting affibody-attached HCPE can be utilized as a reliable fluorescent probe for targeted cellular imaging of HER2-overexpressed cancer cells such as SKBR-3. Considering its low cytotoxicity and good photostability, the HCPE nanoprobe holds great promise in practical imaging tasks. This study also provides a molecular engineering strategy to overcome the intrinsic limitations of traditional fluorescent polymers (e.g., chromophore-tethered polymers and linear conjugated polyelectrolytes) for bioconjugation and applications.
