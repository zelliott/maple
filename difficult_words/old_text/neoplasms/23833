The inappropriate endogenous secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) could play a role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), one of the most frequent causes of death in cancer patients. Because of its capacity to inhibit TNF secretion in vitro, pentoxifylline (PTX) could be extremely useful in ARDS therapy. In this study 30 advanced cancer patients with ARDS were randomized to receive either the conventional care or conventional care plus PTX (100 mg i.v. twice a day for 7 days followed by an oral administration of 400 mg three times a day) to evaluate the efficacy of PTX in reducing TNF serum levels and in improving the symptoms of this syndrome. Serum levels of TNF were measured before and after 7 days of therapy. The percentage of patients alive at 7 days was significantly higher in the PTX-treated group than in the controls (12/15 versus 3/15; P &lt; 0.001). The mean survival time was significantly higher in the PTX-treated group than in the controls. A clinical and/or radiological improvement was obtained in 11/15 patients treated with PTX and in only 2/15 patients in the conventional care group (P &lt; 0.01). TNF mean levels significantly decrease in the PTX-treated group. These data confirm in vivo the capacity of PTX to inhibit TNF secretion in patients with ARDS. Moreover PTX therapy may improve the symptoms related to ARDS without particular toxic effects.
