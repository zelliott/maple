In 2005, following the first cancer plan of the national health authorities, a general cancer registry was established in northern France, in a territory designated as a "zone in proximity to the city of Lille" (ZPL). The aim of the present work was to evaluate the completeness of the registry's first year of incident cancer registration (2005) and to compare the observed cancer incidence in the "ZPL" with the estimated incidence in France.

Completeness was assessed using the average number of sources per case, the percentage of histological verification and a method of independent case ascertainment (mortality/incidence ratio). A direct standardization on the world population was used to calculate the ZPL/France ratios of standardized incidence rates. Analyses were conducted for 21 cancer sites.

In 2005, 3635 cases of invasive cancer were recorded by the registry. The average number of sources per case was 2.7 and histological proof was available for 91.4% of cases. Mortality/incidence ratios showed satisfactory completeness of the data for men for most cancer sites. For women however, for cancer sites for which the number of cases was low, data will have to be confirmed during the subsequent years of observation. A lack of completeness was found for cutaneous melanoma. In men, an overincidence was identified for cancers of lip-mouth-pharynx, larynx, esophagus, lung, liver, bladder, kidney and colon-rectum. In women, an overincidence has been identified for cancers of lip-mouth-pharynx, liver, bladder, colon-rectum, corpus uteri and ovaries.

The first year of incidence validated at the "Registre général des cancers de Lille et de sa région" shows a completeness of records with regards to studied criteria. The comparison with national data shows an overincidence of cancers related to tobacco and alcohol consumption in the geographical area covered by the registry. The incidence of lip-mouth-pharynx cancer in men is the highest of all French registries.
