In search of new strategies for the therapy of advanced tumors stroma-targeted approaches have been discussed recently, especially antiangiogenic therapies. It has turned out that some biomodulating drugs exhibit also effects against tumors beyond their original non-oncologic indication. Among these drugs are for example thalidomide,COX-2 inhibitors, PPARgamma agonists (thiazolidindiones) and mTOR antagonists (rapamycin). The antitumor efficacy of these therapeutics is fundamentally based on indirect effects on the stroma of the tumors. Combination therapies of these therapeutics seem to be superior to the use of single agents. These new biomodulating therapy approaches represent an interesting option for the palliative treatment of advanced tumors, especially as a supplement or extension of established chemo- and immunotherapeutic therapies, since they can be performed in an outpatient setting, the observed side effects are usually mild, and the therapies are therefore well accepted by the patients.
