A method for measuring Willebrand's factor protein has been developed, based on indirect solid-phase enzyme immunoassay with Soviet monoclonal antibodies to this factor. Normal Willebrand's factor level in the plasma has been found 55-161 percent. The method has been tried in patients with Willebrand's disease and with oncologic diseases.
