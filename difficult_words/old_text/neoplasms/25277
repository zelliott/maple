Combined oral contraceptives (OCs) modify different factors implicated in blood coagulation in the direction of encouraging thromboses.  Patients with thrombotic antecedents or with reduced antithrombin III should not receive combined pills, and surgical intervention should be avoided in others until the patient has discontinued use for 3 weeks, long enough for the modifications to disappear.  Combined preparations are inducers of certain hepatic enzyme systems and their use may alter the parameters of substances such as alpha 1 antitrypsine or gamma-glutamyltransferase, with little clinical effect.  Combined OCs favor the formation of delta-aminolevulinic acid and should be avoided in case of porphyrie.  Although the optical microscope discloses no histologic modifications except those existing in a clinical syndrome, the electron microscope may demonstrate modifications which can later attain clinical significance.  Among clinical manifestations of pill use are biliary symptomatologies including cholestatic jaundice, which is rare, more common in women of Scandinavian origin, and apparently due to both the estrogen and progestagen.  Biliary lithiasis is another possible clinical effect and is twice as common in pill users as in the control population.  Vascular symptomatology attributable to pill use includes the Budd-Chiari syndrome and hepatic peliose, which may be reversed on discontinuation of pill use if the lesions are nonnecrotic.  The use of OCs is known to be associated with the appearance of primitive hepatic tumors, but the exact incidence is unknown.  Among 55 cases occurring in women aged 15-50 years identified in France between 1975-79, 5 were malignant and 50 were benign.  47 of the women had definitely used OCs.  47 of the 55 tissues were reviewed by the same pathologist.  Of the 42 benign tumors, 31 were focal nodular hyperplasias, 9 were adenomas, and 2 were unclassifiable.  Although the etiology of hepatic tumors in users of combined OCs is controversial, such women should be followed carefully and episodes of pain or other symptoms should be fully evaluated.
