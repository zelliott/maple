A large number of variables have been identified which appear to influence macrophage phenotype within the tumour microenvironment. These include reciprocal chemical and physical interactions with tumour cells and with non-malignant cells of the tumour microenvironment, tissue oxygen tension, and the origin and prior experience of the particular macrophage population. In this review we outline the key evidence for these influences and consider how macrophage phenotype is acquired and the relevance of the TLR-NF-kappaB pathway.
