A prospective study was undertaken to elucidate the effect, if any, of total parenteral nutrition on plasma Antithrombin III levels. A total of 309 patients were included in the study. The patients suffered from cancer, or chronic illness, or major trauma which necessitated total parenteral nutrition. Each patient acted as his own control. Pre and postinfusion Antithrombin III levels were measured at regular intervals. Statistically, the results of the study have shown that total parenteral nutrition does not significantly alter Antithrombin III levels.
