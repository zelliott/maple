Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been described in cancer patients who received cytotoxic/immunosuppressive therapy and may result in liver damage of varying degrees of severity. There is no known effective treatment. Lamivudine, a nucleoside analogue, has been found to suppress HBV replication and to improve histology in chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus. The outcome of lamivudine therapy (at doses of 100 or 150 mg/day) in eight patients who developed HBV reactivation while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy is described. Each of the eight patients had &gt;98% suppression of the pretreatment HBV DNA levels. Three of the five patients who were initially HBeAg positive underwent seroconversion. Five patients had normalization of liver function tests and improvement in clinical condition. However, one patient died of hepatic failure due to HBV-related submassive liver necrosis, and two died of widespread metastases (including liver) from the primary malignancies. It is concluded that early commencement, i.e., at the onset of HBV reactivation before severe hepatic decompensation, of lamivudine may be effective in the control of HBV reactivation during chemotherapy. In Hong Kong, where hepatitis B infection is endemic, we propose to screen all cancer patients for hepatitis B surface antigen before immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy, and to closely monitor liver function of those who are found to be HBsAg seropositive.
