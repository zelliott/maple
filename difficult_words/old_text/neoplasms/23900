In a prospective multi-centre study, the pain-relieving effects of Tramadol Hydrochloride injection were observed in 98 patients with cancer pain. Tramadol was administered 100 mg intramuscularly p.r.n. for 1-3 days, and then the patients were crossed over to AP-237 injection (a common non-narcotic analgesic in China) or Tramal injection (product of Grunenthal) as control. The results showed that the response rates for Tramadol, Tramal and AP-237 were 82.6%, 81.8% and 62.1%, while the side effects were seen in 31%, 21% and 41%, respectively. In conclusion, the pain-relieving effect of Tramadol is as good as that of Tramal, but superior to AP-237.
