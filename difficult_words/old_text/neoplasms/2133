Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a condition characterized by serum hypoosmolality and hyponatremia, resulting from the aberrant or sustained secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Its most frequent cause is malignancy, of which small cell or oat cell bronchogenic carcinoma is most common. Because it mimics the clinical manifestations of various disorders, SIADH often is difficult to diagnose. However, with early detection and prompt management, it can be reversed. The oncology nurse frequently is in a position to assist in the early recognition of this condition. The ability to maintain a high index of suspicion for patients at risk is critical to prompt recognition. Familiarity with the conditions that lead to this crisis and its early signs are essential to establishing a diagnosis and administering prompt treatment.
