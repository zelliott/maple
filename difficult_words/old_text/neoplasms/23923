NCI's Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program recently initiated a continuing evaluation of the fellows' demographics, fellows' accomplishments in the program, fellow and preceptor expectations and satisfaction, program strengths and weaknesses, current employment for former fellows, and ex-fellows' perceptions of program training. Evaluation shows that the program attracts quality applicants (including minorities and females) nationwide from many disciplines. The program successfully educates about cancer prevention and provides a positive preceptor experience with publication opportunities. Areas for improvement are data access, stipend, office space, job assistance, and networking. Recommendations for other programs include committed enthusiastic staff; adequate budget, space, and support; a formal learning experience in public health fundamentals, research methods, and cancer prevention; individual mentored research within a productive scientific program; aggressive recruitment; competitive admissions policy; defined objectives for fellows; and ongoing formal program evaluation.
