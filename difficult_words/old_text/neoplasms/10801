Using swelling hydrogels, we study the evolution of a thin circular artificial tumor whose growth is confined at the periphery. When the volume of the outer proliferative ring increases, the tumor loses its initial symmetry and bifurcates towards an oscillatory shape. Depending on the geometrical and elastic parameters, we observe either a smooth large-wavelength undulation of the swelling layer or the formation of sharp creases at the free boundary. Our experimental results as well as previous observations from other studies are in very good agreement with a nonlinear poroelastic model.
