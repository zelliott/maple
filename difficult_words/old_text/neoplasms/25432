We analyzed sera from 28 patients with various types of malignancies for the occurrence of antibodies against exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two Pseudomonas proteases. A total of 27 of these individuals were colonized or infected with P. aeruginosa at one time or another during the study, whereas the remaining patient was colonized with four non-P. aeruginosa species of Pseudomonas. Sera were obtained from several of these patients before P. aeruginosa colonization or infection of these individuals was detected, which provided an opportunity to evaluate their responsiveness to pseudomonal exoproducts as they acquired the organism. Exotoxin A was purified from culture supernatant fluids of strain PA-103, and the two proteases were purified from an isolate of strain JR3, a highly proteolytic strain originally recovered from the sputum of a cystic fibrosis patient. Antibodies to the exotoxin A and the two proteases were detected in these sera, and sera which contained relatively high antibody levels to exotoxin A afforded mice complete protection against lethal challenges with this substance. Statistical analyses showed that patients infected with P. aeruginosa had consistently higher antibody levels (P less than 0.005) to the exoproducts than patients who were colonized with this organism. Also, patients colonized with P. aeruginosa possessed significantly higher antibody levels (P less than 0.003) to these three exoproducts than uninfected, hospitalized patients. Parke-Davis type 1 was the strain most commonly isolated from these patients (46%), but colonization or infection due to this organism usually resulted in the production of low levels of antibody to Pseudomonas exoproducts. However, infections with Parke-David type 7 organisms were always associated with intermediate- and high-responder sera to exotoxin A. These results indicated that potentially toxic products were elaborated during the course of cancer-related colonization and infection with P. aeruginosa.
