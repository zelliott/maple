From 3 donors suffering from extracerebral cancer 5 kidneys have been transplanted. All grafts functioned well without tumour signs up to 21 months after transplantation. However, because of tumour recurrence in nearly 50% of the cases recorded in the Cincinnati Transplant Tumor Registry, generally organs from donors suffering from cancer should not be used.
