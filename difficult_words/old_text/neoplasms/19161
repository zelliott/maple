Tumor cell lines exposed to immunoglobulins specific for cell surface antigens developed increased cellular incorporation of [(125)I]iododeoxyuridine and [(3)H]thymidine (up to 200-fold increases over cells treated with normal rabbit immunoglobulins). Antibody-stimulated cells multiplied more rapidly and lived longer than control cells in tissue culture. These observations were made both with cells substituted with 2,4,6-trinitrophenol and purified antibody against 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, and with several cell lines and their respective whole-cell antibodies. Antibodies that were stimulatory at low concentrations were cytotoxic at high concentrations. These observations may have significance in regard to enhancing effects of antibodies on tumor cell growth in vivo.
