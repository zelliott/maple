This summary of results with local BRM administration has been brief because the number of clinical situations in which this approach is applicable is quite limited. On the other hand, when applied in an appropriate patient population, clinical responses are frequent. In addition, detailed study of the effector cells and cytokines that appear in responding patients may yield information concerning the mechanism of action when BRM therapy is effective. Finally, comparison of the results from clinical trials with the results in experimental animals may help to further elucidate the mechanism by which BRMs exert antitumor effects.
