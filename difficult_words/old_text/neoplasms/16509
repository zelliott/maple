Myelosuppression is a common side effect in elderly patients undergoing chemotherapy. Neutropenia and anemia cause considerable morbidity, may increase mortality, and can result in a worse outcome of treatment in elderly patients compared to younger patients with comparable type and stage of disease. The availability and proven efficacy of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO) have had a considerable impact on supportive care in cancer patients: Several randomized trials have demonstrated a reduction of neutropenia and the frequency of severe infections in elderly patients treated with G-CSF following myelotoxic chemotherapy compared with patients without growth factor support. Both for G-CSF and for recombinant human erythropoietin (rHu-EPO) several studies have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of these molecules in elderly patients with regard to increasing hemoglobin concentrations, improving quality of life (rHu-EPO), and neutrophil recovery. Although a positive effect of the use of growth factors on overall survival in elderly cancer patients is not yet proven, a reduction of chemotherapy-induced side effects could clearly be shown. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) of cancer centers has recommended that all patients aged 70 years and older treated with CHOP or cytotoxic chemotherapy of comparable intensity should receive prophylactic G-CSF administration, and that the hemoglobin concentration be maintained at &gt;or=12 g/dl in elderly patients undergoing chemotherapy.
