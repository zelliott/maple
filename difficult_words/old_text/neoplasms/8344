This review describes the research literature relating the possible psychological precursors to cancer, published between 1978-1987. The studies are grouped, according to their methodological design, to cross-sectional case-control studies, cross-sectional studies using pre-biopsy assessment, and prospective longitudinal studies. A theoretical framework, based on recent psychosomatic investigations, is proposed to integrate the seemingly discrepant findings.
