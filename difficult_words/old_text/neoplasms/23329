Pain is a common symptom in cancer patients, but very little information about the prevalence, severity, and treatment of pain in cancer patients in Singapore is available. Therefore, our prospective survey in the National Cancer Centre (NCC) outpatients is incorporated in this report. In addition, a review concerning the recent advances on non-interventional pain management in cancer treatment, which is relevant in the context, is discussed.

For the prospective survey, a questionnaire was distributed for self-administration by patients while waiting for consultation at the NCC outpatient departments. Literature searches on advances in pain management were conducted, reviewed and discussed.

In the last decade, there have been advances in pain pharmacology ranging from wider therapeutic options and management approaches to novel delivery techniques. Acupuncture and massage therapy became increasingly popular among cancer patients. Some clinical trials of acupuncture show benefits in palliation of cancer pain. From the prospective survey, 41.2% of the responders reported pain in the past week, and only 70.8% talked to their doctors about their pain. One third of the patients received analgesics. Of these, 86.5% said that they were taking the prescribed medications, however, 37.4% admitted to having difficulties taking them. Non-drug methods were used by 25.4% of the patients. Medicated oil, cream or gel was used by 49.3%; only 2.6% reported use of Chinese herbs.

Pain is a significant symptom in outpatients attending a cancer centre, affecting 41.2% of the patients. Although majority of patients who suffered from pain reported this to doctors, much more medical effort is needed to help patients to relieve their pain and proper complementary therapy could be considered.
