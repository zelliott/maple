Several recently published clinical trials have extended our knowledge on the use of resveratrol (RVT) to treat several human pathological and metabolic disorders. Herein, we present insights into the metabolism, biological effects, and toxicity of RVT in humans. Recent data show that RVT exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. It can also improve glucose and lipid metabolism, it acts on cardiovascular parameters, and can modify some pathways involved in carcinogenesis. However, these effects are mostly tiny and the results are sometimes controversial as they depend on the protocols (i.e. dose, form of administration, patients' characteristics, adjuvant therapy, etc.). Toxicological data confirm that RVT is well tolerated. Any adverse effects (mainly concerning the abdomen), at doses of â‰¥0.5 g/day for long periods, remain moderate and reversible. Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of RVT need to be further investigated.
