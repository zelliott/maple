In vivo irradiation of the blood followed by a local or parenteral injection with irradiated blood is a useful tool in radiotherapy. To reveal changes in the components of irradiated blood, the serum enzymes LDH, GOT and GPT were examined in the blood of healthy donors, and cancer patients. The same enzymes were determined in the blood of in vivo radiation-treated patients. It seems that with some restrictions LDH offers a possibility to be regarded as biological indicator of radiation effects. Beside enzyme determinations blood picture was taken and immunological methods were used too, to check their usefulness in the evaluation of radiotherapy.
