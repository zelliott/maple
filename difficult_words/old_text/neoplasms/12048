A precise identification of chromosome abnormalities observed in cancerous human cells may be demonstrated by chromosome banding. The types of newly formed chromosomes seem to indicate the possibility of a correlation between chromosome rearrangements and regions of heterochromatin. The evolution of neoplastic cells would be due to a balance between an increase in the level of chromosome mutation and stable changes.
