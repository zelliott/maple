Because thrombin-treated tumor cell-induced metastasis increases tumor nodule volume(12) greater than nodule number, we studied the effect of thrombin on tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo (murine B16F10 melanoma, human HCT8 colon carcinoma, DU145 prostate carcinoma). Tumor cell growth was measured after 3 to 7 days in 1% fetal calf serum (FCS) + RPMI 1640. We found that, whereas relatively low concentrations of thrombin, 0.1 to 0.5 U/mL (1-5 nmol/L) enhance tumor cell growth in vitro approximately 2- to 3-fold, higher concentrations, 0.5 to 1 U/mL (5-10 nmol/L) impaired cell growth approximately 2- to 4-fold. Impaired cell growth was associated with cell cycle arrest at G(2)M and increased pre-G(o) DNA, as well as apoptosis, measured by tumor cell binding to Annexin V and propidium iodide. Apoptosis was reversed with the general caspase inhibitor, FK-011. The enhancing and inhibiting effects were specific for thrombin (reversed with inactive diisopropyl-fluorophosphate [DFP]-thrombin) and mediated via the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1). PAR-1 activation was demonstrated by (1) use of a cell line, B16F10, devoid of the 3 other thrombin receptors, PAR-3, PAR-4, and GPIb; and (2) greater sensitivity of PAR-1 transfected B16F10 and HCT8 cells to impaired cell growth/apoptosis, 3- and 14-fold, respectively. Thus, thrombin has a bimodal effect on PAR-1 in tumor cells: enhanced growth at low concentration, impaired growth/apoptosis at higher concentration.
