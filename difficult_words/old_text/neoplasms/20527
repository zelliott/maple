Adjuvant psychological therapy can help cancer patients in 2 main ways. It has, first, a well-documented capacity to alleviate distress and thus improve quality of life. However, if this kind of assistance is to be made available to the majority of cancer patients, a number of problems need to be solved: administrators need to become aware of the evidence for efficacy of psychosocial care for cancer patients; the treatment needs to be advocated in a manner that would benefit patients rather than being left to the patient to request it; and, for reasons of economy, large, classroom-style, psychoeducational classes may need to be offered in place of small support groups. Furthermore, to allow for individual differences in preferences and abilities, a variety of modes of help should ideally be made available. The author discusses how the provision of coping strategies can be organized in a progressive way to encourage development of greater coping skills. An example of such a stepwise program is given, all aspects of which have been researched and made available in manuals over some 20 years. The possibility of prolonging life with this kind of therapy is still controversial. While randomized controlled trials have become the method of choice to investigate this question, reasons are given for strongly preferring more exploratory modes of research at the present early stage of knowledge. The central task is seen as understanding the states of mind that promote healing or longer life, something that cross-sectional, psychometric research has not been able to accomplish. As an alternative, prospective, longitudinal designs are needed, with detailed interview-style analyses of patients' mental attributes. An example is given of one such study. Furthermore, it is suggested that we consider much more intensive therapies of this kind, since the impact of mind on body will logically be related to the extent of psychological change experienced.
