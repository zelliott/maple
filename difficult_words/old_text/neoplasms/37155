A questionnaire survey was carried out with the aim of evaluating knowledge about and practice of cancer pain treatment in Denmark. A questionnaire was sent to a 10% random sample of Danish physicians. Of these 1411 physicians, 1068 (76%) returned the questionnaires and after the exclusion of those doctors who never treated cancer patients, 577 (54%) were analyzed. Their knowledge of the principles and practice of cancer pain treatment was evaluated by means of 14 multiple-choice and open questions. Their ability to apply their knowledge in practice was evaluated by analyzing their suggested treatment of three simulated patient cases. Ninety-seven percent of the physicians recognized difficulties in cancer pain treatment, the most frequent being side effects of drugs and inadequate pain relief. It appeared from the proposals for pain treatment of the patient cases that the majority of the physicians could treat both pain from bone metastasis (75%) and visceral pain (78%) satisfactorily, while very few suggested coanalgesics for neuropathic pain (20%). Older physicians performed less satisfactorily than did their younger colleagues. Basic pain treatment skills have been acquired by the Danish physicians. However, in the future emphasis should be placed on the treatment of neuropathic pain with coanalgesics and the management of opioid side-effects.
