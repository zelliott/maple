Patients with cancer spend the majority of the last year of life at home, with district nurses (DNs) as the main care coordinators and providers. However, there is a relative lack of empirical work on the DN role in this area. This study used qualitative, case-study methods to explore the role of district nurses caring for patients with cancer who require palliative care. The study focused on three patient cases and the researcher visited each patient with the DN on several occasions. The sample was three DNs and the principal data collection methods were episodes of participant observation (n=11) and in-depth interviews (n=12). The findings suggest that DN role was as linchpin or coordinator of palliative care at home. They were the main providers of physical and emotional support for the patients and families in this study. The supportive role of the DN involved referral to other agencies. Patient and carer preferences impacted on decision-making and care planning and reaching a compromise was often necessary.
