To induce hyperthermia of spontaneous tumors in dogs an interstitial method of heating was used: electrodes in the form of injection needles were implanted around tumors. Necessary temperature levels could not be attained in a dog with circumanal angiosarcoma because the tumor was well vascularized and had a considerable volume. No thermal damage of the animals' skin was observed during all sessions of hyperthermia. A conclusion was made that the interstitial method of heating could be used in multimodality therapy of malignant tumors of a complex shape.
