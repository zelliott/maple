Differences in recording concurrent chronic conditions (CCs) could change the weight of the influence of the different CCs on health status.

To determine the role of musculoskeletal disorders as concurrent CCs.

Cross-sectional study. Discharged patients with CCs were selected by random stratification. Sociodemographic and clinical variables, health status (SF-36), type and number of self-reported and hospital discharge summary CCs were recorded. Relationships were analyzed using linear regression models.

In the 227 patients included, mean self-reported CCs were 6.22 (SD 3.37) and mean hospital discharge CCs were 3.1 (SD 1.95). The most-frequent self-reported CCs were hypertension 48.4%, back pain 40.4%, neck pain 39.6%, and musculoskeletal disorders 38.4%. The most frequent discharge CCs were arterial hypertensive disease 38.3%, all cancers 22.0%, ischemic heart diseases, and angina 15.9%. Musculoskeletal disorders had the greatest negative influence on SF-36 dimensions (p &lt; 0.05).

Musculoskeletal disorders were underestimated in the discharge summary in comparison with those reported by patients.
