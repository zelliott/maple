Advances in the field of human genetics have made it possible to develop specific management and prevention strategies for rare genetic disorders, and tailor pharmacotherapeutic approaches to anticoagulation and certain cancers. The role that genetic variation plays in influencing the risk and outcome of the most common diseases are still unclear. Data from genome-wide association studies is just beginning to answer these questions. We review the role of genome-wide association studies in the quest towards individualized medicine, and examine the promises and challenges that lie ahead.
