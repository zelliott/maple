To find what palliative treatment, in particular for pain and anxiety, terminal cancer patients in the Community of Castilla La Mancha receive.

A descriptive, retrospective study by means of a questionnaire.

Primary Care. Autonomous Community of Castilla La Mancha.

A survey of 157 doctors with data referring to their last cancer patient deceased in the period from January to August, 1994.

Data on 157 patients were received. Of all the tumours, lung cancer was the most common (22.93%). Pain was the symptom most often mentioned (92.91%); anxiety appeared in 70.06%. The most commonly used non-opiate analgesic was Paracetamol (58.22%). Morphine was used in 46.48%, for an average period of 2.35 months (SD = 2.21). Side-effects due to morphine appeared in 22.06%. Complementary drugs to treat pain were used in 13.01% of cases. 12% were referred to specialists for analgesic control. Doctors used pain measurement tables in 5.48% of cases. 19.09% of patients suffering anxiety received no type of treatment.

We think that analgesic tables to monitor the treatment should be used. Attention should be paid to the appearance of side-effects of morphine, the circulation of pain graduation tables and the evaluation of anxiety in this category of patient.
