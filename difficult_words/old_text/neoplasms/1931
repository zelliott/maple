In order to determine the nutritional effects of BCAA compositions in the treatment of cancerous hypoproteinemia, the appropriate ratio of I-leu: Leu: Val and the proportion of BCAA to Total Amino Acids were investigated. As for results, indices such as the serum albumin, the RBP and N-balance quickly recovered to normal levels when the ratio of I-leu: Leu: Val was 1.0:1.8:1.0 and the proportion o BCAA to TAA was 31%. These composition thus may be suitable for the treatment of cancerous hypoproteinemia.
