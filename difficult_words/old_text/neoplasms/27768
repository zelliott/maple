A new pteridine compound, named umanopterin, was isolated from human urine both of cancer patients and non-cancer controls. The structure was confirmed to be 2-amino-4(3H)-oxo-6-[(1'R,2'R)-1',2',3'-trihydroxypropyl]pteridine , a diastereomer of neopterin. The amount of umanopterin relative to neopterin was about 10%, which was practically the same among the non-cancer controls and the patients of various cancers. A small amount of a threo diastereomer of biopterin, named orinapterin, was isolated from human urine for the first time. Its structure was shown to be 2-amino-4(3H)-oxo-6-[(1'S,2'S)-1',2'-dihydroxypropyl]pteridine. A non-enzymatic transformation of 7,8-dihydroneopterin and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin by a mechanism analogous to keto-enol tautomerism is postulated for the formation of umanopterin and orinapterin in human body.
