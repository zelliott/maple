The latest report from the Royal College of General Practitioners Oral Contraceptive Study supersedes their 1977 paper and handles the intermittent pill users differently.  The report concentrates on deaths from circulatory disorders and their relation to oral contraceptive (OC) use and to age and smoking habits.  The yearly drop-out rate is said to average 6.4% in the ever-users and 6.6% in the controls.  This represents a 54% loss to follow-up.  Were the drop-out rates the same for the women who were new OC users when enrolled into the study?  The RCGP study gives a relative risk of 1.5 for deaths due to accidents and violence, the numbers of such deaths being 34 in the ever users and 17 in the controls.  Vessey et al. found admission rates for self-poisoning (per 1000 woman years) to be 0.83 for OC users, 0.21 for diaphragm users, and 0.40 for women fitted with an IUD.  This sample was aged 25-39, thus excluding younger women who are more likely to take overdoses.  The mental effects of OC use are too important to be ignored.  For cancer deaths the relative risk was 1.0.  There were 19 deaths due to breast cancer in the ever-users and 10 in the controls.
