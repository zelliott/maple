This study was performed to determine if the ingestive and bactericidal capacity of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) was altered in cancer patients treated with total body hyperthermia (TBH). TBH of either 41.5 or 42.0 C was induced and maintained for periods up to 6 hours by extracorporeal circulation of the patient's blood through a very sensitive temperature regulating device via a shunt in the patient's leg. In vitro studies performed at 37 C showed that the bactericidal capacity of the PMN from cancer patients was initially generally lower than values obtained from control individuals, but most of the patients' PMN exhibited an increased bactericidal capacity following TBH. Function was not diminished by multiple hyperthermia treatments. Similar studies performed in vitro at 42 C showed that the bactericidal capacity of PMN from both control individuals and cancer patients was significantly less than those obtained at 37 C. These data indicate that the bactericidal capacity of peripheral blood PMN may be transiently increased after TBH, but during the period of elevated temperature, the phagocytic process may be retarded.
