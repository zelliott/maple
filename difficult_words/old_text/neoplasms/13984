Research on the family's response to illness has not been characterized by deliberate attention to quality of family life issues. Most work in the field has been directed toward conceptualizing and measuring coping behaviors and impact. Conclusions regarding quality of family life must be inferred from measures not explicitly designed to measure this concept. The quality of family life is as elusive a concept as is quality of life for the individual. Theoretical and methodological approaches must be developed and tested. Oncology nurses have the potential to influence the quality of family life within the cancer experience.
