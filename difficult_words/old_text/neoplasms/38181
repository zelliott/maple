Micelle is a stable, passively targetable and solubilizing minute particle, and plays a key role to anticancer drug delivery for chemotherapy. With an increasing number of novel polymeric micelles synthesized, many anticancer drugs have been core-encapsulated in the micelles. However, only single drug was studied as the model drug at present researches. It is well known that combined medication is a very important and common method for chemotherapy in the clinic. Therefore, we hypotheses that multi-anticancer drugs encapsulated in the micelle may be proposed based on the cancer cell cycle. Briefly, cell cycle specific agents are chemically conjuncted into the micelles firstly, and then cell cycle non-specific agents are physically loaded in the compound of drugs and micelles. Thus combined administration using micelles as drug carriers is achieved. This hypothesis integrates advantages of the nano-micelles at present researches and drug combination in the clinic. So, it presents many merits for drug delivery, such as high efficiency, convenience and anti-resistance.
