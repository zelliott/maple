The previously reported association of the APEX Asp148Glu single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with cancer, and the suggestion of associations of the XRCC3 Thr241Met and hOGG1 Ser326Cys SNP sites with G(2) chromosomal radiosensitivity were investigated in a new study of 30 childhood and young adult cancer survivors, their 30 partners, and 55 offspring. An additional SNP, hOGG1 Arg46Gln was also analyzed. Data on G(2) chromosomal radiosensitivity was available on 29 of the families including 53 offspring. No significant associations of genotype with cancer or G(2) chromosomal radiosensitivity were observed.
