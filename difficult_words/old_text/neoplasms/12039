Experimental observations of pronounced mesenchyme incorporation near the capillaries of cancer tissue occurring three days after therapeutic treatment with a tumour cell killing rate of 50% have led to the conclusion that mesenchyme reaction is one of the most likely causes of the known increase in resistance found with repeated cancer therapy processes. Mesenchyme incorporation especially diminishes the glucose diffusion coefficient and therefore weakens the glucose diffusion field around the capillaries so that proliferation and sensitivity of tumour cells to cancerostaticas and radiation will decrease to a very high degree. The given solution of the glucose diffusion field equation permits a quantitative presentation of regularities and therapeutic results about mesenchyme incorporation within a capillary distance of R approximately 30 mum. So it has been calculated that, in stationary cases, a transition to the conditions obtained with Cancer Multi-step Therapy (CMT) will increase the volume of tumour tissue being accessible to a therapeutic process by a factor of more than 2.5. Viewed from theoretical aspects, the CMT Concept therefore seems to be one of the most promising possibilities to overcome the (mesenchymal) resistance of tumour tissue. Finally, the paper gives a discussion about an actual possibility for reducing the developing resistance in case of repeated therapeutic treatment based on experimental circumstances; i.e., the inhibition of mesenchyme reactions, for instance, by giving a high dosage of prednisolon in the interval between therapeutic processes.
