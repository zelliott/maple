Activation of cellular or c-oncogenes and loss of function of suppressor genes appears to be the key event in the formation of most human cancers. Altered forms of these genes or their protein products have the potential to provide a new generation of cancer markers. As cancer markers, the most useful application of c-oncogenes and suppressor genes so far, has been in providing prognostic information. The correlation of N-myc gene amplification with poor prognosis in neuroblastoma was one of the first examples of prognostic data supplied by a c-oncogene. Most, but not all investigators, find that either amplification or increased expression of c-erbB-2 gene correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Other potential prognostic markers in breast cancer include amplification of the c-myc gene, and increased expression of both EGFR and p53 protein. Although c-oncogenes and suppressor genes have the potential to supply prognostic information in a broad range of cancers, many of the results are still preliminary with conflicting conclusions.
