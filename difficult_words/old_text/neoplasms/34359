Transcatheter electrocoagulation is an effective method of experimental vessel occlusion even in the presence of thrombocytopenia and heparinization. This technique was used to occlude 13 arteries in 3 patients. In vitro testing suggests that intra-arterial bipolar platinum electrodes may achieve the therapeutic objectives more rapidly and with less risk, but more investigative work is required.
