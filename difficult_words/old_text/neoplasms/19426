Psycho-oncology -- as the diction suggests -- is a multidisciplinary sub-specialty of oncology concerned with the emotional responses of patients at all stages of the disease, their families and staff. Psycho-oncology does not assume the responsibility of cancer cure but attends to the psychological, social and behavioural variables that influence cancer prevention, risk and survival. The psycho-social research domains today contain the screening and management of psycho-social distress as well as experiences with specific psycho-oncological symptoms. Cancer-related fatigue, for example, disturbs patients' quality of life more often than pain. However, all too often doctors fail to pay enough attention to this unknown symptom.
