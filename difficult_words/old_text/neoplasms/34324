153 patients with inoperable malignant tumors were treated by the so-called synchronization therapy with vincristine and ifosfamide. 13 complete remissions (8.5%) and 47 partial remissions (30.7%) were obtained. 5 times cessation of tumor growth occurred (3.3%). In 88 cases the therapy failed (57.5%), but in 11 cases a subjective improvement was noted. The most favourable results of treatment were obtained in cases of malignant lymphoma, small cell carcinoma of the lung and testicular carcinomas. Although the duration of remission was short in most cases, it could be demonstrated, that a targeted polychemotherapy is possible using the proliferation kinetic data in addition to the knowledge of the cell-phase-specific effect of cytostatic drugs. This therapy can succeed in causing a tumor regression even in metastatic carcinomas.
