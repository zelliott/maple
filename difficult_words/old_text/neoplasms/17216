To examine the associations between depressive/anxiety disorders (DAs), perceived health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and mortality in dialysis patients.

Patients were assessed for depressive and DAs with the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The HRQOL was assessed with the Medical Outcome Short Form 36 (MOS SF-36), and the Beck Depression Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were also applied. Sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data were also collected.

Patients with depressive disorders reported more impaired HRQOL on four of the eight subscales, while those with a depressive disorder comorbid with DA reported more impairment on all MOS SF-36 subscales compared to those without any psychiatric disorder. During the observation period, 50% of those with depression, 28% of those with anxiety and 33% of patients with DA disorder died. A survival analysis did not indicate that patients with depressive or DAs had a higher mortality than patients without such disorders.

Dialysis patients with depressive disorders reported impaired HRQOL, whereas those with DAs did not. Patients with DA reported the most serious HRQOL impairment. No evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that depressive and DAs contributed to compromised survival in dialysis patients. In patients with depression, DAs should also be assessed as they significantly contribute to impaired HRQOL.
