Controlling occupational exposure to chemical substances in biomedical laboratories is very complex because of the high number of compounds involved, and the rapid changes in analytical techniques and methods. On the other hand, evidence of increased mortality for malignant lymphoma and leukemia has been observed in laboratory technicians. This calls for more precise procedures of risk assessment to identify the specific substances that may be responsible for these effects. A model of hazard identification is presented, which includes the following steps: identification, classification and periodical updating of the chemical substances used in each analytical technique; evaluation of the variables that can influence the exposure; quantification of exposure using environmental measurements. The availability of such a procedure can be useful for the organization of health and epidemiological surveillance programs for the laboratory workers.
