The persistent presence of chromosome instability (CIN) has been demonstrated in majority of human cancers, particularly in solid cancers. Recent progress in molecular and cellular biology as well as cytogenetic has shed light on the possible molecular mechanisms and their association with carcinogenesis. Chromosome instability may result from various causes, including defects of mitotic spindle checkpoint, centrosome aberration, failure of cell cycle checkpoint, DNA double strand break, telomeres dysfunction, hypomethylation and so on. The researches broaden new insight in molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and provided new ideas in diagnoses, therapy, classification, and prognosis of cancer.
