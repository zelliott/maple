We reported the kind of symptoms and how they could be palliated in terminally ill patients at home based on our experience of about 9 years. Cancer pain, which was the most frequent symptom, appeared in 67 among 126 patients receiving home care, and it could be effectively controlled with morphine; no patient returned to the hospital because of aggravation of pain. Very few patients stayed in the hospital and never returned home due to uncontrollable pain. Home parenteral infusion was done for 63 patients who were unable to eat or drink because of peritonitis carcinomatosa or cancer cachexia. High fever in the tumor mass was controlled by glucocorticoid hormone, and ascites was drained continuously when the patients suffered from abdominal distension. From analysis of the cases in which home care was interrupted or those in which patients were unable to transfer to home care, symptoms that were difficult to palliate at home were nausea caused by bowel obstruction, acute symptoms (bleeding, disturbance of consciousness, and so on), and dyspnea. But if the patients and family are eager for home care and an adequate medical support system is in place, home care may be possible despite these symptoms.
