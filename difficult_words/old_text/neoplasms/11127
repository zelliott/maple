The intravenous anesthetic propofol has a number of well-known nonanesthetic effects, including anti-oxidation and anti-emesis. Another interesting nonanesthetic effect of propofol may be its cyclooxygenase (COX)-inhibiting activity. This activity may have important clinical implications, as propofol could have antitumor properties through COX inhibition. Propofol could counteract the activity of COX, which elicits, via its major product prostaglandin E(2), (1) tumor growth stimulation, (2) increased tumor survival, (3) enhanced tumor invasiveness, (4) stimulation of new vessel formation, and (5) tumor evasion of host immune surveillance through suppression of immune cell functions. Indeed, accumulated evidence indicates that propofol suppresses the proliferation, motility, and invasiveness of tumors in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, propofol could be a particularly suitable anesthetic for use during the perioperative period for cancer surgery. However, whether the COX-inhibiting activity of propofol is related to the reported antitumor properties of propofol is not known. Definitive evidence remains to be provided.
