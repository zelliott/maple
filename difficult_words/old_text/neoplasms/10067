Peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity of 24 cancer patients was studied prior to and after single and multiple injections of various doses of human leukocyte recombinant interferon-alpha clone A (IFN-alpha rA). The NK cell cytotoxicity of all cancer patients declined consistently 4 and 8 hours after a single injection of IFN-alpha rA. Twenty-four hours after the injection of IFN-alpha rA, NK cell cytotoxicity of patients with low NK cell phenotype (NK-LR) was significantly augmented, whereas that of patients with medium (NK-MR) or high (NK-HR) NK phenotype was depressed. After multiple injections of IFN-alpha rA, depression of NK cell cytotoxicity was observed in a number of NK-MR and NK-HR patients, but in some patients with NK-LR phenotype, further potentiation was observed. No direct correlation between the NK cell augmentation and serum IFN levels was detected. In in vitro studies, IFN-alpha rA, when added to cultures of target and effector cells of normal individuals in a dose of 10(3) U/ml, was efficient in augmenting NK cell cytotoxicity. NK cell cytotoxicity of cancer patients could also be augmented by the IFN-alpha rA preparation; however, this augmentation occurred only prior to in vivo IFN-alpha rA therapy. After IFN-alpha rA in vivo therapy, their NK cells became refractory to further in vitro IFN-alpha rA treatment.
