Over the past decade, silicon nanowire (SiNW) biosensors have been studied for the detection of biological molecules as highly sensitive, label-free, and electrical tools. Herein we present a comprehensive review about the fabrication of SiNW biosensors and their applications in disease diagnostics. We discuss the detection of important biomarkers related to diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. SiNW biosensors hold great promise to realize point-of-care (POC) devices for disease diagnostics with potential for miniaturization and integration.
