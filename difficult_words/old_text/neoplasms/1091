Darinaparsin, an organic arsenic, targets essential cell survival pathways. We determined the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose of darinaparsin in patients with advanced cancer.

Patients with solid malignancies refractory to conventional therapies were treated with i.v. darinaparsin daily for 5 days every 4 weeks. The starting dose (78 mg/m(2)) escalated to 109, 153, 214, 300, 420, and 588 mg/m(2). A conventional "3 + 3" design was used.

Forty patients (median age, 61.5 years; median number of prior therapies, 5) received therapy; 106 cycles were given (median, 2; range, 1-12). Twenty patients reported no drug-related toxicities. No DLTs were reported at a dose of &lt;420 mg/m(2). At 588 mg/m(2), two of four patients developed DLTs, including grade 3 altered mental status and ataxia. Of four patients treated at the de-escalated dose of 500 mg/m(2), one developed similar toxicities. De-escalating the dose to 420 mg/m(2) (n = 8) resulted in two neurologic DLTs. Further de-escalation to 300 mg/m(2) (n = 3) resulted in no drug-related toxicities. Arsenic plasma levels peaked on treatment day 3, plateaued on day 5, and returned to baseline on day 7. Plasma levels varied within cohorts but increased with increasing doses. The median plasma arsenic half-life was 16.2 hours. Seven (17.5%) patients had stable disease for &gt; or =4 months (median, 6; range, 4-11), including 4 of 17 with colorectal and 2 of 3 with renal cancer.

The recommended dose for phase II trials is 300 mg/m(2) i.v. given daily for 5 days every 4 weeks.
