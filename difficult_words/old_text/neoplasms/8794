Among other findings that we reported elsewhere, two themes emerged from the in-depth interviews relating to apprehensive percepts. One was that participants spoke of their tendency to battle worrisome thoughts. Although they used a variety of words in describing the construct, anxiety repeatedly appeared as a cogent emotion when facing cancer.
