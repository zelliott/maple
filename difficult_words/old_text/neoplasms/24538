The incidence of perioperative pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) has increased in Japan. As the mortality rate of PE is very high, its prophylaxis is important.

From January 1998 to December 1999 no prophylactic strategies were employed. From May 2000 to December 2004, elastic stockings (ES) for prevention of perioperative deep vein thrombosis were worn from the morning of the operation until the beginning of ambulation. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) apparatuses were used in combination with ES right after the induction of anesthesia until leaving ICU. Sixty percent of patients stayed in ICU until the next morning after the operation and the other patients for a few hours after the end of surgery.

We managed 4,511 patients without any preventing method and 11,688 patients with the combination of ES and IPC. Seven patients developed PTE without any prophylaxis and one with preventative methods. The incidence of PTE was significantly decreased from 15.51 persons/10,000 cases to 0.86 person/10,000 cases. Symptomatic deep vein thrombosis occurred in 3 cases in spite of preventative methods.

Our preventive strategies with the combination of ES and IPC seem to be useful to decrease the incidence and severity of perioperative PTE.
