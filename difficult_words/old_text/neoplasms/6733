Long-term needs of a family whose child has cancer must be integrated into the family's responsibilities early in the disease treatment. The family's understanding, acceptance, and participation in the patient's care is a determining factor in the effectiveness of the treatment plan. Family responsibilities are twofold: obtain correct medical information about child's disease and its treatment, and adapt to necessary changes in lifestyle. Basic medical knowledge the family must possess includes information relating to the disease, its expected course, treatment, and side effects. Adaptation to changes requires that parents be informed to the anticipated alterations in family and community relationships. They need specific information about hospital policies and routines, financial resources, and expectations of the treatment plan in effort to adapt to the demands of long term care. The challenge in preparing a family is in acceptance of a philosophy that recognizes and values the family's contribution to care. Family members are a crucial part of the health care team. A positive and encouraging approach from professionals is essential to family acceptance of the disease and compliance with treatment.
