With the anticipated growth in the numbers of elderly persons, a higher prevalence of cancers among older persons is expected; as a result, oncologists will treat larger numbers of older persons in their practices. Clinicians caring for older persons with cancer must recognize the heterogeneity of the elderly population and focus their assessments and care plans accordingly. The author reviewed literature and drew conclusions regarding geriatric assessment in several key areas: the medical, cognitive, affective, functional economic, and environmental status of patients; social support for patients; and advance directives. They concluded that for younger and healthier seniors, simple probes for the presence of common geriatric problems may suffice, but traditional means of medical assessment should be supplemented by brief screening for common geriatric conditions and nonmedical issues that are of particular relevance to the health of older persons. Assessment instruments can be used to guide these brief evaluations, but results must be interpreted in the context of the limitations of the instruments used. Patients who are frail or at high risk for functional decline or nursing home placement should receive more extensive evaluation by individual practitioners or by a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals who can provide comprehensive geriatric assessment. By broadening their assessment skills to include domains that are beyond traditional internal medicine and oncology training, oncologists can better serve their older cancer patients.
