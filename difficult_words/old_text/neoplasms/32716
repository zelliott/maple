The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway constitutes the major system for nuclear and extralysosomal cytosolic protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. A plethora of cell proteins implicated in the maintenance and regulation of essential cellular processes undergoes processing and functional modification by proteolytic degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Deregulations of the pathway have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative, autoimmune, genetic and metabolic disorders, most of them exhibiting abnormal accumulation and altered composition of components of the pathway that is suitable for diagnostic proceedings. While the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is currently exploited to develop novel therapeutic strategies, it is less regarded as a diagnostic area. Future research should lead to an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway with the aim of allowing the development of subtle diagnostic strategies.
