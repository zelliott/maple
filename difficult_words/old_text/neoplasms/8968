Spirituality is central to many people's lives, yet social workers often defer discussing the topic with patients. Their avoidance can be linked to the lack of training on how to speak with patients about spiritual matters (Lemmer, 2010) With further education, clinical social workers are empowered to assess this significant aspect of the patient's cancer experience as they progress along the illness continuum. The social worker's comfort and familiarity with spiritual assessment, spiritual language, and various forms of religious and/or spiritual practices will improve their clinical work with patients who have chronic cancer by providing insight to guide appropriate social work interventions designed to enhance spiritual well-being.
