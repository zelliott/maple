Monoclonal antibodies directed to tumor-associated antigens have been chemically conjugated to drugs with different mechanisms of action and different levels of potency. Monoclonal-antibody-directed drug delivery has the potential to both improve efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity. Several immunoconjugates have demonstrated impressive antigen-specific antitumor activity in preclinical models. Phase I trials of a calicheamicin immunoconjugate for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and a doxorubicin immunoconjugate for treatment of carcinoma have recently been completed.
