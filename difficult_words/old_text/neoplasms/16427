The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and complication rates of a side-exiting coaxial needle system for fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies.

Between 1995 and 1998, 127 nonconsecutive biopsies were performed on 122 patients (74 males, 48 females). CT guidance was used in 111, ultrasound guidance was used in 14, and both were used in 2 biopsies. Patient history, biopsy site, needle performance, complications, and cytology results were recorded.

Diagnostic rate and accuracy were 92.9 and 99.2%, respectively. There were minor complications from 14 biopsies, and all of them arose from chest biopsies: pneumothorax in 13 of 47 and hemoptysis in 1 of 47. There were no major complications.

The side-exiting coaxial needle system is a safe and effective alternative to the conventional end-exiting coaxial needle system for performance of image-guided FNA biopsies.
