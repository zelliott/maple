We present details of nine patients who developed morphoea after radiotherapy. In every patient morphoea began within the irradiated area and in four spread beyond it. We believe the irradiation triggered the morphoea despite the absence of any clear-cut relationship to dosage or severity of the acute reaction. Dermatologists and radiation oncologists should be aware that this condition may lead to the mistaken diagnosis of a local tumour recurrence.
