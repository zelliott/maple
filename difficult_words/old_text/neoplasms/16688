The results of 308 emergency (61%) and elective (39%) simultaneous operative interventions, comprising 2.2% of the total number of operations for 10 years, are presented. In performing the simultaneous operations for strict indications, the risk of intervention increases insignificantly. The incidence of postoperative complications and lethality after such interventions do not exceed the corresponding indices after similar operations, but performed separately.
