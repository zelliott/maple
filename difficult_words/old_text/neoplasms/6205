Although proton therapy has been used for many decades because of their superior dose distribution over photons and reduced integral dose, their clinical implementation is still controversial. We updated a systematic review of charged particle therapy. Although still no randomised trials were identified, the field is moving quickly and we therefore also formulated ways to move forward. In our view, the aim should be to build enough proton therapy facilities with interest in research to further improve the treatment and to run the needed clinical trials.
