Basic research in biological and medical disciplines has revealed fundamental aspects of the differentiation of single cells as well as the development of multicellular organisms. The combination of knowledge of intracellular and intercellular pathways controlling development and homeostasis in higher organisms is the key to understanding certain diseases that are associated with abnormalities in these pathways and developing strategies for fighting them. Today's high scientific output in a rapidly growing number of scientific journals requires great effort to keep up with the latest developments outside one's specialization. The tenth international conference of the International Society of Differentiation (ISD) therefore was a great opportunity for scientists of diverse fields of biological and medical research to learn about the latest developments in even remotely related branches of research and opening new perspectives. The authors have tried to conserve this spirit in reviewing main aspects of research presented at the conference.
