Increasing numbers of chemotherapeutic agents are being used to treat patients with cancer and various immunologically mediated and inflammatory disorders. Many of the drugs used have distinctive cutaneous side effects that range from relatively common ones, such as alopecia, stomatitis, and hyperpigmentation, to more unusual ones, such as radiation enhancement and recall phenomena, photosensitivity and hypersensitivity reactions, and phlebitis or chemical cellulitis. In addition, there are some rare complications such as diffuse sclerosis of the hands and feet, Raynaud's phenomenon, sterile folliculitis, and flushing reactions. By being aware of which drug may have caused a particular cutaneous reaction, dermatologists will be able to contribute to the care of patients with complex problems in a meaningful way.
