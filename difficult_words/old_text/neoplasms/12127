Non-invasive pharmacological management of patients with cancer related pain has resulted in pain control in 90-95% of the patients. Thus, 5-10% of patients still experience inadequate pain control despite aggressive combined pharmacological therapy. Moreover, patients may not tolerate an aggressive program of titration of medications and fail this approach because of side effects. In these patients interventional techniques have been very useful. This article discusses the alternative therapies, as well as the pitfalls in implementing these therapies, to achieve the highest possible success while minimizing potential complications and side effects.
