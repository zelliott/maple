The most common neoplasias among transplant patients are skin cancers and lymphoproliferative disorders.

To characterize lung transplanted recipients who developed malignancies.

A retrospective analysis of clinical records of our patients.

Seven patients developed malignancies: skin cancer (n = 5; 71%), and adenocarcinomas of prostatic, gastric, and lung (n = 1 each). One patient developed two hematologic malignancies: T-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Among five patients who died (71%), 3 were due to advanced neoplasia. The mean presentation time was 4.3 years. Skin cancers were resected. The patient with lung adenocarcinoma developed pleural involvement and died. The patient with T-cell lymphoma was treated, but succumbed afterward due to multiple myeloma. The patient with gastric adenocarcinoma died at 3 months after the diagnosis, and the patient with prostate cancer underwent surgery without disease recurrence.

Malignancies are a late complication of transplant recipients that require a prompt diagnosis and treatment to improve outcomes.
