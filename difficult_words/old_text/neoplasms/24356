Long waiting times while receiving chemotherapy in an outpatient setting have been identified as contributing to patient dissatisfaction and discomfort by a number of authors. Following an observation of this practice in a non-medical establishment, and as part of our service improvement program, we introduced the use of message pagers to recall patients in our chemotherapy outpatient service. We audited the impact of this intervention by means of questionnaires directed at patients and nursing staff. Our audit found that this intervention was particularly popular with female patients. Perceived benefits included more freedom of movement, less boredom, and peace of mind at being contactable. There were no reported problems with pager operation. Nursing staff were keen promoters of the pagers to patients as they felt that their use gave them more control over work intensity and less disruption from patients enquiring about remaining "waiting time". We concluded that this intervention may benefit other outpatient chemotherapy services.
