The basis of cancer treatment has come a long way since the days of the the classical TNM staging. Identification of novel biomarkers for various cancers and their specific correlations with prognosis have increased our understanding of carcinogenesis and tumour progression on the molecular level. Recent advances in technologies for simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers have opened up new avenues for multimarker profiling on a more individual scale. We summarize the key molecular determinants and their prognostic role in various cancers, and examine the available techniques for analysing biomarker panels that can have a major impact on cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.
