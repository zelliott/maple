O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGAT) is modulated by methylating agents, which, in turn, abrogates nitrosourea resistance in preclinical studies. The feasibility of administering various sequences of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and temozolomide (TEM) in patients with advanced solid neoplasms was evaluated in this Phase I and pharmacological study to assess this premise in the clinical setting. The study also sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) levels of BCNU and TEM as a function of Seq, to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior of TEM administered both before and after BCNU, assess AGAT fluctuations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and seek preliminary evidence of anticancer activity.

Sixty-three patients were randomized to receive treatment with oral TEM daily on days 1-5 and BCNU administered i.v., either on day 1 before TEM [Sequence (Seq) B--&gt;T] or day 5 after TEM (Seq T--&gt;B). Treatment was repeated every 6 weeks. Blood sampling for PK studies was performed on both days 1 and 5 of course one. PBMCs were sampled to evaluate major sequence-dependent effects on AGAT levels.

Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the principal dose-limiting toxicities of the BCNU/TEM regimen. These effects were more prominent in patients receiving Seq T--&gt;B, resulting in a much lower MTD of 80/100 mg/m(2)/day compared with 150/110 mg/m(2)/day for Seq B--&gt;T. Notable antitumor activity was observed in patients with glioblastoma multiforme, sarcoma, and ovarian carcinoma. No sequence-dependent PK effects were noted to account for sequence-dependent toxicological effects. At the MTD level, AGAT activity in PBMCs decreased 3-fold, on average, and AGAT fluctuations did not appear to be sequence-dependent.

The principal toxicities of the BCNU/TEM regimen were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, which were consistent and predictable, albeit sequence-dependent. Seq T--&gt;B was substantially more myelosuppressive, resulting in disparate MTDs and dose levels recommended for subsequent disease-directed evaluations (150/110 and 80/100 mg/m(2)/day for Seq B--&gt;T and T--&gt;B, respectively). Sequence-dependent differences in TEM PK do not account for this clinically relevant magnitude of sequence-dependent toxicity. The characteristics of the myelosuppressive effects of BCNU/TEM, the paucity of severe nonhematological toxicities, and antitumor activity at tolerable doses warrant disease-directed evaluations on this schedule.
