This study uses a systematic literature review to contextualize the risks associated with food additive intake. Studies comparing food additive intake and cancer showed that adverse health effects appeared when Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was exceeded. The review also detected a lack of studies on attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. There were more studies on non-specific hypersensitivity, highlighting such clinical manifestations as rhinitis, urticaria, and angioedema, all associated with food additives, particularly artificial colorants. Children are a vulnerable group as potential consumers of food additives, particularly artificial colorants. Studies on food additive intake should provide the basis for effective food and nutritional surveillance strategies, aiming to promote healthy eating habits.
