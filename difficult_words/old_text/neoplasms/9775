Mortality from cancer in New Zealand children is higher than in most other western countries. This paper reports an analysis of the incidence and survival of all cases of childhood cancer registered in New Zealand from 1961 to 1976. The overall incidence was very similar to that reported by American registries, but higher than in Britain. Survival rates in New Zealand for children with lymphoma and leukaemia were rather poorer than in Britain as a whole, and appreciably worse than in Manchester and in selected regions of the USA. For most other malignancies, survival rates were similar to those in Britain. Survival rates in New Zealand were improving during the period of this study. The possible advantage of centralising treatment was examined by comparing the survival of children treated in the largest centre (Auckland--with 32% of all cases) and in other parts of the country. Children treated in Auckland generally had a longer remission, but experienced no significant advantage in five-year survival. This lack of advantage was not due to referrals from outside the region or to differences in racial composition.
