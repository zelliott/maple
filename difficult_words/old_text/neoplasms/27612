Novel methods used in studying the proliferation activity and cell kinetics of malignant neoplasms such as: the in vivo and in vitro bromodeoxyuridine labeling, the flow cytometric DNS analysis, the immunohistochemical demonstration of the so called proliferation associated antigens and the counting of nucleolar organized regions are briefly introduced. The data obtainable by these methods are reviewed and critically discussed. The prognostic value of the obtained data and their utility in planning and monitoring of cancer patients' therapy are also discussed.
