From the practical experience the possibilities and the areas of application of the tumour chemotherapy and their value in the complex treatment of tumours are described. After representation of the cytostatic drugs available and description of their principal mechanism of action as well as their clinical pharmacology the indications, side-effects and contraindications for the usual cytostatic drugs are described. The possibilities of the application of the tumour chemotherapy in the clinical and out-patient field are particularly entered. Nowadays, by combinations of several cytostatic drugs and additional application of hormones satisfactory results of therapy may be achieved, which were not yet achievable 10 and more years ago. The proportion of tumours, which may be cured by chemotherapy alone, is still insignificant. The pharmacotherapy of tumours is at present put into earlier stages, e.g. into the postoperative phase as an adjuvant treatment. Finally, some practicable schemata of the therapy for solid forms of tumours are given, which are suitable for use in general practice, without putting in a claim for being regarded as therapy standards.
