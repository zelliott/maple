Fifty-one patients who received their first course of chemotherapy were studied to compare the respective efficacy and safety of granisetron and metoclopramide plus dexamethasone in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by emetogenic cytotoxic drugs. The results showed the response rate of antiemesis in the first 24 hours was higher in the metoclopramide plus dexamethasone group than in the granisetron group: 95% vs 84%. For the next six days of the study period, the response rate of the granisetron group was shown to be more effective than that of metoclopramide plus dexamethasone group: 77% vs 60%. Furthermore, the granisetron seemed to display enhanced tolerability with less drug-related side effects and no extrapyramidal effects which appeared in 2 cases of the metoclopramide plus dexamethasone group. In conclusion, a single dose of granisetron can be as effective as the gold standard of metoclopramide plus dexamethasone regimen in preventing and treating acute nausea and vomiting. For preventing delayed nausea and vomiting, granisetron is shown to be more effective than metoclopramide plus dexamethasone.
