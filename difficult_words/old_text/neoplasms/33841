Recognising the value added by economic evaluations of clinical trials and the interaction of clinical, humanistic and economic end points, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has developed an Outcomes Model that guides the comprehensive assessment of this triad of end points. This paper will focus on the economic component of the model. The Economic Impact Committee was founded in 1994 to study the economic impact of clinical trials of cancer care. A steep learning curve ensued with considerable time initially spent understanding the methodology of economic analysis. Since then, economic analyses have been performed on RTOG clinical trials involving treatments for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, locally-advanced head and neck cancer and prostate cancer. As the care of cancer patients evolves with time, so has the economic analyses performed by the Economic Impact Committee. This paper documents the evolution of the cost-effectiveness analyses of RTOG from performing average cost-utility analysis to more technically sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation of Markov models, to incorporating prospective economic analyses as an initial end point. Briefly, results indicated that, accounting for quality-adjusted survival, concurrent chemotherapy and radiation for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, more aggressive radiation fractionation schedules for head and neck cancer and the addition of hormone therapy to radiation for prostate cancer are within the range of economically acceptable recommendations. The RTOG economic analyses have provided information that can further inform clinicians and policy makers of the value added of new or improved treatments.
