We developed a lymphocyte ferritin antibody-binding test (LFABT) to measure lymphocyte surface ferritin (LSF) and used it in cases of malignant and other diseases associated with elevated serum ferritin. LSF was elevated in 33 of 83 patients with a variety of malignant neoplasms in all stages of disease. LSF was also elevated in 2 of 5 patients with infectious mononucleosis, but was normal in all 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, bacterial infections and hemochromatosis. LSF and serum ferritin levels do not correlate. These findings suggest the usefulness of LFABT as a diagnostic tool and demonstrate the biologic significance of LSF.
