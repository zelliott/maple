The cell surface plasminogen activation system functions in promoting tumor dissemination, and is facilitated by a glycolipid anchored three domain receptor for urokinase. This receptor can also be found in a soluble form (suPAR) in extracts of tumors, as well as in plasma from both healthy individuals and cancer patients. The suPAR in plasma consists of the intact three domain protein, but neither the precise mechanism of its release from cell surfaces, nor its biological function are understood. Increased levels of plasma suPAR have been found in patients with cancers of the lung, breast, ovary, and colon, and recent data now indicates that the level of the molecule is related to patient prognosis.
