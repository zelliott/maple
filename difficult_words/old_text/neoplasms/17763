RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing approaches appear very promising for therapies based on the targeted inhibition of disease-relevant genes. The major hurdle to the therapeutic development of RNAi strategies remains, however, the efficient delivery of the RNAi-inducing molecules, the short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), to the target tissue. With respect to cancer treatment the development of efficient delivery methods into solid tumors appears as a critical issue. However, very few studies have addressed this problem. In this study we have investigated the contribution of electrically mediated delivery of siRNA into murine tumors stably expressing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) target reporter gene. The silencing of EGFP gene expression was quantified over time by fluorescence imaging in the living animal. Our study indicates that electric field can be used as an efficient method for siRNA delivery and associated gene silencing into cells of solid tumors in vivo.
