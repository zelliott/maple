Hereditary cancer programs that provide risk assessment, genetic education, and counseling services are becoming increasingly common. This article describes one possible approach to providing comprehensive cancer genetics care by a credentialed genetics advanced practice nurse. In addition to the description of the program, data from a recently conducted time study are included to provide insight into work allocation of different program components. Findings from the study indicate that about 41% of the time is spent in direct clinical time with patients and families, including initial visit counseling, phone consultation, and follow-up visits. The rest of the time is spent in other indirect care activities, including previsit activities, risk calculation, clinical trials enrollment, correspondence, teaching, and administrative duties. For those developing or expanding a cancer genetics program, considering all activities that will occur and the time allocated to each activity is important.
