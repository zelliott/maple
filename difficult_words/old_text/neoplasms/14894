Here, we examined the status of stromal Cav-1 expression in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), primary prostate cancers (PCa), and prostate-cancer metastases (Mets). Interestingly, an absence of stromal Cav-1 directly correlated with prostate cancer disease progression. For example, virtually all BPH samples showed abundant stromal Cav-1 immunostaining. In contrast, in a subset of patients with primary prostate cancer, the stromal levels of Cav-1 were significantly decreased, and this correlated with a high Gleason score, indicative of a worse prognosis and poor clinical outcome. Remarkably, all metastatic tumors (either from lymph node or bone) were completely negative for stromal Cav-1 staining. Thus, stromal Cav-1 expression may be considered as a new biomarker of prostate cancer disease progression and metastasis. Mechanistically, stromal Cav-1 levels were inversely correlated with the epithelial expression levels of Cav-1 and epithelial phospho-Akt. Thus, loss of stromal Cav-1 is predictive of elevated levels of epithelial Cav-1 and epithelial Akt-activation. This provides important new clinical evidence for paracrine signaling between prostate cancer epithelial cells and the tumor stromal micro-environment, especially related to disease progression and metastasis.
