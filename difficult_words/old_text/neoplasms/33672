Clinical research into fast neutron radiation therapy has shown a renewed interest with the advent of the new generation cyclotrons presently being built and already on line in various parts of the country. These units will have neutron beams with better depth dose properties and uniform treatment policy for all facilities. This should ensure that adequate clinical studies are carried out that will define the role of fast neutron radiotherapy in the treatment of cancer.
