Some types of cancer treatment entail a risk of reduced fertility and infertility. Fertility-preserving treatment can reduce the risk for some. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the risk of infertility after treatment of boys and young men with cancer and of fertility-preserving measures.

The article is based on literature searches in the medical databases Medline, Pubmed and Scopus and on the experience of a Nordic medical network collaboration.

Cryopreservation of sperm is an established method for adult cancer patients in Norway. Vibratory stimulation of the penis and electroejaculation with subsequent freezing of sperm may be an option for young cancer patients who cannot manage to produce a semen sample with the aid of masturbation. Freezing of testicular biopsies may be an option for prepubertal boys who are not capable of producing mature sperm.

There are established methods for cryopreservation of sperm for adult cancer patients. The other fertility-preserving measures for boys and young men with cancer are regarded as experimental at present.
