Cancer in Thailand is becoming a significant health problem. It is the leading cause of death in Thailand. Several cancers can be prevented by a nationwide campaign of health education to prevent raw fish intake and an antismoking campaign. An appropriate cervical cancer and breast cancer screening program can improve the recent prevalence of both and lead to better results of treatment. Research related to the carcinogenesis mechanism of certain cancers can lead to greater understanding and a better plan of control.
