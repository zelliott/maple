The aim of this paper is to give an overview of analytical data on the identification of selenium compounds in biological samples with relevance for selenium metabolism. Only studies applying the combination of element-specific inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry as well as molecular electrospray mass spectrometry detection have been included. Hence, selenium compounds are only considered identified if molecular mass spectra obtained by analysis of the authentic biological sample have been provided. Selenium compounds identified in selenium-accumulating plants and yeast are included, as extracts from such plants and yeast have been widely used for examination of the cancer-preventive effect of selenium in cell lines, animal models and human intervention trials. Hence, these selenium compounds are available for absorption and further metabolism. Identification of selenium metabolites in simulated gastric and intestinal juice, intestinal epithelial tissue, liver and urine is described. Hence, selenium metabolites identified in relation to absorption, metabolism and excretion are included.
