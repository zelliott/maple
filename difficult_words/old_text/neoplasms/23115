Operations of the nail apparatus are done under sterile conditions and regional anaesthesia and in local anaemia. The knowledge of the complicated anatomy and physiology is the prerequisite for good surgical results. Nail extractions are commonly done too frequently. Subungual haematomas require a different treatment depending on the severity. Removal of the proximal third of the nail plate quickly clears acute paronychia resistent to antibiotics. The treatment of choice for the ingrown toenail is the surgical narrowing of the matrix. Kind and size of subungual tumours determine their surgical treatment. Diagnostic nail biopsies are best performed laterally.
