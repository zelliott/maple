Overexpression of the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) Receptor gene and the related erbB-2 gene has been identified in human cancers derived from a variety of tissues. The overexpression of the encoded growth factor receptor proteins is functionally related to the development of the tumor. This observation has important potential consequences for the improved diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Overexpression of these proteins also provides experimental systems that facilitate the study of growth factor signal transduction.
