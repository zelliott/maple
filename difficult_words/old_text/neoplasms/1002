Given the important role of parents in ensuring the well-being of their children, their perceived support is crucial for their own, as well as their child's well-being. Perceptions of support were investigated among 214 Swedish parents of 115 children on cancer treatment. Parents answered questions about their satisfaction with their child's care (The Comprehensive Satisfaction with Care, Short Form, Version 4.0 (CASC SF 4.0)) and about their need, opportunity and benefit to talk to health professionals, significant others and other people. Data were collected over telephone at 1 week (T1), 2 (T2) and 4 (T3) months after the child's diagnosis. Parents reported at least moderate satisfaction with all aspects of their child's care, and highest satisfaction with the technical care. Less than half of the parents who reported a need to talk with a psychologist at T1-T3 reported having had the opportunity to do so. The care organization, doctors' interpersonal skills, information provision and availability, nurses' information provision and the availability of psychologists are areas within Swedish paediatric oncology care for which improvement most obviously is needed.
