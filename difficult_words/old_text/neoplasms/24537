The potential preventive effect of the synthetic pineal peptide Epitalon (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly) on spontaneous tumorigenesis in mice was studied. One-year-old female C3H/He mice were kept for 6.5 months under standard conditions. Epitalon was injected at a dose of 0.1 microg, 5 times a week. Long-term exposure to Epitalon in small doses did not show any toxic effect. Treatment with Epitalon decreased the number of tumor-bearing mice with malignant tumors and prevented the development of metastases. Spontaneous tumors of the reproductive organs (mammary glands and ovaries) were predominant in both groups of mice (control and experimental). The mammary gland tumors were different variants of invasive ductal carcinomas. In the ovaries, granulosa-cell tumors were found. Tumors were in the minority in other organs and had benign characteristics. In control mice, metastases were found in 3 out of 9 tumor-bearing mice, all of them being from tumors of the reproductive organs. Treatment with Epitalon slowed down the development of metastases from spontaneous tumors, and no metastases were found in the experimental mice. These data highlight the antimetastatic effect of Epitalon as part of its oncostatic properties.
