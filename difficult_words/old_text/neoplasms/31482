Angiogenesis is the process of new vessel formation from pre-existing vasculature. In preclinical as well as clinical research it has been demonstrated that tumour growth and formation of metastases are angiogenesis dependent. High microvessel density in most tumour types is associated with a bad prognosis. A variety of angiogenic stimuli and inhibitors have been discovered and are expressed in tumours of cancer patients. In addition to specific angiogenic factors, the synthesis and breakdown of the extracellular matrix, the adherence of endothelial cells, the coagulation process and the immune system are important for tumour-induced angiogenesis. Preclinical research has demonstrated that tumour growth can be inhibited by angiogenesis inhibitors. These findings stimulated the development of angiogenesis inhibitors, which are currently under investigation in phase I, phase II and phase III studies for toxicity and efficacy. In the future angiogenesis inhibitors, like insulin therapy in diabetes, may be used to inhibit tumour growth and to induce stabilization of the disease.
