Pain afflicts most cancer patients, mainly in the advanced and metastatic phases of the disease. Despite the existence of several guidelines for cancer pain management that are based on the recommendations by the World Health Organization and the availability of effective treatments for 70% to 90% of cases, undertreatment is well documented and can involve up to 40% of patients. Undertreatment is usually attributed to an incorrect use of opioids for reasons often conceptualized in terms of barriers related to healthcare provider, patient, family, institution, and society. In Italy, opioid consumption rates are among the lowest in Europe despite some of recent efforts to improve the analgesic prescription and utilization. In the context of a wide project coordinated by the Mario Negri Institute, a non-for-profit private foundation located in Milan, Italy, 4 activities were launched: (1) a critical appraisal of information available on the Web, with the preparation and publication of a meta-site to facilitate the use of selected resources; (2) an evaluation of prescriptions of analgesic drugs in a cohort of cancer patients using a large administrative database; (3) a nationwide outcome research study to assess the epidemiology, quality, and effectiveness of different analgesic strategies; and (4) a multimodal, community-based intervention based on information, education, and training programs to change the knowledge, opinions, and attitude toward cancer pain treatment. Activities started in 2005. Some results and outputs are already available; others will be ready by the end of 2007.
