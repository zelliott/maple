The objective of this study was to investigate whether functional CT with Patlak analysis could be used to demonstrate acute changes associated with radiotherapy. Patlak analysis yields fractional vascular volume and contrast clearance per unit volume (a measure of permeability). Four tumour types (prostate, bronchus, breast and cervix) were studied pre-radiotherapy and at 1-2 weeks and 6-12 weeks post-therapy. Significant rises in fractional vascular volume and contrast clearance were shown at 1-2 weeks. These indices were still significantly elevated at 6-12 weeks post-therapy. In the prostates perfusion values were also elevated reflecting a hyperemic response to radiotherapy. Dynamic CT with Patlak analysis can be used to measure important pathophysiological indices which may prove useful in assessing response to therapy of tumours.
