Tetraspanins are a family of small proteins that cross the membrane four times and form complexes by interacting between themselves and with a variety of transmembrane and cytosolic proteins, building a network of interactions referred to as tetraspanin web or tetraspanin enriched microdomains (TEMs). These domains provide a signaling platform involved in many important cellular functions and malignant processes.

The authors describe the methods and the rationale for targeting tetraspanins in the therapy of cancer in this review.

Targeting tetraspanins in cancer may be a promising therapy due to the importance of tetraspanins in several steps of tumor formation, communication with the environment, dissemination, and metastasis.
