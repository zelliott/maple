Since 1979 epidemiological studies have been published that suggest that residential exposure to electromagnetic fields generated mainly near power lines could increase the risk of childhood cancer such as leukemia and neurological tissue tumor. However, methodological shortcomings of the studies are such that the evidence is not strong enough to allow conclusions to be drawn. Similar studies have also been published for adults. Except for cases of occupational exposure the findings do not show that residential electromagnetic field exposure is a risk factor. However, information is too sparse to permit firm conclusions. The existing literature strongly indicate further researchers in the area should be pursued.
