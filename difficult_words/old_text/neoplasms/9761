Ninety patients with solid tumors or lymphomas were immunized with a polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. Pre- and postimmunization antibody titers were determined by radioimmunoassay. Treated patients with lymphoma had poor antibody response whether on or off chemotherapy. Patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia had the lowest antibody titers of all patients groups. Patients with solid tumors had antibody responses which were similar to those of the control population. Those patients who received sequential chemotherapy and immunization had a tendency for higher postimmunization titers than those patients who received simultaneous chemotherapy and immunization, but the difference was not significant. This study suggests that patients with solid tumors would be expected to benefit from pneumococcal immunization, whereas patients with lymphoma immunized after receiving treatment initially would not be expected to develop protective antibody levels. Recovery of antibody formation in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which may occur in patients with Hodgkin disease, remains to be determined.
