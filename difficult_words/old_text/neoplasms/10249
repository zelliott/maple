To evaluate the distribution of symptoms related to Yin deficiency syndrome (YDS), and to analyze the relationship between the severity of YDS and the function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in cancer patients.

Outpatient clinic in a teaching hospital in central Taiwan.

Eighty (80) patients had been diagnosed with cancer by pathologic and clinical findings.

The severity of YDS in each subject was evaluated by a questionnaire consisting of 12 items concerning symptoms and signs related to YDS, scored from 1 to 4 points.

The total score for all 12 items represented the severity of YDS. ANS function in each subject was evaluated by measuring heart rate variability (HRV), including time-frequency analysis. We coded the collected questionnaire material and performed statistical analysis (description analysis, ANOVA, and Pearson's correlation coefficients) using SPSS v.12.0 software.

The highest total YDS score was 36 points and the lowest was 10 points. The 3 most common YDS signs were dry mouth (58.8%), sleeplessness with annoyance (56.3%), and flush over face in the afternoon (22.5%). The total YDS scores had a significantly positive correlation with heart rate (HR), but had significantly negative correlation with the standard deviation of the 5-minute mean R-R intervals (SDANN), total HRV power, power in the very low frequency band, and in the low frequency band.

The above results suggest that the severity of YDS in cancer patients was associated with increased HR and decreased ANS activity. There is a possibility that the disturbance of ANS function may contribute to the occurrence of YDS in cancer patients.
