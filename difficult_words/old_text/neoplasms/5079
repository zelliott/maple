To examine the determinants of physical activity (PA) in young adult cancer survivors (YACS).

A survey of 588 YACS in Alberta, Canada, assessed PA, medical and demographical factors, and theory of planned behavior variables.

Path analysis  explained 38% (P&lt;.001) of the variance in PA with significant contributions from intention, planning, affective attitude, education, and general health. In turn, 56% (P&lt;.001) of the variance in intention was explained by perceived behavioral control, instrumental attitude, and affective  attitude.

PA interventions in YACS should focus on developing strong intentions by targeting perceived behavioral control, instrumental attitude, and affective attitude.
