St. Paul's Hospital Palliative Care Unit is a 15-bed integrated AIDS and non-AIDS unit that has been open since 1989. A respite program has also been operating since 1989. Overall admissions to the unit have comprised approximately one-third AIDS patients and two-thirds non-AIDS patients. However, the respite patients have consisted of about two-thirds AIDS patients and one-third non-AIDS patients. The 53 patients in the first three years of the respite program have generated 96 respite admissions and 37 non-respite admissions. In the course of developing this program a number of questions and issues have arisen relating to goals and objectives of the respite program, perceptions of the patient and caregivers, and the effectiveness of the program. A review of the utilization patterns of this program and a discussion of selected case histories will be instructional for those who are considering developing their own respite programs.
