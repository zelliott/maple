Although cell death once was viewed exclusively as the disordered, chaotic outcome of metabolic catastrophe, apoptosis now is recognized as a highly ordered, evolutionarily conserved, and genetically selected program that is essential for normal development. The death receptor pathway of apoptosis, cytotoxic T cells, prolife survival signals, Bcl-2 family of regulators, p53 and regulated cell death in cancer, and oncogenes are reviewed. Future prospects in this arena also are discussed.
