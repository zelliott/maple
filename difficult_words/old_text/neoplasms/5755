Subungual melanoma is rare and experience in treating this condition with isolated limb perfusion is limited. Between 1985 and 1990, 24 patients were treated by digital amputation and isolated limb perfusion with melphalan and mild hyperthermia. The disease was staged according to the M.D. Anderson classification: stage I (17 patients), stage IIIA (one), stage IIIB (two) and stage IIIAB (four). Thirteen lesions were on the foot and 11 on the hand. Seven patients have developed locoregional recurrence. The estimated overall 2- and 5-year probabilities of survival were 77 and 46 per cent respectively, while for disease-free survival the rates were 58 and 51 per cent. When these results were compared retrospectively with those in 111 patients treated by amputation alone, no significant difference in survival was demonstrated. This experience suggests that isolated limb perfusion with melphalan and mild hyperthermia confers no additional survival benefit over appropriate surgery.
