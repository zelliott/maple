The prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women with cancer requires special consideration. The presence of cancer results in both non-surgical and surgical patients having increased risk of VTE. This usually leads to a modification of the recommended preventive therapy, affecting the type, dose and length of therapy. Cancer patients have other factors which may predispose them to bleeding. Prevention of VTE in cancer patients is important in a number of settings and has been investigated in many of these. These can be broadly classified into three areas: (1) Non-surgical patients in hospital and outpatient care: (1.1) Acutely ill medical patients with incidental cancer or with complications related to cancer; (1.2) Cancer patients receiving therapy--chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy. (2) Surgical care: (2.1) Surgical procedures for cancer therapy; (2.2) Surgical procedures for non-cancer indications in cancer patients. (3) Long-term prevention of VTE in otherwise well outpatients with cancer and its effect on mortality.
