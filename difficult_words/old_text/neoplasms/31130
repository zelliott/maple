Antiphospholipid-protein antibodies (APA) are a family of immunoglobulins which recognize protein-phospholipid complexes. Among the proteins implicated are: beta 2 Glycoprotein I, prothrombin, Annexin V, protein C, and protein S. Laboratory tests are used to identify, predict potential clinical complications, and manage patients with the antiphospholipid-protein syndrome (APS). Emerging evidence suggests laboratory tests can be used to stratify relative risk of patients with APA.
