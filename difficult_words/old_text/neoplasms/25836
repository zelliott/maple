The term circumscribed storiform collagenoma was coined by Maize et al in 1989 to describe four dermal fibromas with pathologic features resembling the sclerotic fibromas associated with Cowden's disease. We report a subungual nodule with the pathologic features of circumscribed storiform collagenoma in a patient without Cowden's disease.
