More than one half of all cancers in developed countries occur in patients aged 70 years and older. Therefore, in recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating a comprehensive geriatric assessment into the management of these patients with cancer. This review article emphasizes the data gathered so far on the correlation between such an assessment and outcome in patients with cancer. The most developed data relate to functional status and comorbidity. Geriatric instruments appear more sensitive than classic oncological instruments in measuring functional status. There is also good evidence that as a patient's age advances, comorbidity affects in an increasing fashion their survival and cancer management. Some evidence is beginning to appear as to the impact a comprehensive geriatric assessment could have on the oncologic management of older patients with cancer.
