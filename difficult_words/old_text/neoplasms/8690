Plasminogen activator (PA) is a specific serine protease which catalyses conversion of the inactive plasminogen into the broad-spectrum protease, plasmin. PA exists in two structurally related forms known as tissue-type PA (tPA) and urokinase-type PA (uPA). Conversion of normal cells into a malignant state frequently leads to increased production of uPA. There is increasing evidence that uPA is directly involved in the process of metastasis. High levels of uPA in human breast cancers is a marker for poor prognosis. Finally, uPA may be a target for anti-metastatic agents, either by inhibition of its synthesis, inhibition of its activity or its binding to receptor.
