The aim of the primary research was to investigate the impact of the nurse-patient relationship on clinical learning and subsequently clinical practice. Coincidently, 32 participants, all Registered Nurses in Hong Kong, provided details of nurse-patient encounters involving withholding of a cancer diagnosis.

The changing face of clinical practice and cancer care has fuelled discussion and debate around disclosure or non-disclosure of the diagnosis of cancer, global consensus on this issue still does not exist. In different countries there is marked variation in how and what a patient may be told about their diagnosis and prognosis. There is considerable variability in the reported rate of cancer diagnosis disclosure across studies and countries. Being asked not to tell a patient their diagnosis of cancer presents many problems for nurses caring for those patients. The issue of non-disclosure directly affects nurses and their clinical practice.

This paper reports one of the findings of a large international qualitative study informed by phenomenology into the perceptions of nurses about caring for a patient with a diagnosis of cancer.

Responses from participants revealed considerable difficulties for nurses when caring for patients who were not informed of their diagnosis. They recounted having learned from the encounters but remarked on the negativity of the experience. They discussed their inability to act decisively in the past situations but expressed hope that they had found a resolve to act in future.

Although, overwhelmingly, participants doubted they would actually be able to change the reality of practice. The identified care episode and the nurse-patient relationship, according to participants, did change their clinical practice but often not for the better.
