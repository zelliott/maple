4'-Epiadriamycin demonstrated considerable efficacies in lymphomas, breast cancer and soft part sarcomas with reduced gastrointestinal, hematologic and probably cardiac toxicities. Mitoxantrone appears to be established the clinical role in lymphomas, acute leukemia and breast cancer with mild clinical toxicities. A new analogous compound of cisplatinum CBDCA concluded phase I study and the dose limiting factor was thrombocytopenia. It is of interest that the drug had responders in ovarian cancer during phase I study. The results reported in new anthracyclines; marcellomycin, carminomycin and 4-demethoxydaunorubicin, anthraquinones; ametantrone and bisantrene, new cisplatinums; CHIP, DACCP and TNO-6, and various other drugs including mAMSA, 5'-DFUR, spirogermanium, VP-16-213 and AZQ were reviewed.
