In recent years, the biological importance of cell-derived microparticles has emerged. However, even without standard protocols for their analysis, the role of microparticles in hemostasis and thrombosis is evident, particularly in cancer patients.

When found in the blood in high numbers, microparticles are prothrombotic. In this brief review, we present recent insights into the mechanisms by which microparticles modulate hemostasis and increase the risk of thrombosis, in particular with regard to their role in cancer-associated thrombosis. We also review mechanisms of microparticle generation and clearance.

Standardization of the definition and methods of analysis of cell-derived microparticles will help to elucidate the precise mechanisms of their generation, clearance, and other biological roles, including their role in thrombosis. These insights will be useful for the designing of therapeutic interventions.
