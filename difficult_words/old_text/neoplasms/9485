Altered gene expression resulting from changes in the post-translational modification patterns of the histones and DNA is collectively termed epigenetics. Such changes are inherited albeit there are no alterations in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is implemented by a wide repertoire of histone and DNA modifying enzymes including the acetyltransferases and deacetylases, the methyltransferases and kinases among others. Therefore, a regulation of these enzyme activities affords a tighter regulation of gene expression. Conversely, aberrant enzymatic activities lead to unregulated gene expression, resulting in several diseases such as RTS (loss of CBP HAT activity) and Spinal and Bulbar muscular atrophy (HATs and HMTases), apart from several forms of cancers, particularly myeloid leukemia (RAR-PML or RAR-PLZF fusion proteins resulting in the mistargeting of HDACs). Thus these enzymes have emerged as novel targets for the design of therapeutics. In this direction, several small molecule modulators (activators and inhibitors) of HATs, HDACs and HMTases are being reported in literature. This chapter introduces the different histone modifying enzymes involved in gene regulation, their connection to disease manifestation and focuses on the role of small molecule modulators in understanding enzyme function and also the design and the evolution of chromatin therapeutics
