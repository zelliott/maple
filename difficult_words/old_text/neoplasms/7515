Rates of phosphatidate synthesis from dihydroxyacetone phosphate via acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate or glycerol phosphate are compared in homogenates of 13 tissues, most of which are deficient in glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8). In all tissues examined, dihydroxyacetone phosphate entered phosphatidate more rapidly via acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate than via glycerol phosphate. Tissues with a relatively low rate of phosphatidate synthesis via glycerol phosphate, showed no compensating increase in the rate of synthesis via acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The rates at which tissue homogenates synthesize phosphatidate from dihydroxyacetone phosphate via glycerol phosphate increase as glycerol phosphate dehydrongenase increase. Both glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol phosphate: acyl CoA acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15) are more active than dihydroxyacetone phosphate : acyl CoA acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.42). Thus, all the tissue homogenates possessed an apparently greater capability to synthesize phosphatidate via glycerol phosphate than via acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate, but did not express this potential. This result is discussed in relation to in vivo substrate limitations.
