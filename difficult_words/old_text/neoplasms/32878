A total of 62 patients with advanced tumours have now been treated by a fractionated course of radiotherapy, with misonidazole. The prime purpose of the administration of the drug to these patients was to determine safe dosage and suitable regimes for use in clinical radiotherapy. The reaction of normal tissues did not seem enhanced but there was an impression of increased tumour response.
