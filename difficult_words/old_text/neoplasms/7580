Gallium (67Ga) citrate is a scanning agent that has been shown to have a differential uptake in a variety of malignancies. Investigation of the usefulness of 67Ga scanning patients with proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region is now in progress. These patients have a 67Ga total body scan as part of the pre-treatment evaluation. The accuracy of the procedure is then judged by correlation with clinical and surgical findings. The results in 25 patients show that a clearly positive uptake occurs in 60 percent in the region of the primary. Uptake in metastatic disease in lymph nodes is much less, occurring in 6 of 18 sides of the neck. In one case, where clinical examination was considered to be negative, the gallium scan was positive and subsequently proven to be correct by histological examination of the surgical specimen. The various difficulties encountered in interpreting gallium scans in the head and neck region are described. It is felt that by improved patient selection and special techniques the yield of positive cases can be improved and unsuspected extension of malignancy demonstrated.
