Molecular imaging allows for the visualization and quantification biologic processes at cellular levels. This article focuses on positron emission tomography as one readily available tool for clinical molecular imaging. To prove its clinical utility in oncology, molecular imaging will ultimately have to provide valuable information in the following 4 pertinent areas: staging; assessment of extent of disease; target delineation for radiation therapy planning; response prediction and assessment and differentiation between treatment sequelae and recurrent disease. These issues are addressed in other contributions in this issue of Seminars in Nuclear Medicine. In contrast, this article will focus on the biochemical principles of cancer metabolism that provide the rationale for positron emission tomography imaging in radiation oncology.
