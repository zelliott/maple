This article summarizes the various current uses of cytokines, and bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for cancer treatment. Interferons, interleukin-2 and hematopoietic growth factors are extensively used for the treatment of hematopoietic as well as nonhematopoietic malignancies, either as the main therapeutic agents or as an adjuvant. Research on gene therapy using cytokines is in progress. Stem cell transplantation is also discussed in the context of gene therapy of cancer. Gene therapy is expected to become a future modality in cancer treatment.
