During the years from 1989-92, 18 patients, at their own wish and the wishes of their family were transferred from the Department of Oncology at the University Hospital of Tromsø, to their homes for terminal care. There were nine women and nine men, all from the city of Tromsø. Their age varied from 28-82 years. The most frequent disease was colorectal carcinoma, and the most frequent occupations were housewife and office worker. Women and patients with adult children remained at home for a longer period of time than the others. Six patients lived at home for more than one month. The care was most often provided by the spouse.
