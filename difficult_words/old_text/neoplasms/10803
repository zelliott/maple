The literature regarding the nature and the frequency of screening tests that every woman should undergo in order to maintain her health is scant and non-systematic. The purpose of the present review is to systematically advise the community physician about the essential screening tests that are required to maintain woman's health. This review does not refer to screening test that should be performed during pregnancy due to the unique nature of such screening tests.
