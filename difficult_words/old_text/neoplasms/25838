The identification of different mechanisms by which tumours escape from the immune system has helped to evaluate the clinical relevance of a variety of phenotypic changes that occur during tumour development. Among them, changes in HLA class I expression play a leading role in the tumour-host environment since HLA class I molecules interact with T lymphocytes for antigen presentation and with NK cells for inhibition/activation of these immune effector cells. Our laboratory has proposed a classification of the altered HLA class I phenotypes frequently found in human tumours, into five major groups. This review focuses on the tumour phenotypes found in primary and metastatic lesions, the molecular mechanisms that give rise to each phenotype and the clinical implications of these findings.
