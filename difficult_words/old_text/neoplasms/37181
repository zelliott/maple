We previously reported on a paradoxical oxidant-antioxidant status in breast cancer patients, more so in pre-menopausal than menopausal women. In this study, measurements were performed on 146 patients with various carcinomas. Vitamin E/total cholesterol increased and plasma malondialdehyde decreased with tumor size and progression. To investigate the difference between young pre-menopausal and aged menopausal breast cancer patients, the same measurements were performed in 365 breast cancer patients according to pathology, tumor size and estrogen receptors. The oxidant-antioxidant status varied with these prognosis factors in the same pattern, and was more pronounced in young than aged women.
