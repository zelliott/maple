A survey was conducted among Hausa and Fulani, two major tribes of Northern Nigeria to identify plants and methods used traditionally in the treatment of cancers and inflammatory diseases. The ecological zones that were considered include Zaria, Kaduna and Kano in the Northern part of Nigeria. The survey involves traditional healers, hunters, farmers and Fulani nomads. This survey has identified plants useful in the treatment of cancers. The plants were identified via taxonomic means and classified according to their habitats, families, genera. Evidently the plants span families and genera, the knowledge and values of the plants was evaluated with the aim of understanding the scientific basis for the use of the plants. The inventory provides the unique opportunity of capturing plants of common uses across the communities.
