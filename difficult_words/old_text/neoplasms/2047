The possibilities of hyperthermia are discussed from the engineering technology standpoint. Microwave equipment yields powerful effects against a superficial tumor. RF capacitive method and annular phased array system (APAS) are typical heating methods against a deep-seated tumor. We have proposed that in the RF capacitive method the diameter of the applicator electrode should be more than 1.5 times the distance between two electrodes. In APAS another exciting method (TE mode) has been proposed. Electric current flows through the short axis of the body by the TE mode excitation. We are developing re-entrant resonant cavity applicators which have the characteristics to heat cylindrical regions of small diameter. We can install an x-ray tube inside the re-entrant electrode. This method is suitable for deep and concentrated heating. We conclude that the recent rapid development of various kinds of hyperthermia apparatus makes it possible to heat more safely and effectively the deep-seated regions of the human body.
