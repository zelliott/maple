Malignant cells are known to enhance glucose metabolism, to increase glucose uptake and to inhibit the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Accelerated glycolysis is one of the biochemical characteristics of cancer cells that allow them to compensate the inefficient extraction of energy from glucose in order to continue their uncontrolled growth and proliferation. Upregulation of glucose transport across the plasma membrane is mediated by a family of facilitated glucose transporter proteins named GLUT. Overexpression of GLUTs, especially the hypoxia-responsive GLUT1, has been frequently observed in various human carcinomas. Many studies have reported a correlation between GLUT1 expression level and the grade of tumor aggressiveness, which suggests that GLUT1 expression may be of prognostic significance. Therefore, GLUT1 is a key rate-limiting factor in the transport and glucose metabolism in cancer cells. This paper presents the current state of knowledge on GLUT1 regulation as well as its utility in the diagnosis and therapy of cancers.
