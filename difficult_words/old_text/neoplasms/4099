The admission of neutropenic patients to an intensive care unit (ICU) is still controversial, especially if mechanical ventilation is required. To avoid useless stays in ICU, the evaluation of the respective role of the underlying malignancy and acute organ failures might be useful for better definition of the categories of patients who could benefit from aggressive ICU support. For this purpose, we carried out a retrospective study of the charts of 107 consecutive neutropenic patients admitted to an ICU in a comprehensive cancer centre over a four-year period. The following characteristics were recorded within 24 h of admission: patient data, characteristics of neutropenia and the underlying malignancy, the type and number of organ system failures (OSFs) and simplified acute physiological scores (SAPS and SAPS II). The impact of each variable on outcome in the ICU was studied by univariate and multivariate (logistic regression) analysis. 59 patients died in the ICU (mortality rate: 55%). Patients with a haematological malignancy (n = 57, 53%) were more likely to experience respiratory failure, an underlying malignancy deemed rapidly fatal, and to have longer lasting neutropenia than patients with a solid tumour (n = 50, 47%). However, the mortality rate did not differ in the two groups (haematological malignancy 61% versus solid tumour 48%, p = 0.16). Respiratory and cardiovascular organ failure (p &lt; 0.001 for both) correlated with mortality in the ICU. In the multiple logistic regression model, only the number of organ system failures and respiratory failure remained predictive of ICU mortality. In conclusion, the characteristics of the underlying malignancy are not relevant when deciding whether or not neutropenic patients should be admitted to an ICU. The main risk factors for death in an ICU are the number of organ failures on admission, and among them the presence of respiratory failure.
