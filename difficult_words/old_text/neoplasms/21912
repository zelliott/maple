We reviewed demographic data, risk factors, treatment, and outcomes associated with Rhodotorula fungemia in a tertiary care hospital during 2002-2005. Rhodotorula species caused fungemic episodes in 7 patients during the 4-year period that we studied. The most common predisposing factors were patients with hematological and solid malignancy receiving corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs, the presence of central venous catheters, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Because of Rhodotorula species's intrinsic resistance to triazole and echinocandin antifungal agents, patients receiving fluconazole and caspofungin might be susceptible to the development of breakthrough Rhodotorula fungemia.
