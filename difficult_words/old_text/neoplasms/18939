Recently, pneumatosis intestinalis has been described in patients receiving bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to VEGF-A. Pneumatosis intestinalis is a condition characterized by subserosal and submucosal gas-filled cysts in the gastrointestinal tract. We report on pneumatosis intestinalis in patients receiving oral anti-VEGF agents. Patients shared the following characteristics: long-term (&gt; 4 months) exposure to anti-VEGF agents, lack of other factors predisposing to pneumatosis intestinalis, and lack of recent surgical intervention. Taken together, these observations suggest that pneumatosis intestinalis is a probable class-effect of anti-VEGF agents.
