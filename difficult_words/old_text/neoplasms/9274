CTIP2 is a key transcriptional regulator involved in numerous physiological functions. Initial works have shown the importance of CTIP2 in the establishment and persistence of HIV latency in microglial cells, the main latent/quiescent viral reservoir in the brain. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of CTIP2 in several other pathologies, such as cardiac hypertrophy and various types of human malignancies. Targeting CTIP2 may therefore constitute a new approach in the treatment of these pathologies.
