Haematopoietic growth factors are glycosylated proteins involved in the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into committed progenitor cells, which eventually give rise to distinct haematopoietic cell lineages. Three recombinant hematopoietic growth factors--G-CSF, GM-CSF and erythropoietin--are currently commercially available for clinical use. G-CSF and GM-CSF are lineage-specific growth factor that regulate the production and function of granulocytic and monocytic cells. They have been shown to reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia. Primary prophylactic administration is reserved for patients in which the expected incidence of febrile neutropenia is greater than 40% without haematopoietic growth factor. After a documented occurrence of febrile neutropenia in an earlier cycle, the secondary prophylactic administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF may be considered. However, in the absence of clinical data supporting maintenance of chemotherapy dose-intensity, dose reduction should be considered as an alternative to the use of haematopoietic growth factors. G-CSF and GM-CSF also shorten the period of neutropenia in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow support. Erythropoietin is currently approved for treatment of anemia associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy with the aim to reduce transfusion requirements.
