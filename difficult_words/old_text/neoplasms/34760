Most scientists agree that the majority of human solid malignant tumors are characterized by chromosomal instability (CIN) involving gain or loss of whole chromosomes or fractions of chromosomes. CIN is thought to be an early event during tumorigenesis and might therefore be involved in tumor initiation. Despite its frequent occurrence in tumors and its potential importance in tumor evolution, CIN is poorly defined and is used inconsistently and imprecisely. Here, we provide criteria to define CIN and argue that few experimental approaches are capable of assessing the presence of CIN. Accurate assessment of CIN is crucial to elucidate whether CIN is a driving force for tumorigenesis and whether a chromosomally unstable genome is necessary for tumor progression.
