The revolutionary changes in computer capabilities in the last decade, both in software and hardware, have opened new doorways for the uses of computers in radiation oncology and diagnostic radiology. Knowledge-based systems offer the potential to function as aids, consultants and advisors in the differential diagnosis of disease, staging, selection of therapy and treatment management and delivery for cancer patients. These computer-based systems can also provide for the training and teaching of radiotherapy and diagnostic radiology residents, and act as advisors and teachers to the medical physicists, dosimetrists and technicians. Following a brief history of the development of knowledge-based systems, the general capabilities of computer-based physician workstations in a department of radiation oncology are described.
