This article reflects three nurses' views of the moral dimensions of their work in caring for patients receiving phases I and II of cancer clinical trials in a dedicated cancer clinical trials unit (CCTU). The nurses took part in a semistructured, tape-recorded, group interview in which they talked about any aspect of their work that they felt demonstrated its ethical or moral dimensions. The nurses were not employed as research nurses, but had chosen to specialize in cancer and palliative care in a CCTU environment. Three key themes emerged from the interview: being valued and moral distress; caring in a climate of scientific research; and care, cure, and consequences for moral reasoning. Working in an environment suffused with moral conflicts can be painful and damaging for the professionals involved. It would appear that if nurses are to function effectively, they need to be proactive in promoting an exploration of the role that emotions play in moral decision making and in examining the contribution of emotions to what they care about and why. A commitment to a shared understanding and valuing of divergent ethical reasoning in and across professional cultures of care and research paradigms also appears to be necessary. The terms "ethics" and "morals" are used interchangeably throughout this article.
