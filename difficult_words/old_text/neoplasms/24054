This study explores the changing characteristics of patients admitted to Sir Michael Sobell House, Oxford, between 1978-89. These dates represent the period between the first available records and the first computerized records. Analysis is between these dates and has been undertaken to enable future comparison between the early life of the unit with more recent developments. Using secondary sources the following areas were compared statistically: information related to general characteristics such as sex and age; information related to referral such as the number of referrals; diagnosis on referral and reasons for referral; information related to problems presented and place of death. Significant findings included an increase in referrals and patient survival; an increase in patients dying at home; a decrease in symptoms presented on referral and fewer referrals for terminal care; and an increase in referral for rehabilitation, assessment and support. Reasons for these changes are suggested.
