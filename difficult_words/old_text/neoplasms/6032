PM00104 binds guanines at DNA minor grooves, impacting DNA replication and transcription. A phase I study was undertaken to investigate safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics (PKs) and preliminary antitumour activity of PM00104 as a 1- or 3-h infusion three-weekly.

Patients with advanced solid tumours received PM00104 in a dose escalation trial, as guided by toxicity and PK data.

A total of 47 patients were treated; 27 patients on the 1-h schedule (0.23-3.6 mg m(-2)) and 20 patients on the 3-h schedule (1.8-3.5 mg m(-2)). Dose-limiting toxicities comprised reversible nausea, vomiting, fatigue, elevated transaminases and thrombocytopenia, establishing the 1-h schedule RP2D at 3.0 mg m(-2). With the 3-h schedule, DLTs of reversible hypotension and neutropenia established the RP2D at 2.8 mg m(-2). Common PM00104-related adverse events at the RP2D comprised grade 1-2 nausea, fatigue and myelosuppression. In both schedules, PKs increased linearly, but doses over the 1-h schedule RP2D resulted in higher than proportional increases in exposure. A patient with advanced urothelial carcinoma had RECIST shrinkage by 49%, and three patients had RECIST stable disease â‰¥6 months.

PM00104 is well tolerated, with preliminary evidence of antitumour activity observed. The 1-h 3-weekly schedule is being assessed in phase II clinical trials.
