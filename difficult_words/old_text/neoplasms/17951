PIN1 is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that can alter the conformation of phosphoproteins and so affect protein function and/or stability. PIN1 regulates a number of proteins important for cell-cycle progression and, based on gain- and loss-of-function studies, is presumed to operate as a molecular timer of this important process. Therefore, it seems logical that alterations in the level of PIN1 can influence hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer. However, the precise role of PIN1 in cancer remains controversial.
