A case of chronic hypervitaminosis A in a 51-year-old female is discussed. The patient was ingesting 27,500--35,000 international units of vitamin A daily for 30 years. The patient displayed the classic symptoms of the disease, including skin and hair changes, esophageal varices and extensive liver disease. Vitamin A products were discontinued and the patient's dietary intake of the vitamin was minimized. Previous reports and studies of hypervitaminosis A are reviewed. Social factors causing increased consumption of vitamin A and regulations governing the sale of vitamin A are discussed. By being aware of the factors influencing vitamin A consumption, hypervitaminosis A can be detected and prevented more readily.
