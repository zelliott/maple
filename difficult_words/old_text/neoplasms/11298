Factors that mediate p53 tumor suppressor activity remain largely unknown. In this study we describe a systematic approach to identify downstream mediators of tumor suppressor function of p53, consisting of global gene expression profiling, focused short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library creation, and functional selection of genetic elements cooperating with oncogenic Ras in cell transformation. This approach is based on our finding that repression of gene expression is a major event, occurring in response to p53 inactivation during transformation and immortalization of primary cells. Functional analysis of the subset of genes universally down-regulated in the cells that lacked functional p53 revealed BTG2 as a major downstream effector of p53-dependent proliferation arrest of mouse and human fibroblasts transduced with oncogenic Ras. shRNA-mediated knockdown of BTG2 cooperates with oncogenic Ras to transform primary mouse fibroblasts containing wild-type transcriptionally active p53. Repression of BTG2 results in up-regulation of cyclins D1 and E1 and phosphorylation of Rb and, in cooperation with other oncogenic elements, induces neoplastic transformation of primary human fibroblasts. BTG2 expression was found to be significantly reduced in a large proportion of human kidney and breast carcinomas, suggesting that BTG2 is a tumor suppressor that links p53 and Rb pathways in human tumorigenesis.
