Long lasting occupational exposure to asbestos dust may cause skin corns, benign pleural effusion, hyaline plaques of the parietal pleura, diffuse thickening of the pulmonary pleura, and asbestosis, i.e. diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Malignant disorders include lung cancer and mesothelioma of the pleura, peritoneum and pericardium. In general, many years elapse from first exposure to the appearance of symptoms. Almost all these diseases are the result of dusty working conditions more than 20 years ago. In spite of the fact that the general public is invariably exposed to small amounts of the material, asbestos is not a public health problem. Even living in a building containing sprayed asbestos is calculated to produce a lifetime risk of death which is negligible. There is no evidence to indicate that ingested asbestos fibres represent a major health problem.
