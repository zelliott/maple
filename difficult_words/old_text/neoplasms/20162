Recombinant purified human haemopoietic growth factors are available for clinical trials and some have been licensed for therapeutic use. Some haemopoietic lineages (erythroid, neutrophilic, monocyte-macrophagic) can be selectively stimulated in order to ameliorate the cytopenias that follow cytotoxic treatment, or that characterize some haematological syndromes, and to stimulate mature cell function. Advances in the knowledge of receptor-ligand interactions and of transduction mechanisms, plus the production of synthetic or mutant molecules that may mimic, potentiate or antagonize the effects of the natural growth factors, should make novel therapeutic approaches possible.
