A significant motivation behind the development of integrated cancer care facilities such as The Chris O'Brien Lifehouse in Sydney or Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne is to improve the continuity of care that cancer patients receive. In developing new services it is important that the opinions of consumers are considered regarding the emphasis and importance that they place on the continuity of their own care. This paper reviews the literature pertaining to continuity of care in cancer treatment, with focus on consumer opinion pieces, and discusses how this may inform the planning of services. The literature is supplemented with qualitative data derived from original interviews with consumers and health-care professionals involved in cancer care in New South Wales and Victoria.
