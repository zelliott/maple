A proportionate mortality ratio (PMR) analysis of all deaths recorded from 1975 to 1985 among New Hampshire white male residents (age 20 years or older) was performed using death certificate information. Among automobile mechanics, the analysis revealed increases in mortality from leukemia (PMR = 178, N = 6); cancers of the oral cavity (PMR = 163, N = 4), lung (PMR = 112, N = 36), bladder (PMR = 169, N = 5), rectum (PMR = 182, N = 4), and lymphatic tissues (PMR = 200, N = 6); and cirrhosis of the liver (PMR = 140, N = 13) and suicide (PMR = 177, N = 22; p less than 0.05). Workers in the gasoline service station industry experienced a leukemia mortality excess (PMR = 328, N = 3; p less than 0.05) as well as increases in deaths from suicide (PMR = 162, N = 4), emphysema (PMR = 245, N = 4), and mental and psychoneurotic conditions (PMR = 394, N = 3). These workers are potentially exposed to a variety of substances including gasoline vapor, benzene, solvents, lubricating oils and greases, and asbestos (from brake and clutch repair) as well as welding fumes and car and truck exhaust. Despite limitations regarding the small number of deaths and methodologic constraints, the results of this analysis suggest that one or more of the exposures experienced by these workers poses a significant carcinogenic risk. More definitive epidemiologic studies are required to determine if the leukemia excess is associated with exposure to benzene, gasoline, or other workplace substances.
