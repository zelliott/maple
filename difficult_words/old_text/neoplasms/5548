The 1997 Fourth Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections explored the benefits of newer combination therapies and their effect on HIV in lymphoid tissues, HIV-related drug interactions, HIV therapies that are in the pipeline, chemokine research, and recent insights into HIV/AIDS pathogenesis. Highlights within each of these topics are presented, including discussions on clinical care, treatments for opportunistic infections, cancers, and other conditions, HIV transmission, HIV treatment in infants and children; and a worldwide and United States epidemiological update.
