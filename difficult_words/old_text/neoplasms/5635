To examine the interpersonal relationships, self-image, healthcare interactions, and occupational concerns of rural men and women experiencing cancer directly or as a caregiver of a person with cancer.

A descriptive design employing a mail survey as part of a larger, longitudinal study.

Rural areas in the northern Rocky Mountain region of the United States.

294 people with cancer and 294 family caregivers in Montana responded to mail questionnaires. Fifty-two percent were women, and almost all were Caucasian.

Investigator-developed Cancer Concerns Inventory mailed to participants.

Interpersonal relationships, self-image, healthcare interactions, occupational concerns, gender, and type of experience with cancer.

In general, women were more likely than men to report relationship problems, lack of support, and feelings that were not understood. People with cancer, as compared with caregivers, were more likely to report feeling alone and that other people avoided them and were afraid to talk to them. Men with cancer were more likely than women with cancer and caregivers to feel that their job security was threatened. However, only a small percentage of all participants felt discriminated against at work. In general, a higher percentage of women with cancer and men caregivers reported concerns about healthcare interactions than men with cancer and women caregivers.

Men and women caregivers and people with cancer have different concerns regarding cancer.

Nurses working in rural areas must help families work through relationship difficulties, maximize healthcare interactions, and be an advocate for people with cancer.
