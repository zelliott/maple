It is currently estimated in France, that the cost of cancer is rising to 25 billion francs, which represents approximately 6% of all health expenditure with an annual growth of 5-10%. The data from the Register of Tumors in the Doubs region have enabled us to make an evaluation of health expenditure, reimbursed by the social security system, and its distribution in relationship with the different posts (assessment, type of treatment, supervision, transport) according to the cancer site. The average cost per patient within the first 6 months of the illness has been evaluated at 26,000 F (1984). The results show major differences for the cancer sites, care facilities and posts which are budgeted for.
