20 patients with proven or suspected fungal infections were treated with the amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) with a daily dose of 5 mg/kg for 1-25 days. 6 patients died during the therapy due to fungal infection (3) or underlying disease (3). One patient was not evaluable. 13 patients were cured and improved. ABLC was administered in patients with renal disease avoiding the use of conventional amphotericin B (AmB) because of nephrotoxicity or after failure with AmB. Except for hypokalemia persisting after AmB in 5 patients, no systemic adverse reaction appeared. ABLC is a promising, well-tolerated and effective drug for the therapy of fungal infections after the failure of a previous antifungal therapy or after toxic reactions due to AmB.
