A concern about safety management is growing rapidly in the field of an outpatient's cancer chemotherapy. Therefore, the pharmaceutical department of Tokai University Hachioji Hospital has employed; (1) a system to check injection prescriptions accompanied by records of drug administration and (2) an injection drug preparation worksheet for a certain communication. The results that examined their usability were as follows: (1) a prescription check found a deviation of recipes from the protocol, then all of the deviations were revised, (2) use of the worksheet with an indicated cancellation line completely prevented preparation mistakes in the case of a prescription change. Consequently, the safety management of an outpatient's cancer chemotherapy has made progress due to an application of the system and worksheet by the pharmaceutical department.
