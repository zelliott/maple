A frequent issue in the management of cancer patients with thrombosis is thrombocytopenia, whether related to chemotherapy, heparin, or other drugs. The oncologist will have multiple new anticoagulants to choose from in the future, but for now, the effect of these experimental agents on cancer thrombosis is unknown. Despite the effectiveness of anticoagulation in cancer patients, survival benefit remains controversial. Given the ongoing clinical questions and new drugs, anticoagulant therapy in patients with cancer promises to have an exciting future.
