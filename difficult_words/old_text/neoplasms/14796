Increased cancer rates have been documented in people residing in areas around Naples characterized by illegal dumping and incineration of waste.

Risk of cancer in dogs and cats is associated with waste management.

Four hundred and fifty-three dogs and cats with cancer and 1,554 cancer-free animals.

Hospital-based case-control study in Naples (low danger) and nearby cities having a history of illegal waste dumping (high danger). Odds ratio (OR) between high- and low-danger areas was calculated for all tumors and various malignancies in dogs and cats.

An increased risk for cancer development was identified in dogs but not in cats residing in high-danger areas (OR: 1.55; 95% confidence interval: 1.18-2.03; P &lt; .01). A 2.39-fold increased risk of lymphoma (P &lt; .01) accounted for the greater tumor frequency in dogs residing in high-danger areas. The risk of mast cell tumor and mammary cancer did not differ in dogs residing in high- or low-danger areas.

Waste emission from illegal dumping sites increases cancer risk in dogs residing in high-danger areas. An increased prevalence of lymphoma has been previously recognized in humans living close to illegal waste dumps. Thus, epidemiological studies of spontaneous tumors in dogs might suggest a role for environmental factors in canine and human carcinogenesis and can predict health hazards for humans.
