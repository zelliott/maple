Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication of malignant disease, affecting approximately 1 in 200 cancer patients. Oncology nurses are instrumental in identifying patients with cancer at high risk of venous thromboembolism. Risk factors include: stage of disease, chemotherapy, the patient's degree of immobility, a history of recent surgery, and the presence of a central venous catheter. The treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer usually involves a sequential combination of unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), followed by oral warfarin or LMWH. LMWHs are an alternative to warfarin for secondary prophylaxis and long-term treatment. LMWH is given by subcutaneous injection, does not require hospitalization for administration or routine laboratory monitoring. Recent clinical trial results have shown that LMWH use is associated with improved survival in cancer patients with relatively good prognoses. Patients receiving any anticoagulant therapy should be monitored for signs of pulmonary embolism or bleeding and intravenous sites (if present) should be monitored for oozing. Appropriate patient selection, a carefully constructed treatment plan, extensive patient education, and regular patient contact are integral elements for the nursing care of patients with cancer-associated thrombosis treated in the outpatient setting.
