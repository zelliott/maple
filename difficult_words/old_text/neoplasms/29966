Different types of human cells which normally grow as monolayers or suspension cultures were tested for their capacity to form and grow as spheroids. Sixteen out of the 27 tested tumour cell lines formed spheroids. Nearly all of these spheroids also grew. With only two exceptions the doubling times were longer when the tumour cells grew as spheroids than when they grew in conventional mass culture. Eleven out of 13 tested human non-tumour cells formed small spheroids but of these only the spheroids of lymphoid origin could grow. These lymphoid cells grew faster when aggregated to spheroids than when in single-cell suspension culture. None of the other non-tumour cells, which normally grew as monolayers, could grow as spheroids. The normally monolayer-cultured tumour cells formed symmetrical spheroids with smooth surfaces while the normally suspension-cultured cells formed irregular spheroids with rough surfaces. All large spheroids had a necrotic centre surrounded by a shell of viable cells. The thickness of the viable cell layer varied depending on cell type. The shape and organization of cells within the spheroids also varied largely. The results show that many types of human cells can be cultured as spheroids and that a wide spectrum of morphological appearances and growth rates can be obtained.
