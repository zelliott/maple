Continuous improvement or CI is an approach to improving quality in an organization's processes on an ongoing basis. Three key components contribute to CI success: (1) draw on the knowledge and abilities of employees at all levels; (2) focus on customer needs; and (3) use data in a scientific approach to decision making. A long-term effort, not a short-term fix, the classic CI cycle is Plan, Do, Study, Act. Health care organizations are finding a good fit for CI in clinical applications. Improved patient care through efficient, consistent processes is one of the immediate, obvious benefits of CI. The data collected can also validate decisions from a financial standpoint and provide necessary information to regulatory agencies. Over the longer term, applying CI data and understanding customer needs can help to develop efficient, user-oriented facilities. The chief payback, however, is an organization that is flourishing because it meets the needs and expectations of customers--patients, physicians, employees, and the community.
