Recently a number of patients have received home enteral nutrition (HEN) as well as home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in Terumo's home healthcare network 'Home-Joint'. This study was undertaken to compare the patients who received HEN with those who received HPN. 1. HPN patients in 2000. Number: 1,789 (45% females), age: 0-101 (mean: 66 years old, 48% over 70 years old), diagnosis: cancer 54%, therapeutic periods: 0-916 days (mean: 80 days). 2. HEN patients in 2000. Number: 736 (40% females), age: 1-101 (mean: 50 years old, 33% over 70 years old), diagnosis: Crohn's disease 44%, therapeutic periods 0-1,618 days (mean: 183 days). 3. Adoption of HPN and HEN in home care agents. HPN only 66%, HEN only 24%, both HPN and HEN 10%. It suggested that following two issue take place against making choice of HPN or HEN in home nutrition care. 1) Adoption of both HPN and HEN in more clinics. 2) Establishment of the guidelines for systematic HPN/HEN choice.
