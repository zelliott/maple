Twenty-six male and 86 female, predominantly White, non-terminal cancer patients addressed preferences for disclosure of terminal prognosis, should their disease advance to that stage. Specific inquiries were made about desired levels of disclosure (full, partial,or non-disclosure) and desired pathways of disclosure (from physician to patient only, from physician to patient in the presence of a loved one, or from physician to loved one only). Gender, previous experience with death, and trait anxiety were associated with level preference. Education, previous experience with death, and trait anxiety were associated with pathway preference.Variables predictive of level and pathway preference were identified, benefits to physicians and patients were explored, and sampling limitations were discussed.
