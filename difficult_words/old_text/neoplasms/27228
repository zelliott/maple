Ribosome biogenesis and translation control are essential cellular processes that are governed at numerous levels. Several tumour suppressors and proto-oncogenes have been found either to affect the formation of the mature ribosome or to regulate the activity of proteins known as translation factors. Disruption in one or more of the steps that control protein biosynthesis has been associated with alterations in the cell cycle and regulation of cell growth. Therefore, certain tumour suppressors and proto-oncogenes might regulate malignant progression by altering the protein synthesis machinery. Although many studies have correlated deregulation of protein biosynthesis with cancer, it remains to be established whether this translates directly into an increase in cancer susceptibility, and under what circumstances.
