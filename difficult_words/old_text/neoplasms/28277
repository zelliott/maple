To develop and evaluate a system of obtaining financial assistance for the treatment of children with solid tumours by involving individual members of society.

This prospective project was carried out at the Paediatric Solid Tumours Clinic of the Department of Paediatric Surgery, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, from January 1994 to December 1998. Donor families were enlisted by talking to affluent people. Families who agreed to help in this effort were told that they could 'adopt' a child for the purpose of his/her treatment and that they should purchase the prescribed chemotherapeutic drugs and give them to the family of the affected child. Therapy was started once the drug was received at the hospital. This process was repeated at each subsequent visit.

Of the 291 children with solid tumours registered at the clinic, 45 (15.5%) received financial assistance by this method. The proportion of children receiving financial assistance increased from 8.6% in 1994 to 23% in 1998. Of all those who received assistance, 20 (44.4%) have completed therapy and are surviving, 11 are still on therapy, 12 died and 2 decided to discontinue therapy because of progressive disease.

The advantages of this system far outweigh its disadvantages. This method of generating finances for children with cancer can be recommended to all doctors treating such children.
