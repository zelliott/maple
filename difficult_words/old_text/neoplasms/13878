Results of the initial theoretical and experimental work performed at the Institute of Nuclear Technics of the Budapest Technical University (BTU NTI) regarding the design of a pure thermal neutron field for neutron capture therapy experiments are reported. Calculations show that a thermal neutron flux of approximately 10(9) neutrons cm-2s-1 will be generated using a filter made of graphite and bismuth.
