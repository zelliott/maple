Neuropathic pain is an increasingly common problem facing the cancer patient. Painful neuropathy can come from various sources and significantly impact quality of life. The most commonly observed scenario is paraesthesia and dysesthesia as a result of toxic effects of chemotherapies on the distal peripheral nerves. Neuropathic pain should be addressed ideally with the help of a neuro-oncologist, and it usually can be successfully treated with a variety of agents, including atypical analgesics such as antidepressants, newer drugs with analgesic benefit, and opioids for more refractory cases. Direct and indirect effects of the primary neoplasm need to be considered in the etiology of specific syndromes of mononeuropathies and plexopathies.
