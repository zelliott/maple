A type of pH-responsive nano multi-drug delivery systems (nano-MDDSs) with uniform particle size (100 ± 13 nm) and excellent monodispersity was developed by in situ co-self-assembly among water-insoluble anti-cancer drug (doxorubicin, DOX), surfactant micelles (CTAB) as chemosensitiver and silicon species forming drugs/surfactant micelles-co-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (drugs@micelles@MSNs or DOX@CTAB@MSNs) via a micelles-MSNs self-assembly mechanism. The nano-MDDS DOX@CTAB@MSNs had a highly precise pH-responsive drug release behavior both in vitro and in vivo, and exhibited high drug efficiencies against drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells as well as drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells by the MSNs-mediated transmembrane delivery, the sustained drug release and the high anti-cancer and multi-drug resistance (MDR)-overcoming efficiencies. The MDR-overcoming mechanism was proved to be a synergistic cell cycle arrest/apoptosis-inducing effect resulted from the chemosensitization of the surfactant CTAB. These results demonstrated a very promising nano-MDDS for the pH-responsive controlled drug release and the cancer MDR overcoming.
