The introduction of the diagnosis 'posttraumatic stress disorder' (PTSD) in cancer patients in the diagnostic nomenclature and the application of assessment to investigate prevalence, risk factors and comorbidity are discussed. The diagnosis PTSD in cancer patients makes it necessary to modify the trauma criteria. Data to identify patients at risk for developing PTSD in the group of cancer patients are incomplete. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to define the characteristics and course of PTSD in the cancer setting. With these data it would be possible to identify the population at risk and the best time for assessment and therapeutic intervention.
