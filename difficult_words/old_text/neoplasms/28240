The diagnosis-related-group/prospective-payment system (DRG/PPS) was introduced into the health care system of the United States in 1983. This system triggered the development and implementation of clinical pathways aimed at reducing the length and cost of hospitalization. In Japan, trial use of a Japanese version of DRG/PPS was initiated in November 1998 in 10 hospitals under the control of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and full-scale implementation of the system is expected in the near future. Clinical pathways, therefore, are a current focus of attention, mainly because of their success in enhancing management efficiency in the U.S. However, in actual clinical settings where clinical pathways are used, several Japanese health care providers have come to realize that they are also useful in improving staff coordination, patient satisfaction, and patient care, rather than simply reducing the length of hospital stay and cost of health care. The introduction of clinical pathways requires that treatment of the disease in question be defined and standardized. The implementation of pathways for the treatment of cancer, however, might prove difficult because of the high frequency of variation. In our experience, the main reason for the use of clinical pathways is not to reduce the number of variant cases but to provide high-quality care through the promotion of a team approach to treatment and enhanced patient care. Therefore, even if there were frequent variances following surgery for cancer, those occurring in accordance with the pathophysiological state of the patient would not interfere with management by clinical pathways. Clinical pathways are advantageous because they allow patients to know their treatment schedule; to prepare for hospitalization procedures; to have a better perspective on discharge; to reduce anxiety regarding hospital admission, even if it is the first time; to communicate better with doctors, nurses, and other medical care staff, leading to greater trust; and to improve their ability for self-management. These features are all important for the improvement of patient care. Furthermore, clinical pathways may lead to a situation in which the cost of hospitalization can be predicted prior to admission, enabling patients to compare differences between several hospitals. From our experience with gastric cancer, breast cancer, and esophageal cancer management, we consider clinical pathways to be of great benefit in helping to reform the current medical care system in regard to the management of cancer patients as well as patients with other diseases.
