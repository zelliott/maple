We studied the expression of Î±1-syntrophin (SNTA1) protein in histologically confirmed esophageal, stomach, lung, colon, rectal and breast cancerous tissue samples. Our results suggest a significant decrease in the expression level of SNTA1 protein in both esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) compared with their respective controls while a significant increase in expression of SNTA1 protein compared with the normal tissue was observed in breast carcinoma samples. No significant difference in expression of SNTA1 protein was observed in stomach, lung, colon and rectal cancers. Our results suggest that SNTA1 has a role in carcinogenesis and could possibly be used as a novel diagnostic or prognostic marker in esophageal and breast cancers.
