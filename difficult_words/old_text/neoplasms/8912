Tumor growth requires induction of an angiogenic program, and targeting of this program with antiangiogenic drugs shows an impact on tumor progression. However, although they are effective at reducing angiogenesis, these therapies have not produced widespread or enduring clinical benefit, which openly exposes their limitations. Here, we describe the current limitations of these therapies, including the known mechanisms and current controversies. Further, we present some of the recent approaches to predict these limitations and strategies to overcome them. With the development of meaningful predictive biomarkers and effective treatments that impede these limitations, longer and more robust efficacies will be achieved for a wider population of patients.
