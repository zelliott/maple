79 patients(almost gastric cancer), who took drug S-1for the period from November 2000 to February 2006 in Asahi Rosai Hospital, were placed in two groups--a continuous group and a withdrawal group--to investigate and discuss the background factors contributing to the alleviation of digestive medication toxicity. The average number of days elapsed until drug withdrawal was 20 days, approximately 60% of the causes for withdrawal being attributable to digestive symptoms. A comparison between a subgroup of post-gastrectomy patients and a subgroup of non-gastrectomy patients showed that single S-1 drug administration could be continued for a longer period in the former than in the latter (p&lt;0.05). A comparative study on drug regimens among all the patients demonstrated that a two-week regimen allowed the drug to be continuously administered for a longer period than a three- or four-week regimen(p&lt;0.05). It was suggested that adverse effects might be alleviated by suppressing acid secretion in the stomach in the post-gastrectomy group. For the patients in that group, drug withdrawal is almost impossible. Considering that the average number of days elapsed until drug withdrawal is approximately 20 days, there seems to be a pressing need to establish the two-week regimen for continuous S-1 administration, which is not contained in the attachment hereto.
