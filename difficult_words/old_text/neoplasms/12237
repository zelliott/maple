to assess the relationship between quality of life, pain and desire for hastened death in advanced cancer patients.

120 Greek patients with advanced cancer were interviewed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 version 3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30), the Greek Brief Pain Inventory (G-BPI), the Greek Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (G-HADS) and the Greek Schedule of Attitudes toward Hastened Death (G-SAHD).

statistically significant associations were found between total G-SAHD scores and scores for the worst level of pain in the previous 24 hours (G-BP13) (r = 0.279, P = 0.002), and between total G-SAHD scores and scores for the level of pain relief obtained in the last 24 hours (G-BP18) (r = -0.326, P = 0.0005). The strongest correlations were found between G-SADH and emotional functioning (r = 0.569, P&lt;0.0001) and global quality of life (r = -0.331, P&lt;0.0001) from EORTC QLQ-C30. In multivariate analyses, emotional functioning, social functioning, financial impact, and the interference of pain in general activity and mood were significant predictors of G-SAHD (all P&lt;0.0001).

quality of life and pain appeared to have a statistically significant relationship with desire for hastened death. Adequate palliative care should alleviate pain and the desire for hastened death, improving quality of life.
