The Fargo CCOP believes that a Research Nurse enhances their participation in clinical trials. Although it is early in our evaluation, the CCOP has maintained a stable accrual level despite the loss of a Medical Oncologist that historically led our research accrual totals. It may also be noted that enhancing treatment protocol participation increases cancer control participation as illustrated in the figure below. Cancer Control accrual is very respectable and positions the Fargo CCOP among the leaders in the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. The Cancer Control protocols are very time intensive. It would have been extremely difficult for the Medical Oncology Nursing staff to add cancer control research responsibilities to an already busy work day. Although subjective, communication between nurses, physicians, and data managers has been enhanced. Medical Oncology nurses have also begun to do more extensive telephone follow up with non-study patients. Minor violations appear to be decreasing. In summary, the Fargo CCOP plans to continue support of the Research Nurse role. Centralizing the accountabilities identified with one individual provides a mechanism for better communication, patient compliance, and higher patient accrual to cancer treatment and cancer control protocols. This approach may be helpful to other community cancer programs that wish to enhance their participation in clinical trials and the NCI's effort to increase patient accrual to high priority protocols.
