Previously, a specific angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin, discovered in urine and serum of tumor-bearing mice, was reported to potently block tumor growth and metastasis in animal models. Detection of angiostatin and its precursor proteins in urine from cancer patients has not been reported. Now, we report the development of an antibody-based analysis system that allows us to detect angiostatin and plasminogen/plasmin (Pgn/plasmin) in the urine of cancer patients. The detection system is a combination of a novel lysine-ELISA assay and Western immunoblot analysis using a specific antibody to human angiostatin and Pgn/plasmin. High levels of Pgn/plasmin were detected in the urine from various cancer patients, whereas healthy individuals showed relatively low levels of urine Pgn/plasmin. Of interest, angiostatin is detectable in urine samples of patients with various cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, suggesting that angiogenesis may play an important role in the development and progression of leukemia. Our data for the first time show that angiostatin and Pgn/plasmin are present at relatively high levels in the urine of human cancer patients. Detection of urine angiostatin in cancer patients helps us not only to understand the role of this angiogenesis inhibitor in cancer development and progression but also allows us to develop tools of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Thus angiostatin has both therapeutic and diagnostic implications in cancer disease.
