Blood group-related antigens have been attractive targets for immunotherapy of cancer since their initial identification as cancer-related antigens. However, available information on the relative expression of most of these antigens on human malignant and normal tissues has been insufficient for selecting optimal antigens and tumors for immune attack. In this study, the distribution of the blood group-related antigens TF, Tn, sTn, Le(a), sialyl Le(a), Le(b), Le(x), sialyl Le(x), polyfucosyl Le(x) and Le(y) on 13 types of cancer and 16 normal tissues was compared. Our results show that sTn is strongly expressed on cancers of breast, colon, stomach, ovary, prostate and uterus; Tn on prostate cancer; TF on cancers of breast, colon, ovary, prostate and uterus; Le(y) on the cancers of colon, lung, pancreas and ovary; Le(a) and Le(x) on gastric cancer; and sialyl Le(a) and sialyl Le(x) on colon cancer. The complete absence of these antigens on cancers of neuroectodermal or mesodermal origin including melanoma, sarcoma, neuroblastoma and B cell lymphoma is as striking as their widespread presence on tumors of epithelial origin. Normal tissues were also tested. Tn and Le(b) were only detected on gastric and ovarian epithelia; sTn on Leydig cells of testis in addition to gastric and ovarian epithelia; Le(x) and sialyl Le(x) on polymorphonuclear leukocytes; and TF, Le(a), sialyl Le(a), Le(x), sialyl Le(x), polyfucosyl Le(x) and Le(y) on epithelia from a variety of tissues.
