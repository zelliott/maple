Lymphatic vasculature forms the second part of our circulatory system that plays a critical role in tissue fluid homeostasis. Failure of the lymphatic system can lead to excessive accumulation of fluid within the tissue, a condition called lymphedema. Lymphatic dysfunction has also been implicated in cancer metastasis as well as pathogenesis of obesity, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Since the identification of the first lymphatic marker VEGFR-3 and growth factor VEGF-C almost 20 years ago, a great progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis. This has been achieved largely through characterization of animal models with specific lymphatic defects and identification of genes causative of human hereditary lymphedema syndromes. In this review we will summarize the current understanding of the regulation of lymphatic vascular morphogenesis, focusing on mechanisms that have been implicated in both developmental and pathological (tumor) lymphangiogenesis.
