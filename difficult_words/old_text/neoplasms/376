The carcinogenic effect of N-bis(2-hydroxypropyl)nitrosamine (BHP) was studied in newborn Wistar rats. Tumors were induced in the lung (adenoma), pancreas (adenoma), kidney (nephroblastoma), and ovary (benign granulosa cell tumor) at 24 weeks after the treatment and in the lung (adenoma and adenocarcinoma), liver (hemangioma, hemangioendothelioma, and hepatocellular carcinoma), pancreas (adenoma), kidney (renal cell carcinoma and nephroblastoma), thyroid (adenocarcinoma) and ovary (benign and malignant granulosa cell tumors) at 52 weeks. The highest incidence of tumor was seen in the liver of rats applied BHP within 24 hours after birth. These results indicate that newborn Wistar rats are more susceptible to BHP than are adult rats.
