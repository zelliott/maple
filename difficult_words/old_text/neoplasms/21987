Oncolytic adenovirus (rAd)-mediated E1A gene therapy of cancer has become a novel therapeutic modality. In this study, we constructed a recombinant oncolytic adenovirus (rAd-E1A) expressing the tumor suppressor E1A gene. We demonstrated that the rAd-E1A replicated in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells but attenuated in the normal liver cell line HL-7702. It induced HCC cell apoptosis through upregulation of apoptosis-associated Bax, caspase-3, and Fas and downregulation of survivin and Bcl-2 in a p53-dependent pathway. It also downregulated the expression of angiogenesis- associated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD34 genes and reduced tumor vessel formation and angiogenesis. In mice bearing SMMC-7721 tumors, intratumoral injections of rAd- E1A significantly inhibited HCC growth. Therefore, the oncolytic adenovirus-mediated E1A gene therapy may be a useful therapeutic approach for HCC treatment.
