Local interleukin-2 (IL-2) is effective in a number of experimental animal models and in veterinary and human cancer patients without discomforting side effects. The primary goal of this study was to compare the therapeutic effects and side effects of the local intratumoral administration of five or ten low doses of IL-2 with those of a combination of cisplatin and a single high dose of IL-2 in the treatment of equine sarcoids. The therapeutic effect (complete and partial regression) of local cisplatin together with a single high dose of IL-2 was significantly better than the combined effect of low doses of local IL-2 administered daily over 5 or 10 days (80% and 43%, respectively; P=0.02). Cisplatin/IL-2 and low doses of IL-2 induced 53% and 14% complete regressions, respectively ( P=0.02). Histological changes after cisplatin/IL-2 treatment were far more pronounced than after IL-2 only treatment and in several cases showed an enormous eosinophilic infiltrate.
