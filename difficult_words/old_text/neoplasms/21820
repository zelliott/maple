Ever increasingly potent but non-specific immunosuppression has necessarily brought with it the continuing risk of opportunistic infections and virus-induced malignancies. The improvement in graft and patient survival rates from transplantation has depended to a certain extent on parallel improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious complications. This review will highlight some of the current problems and progress. The risks of infection are largely related to the total burden of immunosuppression rather than any particular drug, although sirolimus and the anti CD25 antibodies may be an exception. Almost all the post-transplant infections are treatable; a precise microbiological diagnosis is essential so that specific therapy can be used. Newer molecular diagnostic techniques are increasingly widely available, e.g.quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The transplant community will inevitably be faced with highly resistant bacteria such as. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) and will have to develop appropriate strategies. New infectious organisms continue to be identified [e.g. Burkitt's Virus (BKV), West Nile virus and Avian influenza) and will continue to tax the ingenuity of transplant physicians and microbiologists.
