Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was determined in normal and malignant human cell lines by histochemical methods. In normal human fibroblasts, no AChE activity could be demonstrated by any histochemical technique or substrate. Enzymic activity was observed in HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, RD 2 human rhabdomyosarcoma cells, and SW 311 human colon carcinoma cells. Activity was localized around the nuclear envelope, in the cytoplasm and associated with the cortical region of most cells. The specificity of the reaction was shown through the use of specific cholinesterase inhibitors.
