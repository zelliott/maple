This article traces the concept and different uses of systemic (Half-Body) irradiation (HBI) for the last 20 years. It presents both indirect and direct evidence of HBI effectiveness and discusses the various hypothesis that have been advanced to explain its success as a palliative and more recently as an elective therapeutic tool. The article discusses the transition from treating overt to subclinical metastatic disease and recalls the pioneer uses of elective HBI in lung and prostate cancers. Recent uses of elective HBI with a variety of unconventional fractionation schemes are discussed. These include clinical trials (51 patients with lung, esophagus, colorectal, prostate, ovary and endometrial cancers) and animal experiments (1195 C3H mice). An intriguing combination of hyper/hypo fractionated HBI proved to be the less toxic of all the schedules used in animals where mortality data, analyzed by the LQ Model, yielded an alpha/beta ratio of 8.3 Gy, a value generally associated with acutely responding tissue.
