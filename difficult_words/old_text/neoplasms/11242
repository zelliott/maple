A panel of vectors was constructed to encode carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) fused at its C-terminal end to various polypeptides, so as to compare their immunogenicity by plasmid DNA immunization and adenovirus injection in wild-type and CEA transgenic (CEA.tg) mice. Fusions between CEA and the minimized domain of tetanus toxin fragment C (CEA-DOM) or the Fc portion of IgG1 (CEA-FcIgG) were identified as highly immunogenic and elicited significant CEA-specific antibody and CD8+ T cell responses. CEA.tg mice were protected from tumor growth on challenge with MC38-CEA tumor cells only when immunized with repeated injections of plasmid pV1J/CEA-DOM followed by Ad/CEA-DOM. Depletion of T-regulatory cells resulted in an increased immune response and antitumor effect with DNA plus adenovirus immunization. In addition, this protective effect was abrogated if the NK, CD4+, or CD8+ cell population from immunized mice was depleted before tumor challenge. Passive transfer studies demonstrated that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and antibodies contributed to the antitumor effect, thus suggesting that a genetic vaccine based on the use of plasmid DNA and adenoviral vectors encoding CEA fused to immunoenhancing sequences augments CEA-specific immune responses and effectively protects from tumor development.
