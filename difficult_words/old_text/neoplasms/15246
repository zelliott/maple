In March 1989, the National Cancer Institute's Physician Data Query (PDQ) celebrated its fifth year. PDQ, a computerized cancer information database, was created to enhance the communication and application of cancer research data to the oncology community. Because of the variety and currency of the information contained within the system, it can be an extremely valuable resource for cancer nurses and patients. Future enhancements of the system will provide nurses with even more material for patient teaching and self-learning. This article discusses the development of PDQ, reviews its content and objectives, and identifies its possible uses for oncology nurses practicing in a variety of patient care settings.
