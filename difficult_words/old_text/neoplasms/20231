Membranous glomerulonephritis of defined aetiology (secondary MG) is a common finding, particularly in children and older adults. Secondary MG can be readily detected by a combination of clinical, serological and morphological analysis in a majority of instances. Recognition of secondary MG has significant prognostic and therapeutic implications.
