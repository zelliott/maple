Many studies have demonstrated that covalent histone modifications are dynamically regulated to cause both chemical and physical changes to the chromatin template. Such changes in the chromatin template lead to biologically significant consequences, including differential gene expression. Histone lysine methylation, in particular, has been shown to correlate with gene expression both positively and negatively, depending on the specific site and degree (i.e., mono-, di-, or tri-) of methylation within the histone sequence. Although genetic alterations in the proteins that establish, or "write," methyl modifications and their effect in various human pathologies have been documented, connections between the misregulation of proteins that remove, or "erase," histone methylation and disease have emerged more recently. Here we discuss three mechanisms through which histone methylation can be removed from the chromatin template. We describe how these "erasure" mechanisms are linked to pathways that are known to be misregulated in diseases, such as cancer. We further describe how errors in the removal of histone methylation can and do lead to human pathologies, both directly and indirectly.
