Tumor immunotherapy is currently receiving close scrutiny. However, with the identification of tumor antigens and their production by recombinant means, the use of cytokines and knowledge of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II presentation has provided ample reagents for use and clear indications of how they should be used. At this time, much attention is focused on using peptides to be presented by MHC class I molecules to both induce and be targets for CD8+ cytolytic T cells. Many peptides generated endogenously or given exogenously can enter the class I pathway, but a number of other methods of entering this pathway are also known and are discussed in detail herein. While the review concentrates on inducing cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), it is becoming increasingly apparent that other modes of immunotherapy would be desirable, such as class II presentation to induce increased helper activity (for CTL), but also activating macrophages to be effective against tumor cells.
