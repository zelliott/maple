While symptomatic differences exist between younger and older advanced cancer patients, few studies have examined the differences in their care with respect to age. Our goals were to examine the influences of age differences on physical, psychosocial and spiritual distress among advanced cancer patients. Advanced cancer patients who resided in Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital during 2007-2008 were recruited. Data were collected through professional consultants. The influences of age variations on physical, psychosocial and spiritual distress in nonelderly (&lt;60 years old) and elderly (â‰§60 years old) patients were analyzed. A total of 1013 advanced cancer patients were included in the analyses with 467 nonelderly patients and 546 elderly patients. Nonelderly patients were identified to have a higher baseline pain level (4.0 vs. 2.8, p&lt;0.001), breakthrough pain (19.3% vs. 9.9%, p&lt;0.01), insomnia (6.4% vs. 2.7%, p=0.006), emotional distress (69.0% vs. 60.6%, p=0.013), and unwillingness to pass away because of concern for loved ones (18.8% vs. 11.9%, p=0.003) with significant difference. Elderly ones were concerned about unfulfilled wishes (29.7% vs. 18.4%, p&lt;0.001) in spiritual concerns. After adjustments in regression models, nonelderly age (&lt;60 years old) still revealed significant positive or negative impact on all categories of distress. Patients aged under 60 years have more physical, psychosocial and spiritual suffering. This study suggested that professional practitioners should provide intensive care for vulnerable terminally ill cancer patients.
