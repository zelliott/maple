The possibility of reducing symptomatic hypercalcemia and of maintaining total serum calcium concentrations less than 2.8 mmol/l with clodronate (dichloromethylene bisphosphonate) was evaluated in 28 patients with various types of malignant tumors. Four episodes of hypercalcemic crisis with mean serum calcium concentrations of 4.43 mmol/l were controlled within 4-6 days of intravenous clodronate (4 mg/kg BW/day). This was accompanied by a moderate increase in serum creatinine values which, however, returned to pretreatment levels after therapy withdrawal in all but one case. Oral clodronate successfully reduced a mean serum calcium concentration of 3.16 mmol/l in 22 out of 25 patients after 3-12 days (800-3,200 mg/day). After reversal of the hypercalcemias oral clodronate controlled the serum calcium concentration for up to 42 weeks in six out of 15 patients After discontinuation of initial therapy five of seven recurrent hypercalcemias were successfully treated with oral or intravenous clodronate. Hypocalcemia and subjective side-effects were uncommon. It is concluded that clodronate is a valuable clinical tool in the management of patients with malignancy-associated hypercalcemia.
