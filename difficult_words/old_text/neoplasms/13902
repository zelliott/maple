A preliminary result from a cohort study on the association of a family history of cancer with mortality is discussed in this paper. Among 2200 patients (1912 males and 288 females) gastrectomized because of benign gastric diseases, 274 male patients, and 40 female patients had a family history of cancer. During 2750 person-years of observation, 22 patients with the family history of cancer were found to be dead and 111 patients without the family history died during 17,527 person-years, giving a relative risk of 1.26 (not significant). We focused on the male subjects that were followed up for more than 10 years; however, the observed/expected ratio of cancer deaths for subjects with a family history of cancer was about four times higher than that for those without family history. Since case-control studies on family history are vulnerable to biased recall and interchangeability of cases, more cohort studies like the present study should be conducted to assess the association of the family history of cancer.
