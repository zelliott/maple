Family caregivers share the strain of cancer and are at risk of physical and psychological symptoms in relation to caregiver stress. This study investigated the relationships between perceived difficulty in managing caregiver tasks and the experience of stress symptoms among 26 family caregivers of terminally ill patients with cancer in Hong Kong. The findings revealed that more stress symptoms were experienced by caregivers who had reported increased difficulty in managing caregiver tasks (rs = 0.64; p &lt; 0.001). Wilcoxon signed-ranks test indicated that psychological stress symptoms, rather than physical symptoms, overwhelmed most of the caregivers (z = -2.15; p &lt; 0.05). There were significantly more negative responses to stress by caregivers who had a shorter duration of experience in providing care. In addition, caregivers who had less education were at higher risk of developing stress (p &lt; 0.01). These findings indicate the need for the provision of support to facilitate the emotional and physical adaptation of caregivers at risk for health problems.
