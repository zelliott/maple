The study was conducted to determine the usefulness and efficacy of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in cancer patients with "life-support techniques limitation" admitted for an acute respiratory distress, in terms of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital discharges.

A total of 18 consecutive cancer patients (17 with solid tumours and one with haematological malignancy) with "life-support techniques limitation" in acute respiratory failure and who benefited from NIV were included. NIV was provided with a standard face mask by the BiPAP Vision ventilator (Respironics Inc.). Variables related to the demographic parameters, SAPS II score, cancer characteristics, intensive care data and hospital discharge were recorded.

Complications leading to NIV were hypoxemic respiratory failure in 11 patients and hypercapnic respiratory failure in seven. Total median duration of NIV was 29 h. NIV was applied during a median of 2.5 days with a median of 16 h per day. Total median ICU stay was 7 days (range 1-21). Fourteen and ten patients were discharged from ICU and from hospital, respectively.

NIV appears to be an effective ventilation support for cancer patients with "life-support techniques limitation".
