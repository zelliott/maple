Nicotinamide has been employed to stimulate the repair of DNA damaged by chemical and physical means. It has also been used to promote the antitumor characteristics of keratinocytes and the suppression of UVB photocarcinogenesis. Therefore, I recommend the addition of this substance to sunscreens in order to develop a new generation of sunscreens for use in Australasian countries and cancer-provoking conditions. The anti-acne, skin lightening, and epidermal barrier improving effects of nicotinamide will afford another unique advantages to these new sunscreens.
