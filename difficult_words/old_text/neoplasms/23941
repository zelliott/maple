The over 400-year history of struggle against cancer in Poland is presented in this work, from its beginning, marked by the establishment of the first hospital for cancer patients in Warsaw in 1592, up to the achievement of the main aim of the National Cancer Programme, i.e., the recent construction of a large modern cancer centre in Warsaw. In the meantime, a number of significant events have taken place in Poland for example, studies on cancer conducted in the 17th-19th centuries, a report on cancer mortality data which was published in 1888, and the Warsaw Committee on Cancer Research and Control, established in 1906. As regards the 20th century, the National Cancer Research and Control programmes were carried out (in 1924, 1952 and 1975), among other activities. An oncological network was built up in Poland based on 11 comprehensive cancer control centres and provincial outpatient clinics. At present, out of each 100,000 new cancer cases more than 70,000 die every year in Poland. The leading localizations in males are: lung (30.5%), stomach (9.8%), larynx (5.5%), prostate (5.1%) and urinary bladder (5.0%); in females: breast (17.5%), cervix uteri (9.8%), lung (6.6%), stomach (6.2%) and ovary (6.2%). Cancer patients' estimated probability of surviving 5 years is 26.4% (males) and 39.8% (females).
