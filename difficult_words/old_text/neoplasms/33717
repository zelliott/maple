Tumor-producing substances that promote lipolysis in vitro may also account for fat mobilization in cachectic cancer patients. Cachexia might improve if this lipolytic action of cancer cells could be halted. This study examined the lipolytic activities of media from four tumor cell lines after treatment with retinoic acid (RA), a cell differentiation inducer. An in vitro adipocyte bioassay measured lipolysis. All four tumor cell lines were intrinsically lipolytic, with elevated baseline lipolytic activities relative to fibroblast-conditioned controls (128% to 287% of control, p less than 0.05). After a 2-week exposure to RA in culture medium followed by 3 days of continued growth in fresh medium, two of four cell lines (both rat prostatic adenocarcinomas) showed significantly reduced lipolytic activities (16% and 61% of corresponding untreated controls, p less than 0.05). These reductions in lipolytic activity after RA treatment were not generalized phenomena; nor were they simply caused by cell differentiation, as the other cell lines (human malignant melanoma and human ovarian teratocarcinoma) showed no reductions despite evidence of cell differentiation. No effect on lipolytic activity was seen after only a 24-hour exposure to RA. We conclude that RA can affect the lipolytic activity of certain tumor cells in vitro, perhaps by influencing tumor-producing lipolytic factor(s).
