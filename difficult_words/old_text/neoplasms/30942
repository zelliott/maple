The effect of angiotensin II-induced hypertension on tumor interstitial fluid pressure (TIFP) and tumor blood flow (TBF) was investigated to examine blood flow and pressure regulation in solid tumors. TIFP measurements were made before and after administration of angiotensin II using the wick-in-needle method in s.c. tumor implants. Relative TBF was continuously monitored by laser doppler velocimetry. The effect of host strain on TIFP was evaluated in MCA-IV mammary carcinoma, transplanted in C3H and SCID mice, and showed no significant difference. The effects of tumor types were evaluated by comparing two murine tumors, MCA-IV mammary carcinoma and FSaII fibrosarcoma, and a human tumor xenograft, LS174T adenocarcinoma, transplanted in SCID mice. Baseline TIFP was elevated in all three tumor lines to significantly different pressures. AII-induced hypertension (approximately 150 mm Hg) had a variable but tumor line-specific effect on TIFP and TBF. The increase in TIFP was correlated with the baseline TIFP (r2 = 0.853) (increasing from 6.9 to 8.7 mm Hg, 10.5 to 15.8 mm Hg, and 21.7 to 29.4 mm Hg in FSaII, MCA-IV, and LS174T, respectively). These data suggest that in addition to blood flow redistribution due to the steal phenomenon, arterial control of TBF and TIFP exists within these solid tumors; however, the extent of control is tumor line dependent and less than that in normal tissues. Moreover, parallel increases in TIFP and TBF do not support the hypothesis that elevated TIFP causes vascular collapse and thus decreases TBF.
