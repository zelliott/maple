We present the technique and the preliminary results of percutaneous implantation of intraarterial catheters connected to a subcutaneous infusion reservoir for prolonged regional chemotherapy of hepatic and extrahepatic tumors.

Two hundred patients with primary or secondary hepatic neoplasms, pelvic, pancreatic, renal, lingual, and breast cancer underwent the procedure. The access was the left axillary artery (188 patients) and the femoral artery (12 patients). The catheter tip was placed in the hepatic (170 patients), hypogastric (18), splenic (4), internal thoracic (2), gastroduodenal (3), renal (2) or the external carotid artery (1). The catheter was connected to a subcutaneous reservoir and filled with heparin; chemotherapeutic infusion was subsequently started.

One hundred percent immediate technical success was obtained. Forty-three of 200 (21.5%) patients had a complication: 29 patients had a catheter dislodgment, nine had arterial thrombosis, three had a pseudoaneurysm of the left axillary artery and two had a port pocket hematoma. Most complications (37/43, 86%) were treated percutaneously without interruption of chemotherapy. In only six cases (3% of the total population) was chemotherapy discontinued due to the complication itself. The mean duration of catheter patency was 7.2 months.

Percutaneous placement of an intraarterial catheter is feasible and causes less discomfort to the patient than the surgical approach. The technique has an acceptable complication rate (21.5%), similar to that for surgical implantation (17.8%), with the advantage that in most cases the complications can be resolved percutaneously. This technique represents an alternative to surgical implantation in the treatment of liver metastases from colorectal cancer and opens new therapeutic possibilities for the local prolonged treatment of other kinds of tumor, though its clinical efficacy must be assessed in selected trials.
