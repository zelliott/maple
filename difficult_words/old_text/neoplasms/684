Preclinical studies have shown that the combination of topotecan and carboplatin is synergistic. To evaluate the schedule dependency of this interaction, the following phase I trial was designed to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of carboplatin and topotecan in patients with malignant solid tumors.

In part 1, patients received carboplatin on day 1 and topotecan on days 1, 2, and 3 (C--&gt;T schedule). In part 2, topotecan was administered on days 1, 2, and 3, followed by carboplatin on day 3 (T--&gt;C schedule). Pharmacokinetics were determined in plasma and DNA topoisomerase I catalytic activity and Pt-DNA adducts in WBC and tumor tissue.

Forty-one patients were included. Dose-limiting toxicities during the C--&gt;T schedule were grade 4 thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia (MTD: carboplatin target area under the free carboplatin plasma concentration versus time curve, 4 min mg/mL; topotecan, 0.5 mg/m(2)/d). Dose-limiting toxicities during the T--&gt;C schedule included grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenic fever, and grade 4 nausea and vomiting (MTD: carboplatin target area under the free carboplatin plasma concentration versus time curve, 6 min mg/mL; topotecan, 0.9 mg/m(2)/d). One complete response and five partial responses were observed. The clearance of and exposure to carboplatin and topotecan did not depend on the sequence of drug administration. No schedule-dependent effects were seen in Pt-DNA levels and DNA topoisomerase I catalytic activity in WBC and tumor tissue. However, myelotoxicity was clearly more evident in the C--&gt;T schedule.

The T--&gt;C schedule was better tolerated because both hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were milder. Other pharmacodynamic factors than the ones investigated must explain the schedule-dependent differences in toxicities.
