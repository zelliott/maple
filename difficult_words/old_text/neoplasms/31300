The effect of hydroxyl radical, generated by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of hydrogen peroxide, on human placental DNA was monitored by UV spectroscopy, melting temperature studies, S1 nuclease digestibility and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. Immunological data indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) modified human DNA induced high titer antibodies. In ELISA, serum antibodies from various cancer patients showed a higher recognition of ROS-human DNA as compared to native DNA. Retarded mobility of the immune complex formed between IgG, isolated from cancer sera, and ROS-human DNA provided convincing evidence for antigen-antibody interaction. Oxidative lesions in DNA of cancer patients were probed using anti-ROS-human DNA IgG. DNA from cancer patients were found to inhibit anti-ROS-human DNA IgG activity in the range of 40% to 57%. These binding results indicate the presence of oxidative lesions in the cancer patient's genome.
