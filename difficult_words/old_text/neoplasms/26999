Over recent years, with the advances in next-generation sequencing, a large number of cancer mutations have been identified and accumulated in public repositories. Coupled to this is our increased ability to generate detailed interactome maps that help to enrich our knowledge of the biological implications of cancer mutations. As a result, network analysis approaches have become an invaluable tool to predict and interpret mutations that are associated with tumour survival and progression. Our understanding of cancer mechanisms is further enhanced by mapping protein structure information to such networks. Here we review the current methodologies for annotating the functional impacts of cancer mutations, which range from analysis of protein structures to protein-protein interaction network studies.
