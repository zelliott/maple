Surveys of nurses' knowledge of cancer pain management were conducted in five countries: Australia, Canada, Japan, Spain, and the United States. The results reveal that, in all countries, serious knowledge deficits exist that could adversely affect the care of patients with cancer pain. It appears, however, that the longer a country has been engaged in efforts to educate health-care professionals and the public and to establish palliative care programs, the more likely are nurses from that country to possess correct information about cancer pain. Nevertheless, survey results in all countries strongly suggested the need to continue aggressive measures to educate nurses, who are the cornerstone of palliative care.
