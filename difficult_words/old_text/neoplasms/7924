The immunofluorescence cytofluorometric reactivity pattern of monoclonal antibody Bra55 (IgG1) elicited with a non-T, non-B ALL cell line (REH), with a panel of human neoplastic hemopoietic cell lines (including non-T, non-B, T and myeloid leukemia cell lines) and with isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes from healthy donors corresponded to the previously described microscopic immunofluorescence, ELISA, immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemic data indicating that this monoclonal antibody recognizes a 170-220 kDa cell surface glycoprotein (leukocyte common antigen) expressed selectively on hemopoietic cells. The purified, FITC-conjugated Bra55 monoclonal antibody was effectively inhibited in its binding to the surface of LCA-positive cells by reference anti-LCA monoclonal antibodies; no inhibition of this activity by LCA-unrelated monoclonal antibodies (such as anti-MHC class I and class II antibodies) was observed. These data confirm the previously reported hemopoietic cell specificity (anti-LCA, CD45) of the Bra55 monoclonal antibody.
