Since 1990 age-standardized cancer mortality in men has decreased by about 1% per year. This decrease is due to a decrease in the mortality from lung cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer. The mortality from melanoma, prostate cancer and oesophageal cancer in men has increased. After a slight increase in age-standardized cancer mortality in women, the rate has remained constant since 1990 in spite of the rapid increase in lung cancer mortality. Mortality due to cancers of the stomach, pancreas, cervix and ovary has decreased. Total cancer incidence in both men and women didn't change much during 1989-1994. In men the incidence of prostate cancer strongly increased. For women both the incidence of lung cancer and breast cancer increased. In the south-east of the Netherlands cancer incidence has been registered since 1973. In this area, the incidence increased before 1989. Therefore, it is likely that the national cancer incidence rates have also increased. Despite this increase, the age-standardized overall cancer mortality in the Netherlands did not increase during recent years.
