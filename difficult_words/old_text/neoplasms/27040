This article describes the lessons learned by social work practitioners and nurse researcher faculty from a unique partnership between a 501(c) 3 nonprofit community service organization (cancer helpline) and an academic facility to improve outreach to older adults with cancer. In preparing the research proposal, carrying out the procedures, and instituting a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach lessons learned included the importance of experienced researchers/writers, unpredictability of research activities, importance of collecting complete data, communicating underlying discipline and role-oriented assumptions, and effectiveness of CBPR to increase outreach to older adults with cancer in Delaware's eight cancer clusters.
