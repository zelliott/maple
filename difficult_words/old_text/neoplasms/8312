Radiotherapy in curative or palliative intent is well tolerated and effective in the elderly patient, too. When establishing the indication for treatment, the extent of concomitant diseases, the general state of health of the patient, and his/her life expectancy must all be taken into account. When extensive volumes in the head/neck, chest or abdominal areas need to be irradiated, adequate uptake of fluid and calories must be ensured, and electrolytes, renal parameters and the blood count must be closely monitored. Supporting measures should be applied early on.
