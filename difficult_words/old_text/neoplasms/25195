Deregulation of epigenetic and miRNA pathways are emerging as key events in carcinogenesis. miRNA genes can be epigenetically regulated and miRNAs can themselves repress key enzymes that drive epigenetic remodeling. Epigenetic and miRNA functions are thus tightly interconnected and crucial for maintaining correct local and global genomic architecture as well as gene-expression patterns, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms and their widespread effects remain poorly understood. Owing to the tissue specificity, versatility and relative stability of miRNAs, these small ncRNAs are considered especially promising in clinical applications, and their biogenesis and function is subject of active research. In this article, the current status of epigenetic miRNA regulation is summarized and future therapeutic prospects in the field are discussed with a focus on cancer.
