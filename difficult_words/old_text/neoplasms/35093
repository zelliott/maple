The occurrence of fatal conditions was substantially similar in a large population of recent, healthy oral contraceptive users and comparable nonusers at Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound during the years 1977-1981. There were no deaths from cardiovascular disease among those who were oral contraceptive users at the onset of their cardiovascular illness; there was one death from liver cancer, probably attributable to oral contraceptive use; and there were no deaths from complications of pregnancy among either users or nonusers. Newer formulations of oral contraceptives and greater care in prescribing oral contraceptives to the healthiest younger women may have substantially lessened the risks identified with earlier preparations and prescription practices.
