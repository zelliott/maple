Cytogenetic end-points have been successfully used in epidemiological studies for many years. Conventional end-points are now being replaced by procedures that utilize molecular methods, with greatly increased sensitivity, specificity and precision. In this paper we briefly review the most common cytogenetic assays that are useful in epidemiological settings, including structural chromosome aberrations, micronuclei, sister chromatid exchanges and analysis of interphase cells for aneuploidy. We describe new developments of each assay, where applicable, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the assays for detecting exposures and estimating risks. Finally, pertinent information concerning each of the assays that is useful in designing epidemiological studies is summarized in a table. It is hoped that the information presented here will be useful to individuals who are interested in applying biomarkers to studies of human environmental exposure and disease.
