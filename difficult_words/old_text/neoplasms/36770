We reviewed the clinical safety of tiagabine HCl (TGB), a selective CNS GABA uptake inhibitor, in nearly 3100 patients from 53 separate clinical trials. TGB was found to have no clinically important effect upon hepatic metabolic processes, serum concentrations of concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), laboratory values, or important interactions with any common non-AEDs. Adverse effects were usually mild and involved the nervous system. TGB is safe and well-tolerated as add-on therapy for the treatment of partial seizures.
