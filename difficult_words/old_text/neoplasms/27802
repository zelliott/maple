The findings on cancer teaching methodology presented in this abstract come from an American Association for Cancer Education (AACE)/American Cancer Society-sponsored survey of American allopathic medical schools in 1989 and 1990 to determine how and how well cancer is presented in the medical school curriculum. Responses were received from 126 institutional and approximately 1,000 faculty respondents. Approximately one-third (368) of faculty respondents indicated the use of specific learning objectives; utilization does vary across disciplines. The lecture remains the dominant form of instructional method. Computers were reported as an instructional modality by only 16% of the faculty respondents. Prepared audiovisual instructional materials appeared to be widely utilized. Use varied from 86% for 35mm slides to 11% for video discs. Faculty favored the development of new teaching materials for ten topic areas ranging from approximately 40% for early detection and prevention to a low of approximately 25% for rehabilitation and continuing care. The survey identified an underutilization of existing outpatient facilities and tumor registries for cancer teaching purposes. The findings give rise to questions concerning the appropriateness of the match between specific instructional goals and the teaching methods employed. Eight recommendations designed to strengthen cancer training are made.
