Pain is a human experience with many different definitions and meanings. Under the influence of science these meanings multiplied and added complexity to the process of managing pain as a clinical problem. Over the last four decades nurses have made important contributions to pain knowledge and pain management through research and clinical innovation. Nurses are pivotal providers in the implementation of effective pain management programs and in fostering multidisciplinary efforts to improve the services currently available to cancer patients and their families.
