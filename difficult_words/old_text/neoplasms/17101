To summarize the results of qualitative research conducted to describe patients' experience with cognitive changes attributed to cancer and chemotherapy.

Peer reviewed journals and texts.

Patient experiences were consistent across tumor types and gender. Patients' desire to be informed about the potential for cognitive changes was a common theme, as was the desire for recognition, assessment, and validation by the health care team. Cognitive changes significantly impact quality of life, self-confidence, and independence.

Understanding the patients' perspective is important to provide appropriate education and emotional support. Ongoing and future research is crucial to investigate interventions to prevent, mitigate, and treat the cognitive sequelae of cancer and chemotherapy.
