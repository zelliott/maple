We developed an approach using multi-function disease genes to find function pairs whose co-deregulation might induce a disease. Analyzing cancer genes, we found many cancer-specific coordinated function pairs co-deregulated by dysfunction of multi-function genes and other molecular changes in cancer. Studying two subtypes of cardiomyopathy, we found they show certain consistency at the functional coordination level. Our approach can also provide important information for finding novel disease genes as well as their mechanisms in diseases.
