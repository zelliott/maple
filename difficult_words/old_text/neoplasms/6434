A new microprocessor-controlled portable infusion pump, the Pancretec Provider IV 2000 TM was tested in vitro and in vivo in cancer patients. The Provider is a rotary peristaltic, battery-powered pump capable of flow rates of 0.2 to 83 ml/hour with delivery volumes up to 1999 ml. Two programming modes are available: intermittent infusion and continuous infusion. Bench tests showed the flow rate accuracy to be within 96% of the desired rate. Flow rate precision was similarly excellent at +/- 2%. Clinical studies were performed in 14 ambulatory patients receiving continuous infusion antineoplastic or analgesic drugs over 5-60 days as outpatients. The majority of infusions delivered fluoropyrimidines via indwelling central venous access ports. Two of the patients received long term (60 days) continuous infusion of analgesics for pain control. Flow rate accuracy with the pumps was within +/- 5% in 90% of the 27 infusion courses (244 patient-days of continuous infusion therapy). A significant therapy deviation (interruption 10% of the desired course) occurred in three instances. One related to a procedural error (incomplete cartridge insertion into the pump), two were caused by fluid leakage which interrupted pump function. Defect alarms (both visual and audible) operated in both instances. A KVO flow rate of 0.1 ml/hr was also found to be adequate to maintain catheter patency in peripheral veins over a 24-hour period in two normal volunteers. We conclude that the Provider pump is an accurate, reliable and state of the art infusion system with wide clinical applicability.
