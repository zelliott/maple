The control of senescence and its biochemical pathways is a crucial factor for understanding cell transformation. In a large RNA interference screen, the RSK4 gene was found to be related to p53-dependent arrest. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential role of RSK4 as a tumor suppressor gene.

RSK4 expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblot in 30 colon and 20 renal carcinomas, and in 7 colon adenomas. Two HCT116 colon carcinoma cell lines (p53 wt and p53 null), IMR90 human fibroblasts, and E1A-expressing IMR90 cells were infected with RSK4 cDNA and/or shRNA. RSK4 expression levels were analyzed in HCT116 p53 wt or p53 null and IMR90 after senescence induction by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot.

The RSK4 gene was down-regulated in 27 of 30 colon carcinomas (P &lt; 0.001), 16 of 20 renal cell carcinomas (P &lt; 0.01), and 6 of 7 colon adenomas (P &lt; 0.01). In vitro overexpression of RSK4 induced cell arrest and senescence features in normal fibroblasts and malignant colon carcinoma cell lines. Interestingly, in these cell lines RSK4 mRNA levels were increased both in replicative and stress-induced senescence. Moreover, IMR90 partially immortalized by RSK4 shRNA and HCT116 with this short hairpin RNA were more resistant to cisplatin treatment. Finally, cells expressing E1A or Rb short interfering RNA were resistant to RSK4-mediated senescence.

These results support the concept that RSK4 may be an important tumor suppressor gene by modulating senescence induction and contributing to cell proliferation control in colon carcinogenesis and renal cell carcinomas.
