The use of nucleoside analogues in anticancer and antiviral treatments is often impaired by the slow intracellular activation of these drugs. This problem can be addressed by the modulation of rate-limiting enzymes in the activation pathways of the nucleoside analogues. Therapeutic strategies based on the combination of optimized activating enzymes and established nucleoside drugs promise significant improvements to traditional chemotherapy.
