Effect of a DNA-rich fraction from Mycobacterium bovis BCG (MY-1) on the macrophage-activating-factor (MAF)-activity release from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of patients with benign diseases and patients with gastric cancer or colorectal cancer was studied in vitro. The MAF activity was augmented by the addition of 10 micrograms/ml of MY-1 in many cases. Augmentation of the MAF activity in benign disease, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer in stages I to III was observed in five of six cases, eight of 10 cases and five of eight cases, respectively. The activity of MY-1-induced MAF was partially abolished by the treatment with monoclonal anti-interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) antibody. These results suggest that MY-1 augments MAF-activity release from PBL by inducing IFN-gamma and other MAF-like substances.
