The first medical department of the Poliklinik is part of a community hospital in Vienna. Out of 1500 patients admitted every year, in about 65 cases a malignant disorder is diagnosed for the first time. Recent developments in chemotherapy of solid tumors and hematologic disorders suggest the necessity to establish a specially trained oncologic working group. In this study the patient material of two years (1982-1984) is analysed. The importance of an oncologic working group integrated to the staff members of the general department of internal medicine is discussed. It is pointed out, that in about 30% of cancer patients no specific therapy was initiated due to the far advanced stage of disease and/or due to the elderly patients. Future developments should include a more intensive cooperation with the surgical departments in order to establish a careful follow-up of patients after surgical intervention and to ensure a chemotherapeutic treatment at an earlier stage of disease.
