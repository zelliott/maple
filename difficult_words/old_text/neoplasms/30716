A multicentre, randomised vehicle-controlled single-blind dose ranging trial of intravenous recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhuG-CSF) administration after BMT has been performed in 121 patients with non-myeloid malignancies. All the doses of rhuG-CSF used (2-20 micrograms/kg/day) resulted in significant acceleration of neutrophil recovery, and a dose-response effect was apparent (p &lt; 0.05). At the 20 micrograms/kg/day dose of rhuG-CSF the median time taken to achieve a neutrophil count of &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/1 was reduced from 19 to 13 days (p &lt; 0.001) and the time to achieve a neutrophil count &gt; 1.0 x 10(9)/1 on the first of 3 consecutive days, from 26 to 14 days (p &lt; 0.001). There was a trend to less antibiotic use in the rhuG-CSF recipients and the median time in hospital was markedly reduced by 11-15 days (p &lt; 0.01). There was no toxicity in this study attributable to rhuG-CSF.
