When adult survivors of childhood cancer were compared with their peers, survivors were found to be at least as well adjusted. Indeed, some evidence was suggestive of survivors having adaptive advantages in everyday life. The survivors reported significantly more positive affect, less negative affect, higher intimacy motivation, more perceived personal control, and greater satisfaction with control in life situations. Despite these apparent strengths associated with surviving childhood cancer, several specific problems were documented. Survivors were more likely than peers to have repeated school grades, to be worried about issues of fertility, and to express dissatisfaction with important relationships. The latter finding was interpreted as reflecting the high expectations of survivors for relationships, based on their difficult yet interpersonally rewarding experiences during times of illness.
