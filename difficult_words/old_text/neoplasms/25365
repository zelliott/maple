D-Glucosamine was found to inhibit the growth of human malignant epithelial cells SW-839, HT-29, RT-4, and SK-OV-3 in culture in a process that was associated with significant increments in glycerol-containing lipids. Each cell line had a different sensitivity to the drug, but all four cell lines shared the same features in their response, i.e., dose-dependent (at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 mM), noncytotoxic reductions in growth (minimum 30%, maximum 70%), and simultaneous 1.5-fold to sevenfold increases in lipid contents. Cells regained their normal growth and lipid patterns when glucosamine was removed. Glucosamine did not modify the lipid contents of cells in the late phase of culture when growth was minimal.
