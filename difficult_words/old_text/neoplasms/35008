Murine monoclonal antibodies were used to identify tumor-cell membrane antigens on a new human mesothelioma cell line. Hybridomas were constructed by fusing SP2/0 mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells from Balb/C mice immunized by the human mesothelioma cell line MT-1. Hybridoma antibody was detected in 55/672 microculture wells that reacted to these MT-1 tumor cells by an indirect 125I-protein A binding assay. Six cultures produced antibody binding selectively to the MT-1 tumor cells but not to a human lymphoblastoid cell line. These six hybridomas were cloned: three were IgG and three were IgM antibodies. One monoclonal, MAb 45, reacted with 4 of 7 human mesothelioma cell lines but with only 1 of 11 carcinomas, 1 of 3 sarcomas, 4 of 11 melanomas, and 0 of 5 lymphoid lines. The other five monoclonals had a much broader cross-reactivity. Using an immunoperoxidase technique, MAb 45 bound to mixed-type malignant mesotheliomas but not to normal lung and pleura. The specificity of MAb 45 for diffuse mesotheliomas and the low cross-reactivity with carcinomas and normal adjacent tissues suggest that this monoclonal may be clinically useful.
