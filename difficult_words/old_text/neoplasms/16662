The efficacy and tolerability of imipenem-cilastatin were studied in 66 haemato-oncology patients from 16 centres presenting with a bacteriologically proven infection; 29 of the patients had neutropenia (less than 500/sq.mm). The drug was given as monotherapy in 30 cases, as bitherapy in 29 cases and as tritherapy in 7 cases. The initial clinical diagnosis was septicaemia in 29 patients, various severe infections in 31 and fever of unknown origin in 6. The infection was bacteriologically documented in 55 patients; the remaining 11 patients were kept in the study and the results of their treatment were taken into account. One-hundred and fourteen bacterial strains were isolated, including 64 Gram-negative organisms, 48 Gram-negative organisms and 2 anaerobes. Treatment was discontinued in 4 patients, due to lack of response in 2 and to adverse events (haemolytic shock, Lyell's syndrome) in 2. Five patients died during the study: 4 of an underlying pathology, the infection having subsided, and 1 of persistent infection and the above-mentioned Lyell's syndrome. Clinical success was achieved in 63 patients (95.5 per cent), including 27 of the 29 patients with neutropenia (93.1 per cent). Among the 114 strains isolated, 106 were eradicated, 5 persisted and only 1 became resistant (outcome not available in 10 cases). Apart from the haemolytic shock and Lyell's syndrome, haematological and hepatic alterations were minor and not obviously due to imipenem-cilastatin. Three cases of colonization and 3 cases of superinfection were recorded during the study.
