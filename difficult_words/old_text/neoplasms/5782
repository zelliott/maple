Cancer is diagnosed currently in more than 1 million Americans every year and cancer pain is experienced by patients in all stages of the disease. Even though research indicates that optimal pharmacologic management alone can provide adequate relief for 70% to 90% of these patients, and additional relief can be obtained from nonpharmacologic interventions, the problem of pain continues to exist. This article focuses on the contributions of nurse scientists to the study of cancer pain during the last 5 years. Selected contributions of nursing research designs and methods to the understanding of pain caused by cancer and cancer treatment modalities are reviewed. Limitations of present methodologic approaches to the study of cancer pain and gaps in nursing knowledge are examined. Recommendations for future nursing research designs and methods used to study nursing management of cancer pain and the implications of projected future treatment modalities also are discussed.
