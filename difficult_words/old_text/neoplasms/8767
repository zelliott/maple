Tumor immunoevasion is an advanced phase of cancer immunosurveillance in which tumor cells acquire the ability to circumvent host immune systems and exploit protumorigenic inflammation. T-cell immunoglobulin mucin (TIM) gene family members have emerged as critical checkpoint proteins that regulate multiple immune response phases and maintain immune homeostasis. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that tumor cells exploit TIM gene family members to evade immunosurveillance, whereas TIM gene family members facilitate the prevention of inflammation-related tumor progression. Thus, a comprehensive analysis to clarify the relative contributions of TIM gene family members in tumor progression may elucidate immunosurveillance systems in cancer patients.
