Seventeen patients with advanced malignancy were treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor rhG-CSF (KRN 8601) infused intravenously over a period of 30 minutes once daily at the dose level/25 micrograms, 50 micrograms, 100 micrograms, 200 micrograms, 400 micrograms, 800 micrograms/m2 for 14 consecutive days, and the effect was compared to the period without rhG-CSF treatment. The maximum numbers of peripheral leukocyte (granulocyte) showed a dose-related increase and the nadir of leukocyte counts escalated with shortening of the period. After stopping infusion, the neutrophil count dropped to the base line level within two or three days. RhG-CSF did not affect other components of peripheral blood such as monocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and hemoglobin value and platelet counts. Transient bone pain occurred in two patients receiving a dose of 800 micrograms/m2. The biochemical changes detected were increased total alkaline phosphatase activity in serum, which appeared in parallel with the increase of neutrophil numbers, and less elevation of total uric acid values. We conclude that an optimal dose of rhG-CSF is 100 micrograms/m2 (average maximum peripheral granulocyte count, 10799/microliters; nadir granulocyte count, 3772/microliters; period of neutropenia, 2.6 days), and rhG-CSF is useful for acceleration of neutrophil recovery and prevention of infection from chemotherapy.
