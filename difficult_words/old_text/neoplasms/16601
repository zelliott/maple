Success in oncology has traditionally been measured in terms of cure, survival, and tumour response. However, more recently, health-related quality of life has emerged as an important outcome, particularly in the palliation setting. We review published randomised studies from two areas in palliation: those assessing the effectiveness of palliative care programmes and those looking at the effects of palliative chemotherapy compared with best supportive care. In the latter studies, there was an improvement in research methods between the late 1980s and 2000, owing to the use of standardised instruments, specification of endpoints, and improvements in data presentation and interpretation. A range of health-related quality-of-life instruments were used in the studies, which makes comparisons difficult. This was particularly true of the palliative-care programmes. Attrition due to the death of patients in the study groups was also a problem and needs to be taken into account in study planning and design, as well as in data collection. A common standard for scoring health-related quality of life measurements both within and between instruments would improve the interpretation of findings and their clinical application, thereby giving them greater effect on clinical decision-making.
