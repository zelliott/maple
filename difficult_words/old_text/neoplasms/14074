The values for alpha/beta (fractionation sensitivity, or recovery capacity) for early and late reactions in human normal tissues are consistent with results from experimental animals. For breast treatments direct analysis indicates that for early reactions alpha/beta is in the range 7 to 11 Gy, while for late effects it is in the range 2 to 4 Gy. Data on recovery kinetics in human tissues is limited but these indicate that recovery may be slower in humans than in rodents. For early skin reactions the halftime of recovery is about 1 h, while for late telangiectasia it is more than 3 h. alpha/beta values for human tumors are more variable than in rodents: some are high (head and neck, lung, skin, cervix) and similar to those for early reacting normal tissues. Others are low, including melanomas, where alpha/beta was estimated at 0.6 (-1.1, 2.5) Gy, and liposarcomas, where direct analysis of cases surveyed from the literature suggested that alpha/beta = 0.4 (-1.4, 5.4) Gy. Repopulation kinetics is faster in the mucosa of the soft palate and faucial pillars (1.8 Gy/day) than in head and neck tumors (up to 1 Gy/day).
