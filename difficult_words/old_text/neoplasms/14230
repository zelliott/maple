This study, we analyzed the effect of boosting tumor infiltrating lymphocyte in immunotherapy using mathematical modeling. In this model, tumor growth is described as a tumor cells population with immunotherapy. This model also describes the effect of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon alpha (INF-alpha) on dynamics of tumor cells. Numerical modeling of immunotherapy with or not boosted Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) are presented in this study. We obtained that boosting Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) in immunotherapy have a very significant role in killing of tumor cells.
