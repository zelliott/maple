Autologous transplantation of circulating stem cells is potentially capable of creating a chance of normal hematopoietic reconstitution in the patients in which both allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplantation was impossible. The authors have reviewed the possibilities for collection of adequate and sufficient numbers of peripheral blood stem cells as well as up-to-date results of their autografting especially in relation to hematopoietic malignant diseases. The advantages resulting from autologous transplantation of circulating stem cells depends on: 1. The lack of risk of GvH--disease. 2. early and rapid hematopoietic and lymphoid recovery, 3. probably, the low risk of graft contamination by tumor cells in early remission.
