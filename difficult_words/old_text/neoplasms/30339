Synthetic immunology, the development of synthetic systems capable of modulating and/or manipulating immunological functions, represents an emerging field of research with manifold possibilities. One focus of this area has been to create low molecular weight synthetic species, called antibody-recruiting molecules (ARMs), which are capable of enhancing antibody binding to disease-relevant cells or viruses, thus leading to their immune-mediated clearance. This article provides a thorough discussion of contributions in this area, beginning with the history of small-molecule-based technologies for modulating antibody recognition, followed by a systematic review of the various applications of ARM-based strategies. Thus, we describe ARMs capable of targeting cancer, bacteria, and viral pathogens, along with some of the scientific discoveries that have resulted from their development. Research in this area underscores the many exciting possibilities at the interface of organic chemistry and immunobiology and is positioned to advance both basic and clinical science in the years to come.
