Serum succinyl (Ala)3-p-nitroanilide hydrolyzing elastase-like activity which elevates in patients with obstructive jaundice, is due to the joint action of two enzymes: first, succinyl (Ala)3-p-nitroanilide is cleaved to succinyl (Ala)2 and Ala-p-nitroanilide by metalloendopeptidase, and then Ala-p-nitroanilide is cleaved to Ala and p-nitroaniline by aminopeptidase. We adopt a new assay method for serum endopeptidase activity using HPLC.
