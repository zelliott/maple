Since the foundation of the GDR a constant decrease in the infant mortality was achieved. In 1987 it was 3.02 of 10,000 children between the age of 1 and 15 years. When investigating the death causes, it is quite obvious that for many years it is the accident that hold the first place. Then follow neoplasms, congenital anomalies, nervous diseases and diseases of the sense organs as well as diseases of the respiratory apparatus. The present analysis examines the development of the nonaccidental infant mortality between the age of 1 and under 15 years old. The basis for this analysis are the documents of the Special County Commissions for Reducing Baby- and Infant Mortality in the county of Magdeburg from 1973 until 1986. The most important pathological death causes are shown according to the age, to sex and diagnosis groups. Even their development is shown.
