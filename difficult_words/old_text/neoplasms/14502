A significant increase in sialic acid content is demonstrable in the sera of cancer patients. Our investigations were performed to find out whether the serum sialic acid level is altered also during pregnancy or with infections of the upper respiratory tract. Our results have revealed a slight increase in sialic acid level to occur only in the last trimester of pregnancy. However, this distinct, though statistically insignificant, increase will not lead to misjudgement in regard to cancer diagnosis, or in case control of this disease. By contrast, in 7 out of 15 patients with infected upper respiratory tract the sialic acid content was clearly above the tolerance limit so that false positive findings may possibly be obtained.
