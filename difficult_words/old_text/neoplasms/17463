As I have discussed, oncology nurses and cancer nursing have made great strides in the past two decades. Where do we want to be in the next two decades? Questions need to be raised, goals set, and a course of action determined. As Derdarian (1981) states, "Cancer Nursing as a specialty of nursing profession, can create a prototype- a model- for practice, curriculum development, and research." Cancer Nursing is now a colossus inspite of its fragile beginning. It developed and was built on caring, sharing, and daring. We must plan and build for the future while keeping pace with the present. I have been in this field for 32 years, and knowing and working with oncology nurses, the challenges will be met and resolved.
