The suitability of a liposomal form of hydrophobic nonsulfonated meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin (TPP) for the photodynamic therapy of tumors was investigated. TPP was solubilized in small unilamellar lipid vesicles prepared by extrusion on a LIPOSOFAST apparatus. These samples were studied by laser-excited time resolved luminescence and triplet-triplet absorption spectroscopy. In this lipid environment TPP was still an efficient singlet oxygen producer, as indicated by the characteristic singlet oxygen phosphorescence at 1270 nm in D2O, when excited with a 28 ns laser pulse at 412 nm. Moreover, unlike with sulfonated TPP (TPPS4), liposomal TPP showed the reduced decay rates of TPP triplet-states with the increasing time of pre-illumination by a Xenon lamp. This was shown in an indirect way, based upon the appearance of a second component of the luminescence decay at 1270 nm in D2O; and by direct TPP triplet state monitoring, detecting triplet-triplet absorption at 440 nm in H2O. The deactivation of higher triplet states was delayed upon pre-illumination. This reflects an irreversible interaction of singlet oxygen with membrane lipids, thus demonstrating the potential of the liposomal form of TPP to efficiently disintegrate tumor cell membranes and to be a suitable preparation for the photodynamic therapy.
