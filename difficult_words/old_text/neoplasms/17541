Taking psychoanalytical aspects of psychologically caused symptoms into consideration it is discussed, whether in a narrower sense human cancer can be regarded as a psychosomatic disease or not. Research results in molecular biology including genetics are taken into account. It is held that psychogenesis as a primary cause explains only a minor part of the incidence rate of human cancer. Psychological--or neurotic--influences on the course of the disease are regarded as relatively well proved, but not as specific to cancer. Against hasty psychological explanations of cancer should be warned.
