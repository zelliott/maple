The associations of blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI) and iliac-to-thigh circumference index (CI) with total, cardiovascular and cancer mortality were investigated in 7312 middle-aged men, initially free of coronary heart disease, known cancer and not treated for hypertension, who have been followed for 15 to 20 years in the Paris prospective study I. Using Cox survival regression analysis, total mortality (1208 deaths) was found to be highest in relatively lean men (BMI &lt; 24.4 kg/m2) with elevated blood pressure (mean BP &gt; or = 96 mmHg) and central pattern of body mass distribution (CI &gt; 1.82). Cancer causes accounted for a large proportion of the increased mortality risk. In parallel, mortality from cardiovascular diseases increased independently with blood pressure and iliac-to-thigh circumference index, but increased with body mass index only in men with low blood pressure (mean BP &lt; 96 mmHg). Taking into account serum cholesterol and cigarette smoking levels as covariates and excluding deaths occurring 5 to 10 years after the examination only slightly attenuated the intensity of this pattern of association.
