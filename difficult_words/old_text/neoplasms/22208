The research to 1970 on the adverse reactions caused by oral contraceptives is reviewed in brief.  A rare but statistically significant higher risk of thromboembolism has been associated with oral contraceptive use and pills of lower estrogen content are recommended.  The problem is extremely complex and further detailed research is necessary.  No relationship between oral contraceptives and cancer of any sort has been demonstrated.  Numerous metabolic changes have been associated with oral contraceptive use but their significance has not been established and their occurence is highly dependent on the nature of the individual patient.  No genetic effects are caused by suppressing ova production in a woman's body for extended periods.  Recent dramatic publicity about the pill and its side-effects has been useful in informing the public about these drugs but has also been seriously misleading about the risks involved in their use.
