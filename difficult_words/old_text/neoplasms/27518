The objective of this study was to investigate the perceptions of patients with cancer, their caregivers and healthcare professionals (HCPs) about fatigue and its impact on quality of life. It was a cross-sectional survey, the respondents were patients with cancer attending three UK regional cancer centres (n = 1,370), their informal caregivers (n = 1,370) and a random selection of HCPs (oncologists/nurses/radiographers/haematologists; n = 1,098). The response rates for patients, caregivers and HCPs were 42%, 33% and 34% respectively. Fatigue was reported to affect 56% of patients and to have a considerable impact on quality of life. Caregivers also recognized that fatigue was a common problem, with significant effects on patients' quality of life and impact on themselves. Healthcare professionals recognized that fatigue was a common problem for their patients but overestimated its impact on some aspects of patients' daily lives. Although most HCPs reported that they prescribed/recommended treatment for over half of their patients, only 14% of patients reported receiving any such treatment. The most common advice was to take more rest and relaxation.

patients with cancer report that fatigue is a common and distressing symptom and the importance of this symptom is generally recognized by both HCPs and lay-carers. Healthcare professionals need more information about the effectiveness of existing interventions for cancer-related fatigue and further research is required to improve the current management of this debilitating symptom.
