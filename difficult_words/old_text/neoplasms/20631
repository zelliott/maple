Cathepsins B, H and L have been shown to participate in processes of tumor growth, vascularization, invasion and metastasis. Their levels in tumor tissue extracts can provide useful clinical information to predict disease-free and overall survival in breast, lung, colorectal, brain and head and neck cancer patients. Recently we have found that both cysteine cathepsins and their endogenous protein inhibitors stefins and cystatin C can also predict prognosis when measured extracellularly. In melanoma and colorectal cancer patients high serum levels of cathepsins B and H correlated with shorter survival. Similarly, increased extracellular levels of stefins A and B and cystatin C correlated significantly with high risk of adverse outcome in cancer patients. However, the cathepsin B/cystatin C complex was found to be less abundant in sera of patients with malignant tumors than in those with benign diseases or in healthy controls, suggesting an imbalance between the enzyme and its inhibitor in cancer patients.
