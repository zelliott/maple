The aim of the present study was to compare specific causes of death in Type 2 diabetic patients attending and not attending the diabetes center.

The study was carried out within the framework of the Verona Diabetes Study, a population-based survey of known diabetes prevalence with a 10-year mortality follow-up. On 31 December 1986, 7148 Type 2 diabetic patients were identified in Verona, north-east Italy. Among them 4047 regularly attended the diabetes center, while 3101 did not attend the diabetes center. On 31 December 1996, life status was determined and the underlying cause of death was coded according to the ICD-9. During the follow-up, 2896 subjects died. Difference in mortality from specific causes between attenders and non-attenders were evaluated by a Cox model, controlling for sex, age, diabetes treatment and place of residence (downtown vs suburbs).

Mortality was lower in subjects who attended the diabetes center (38. 6% vs 43.0%, p&lt;0.001). This phenomenon was mainly due to lower cardiovascular (p=0.002) and digestive (p=0.047) mortality.

These data support the conclusion that attending the diabetes center reduces cardiovascular and, to a lesser extent, digestive mortality.
