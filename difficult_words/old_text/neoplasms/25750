A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial was performed to investigate the effects of megestrol acetate (MA) on the quality of life (QoL), appetite, weight and survival of patients with advanced, incurable, hormone-insensitive cancer. QoL was assessed at the start of treatment and at 4, 8 and 12 weeks, using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 instrument. 255 patients were randomised to 320 mg of MA daily or placebo for 12 weeks. 244 patients were assessable at baseline, 190 at 4 weeks (placebo 94; MA 96), 150 at 8 weeks (placebo 69; MA 81) and 112 at 12 weeks (placebo 55; MA 57). A beneficial effect of MA on appetite loss was observed at week 4 (P &lt; 0.0001) and possibly at week 8 (P = 0.058). Further weight loss during treatment was significant only in the placebo group. In the first 8 weeks, changes in mean global QoL were small and similar in both groups. By 12 weeks the decrease in mean global QoL was more pronounced in the MA group (P = 0.028), which was related to a deterioration in physical function, while psychosocial function was not affected. Survival was not affected by MA, and side-effects were mild. The results show that MA has a beneficial effect on appetite and that it may retard weight loss with no adverse impact on survival and with mild toxicity. However, MA does not appear to improve global QoL as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30.
