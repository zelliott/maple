The End-of-Life Preferences Interview (ELPI) was developed with the purpose of supporting physicians in communicating with advanced cancer patients.

This study aimed to evaluate ELPI feasibility and compare home care/hospice (HC-H) vs. outpatient (OU) care settings.

Twenty-eight physicians were trained in the use of the ELPI and were asked to apply the new instrument in their daily clinical practice for two months. ELPI feasibility was evaluated through three indices: the percentage of eligible patients, the percentage of patients to whom the ELPI was proposed, and the percentage of completed interviews.

The 23 physicians participating in the data collection screened 633 patients, and 156 of them (25%, 95% confidence interval 21%-28%) were judged to be eligible. Eligibility in HC-H was lower than that in the OU setting (18% vs. 46%; P&lt;0.0001), whereas the differences were reduced when looking at patients to whom the ELPI was proposed (12% vs. 20%; P=0.017) and who completed the ELPI (8% vs. 18%; P&lt;0.001). The percentage of eligible patients refusing the interview was very low in the entire sample (1.9%).

Results indicate that discussing end-of-life preferences in an earlier disease phase, such as in the OU setting, could be preferable but that its accomplishment in this setting may be more difficult, mainly as a result of organizational reasons. This observation could indicate that the system is not yet ready to offer patients such an opportunity and although communication on these sensitive issues cannot be reduced to a procedure, the ELPI can become a useful tool to help physicians in accomplishing this difficult task.
