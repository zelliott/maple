The association of scleroderma and malignancy has been a source of controversy during recent years. Several mechanisms of interrelationship have been suggested in earlier reports. Recent long-term studies suggest an increased association-ratio of scleroderma and malignancy. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This paper reviews the mechanisms described in earlier studies and discusses their possible pathogenetic meaning for the interrelationship and the pathogenesis of scleroderma and neoplasia.
