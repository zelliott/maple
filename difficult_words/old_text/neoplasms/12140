The annual meeting of Cancer Immunotherapeutics held in Boston integrated a multi-disciplinary audience of scientists from academia and biotech companies, as well as venture capitalists, in an attempt to bring to the forefront the most thought-provoking approaches toward cancer immunotherapy as well as innovations in biotechnologies. The major focus of the meeting was to bring together investigators to discuss technologies that can enhance immune responsiveness. Major themes included the enhancement of T-cell recognition and killing by the addition of cytokines or through novel inhibitors of in vitro cell signalling factors. Many of the presentations were based on studies that may provide the groundwork for translation into the clinic. Another goal of this meeting was to foster collaborations among investigators to facilitate and extend current research objectives.
