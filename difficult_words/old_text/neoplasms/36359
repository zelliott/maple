It is well known that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzo (a) pyrene have carcinogenic properties and may cause many types of cancers in human populations. Genetic susceptibility might be due to variation in genes encoding for carcinogen metabolizing enzymes, such as cytochrome P-450 (CYP450). Our study aimed to investigate the effect of genetic polymorphisms of CYP1A1 (m1 and m2) on genetic damage in 115 coal-tar workers exposed to PAHs in their work place.

Genetic polymorphisms of CYP1A1 were determined by the PCR-RFLP method. Comet and buccal micronucleus assays were used to evaluate genetic damage among 115 coal tar workers and 105 control subjects.

Both CYP1A1 m1 and CYP1A1 m2 heterozygous and homozygous (wt/mt+mt/mt) variants individually as well as synergistically showed significant association (P&lt;0.05) with genetic damage as measured by tail moment (TM) and buccal micronuclei (BMN) frequencies in control and exposed subjects.

In our study we found significant association of CYP1A1 m1 and m2 heterozygous (wt/mt) +homozygous (mt/mt) variants with genetic damage suggesting that these polymorphisms may modulate the effects of PAH exposure in occupational settings.
