The advent of a centralized chemotherapy department at a single-specialty private clinic solved many existing problems, but created a significant new one--purchasing the increased amount of necessary chemotherapeutic drugs. Sufficient quantities became difficult to procure, the cost fluctuated inexplicably, and too often expired drugs were received. Doctors, nurses, and patients alike became more and more frustrated, and the problem threatened the viability of the department. In this case study, the author relates the process of entering into purchasing agreements with independent pharmaceutical companies and a wholesale supply house, and the results of this arrangement.
