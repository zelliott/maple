Drug metabolism enzymes (DME) play a significant role in drug detoxification and activation, which exert important effect on drug efficacy and sensitivity to toxicity. There is difference in expression and activity of DME between in tumor tissue and in non-tumor tissue. DME related with tumor chemotherapy are cytochrome P450 (CYP), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). The enzymes above are inducible and genetic polymorphic, thus with variable activity in individuals.
