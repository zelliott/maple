p53 antibodies have been found in sera of patients with breast and lung carcinomas and in children with B-lymphomas. We report here the presence of p53 antibodies in sera of patients with 11 different types of cancer. The frequency of seropositives for p53 varied among the different types of cancer, but a correlation with the frequency of p53 gene alteration was established. Using a powerful peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we demonstrated that the immune response of patients with p53 antibodies was restricted to a small subset of peptides localized in the amino and carboxy termini of p53, whatever the type of cancer. Given the similarities of the patterns of immune responses in patients with p53 antibodies and animals hyperimmunized with human p53, we propose that the p53 humoral response is the result of a self-immunization process which is itself the consequence of p53 protein accumulation in tumor cells.
