The purpose of this study was to examine the factors which affect the level of fatigue among patients participating in clinical trials in which this symptom had been assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30. Data were assembled from 2390 patients in ten clinical trials in which the QLQ-C30 had been used to assess baseline and on-study quality of life. The relationship between the level of fatigue reported by the patients on the fatigue scale of this questionnaire and patient and disease characteristics was assessed in univariate and multivariate cross-sectional analyses. In addition, changes in fatigue scores were compared in a longitudinal analysis among patients on two arms of an anti-emetic trial whose emesis control was markedly different. Baseline fatigue levels differed substantially among patients taking part in the different trials. Factors associated with greater fatigue severity on univariate analysis included: female gender, presence of metastatic disease, and poorer performance status. In addition, on multivariate analyses the oldest patients were found to have less fatigue, as were patients with breast cancer, while patients with ovarian and lung cancer experienced greater fatigue. Patients on the arm of the anti-emetic trial in which emesis was better controlled showed significantly less increase in fatigue after receiving chemotherapy. The fatigue scale of the QLQ-C30 appears to provide a useful approach to assessing this important symptom. The relationships found between fatigue and patient and disease characteristics need further exploration as does the degree to which the QLQ-C30 fully captures this dimension of quality of life.
