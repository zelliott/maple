We review the present knowledge of telomeres and telomerase with special attention to their role in cell proliferation, cellular senescence, and human aging. We summarize the functional aspects of telomerase in cancer, as well as its role as a useful diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker, and discuss possible approaches to telomerase inhibition as a target for cancer therapy.
