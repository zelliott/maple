A discussion of the history of substitutions in industrial solvent use is presented, and animal carcinogenicity studies with certain chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents are reviewed. The present knowledge on the association between occupational exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents and human carcinogenicity is summarized, including a critical review of 23 studies pertaining to human carcinogenicity. Several deficiencies are identified in these studies that make interpretation of the results uncertain, including poor characterization of exposures in qualitative and quantitative terms, the small numbers of deaths or cases, and short follow-up periods. Despite these weaknesses, we conclude that, when viewed collectively, the evidence strongly suggests that occupational exposures to chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents are associated with an excess human cancer risk. The literature supports an association between occupational exposures to chlorinated hydrocarbons and elevated risks of leukemia, lymphoma, and urinary tract cancer. Parental occupational exposures are consistently associated with an elevated childhood cancer risk in the offspring.
