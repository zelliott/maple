Mononuclear cells (MC) were found in suspensions prepared from twenty-one out of twenty-two solid human neoplasms. In three cases it was calculated that more than 1% of the MC could represent contamination by blood MC. Due to technical difficulties and blood lymphocyte contamination, eight cases were excluded from the study. MC could be separated from thirteen of the remaining fourteen tumours and in one tumour no MC were found. On average, 0.44 X 10(6) MC were obtained from each biopsy weighing 1-5 g. The MC were characterized with regard to markers for T and B lymphocytes. On average 41.0% of the MC were T and 18.2% B cells. There was no significant correlation between MC infiltration and tumour size or spread. In all patients blood MC were also isolated and characterized with regard to T (62.0%) and B lymphocytes (14.3%). The T/B ratio of tumour and blood lymphocytes corresponded in most cases. In two cases a markedly depressed T fraction was found within the tumour, whereas the T lymphocyte portions in the blood of these patients were within the normal range.
