In 1979 the National Cancer Institute, the Pan American Health Organization, and the Latin American Information and Documentation Center (Brazil) jointly sponsored the Latin American Cancer Information Project. This paper reports the objectives, development, and utilization of this service as it is administered by the National Health Information Documentation Center in Mexico. Evaluation of the project provides insight into problems of information dissemination in countries that are experiencing great economic instability.
