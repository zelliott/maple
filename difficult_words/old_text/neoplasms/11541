The febrile response is a complex physiologic reaction to disease involving a cytokine-mediated rise in body temperature, generation of acute-phase reactants, and activation of numerous endocrinologic and immunologic systems. Understanding the basic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon helps to formulate rational approaches to treatment and interventions. In this article, the authors review the basic pathophysiology of fever, its contributing etiologies, and management approaches based on current evidence.
