Tumor-specific immunity is partly linked to the observation that cancerous cells express some proteins that are not present in normal cells. In the past, one of the major problems for the development of immunotherapy approaches has been linked to the difficulty to identify the antigens which are the targets of the tumor-specific T cells. Recent progress in fundamental immunology, particularly concerning the understanding of the molecular basis of cellular immunity, has facilitated the identification of tumor-specific antigens. These results allow to study new therapeutic approaches today.
