The roles of vitamin B12 and folate in carcinogenesis are largely extensions of and linked to their roles in normal metabolism, particularly 1-carbon unit metabolism. A possible key area may be hypomethylation to "switch on" genes and methylation to "switch them off." Some vitamin analogues may act as antivitamins in these reactions, as may some vitamin-binding proteins. Others may act as specific delivery proteins. Using appropriate radioactive substrates and suspensions of vitamin-dependent normal and malignant cells, it may be possible to work out their positive and negative control of DNA synthesis.
