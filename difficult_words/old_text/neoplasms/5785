The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of nursing strategies to improve cancer pain management on hospital readmission for uncontrolled pain. Strategies include implementing a pain resource nurse program (PRN), making pain management a focus in the continuous quality improvement process of the institution and creating a supportive care service. Admissions were compared before and after implementation of the strategies. Results for 1989 to 1990 revealed 5772 total admission with 4.4% (255) admissions for uncontrolled pain; results for 1992 to 1993 revealed 4066 total admissions with 3.0% (121) admissions for uncontrolled pain. Findings indicate that strategies were effective in reducing the number of readmissions for uncontrolled pain.
