Activation of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells is critical for vaccine design. We have advanced a novel technology for enhancing activation of antigen-specific CD4+ T helper cells whereby a fragment of the MHC class II-associated invariant chain (Ii-Key) is linked to an MHC class II epitope. An HLA-DR4-restricted HPV16 E7 epitope, HPV16 E7(8-22), was used to create a homologous series of Ii-Key/HPV16 E7 hybrids testing the influence of spacer length on in vivo enhancement of HPV16 E7(8-22)-specific CD4+ T lymphocyte responses. HLA-DR4-tg mice were immunized with Ii-Key/HPV16 E7(8-22) hybrids or the epitope-only peptide HPV16 E7(8-22). As measured by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay of splenocytes from immunized mice, one of the Ii-Key/HPV16 E7(8-22) hybrids enhanced epitope-specific CD4+ T cell activation 5-fold compared to the HPV16 E7(8-22) epitope-only peptide. We further demonstrated that enhanced CD4+ T cell activation augments the CTL activity of a H-2D(b)-restricted HPV16 E7(49-57) epitope in HLA-DR4+ mice using an in vivo CTL assay. Binding assays indicated that the Ii-Key/HPV16 hybrid has increased affinity to HLA-DR4+ cells relative to the epitope-only peptide, which may explain its increased potency. In summary, Ii-Key hybrid modification of the HLA-DR4-restricted HPV16 E7(8-22) MHC class II epitope generates a potent immunotherapeutic peptide vaccine that may have potential for treating HPV16+ cancers in HLA-DR4+ patients.
