The parallel expression of ABH blood-group antigens and of the carcinoembryonic antigen was examined applying the biotin-streptavidin immunostaining system. Monoclonal antibodies to the ABH antigens newly produced by us and a polyclonal antibody to the carcinoembryonic antigen (Ortho) were used as primary antibodies. Human tumours derived from six different organs were studied. ABH antigens showed a heterogeneous expression. They were entirely missing in some neoplastic tissues and found in single or in clustered tumour cells in others. The staining for the carcinoembryonic antigen revealed stronger intensity and covered large malignant areas. The possible functions of ABH blood-group antigens as tumour-associated structures are discussed. A number of tumour-associated antigens have been identified which may serve to improve the early diagnostics of tumour processes in man. Recently, the blood-group antigens (BGA) from the ABO/H system have attracted the attention of many investigators who regard them as differentiation antigens and as tumour-associated structures. Oncogenesis is accompanied by a block in BGA biosynthesis as a result of an altered ontogenetical programme. This process leads to: a) deletion of BGA-structures in malignant cells; b) neoantigen expression (onco-developmental markers) and c) appearance of BGA-incompatible antigens. The aim of the present investigation is to examine the coexpression of A, B and H BGA and of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in malignant human tissues. Using the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to ABH-BGA newly produced in our laboratory, some insufficiently explored organs like the mammary gland and especially its metastases were also tested.
