The procedures for handling injectable antineoplastic drugs in comprehensive cancer centers in the U.S. are summarized. In May 1982, a survey was sent to directors of pharmacy at 27 institutions designated as comprehensive cancer centers. Some questions duplicated a 1979 survey, while others addressed points in recently published guidelines on handling antineoplastic medications. Representatives of 21 institutions responded. These institutions represented 13,638 beds, 1,848 of which were oncology beds. Seventeen institutions had written policies for the preparation of antineoplastics, but only nine had a training program. The pharmacist or pharmacy technician prepared these medications in 12 institutions. Ten institutions prepared antineoplastics in a vertical laminar-flow hood. Gloves and masks were worn by employees in 20 and 13 of the institutions, respectively. Six institutions in some way assessed the health of employees handling antineoplastics. Eleven institutions had written policies on disposal of antineoplastics; 13 institutions disposed of this waste separately. Ten institutions had a training program for administration of antineoplastics. Compared with 1979, the trend is toward increased protection of persons handling injectable antineoplastic agents, but the procedures used at comprehensive cancer centers are not uniform.
