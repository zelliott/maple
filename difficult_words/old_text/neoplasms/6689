Three basic approaches to the problem of DNA content in normal and malignant cells are presented. The literature analysis (48 references) indicates the possibility of diagnosis of malignant condition in some tissues on the basis of DNA content measurement if a high number of aneuploid cells non-characteristic for a given state are present in the sample. The question of the correlation between the DNA content and prognosis remains open until now. Although some approaches appear to be perspective at present, literature analysis does not give the evidence of feasibility of using the flow methods for massive screening.
