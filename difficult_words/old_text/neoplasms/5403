Recent advances in the molecular genetics of cancer have created new opportunities for behavioral scientists interested in decision-making, risk communication, and health behavior. As part of a National Cancer Institute-sponsored workshop, behavioral scientists participated in breakout groups charged with generating suggestions for research priorities. The following five research priorities were identified for the area of genetic testing for cancer susceptibility: (1) enhancing informed decision-making about whether to be tested, (2) improving methods of cancer risk communication, (3) examining the psychosocial, clinical, and economic outcomes of testing, (4) evaluating the efficacy of psychological and behavioral interventions, and (5) evaluating approaches to prevent cancer in mutation carriers. Across each of these areas, family issues, ethnic and cultural issues, and economic implications should be evaluated.
