This study was conducted to provide baseline information about the awareness, attitude, and willingness of oncology healthcare providers (HCPs) to recommend quality-of-life cancer education and support services to their patients.

A brief survey questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 2000 physicians, nurses, and social workers who were active members of their respective oncology associations.

A total of 1241 questionnaires were returned (62% reply rate), resulting in a final sample of 1180 HCPs (61% response rate). Among HCPs who referred patients to cancer organizations, the American Cancer Society (ACS; 83%), the National Cancer Institute (NCI; 55%), and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society ([formerly Leukemia Society of America] 42%) ranked at the top. More than 70% of HCPs indicated that they had heard about specific ACS programs and services or the NCI information hotline. Less than 60% of HCPs recommended or thought these same services were helpful to patients. Awareness, referrals, and attitudes toward cancer support services among HCPs were significantly related (P &lt;.001). Qualitative comments qualified quantitative results.

Although a surprising number of HCPs were aware of support services, fewer recommended or reported satisfaction with these services. HCPs' referrals and attitudes toward cancer psychosocial support services may be improved by assembling a concise directory of locally available resources, directing this information to HCPs who refer directly to cancer organizations, improving collaboration between agencies, increasing staff support, and targeting particular services in specific areas of the country for program monitoring and development.
