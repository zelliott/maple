The control of intra-arterial chemotherapy by selective conventional and xero-angiographic exploration of the external carotid artery is reported. With the aid of a catheter inserted into the superior thyroid, facial or super-facial temporal artery, all the main branches of the external carotid artery can be depicted. Xeroangiography in the area of the external carotid artery is a new method on which no data could be found in the literature. Anatomical variations of the vascular system and vascular lesions caused by surgery, a tumour, or intra-arterial chemotherapy are better demonstrated by xeroradiography. The bones and the soft parts are well depicted at the same time in the xeroradiographic pictures; thus the bony masses of the facial and petrous regions, together with the vessels on the bones, in the bones and in the soft parts are visible on one and the same picture.
