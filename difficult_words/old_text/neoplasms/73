Within the last decade, significant advances have been made both in treating children with cancer and in providing proper nutrition support. Oncologic treatment and nutrition research and their application to the nutrition care of children with cancer are reviewed. Quality nutrition care is now possible because of an improved understanding of (a) the prevalence and significance of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) in high-risk groups, (b) the staging and assessment of nutritional status, and (c) the efficacy and limitations of nutrition support options. Nutrition staging, assessment, and support should be integrated into treatment protocols for children with neoplastic diseases. Common risk factors for the development of PEM have been identified from serial monitoring of newly diagnosed children with a variety of tumors. Certain tumor types and their treatment can be classified within either low or high nutritional risk groups. A comprehensive nutrition program (intense nutrition counseling, favorite nutritious foods) is preferred for low nutritional risk groups but is ineffective in preventing or reversing PEM in high-risk groups. For high-risk patients, central parenteral nutrition (CPN) is the method of choice as a relatively short-term but important support measure that allows children to withstand long intervals of intense treatment during periods of growth and development. Current data suggest that bone marrow suppression may be attenuated and treatment tolerance improved with the use of CPN in selected children with advanced cancer (e.g., acute nonlymphocytic leukemia or advanced neuroblastoma).
