Tyrosine kinases are associated with the cytoplasmic domains of growth factor receptors as well as oncoproteins and many have the potential to cause transformation if mutated or hyperexpressed. Tyrosine kinases therefore represent an excellent target for the development of cancer drugs. A large number of inhibitors have now been identified and many show promising cytostatic activity, particularly using in vitro models. Some in vivo activity has been reported. Progress with various structural classes is reviewed. It is not clear whether specific or broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be developed as potential anticancer drugs. It does seem likely, however, that tyrosine inhibitors will enter clinical trial in cancer patients.
