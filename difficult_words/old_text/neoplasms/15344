A prospective, 1-year study was performed to determine the causes of an ESR greater than or equal to 100 in patients admitted to a general medical ward in Harare, Zimbabwe. An ESR greater than or equal to 100 was found in 101 (12%) patients. Infection (46 patients) was the commonest cause, followed by malignancy (25), connective tissue disease (17), renal disease (8) and liver disease (5). The frequency of an ESR greater than or equal to 100 in these diagnostic groups was infection (28%), malignancy (44%), connective tissue disease (71%), renal disease (30%) and liver disease (24%). Pneumonia was the commonest infection diagnosed and the commonest cause of a markedly elevated ESR. Although myeloma was only the second commonest malignancy diagnosed it was the commonest malignancy causing an ESR greater than or equal to 100. In the largest group, infection, there was a significantly increased mortality in patients with an ESR greater than or equal to 100.
