Dysregulation of mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor receptor tyrosine kinase pathway leads to cell proliferation, protection from apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. It can be dysregulated through overexpression, constitutive activation, gene amplification, ligand-dependent activation or mutation. New drugs targeting various mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor pathways are being investigated with promising results.
