The pharmacokinetics of 7-con-O-methylnogarol were investigated by HPLC assay with fluorometric detection in nine cancer patients with normal hepatic and renal function, after a 2-h infusion of 160 or 200 mg/m2. The drug disappeared from plasma biexponentially with a mean elimination half-life of 38 +/- 3 h; the mean apparent volume of distribution and the plasma clearance were 805 +/- 91 1/m2 and 14 +/- 2 1/h per m2. Within 48 h of administration, urinary excretion of the drug and its metabolite 7-con-O-methyl-N-demethylnogarol accounted for 2%-15% and 0.1%-6% of the dose, respectively. Neither 7-con-O-methylnogarol nor its N-demethyl derivative was conjugated with glucuronic acid or sulfate in detectable amounts.
