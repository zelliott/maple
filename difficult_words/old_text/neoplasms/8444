Nutrition therapy is accepted to represent an important part of therapeutic strategy in cancer patients. In correlation to general clinical state, nutritional condition and anti-cancer therapy, nutrition has to be planned according to a stepwise concept. Under certain circumstances, enteral tube feeding is indicated. This procedure is affected by tumor lesions, digestion, resorption and tumor related metabolic disorders, and side effects of particulate anti-cancer therapy. In tumor patients, elemental (chemically defined) diets are predominant. Polymeric diets, however, occasionally represent another possible nutritional tool.
