After the first 5 years of life, cancer is one of the three most common causes of death. Most investigations of cancer pain have shown that 50-70% of patients suffer needlessly. Pain may be due to the tumor or a co-existant benign pain syndrome. Methods of pain management include: 1) neurolytic blockade: stellate ganglion block, celiac plexus block, lumbar sympathetic block, epidural phenol, subarachnoid neurolysis; and 2) non-pharmacologic methods: radiofrequency thermocoagulation lumbar sympathectomy, transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS), dorsal column stimulation (DCS). In summary, we utilize every possible combination of therapeutic modalities for cancer pain management. With so many safe procedures available, we encourage the primary physician to refer patients early in their disease process. Neurolytic procedures should be performed prior to initiation of high dose narcotic therapy, radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery when possible.
