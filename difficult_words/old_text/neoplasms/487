Proton relaxation rates in plasma from cancer patients tend to be lower than those for healthy people, whilst illnesses other than cancer produce relaxation rates higher on the average than those for healthy people. These differences are not large enough for diagnostic purposes but might, perhaps, prove useful for monitoring the progress of cancer treatment. The experimental accuracy needed for this purpose is discussed, as are the causes of experimental error.
