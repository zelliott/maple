A pioneer of oncogene research, Hidesaburo Hanafusa, Emeritus Director of the Osaka Bioscience Institute and Emeritus Professor of the Rockefeller University in New York, passed away on 15 March of this year in Japan. For his seminal works in cancer research during six decades (1950s until now), he received a number of awards including the Lasker Award, the Asahi Prize, the Ricketts Award, the Clowes Award, The Order of Culture (Bunka Kunsho in Japan) and the General Motors Sloan Award. I would like to provide a summary of his many contributions to research on viral and cellular oncogenes in order to appreciate the significance of his work on our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer and the implications for diagnosis and treatment.
