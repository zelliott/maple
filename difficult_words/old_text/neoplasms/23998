In the framework of the ITACARE project, a cooperative investigation conducted on the data from the Italian population-based cancer registries, survival of patients with childhood malignant neoplasms was studied. The study included 1,768 cases diagnosed at age 0-14 plus 29 osteosarcoma cases diagnosed at age 15-19. Cases were collected over the period 1978-1989, or more limited periods for some participating registries. A total of 1,138 cases were from the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont and 659 from the registries operating in the provinces of Varese, Parma, Modena, Forli and Ravenna, Florence, Latina, Ragusa and in the cities of Genova and Torino (the last contributed only for bone neoplasm diagnosed at age 15-19). Overall 5-year survival was 54% for malignancies diagnosed in 1978-1981, 60% for the period 1982-1985; and 69% for the period 1986-1989. The range among registries of 5-year survival for cases diagnosed in 1986-1989 was 55-78%. Most diagnostic categories presented an improved prognosis for the cases diagnosed more recently. For cases diagnosed in 1986-1989, 5-year survival was: 74% for acute lymphatic leukaemia, 40% for acute non-lymphatic leukaemia, 65% for central nervous system neoplasms (76% for astrocytoma, 75% for ependymoma and 85% for medulloblastoma), 66% for osteosarcoma, 55% for Ewing's sarcoma, 87% for Hodgkin's disease, 64% for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 74% for rhabdomyosarcoma, 64% for neuroblastoma, 78% for nephroblastoma and 100% for retinoblastoma. Italian survival was similar to that observed in other population-based surveys in the UK and USA.
