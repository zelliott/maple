This article discusses the value and importance of support groups for people living with chronic cancer. It is a primer for the professional mental health practitioner interested in leading a support group. Group formation, screening, open versus closed groups, size, co-facilitation, duration and phases-beginning, middle and end will be discussed. Leadership, structure, and group dynamics are explained using case examples to highlight the issues. The effect of the deterioration and death of group members on both the facilitators and the group's members will be explored. The paper ends with a discussion of counter-transference, stress, self-care and resiliency.
