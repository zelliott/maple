MHC class II molecules presenting MHC class II restricted antigens play an important role in the activation of CD4+ T cells, which are the central orchestrating cells of an immune response. This review focuses on the particular role of MHC class II molecules in tumour immunology. The MHC class II antigen presentation pathway and the expression of MHC class II molecules on tumour cells related to clinical outcome is discussed. Improving the MHC class II tumour antigen presentation pathway, for instance by downregulation of the invariant chain or modulation of HLA-DO expression, offers many opportunities for developing new modalities of immunotherapy.
