This perspective on the report by Rogozina and colleagues (beginning on page 712 in this issue of the journal) reviews mechanisms that may underlie inhibitory effects of dietary restriction on tumor growth in the mouse mammary tumor virus transforming growth factor alpha (MMTV-TGF-alpha) breast cancer model and comments on the potential clinical relevance of these mechanisms. The inhibitory effect of caloric restriction on carcinogenesis and tumor growth in rodent models is a classic finding that is receiving increasing attention. In some experimental models, the magnitude of the effect is significant, rivaling what can be achieved by pharmacologic approaches to cancer prevention or treatment. Major challenges include defining the underlying mechanisms and determining the clinical relevance of laboratory models of caloric restriction.
