The objectives of this study were to assess the toxicity and immunological response induced by the intradermal (i.d) administration of tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs).

Patients with stage IV solid malignancies were treated in cohorts that received 10(6), 10(7), and 10(8) DCs i.d. every 2 weeks for three vaccines. Each vaccine was composed of a mixture of half DCs pulsed with autologous tumor lysate and the other half with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) harvested 1 month after the last immunization was compared with pretreatment PBMCs for immunological response. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactivity to tumor antigen and KLH was also assessed.

Fourteen patients received all three vaccines and were evaluable for toxicity and/or immunological monitoring. There were no grade 3 or 4 toxicities associated with the vaccines or major evidence of autoimmunity. Local accumulation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were found at the vaccination sites. There was a significant proliferative response of PBMCs to KLH induced by the vaccine. In 5 of 6 patients, the vaccine resulted in increased IFN-gamma production by PBMCs to KLH in an ELISPOT assay. Using the same assay, 3 of 7 patients' PBMCs displayed increased IFN-gamma production in response to autologous tumor lysate. One patient with melanoma also was observed to have an increased frequency of MART-1- and gp100-reactive CD8(+) T cells after vaccination. By delayed-type hypersensitivity testing, 8 of 9 and 4 of 10 patients demonstrated reactivity to KLH and autologous tumor, respectively. Two patients with melanoma experienced a partial and a minor response, respectively.

The administration of tumor lysate-pulsed DCs is nontoxic and capable of inducing immunological response to tumor antigen. Additional studies are necessary to improve tumor rejection responses.
