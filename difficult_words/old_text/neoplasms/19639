Interleukin-12 (IL-12) shows strong antineoplasm properties.

of the study was to evaluate concentration of IL-2 in children's serum with malignant disease, association cytokines with the presence allergic reaction.

We analysed 100 patients with malignant disease, and/or with allergy (NA+/NA-, respectively), 100 children with allergic disease (A). The control group was 48 healthy cases (K). In all cases were performed skin prick-tests. Concentration of total IgE (t-IgE), IL-12 and INFgamma determined by using ELISA method.

T-IgE concentration was to higher in children with allergy disease compared with healthy cases. To low concentration of IL-12 observed in children's group with malignant and allergy disease compared with the other cases ((NA+) = 123,7 pg/ml, (NA-) = 181,7 pg/ ml, (A) = 167,7 pg/ml, (K) = 154,2 pg/ml, Me respectively). Higher point of INFgamma observed in children with malignant and allergic disease compared with groups with malignant disease but without allergic disease, allergic disease and healthy cases (Me = 0,95 pg/ml, Me = 0.0 pg/ml, Me = 0,28 pg/ml, Me = 0,55 pg/ml, respectively).

Coexistence malignant process and allergy describes the interference of synthesis IL-12 and increase t-IgE thus prevelance of humoral reaction.
