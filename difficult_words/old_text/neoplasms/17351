Advances in diagnostics and targeted therapies during the past decade have changed how oncology is viewed. "Stratified medicine" has emerged from the accumulated evidence garnered from matching targeted therapies with tumor molecular aberrations. Concomitantly, current knowledge derived from large-scale, massively parallel sequencing technologies and global research initiatives such as the international 1000 Genomes Project, the Cancer Genome Atlas, the International Cancer Genome Consortium, and publicly available catalogs such as the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer have illuminated the utility of understanding the molecular basis of cancer through genome analysis. In addition, multiple collaborative efforts are widening the possibility of universally personalizing cancer care. Although several key challenges of personalized cancer medicine (PCM) need to be addressed, some pilot studies are transforming the way we analyze tumor tissue molecular aberrations, design clinical trials, and measure treatment efficacy. Taken together, these pilot studies are paving the way for clinical trials that are designed to empirically test the concept of PCM. In this paper, we describe lessons learned from the first pilot initiatives of PCM and how this knowledge is being used to design novel clinical trials.
