To determine the prevalence of use of alternative diets and other alternative therapies by cancer patients

Descriptive, questionnaire.

During one week, a written survey was held among all 429 patients visiting the outpatient cancer clinic of the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Patients were asked about their use of alternative therapies both current and in the past, their reasons for using these therapies and the extra expenses involved. A total of 405 patients participated in the study.

In all, 121 (30%) patients used an alternative therapy. Of the 51 patients (13%) using an alternative diet, 63% were using the Houtsmuller diet. Twelve years ago, 8% of patients used an alternative diet, which was in most cases the Moerman diet; the Houtsmuller diet did not yet exist. Seventy patients (17%) were using other alternative therapies, such as homeopathy, vitamins, herbs and paranormal therapies. The costs of especially the Houtsmuller diet, including supplements, were considerable: patients paid about Dfl. 480 monthly, expenses not covered by insurance. More than half the patients using a diet believed it would cure them, delay tumour progress or both.

Compared with 12 years ago, the number of cancer patients using alternative diets and other alternative therapies had increased by about 80%. The Houtsmuller diet was used by 63% of patients using alternative diets and had, consequently, supplanted the Moerman diet.
