(1) The standard treatment for symptomatic anaemia due to cytotoxic chemotherapy is blood transfusion. (2) The licensing terms for epoetin alfa have been extended to cover the treatment of anaemia induced by all cytotoxic drugs, no longer only by platinum salts. The licensing terms for epoetin beta have been extended to cover some haematological malignancies. (3) The clinical file on epoetin alfa contains data from 8 placebo-controlled double-blind trials in patients with anaemia. Four trials showed a significant reduction (of 12-35%) in the number of patients transfused during the second and third months of treatment with epoetin alfa. (4) Quality of life was mentioned in only two trial reports. In one, the score was significantly better on epoetin alfa than on placebo, but the practical repercussions of this difference are unclear. In the other trial there was no significant difference between the groups. (5) The clinical file on epoetin beta contains data only from unblended dose-finding studies showing a favourable impact on the haemoglobin level and transfusion requirements. (6) The preventive effect of the two epoetins has not been compared with that of alternative treatments. (7) The main known risks of epoetin are arterial hypertension and thrombosis. Stimulation of tumour growth cannot be ruled out. (8) Epoetin beta has a practical advantage, in that it can be stored for a few days at room temperature. (9) In practice, epoetin is the standard treatment of anaemia after chemotherapy, outside emergency situations.
