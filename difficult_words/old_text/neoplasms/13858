We have applied fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to assess the presence of numerical chromosome aberrations in fresh specimens of human solid tumors of varying histology. For this purpose, a set of 12 biotinylated chromosome-specific, repetitive alpha-satellite DNA probes (for chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, X and Y) were hybridized directly to isolated interphase nuclei. Utilizing this approach, we found numerical chromosome changes in all tumors. FISH ploidy profiles were in accordance with flow cytometric DNA histograms of these tumor cells.
