ImmunoPET is a non-invasive imaging technology based on tracking and quantification of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments and peptides in vivo. The knowledge of distribution and expression levels of a given receptor is a key for successful receptor targeted cancer therapy. ImmunoPET performed with probes with high affinity and specificity to a given receptor aspires to be a method for obtaining comprehensive information about current in vivo status of the targeted receptor. This review describes methods for radiolabeling of peptides, monoclonal antibodies, and antibody fragments for immunoPET and highlights the recently reported pre-clinical and clinical applications of immunoPET in receptor targeted therapy.
