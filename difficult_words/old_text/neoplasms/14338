Edits are a standardized tool for cancer registry data quality. The development of edits is overseen by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries Edits Workgroup. Edit software tools are supported by the National Program of Cancer Registries. Collaborative Stage (CS) edits are available to support registrar coding of the CS data items. Edits enforce consistent coding across multiple related data items. Understanding where to look for information on edit logic and how to read the edit documents will enable registrars to correctly resolve data discrepancies identified by edit reports.
