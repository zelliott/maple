Giant cell arteritis (Horton disease) is of growing significance among conditions met in elderly patients. Typical forms are no longer overlooked but occult or incomplete forms, in which one or more characteristic features are lacking, are misleading and may result in a dramatically effective therapeutic decision being deferred. These paucisymptomatic or misleading forms of giant cell arteritis are discussed with reference to 37 personal cases and a review of the medical literature. They have been categorized into ocular, febrile or anemic monosymptomatic forms, extraocular ischemic forms and pseudotumoral forms. Correct diagnosis is worthwhile, in order to avoid the serious consequences of overlooked disease and unnecessary traumatic investigations.
