Cancer pain significantly affects the diagnosis, quality of life and survival of patients with cancer. During the past decade, preclinical and clinical data has begun to provide insight into the mechanisms that drive and mask cancer pain and the mechanisms by which anti-neoplastic agents induce peripheral neuropathy. Developing a mechanism-based understanding and mechanism-based therapies to treat cancer-associated pain and sensory neuropathy, and incorporating these into mainstream cancer research and therapy, will be crucial to improving the quality of life and survival of patients with cancer.
