The aim of this research was to reveal, from the perspective of the "lived experience" shared by cancer patients and their nurses, how patients facing death create lived experience in the context of palliative care. This research also aims to elucidate the meaning nurses find in patients' experiences while caring for their patients.

The participants in this study were cancer patients who were given opportunities to discuss events and concerns in their daily lives, with the interactions guided by the researchers. Transcriptions of conversations with the patients were analyzed using the method for empirical data classification set forth by Giorgi (1985) with appropriate modification.

This study found that when the nurse correctly interprets the meaning of the concerns (Heidegger, 1962) of the patient facing death and shares that meaning with the patient, fundamental questions naturally arise for the patient. Answering these questions becomes possible only through interactions that require the reexamination of the values of the patient and the nurse.

This research elucidates the spiritual pain experienced by cancer patients and discusses opportunities for nurses to address the spiritual care of these patients.
