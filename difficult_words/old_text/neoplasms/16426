Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) refers to the delivery of irradiation at surgery. A large single dose of irradiation is delivered to a surgically defined area, while uninvolved and dose-limiting tissues are displaced, the final goal of IORT being enhanced locoregional tumour control. IORT is used in most modern protocol studies as a boost radiation component of multidisciplinary treatment approaches. More recently, high activity radiation sources or mobile operating room treatment machines are used to facilitate the IORT procedure. Clinical experiences have shown that IORT may improve local control and disease-free survival, especially when used in adjuvant setting, combined with external beam irradiation in some neoplasms such as cancer of the stomach, pancreas, colorectum, and soft tissue sarcoma.
