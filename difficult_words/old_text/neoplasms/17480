The basic abnormality of neurofibromatosis consists not only of a maldevelopment of the neuroectoderm but also of the mesoderm. Therefore any organ or system of the body may be involved. Following a short clinical review of the central (acoustic) and peripheral type the well known and the more unusual radiographic findings are summarized. They include cranial and intracranial manifestations (orbitosphenoid dysplasia, bone defects of the skull, acoustic neuroma, glioma of the optic nerve and chiasm, meningioma), spinal lesions (scoliosis, vertebral scalloping, meningocele, neuroma, ependymoma), skeletal abnormalities (pseudarthrosis), cardiovascular manifestations, pulmonary fibrosis, tumors of the gastrointestinal and urinary tract and different endocrinopathies. Some of the roentgenologic symptoms are very characteristic and allow definitive diagnosis.
