Spores of the apathogenic clostridium butyricum (M 55) germinate after intravenous application in mammalians in tumor tissue only. On the basis of these earlier findings a diagnostic and prognostic procedure, used so far, namely the agglutinationtest with vegatative forms of this clostridium was improved by creation of a hemagglutination reaction. With different methods some different hemagglutinins have been isolated. Their efficacy was tested against specific antibodies in rabbits and mice. The higher sensitivity of these procedures was demonstrated.
