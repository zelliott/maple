Antibodies against cell-surface determinants present on limited types of normal cells, such as differentiation antigens, offer an approach to detecting and characterizing tumor cells that is well-suited to fluorescence flow cytometry. This paper reviews the technology involved and its application in the study of hematologic malignancies, especially in the detection and characterization of tumor cells in leukemias and lymphomas.
