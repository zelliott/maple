A growing body of literature supports a possible role for beta-carotene in the prevention of human cancer. The most scientifically rigorous method for testing the hypothesis that beta-carotene has chemopreventive properties is with intervention trials, several of which are ongoing or soon to be initiated. Connecticut will be actively involved in three of these trials. This article reviews and critically evaluates the evidence supporting a role for beta-carotene in the prevention of human cancer, including animal studies, cell culture studies, epidemiologic studies, and intervention trials, and concludes with a brief description of chemoprevention research involving beta-carotene in Connecticut.
