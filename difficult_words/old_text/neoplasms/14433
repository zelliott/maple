Chronobiology, aided by modern automatic instrumentation for the monitoring of marker rhythms and the administration of complex therapeutic schedules on the one hand and, on the other hand, by appropriate software for data analysis, exploits the organism's time-structure along several frequency scales. Available evidence shows that several modes of treatment, namely radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, can all be improved by timing. Even more important is the mapping of rhythms in health, for a comparison of rhythm characteristics between individuals at low or high risk with respect to a given disease; it may ultimately lead to a rational chronobiologic approach to cancer prevention.
