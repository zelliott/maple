Doxorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in 33 patients with solid tumours who received intravenous doses of 20-320 mg m(-2) HPMA copolymer bound doxorubicin (PK1) in a phase I study. Since assay constraints limited the data at lower doses, conventional analysis was not feasible and a 'population approach' was used. Bound concentrations were best described by a biexponential model and further analyses revealed a small influence of dose or weight on V1 but no identifiable effects of age, body surface area, renal or hepatic function. The final model was: clearance (Q) 0.194 I h(-1); central compartment volume (V1) 4.48 x (1+0.00074 x dose (mg)) I; peripheral compartment volume (V2) 7.94 I; intercompartmental clearance 0.685 I h(-1). Distribution and elimination half-lives had median estimates of 2.7 h and 49 h respectively. Free doxorubicin was present at most sampling times with concentrations around 1000 times lower than bound doxorubicin values. Data were best described using a biexponential model and the following parameters were estimated: apparent clearance 180 I h-(-1); apparent V1 (I) 1450 x (1+0.0013 x dose (mg)), apparent V2 (I) 21 300 x (1-0.0013 x dose (mg)) x (1+2.95 x height (m)) and apparent Q 6950 I h(-1). Distribution and elimination half-lives were 0.13 h and 85 h respectively.
