In this retrospective non controlled trial we evaluated the incidence of sepsis in cancer patients in two different periods (January-June 2003 versus January-June 2004). The main difference in these two periods was that in our oncology department we changed from systemic chemotherapy to loco-regional chemotherapy using less myelosuppressive drugs and developed the domiciliary assistance. The aim of the study was to assess the incidence of sepsis in order to demonstrate a reduction of the infection related to the change of chemotherapy. In addition, this study may be able to describe the epidemiology of sepsis in cancer patients afferent to our oncology department. The incidence of sepsis was reduced in the second period from 24.3% to 6.2%. The pathogens more frequently isolated in this study were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) followed by Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Less invasive therapy may reduce infective complication of chemotherapy. The epidemiology of sepsis may be very helpful to design empiric therapeutic protocol for febrile patients that have received chemotherapy.
