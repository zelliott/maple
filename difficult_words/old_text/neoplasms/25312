During the course of clinical investigation of partly purified human leucocyte interferon (IFN) prepared at the Finnish Red Cross (PIF), neutralising IgG antibodies to human leucocyte IFN were detected in the sera of 3 patients with cancer. In 2 of these patients, the antibodies were detected in serum before treatment with PIF. In the third patient antibodies developed during the course of treatment. Antibody titres against six recombinant human leucocyte IFN sub-types and one recombinant hybrid human leucocyte IFN were different in the 3 patients.
