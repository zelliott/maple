In order to clarify the optimal timing for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection, PBSC collection records of 323 children who were scheduled to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation from two study periods differing in the timing of PBSC collection were analyzed. In the early study period (March 1998 to August 2007, n=198), PBSC collection was initiated when the peripheral WBC count exceeded 1,000/µL during recovery from chemotherapy. Findings in this study period indicated that initiation of PBSC collection at a higher WBC count might result in a greater CD34(+) cell yield. Therefore, during the late study period (September 2007 to December 2012, n=125), PBSC collection was initiated when the WBC count exceeded 4,000/µL. Results in the late study period validated our conclusion from the early study period. Collection of a higher number of CD34(+) cells was associated with a faster hematologic recovery after transplant in the late study period. Initiation of PBSC collection at WBC count &gt; 4,000/µL was an independent factor for a greater CD34(+) cell yield. In conclusion, PBSC collection at a higher WBC count is associated with a greater CD34(+) cell yield, and consequently a faster hematologic recovery after transplant.
