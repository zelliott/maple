This clinical trial was performed to study the effects of intravenously (IV) administered recombinant human (rh) erythropoietin (EPO) at escalating doses (150, 300, and 450 U/kg, administered as an IV bolus injection, twice weekly, for 6, 4, and 4 weeks, respectively) in five patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Ig NHL) and bone marrow involvement and one patient with multiple myeloma (MM). All patients were anemic due to underlying disease. None of the patients had a history of bleeding, hemolysis, renal insufficiency, or other disorders causing anemia in addition to bone marrow infiltrating malignancy. Endogenous EPO serum levels were significantly increased in all patients (74 to 202 mU/mL). Five patients (one MM, four small-cell lymphocytic [SCLC] NHL) showed a dramatic increase of hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hk) and RBC count becoming obvious on the second EPO dose level. Initial ferritin serum values, which were high mostly due to polytransfusion, were significantly reduced in responding patients. Erythropoiesis of one patient with extensive follicular mixed (fm) NHL did not respond to EPO treatment. Platelet (PLT) count increase (greater than 75% above starting levels) during and following EPO therapy was observed in one patient with MM. Adverse events due to EPO therapy have not been recorded. These findings point out a previously unrecognized capacity of EPO given at pharmacologic doses to stimulate erythropoiesis in patients with anemia due to bone marrow infiltration by neoplastic lymphocytes in spite of enhanced endogenous EPO expression.
