The complement system and Toll-like receptors (TLR) are key innate defense systems which might interact synergistically on dendritic cells (DC) to reinforce adaptive immunity. In a previous work, we found that the extra domain A from fibronectin EDA (an endogenous ligand for TLR4) can favour antigen delivery to DC and induce their maturation. Given the potential of anaphylatoxins to cause inflammation and activation of myeloid cells, we hypothesized that a fusion protein between EDA, and anaphylatoxins C3a, C4a or C5a together with an antigen might improve the immunogenicity of the antigen. Naked DNA immunization with a construct expressing the fusion protein between C5a, EDA and the cytotoxic T cell epitope SIINFEKL from ovalbumin, induced strong antigen specific T cell responses. The purified recombinant fusion protein EDA-SIINFEKL-C5a induced activation of dendritic cells, the production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and stimulated antigen presenting cell migration and NK cell activation. As compared to EDA-SIINFEKL, the fusion protein EDA-SIINFEKL-C5a did not induce the production of the immunosuppressive molecules IL-10, CCL17, CCL1, CXCL12 or XCL1 by DC. Moreover, EDA-SIINFEKL-C5a induced strong specific T cell responses in vivo and protected mice against E.G7-OVA tumor growth more efficiently than EDA-SIINFEKL or SIINFEKL-C5a recombinant proteins. Our results suggest that fusion proteins containing EDA, the anaphylatoxin C5a and the antigen may serve as a suitable strategy for the development of anti-tumor or anti-viral vaccines.
