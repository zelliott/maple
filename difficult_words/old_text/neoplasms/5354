Nurse-controlled analgesia (NCA) using a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device has been described for intensive care and postoperative use. This report describes the effective use of this technique for severe episodic and procedural pain in four children with advanced malignancy and high opioid requirements where conventional parenteral analgesia had been inadequate. Both morphine and fentanyl were used. Average duration of NCA was 6.75 days (range 4-12).
