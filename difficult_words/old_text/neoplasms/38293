The use of agents that modulate tumour angiogenesis has led to improvements in patient care, and tumour angiogenesis remains an important area for cancer research. As more anti-angiogenic agents proceed through clinical development, it is important to consider what we now know about the effects these agents have on the tumour vasculature and what aspects of tumour angiogenesis remain to be elucidated.
