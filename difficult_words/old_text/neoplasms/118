Mononuclear phagocytes, a specialized cell lineage comprising bone-marrow precursors, blood monocytes and tissue macrophages, can interact with blood coagulation mechanisms with resulting thrombus formation or extravascular fibrin accumulation. Such procoagulant activity is usually activation dependent and requires interaction of the cells with immune or nonimmune stimuli. In the former case (e.g., alloantigens, soluble protein antigens) collaboration of mononuclear phagocytes with T lymphocytes is necessary and is mediated by cell-to-cell contact or lymphokines. Prototype of a direct acting stimulus is bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Mononuclear phagocyte procoagulant activity is expressed in the form of cell membrane-bound or released factors which display molecular heterogeneity. They include the initiator of the extrinsic clotting pathway, tissue factor, known clotting proteases such as factors V and VII, and novel proteolytic enzymes including prothrombinase and a factor X activator. Mononuclear phagocyte procoagulants are pathogenetically involved in generalized disorders with intravascular coagulation and thromboembolic phenomena. These disorders, exemplified by the Shwartzman reaction and possibly by paraneoplastic thromboembolism, are initiated by blood monocytes. Extravascular fibrin deposition can be initiated by tissue-infiltrating monocytes and macrophages in disease states such as acute renal allograft failure and solid tumours.
