The incidence of cancer is continuing to rise in Iran. More people are now surviving cancer. They may require different kinds of care and support from those traditionally available. The expression of needs and how they are met in different cultural contexts can inform local assessment of needs and provide insights for initiatives in holistic cancer care. This study explores Iranian cancer patients' needs from patients' perspective. A qualitative design that consists of interviews, field notes and specified demographic information was used. Thirty participants were interviewed during the summer and autumn of 2009. The study conducted in a cancer research centre (Omid Hospital) in Mashhad, Iran. Interviews were analysed using a content analysis method. The results indicate that Iranian cancer patients are more likely to suffer from the impact of cancer on their daily life than physical symptoms related to the disease and its treatment. Cancer affected several aspects of their daily living, including their financial situation, ability to work and family life. Cost of treatment and psychosocial distress were the two aspects rated by respondents to be the most affected. Iranian cancer patients need holistic care which covers all the influences that affect their personal's life.
