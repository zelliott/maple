To describe the chest computed tomography findings for severe influenza H1N1 infection in a series of hospitalized neutropenic cancer patients.

We performed a retrospective systematic analysis of chest computed tomography scans for eight hospitalized patients with fever, neutropenia, and confirmed diagnoses of influenza H1N1. The clinical data had been prospectively collected.

Six of eight patients (75%) developed respiratory failure and required intensive care. Prolonged H1N1 shedding was observed in the three mechanically ventilated patients, and overall hospital mortality in our series was 25%. The most frequent computed tomography findings were ground-glass opacity (all patients), consolidation (7/8 cases), and airspace nodules (6/8 cases) that were frequently moderate or severe. Other parenchymal findings were not common. Five patients had features of pneumonia, two had computed tomography findings compatible with bronchitis and/or bronchiolitis, and one had tomographic signs of chronicity.

In this series of neutropenic patients with severe influenza H1N1 infection, chest computed tomography demonstrated mainly moderate or severe parenchymatous disease, but bronchiolitis was not a common feature. These findings associated with febrile neutropenia should elicit a diagnosis of severe viral infection.
