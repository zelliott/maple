The group (totally 156 postmenopausal women) used for the study of 'standard' (S) and 'associated' (A) genetic markers of potential sensitivity to metformin (MF) consisted of 37 healthy females, 32--with diabetes (DM) without cancer, 64 cancer patients with DM, and 23 cancer patients without DM. No significant difference in carrying of S-polymorphisms was found between DM patients without and with cancer. In cancer patients without DM most characteristic data regarding potential MF-response were detected with polymorphisms of STK11 gene while data on OCT1_rs622342 and OCT1_R61C variants showed opposite trends. In regard of A-markers, the tendency to the more often finding of GC genotype of OLR1_GS01C in DM patients carrying 'MF-positive' variant of OCT1_R61C deserves to be underlined. In patients with new-onset diabetes who carried S-markers of potential response to MF higher insulin resistance (OCT1_R61C and OCT1_rs622342) as well as lower estradiolemia (STK11 and C11orf65) were discovered. Thus, according to genetic S-criteria of sensitivity to MF, DM patients with and without cancer differ in lesser degree than they differ from cancer patients without DM. It can not be excluded, that The efficiency of such criteria might be increased due to combination with A-markers and certain hormonal-metabolic indices.
