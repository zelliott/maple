Malignant tumors, particularly Kaposi's sarcoma and certain cancers of the lymph system, have been common in AIDS patients since 1981. The array of cancers is broadening and researchers are looking for insight into the increases in frequency. An emerging theory is that most AIDS-related cancers are linked to viral infections; however, physicians do not know if HIV enhances the ability of other viruses to produce certain cancers. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) held a meeting to discuss the incidences, types, and treatments of cancers. These cancers include squamous cell cancer of the eye, in situ carcinomas of the cervix and anus, plasmacytoma, and leiomyosarcoma. The proportion of cancers that may be caused by the anti-HIV drugs are unknown and current techniques used to track cancer in AIDS patients need to be updated. If the frequency of AIDS-related cancers continues to increase or is linked to anti-HIV drugs, patients and their physicians need to be informed quickly.
