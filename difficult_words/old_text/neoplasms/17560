A method for extracting from biological tissues vincristine, vinblastine, and their metabolites and analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography has been developed. After excision tissues are rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen (less than 10 s) and powders are made under liquid N2. Extraction of blood, plasma, or tissue powders was achieved using ethanol (95%) acidified to pH 4.9 with acetic acid. Extracts were analyzed using reverse-phase chromatography capable of separating Vinca alkaloids with substitutions on the vindoline or catharanthine moiety. This technique has been used to elucidate the metabolism of [3H]vincristine and [3H]vinblastine in vivo and in vitro.
