The loading of tissue with iodine can result in the enhancement of the radiation dose absorbed from low-energy x-ray or gamma ray sources. We have explored the potential of this phenomenon for radiation therapy. We have demonstrated the effect of iodine concentration and radiation quality on this dose enhancement in lymphocytes, we have calculated the effect of such enhancement on depth dose distributions in the brain, we have estimated the iodine content in two human brain tumors during computerized tomography (CT) scans, we have studied the dispersion of the iodine contrast media after direct injection into rabbit tumors, and we have demonstrated that the combination of x-ray and contrast media injection is far more effective than either agent alone in causing the regression of mouse tumors. These results suggest that there may be a therapeutic advantage from loading tumors with iodine and treating them with low-energy photons.
