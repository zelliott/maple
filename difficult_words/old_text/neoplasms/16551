Guidelines are lacking for prophylaxis against D alloimmunization after D-incompatible platelet transfusion. A rational basis for the application of prophylaxis would be beneficial for institutions in which inventory constraints demand the administration of large numbers of D-incompatible platelets.

A retrospective analysis was performed of all D-incompatible platelet transfusions administered at a pediatric research hospital over a 1.5-year period. Patients exclusively received single-donor WBC-reduced platelets and did not receive RhIg immunoprophylaxis. Numbers, source, ABO type, duration of serologic follow-up, and level of RBC contamination of D-incompatible transfusions were analyzed. All positive D serologies in the institution over a 3.5-year period were examined to determine cause and potential association with platelet transfusion.

Thirty-five patients not receiving bone marrow transplant and seven bone marrow transplant patients received 490 and 255 D-incompatible transfusions, respectively, over 1.5 years. Patients had various diagnoses, predominantly malignancies. Seventy-nine percent of D-incompatible transfusions were ABO compatible. An estimated 2300 incompatible transfusions were performed over 3.5 years. No case of D alloimmunization was detected.

D immunoprophylaxis is generally unnecessary in pediatric oncology patients receiving D-incompatible, WBC-reduced, single-donor platelets not visibly contaminated by RBCs. Further studies to validate these observations in the pediatric population and to extend them to other population groups are warranted.
