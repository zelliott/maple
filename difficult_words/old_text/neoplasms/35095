Aclacinomycin A (ACM) in a daily dose of 30 mg/m2 was infused over 1 h on 4 consecutive days to 50 patients. Myelotoxicity was acceptable, nausea and vomiting was frequent, hair loss was mild. Grade 1-2 cardiac rhythm abnormalities were observed in 12% of the patients. Between days 1 and 4 the heart rate and the corrected Q-T interval increased while the amplitude of the T wave decreased significantly, cardiac contractility remained unchanged. In 24 evaluable breast cancer patients 1 complete remission (4%) and 2 partial remissions (8%) lasting for only 2-3 months were seen. None of the 8 patients suffering from ovarial cancer benefitted from ACM therapy.
