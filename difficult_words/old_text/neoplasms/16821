A retrospective analysis was made of elderly cancer patients (pts) who were treated with cancer chemotherapy in our Department of the Cancer Inst. Hosp. There were 180 pts above age 70 years at the start of chemotherapy between July of 1974 and December of 1988. Characteristics of these 180 pts were as follows: (1) 73 years of age in median (70-89 years), (2) 67 pts with malignant lymphoma (37%); 40 with lung ca. (22%), 20 with breast ca. (11%), stomach ca., colorectal ca., multiple myeloma and other; (3) Combination chemotherapy given to 174 pts; (4) OUTCOME: 41 pts (23%) were alive as September of 1989, and autopsy performed in 66 out of 87 pts who died in the hospital (76%). There were no special chemotherapeutic regimens only for elderly pts. Intensity of adequate chemotherapy based on therapeutic protocols was evaluated, dividing pts into two groups: full-dose group and reduced-dose group. Most pts (96%) with small cell lung cancer (SCL) were treated on protocols. For example, 12 elderly pts with SCL were treated with VEC regimen (VCR.VP-16.CTX); eight pts with full-dose and four reduced-dose, and their response rate (CR/PR) of 50%/38% and 25%/75%, respectively, and in 23 younger pts; 20 full-dose and three reduced-dose, and response rate 35%/35% and 33%/33%, respectively. There were 40 pts with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia over 60 years old, treated at Jikei University and in our Department. CR rates of these pts according to age showed a lower percentage with advancing age. Elderly pts with malignancies responsive to chemotherapy should be treated with the same regimen used in younger pts. But doses of each drug have to be adjusted to organ functions of each pt. patients with unresponsive malignancies, must be enrolled in clinical trials, and their responses and toxicities evaluated by age-stratified analysis.
