The aim of this study was to describe family members' experiences of participation in a support group intervention during ongoing palliative home care. Four taped-recorded focus group interviews were conducted (in total, 13 persons) and a questionnaire was completed by 19 of 22 possible family members. The participants experienced increased perception of support and knowledge, and would recommend that a person in a similar situation join a support group. Categories that emerged in the qualitative content analysis concerned "reasons for support group participation", "group composition contributed to group cohesion", "experience and sensitivity of group leader was a catalyst", "meaningful dialogue helped to solve everyday problems", "sense of cohesion increased effectiveness of the group", and "group sessions and post-session reflection increased perception of inner strength". Support groups for family members seem to be a valuable contribution during ongoing palliative home care. The findings are discussed in relation to recruitment into and ending of support groups.
