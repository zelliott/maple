The purpose of this study was to evaluate electronic portal imaging (EPI) as a means of identifying and correcting field displacement in patients with problematic external beam radiotherapy setups. Fourteen patients with problematic setups were identified for pretreatment daily EPI beam monitoring as part of a physician-directed therapist intervention protocol. Pretreatment EPIs were used to realign fields as necessary to bring the setup within the physician-prescribed tolerance level. For comparison, daily EPIs were available for 12 control patients who had no particular setup difficulties and for whom online beam realignment was not made. Anatomy-matching software was used to measure setup variation along medial-lateral, superior-inferior, and anterior-posterior axes. Online field realignment yielded a significant (p = 0.001) improvement when comparing initial and final setup variations. The mean standard deviation of setup displacement averaged over three axes was reduced from 6.4 mm to 3.1 mm after realignment. The final variation of protocol patients was comparable to that of control patients. In conclusion, EPI provided effective means to perform online beam realignment in a group of difficult-to-position patients. This procedure resulted in a reduction in setup displacement that was statistically significant, clinically relevant, and approached that of a more typical patient group.
