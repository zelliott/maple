The principles and rationale of using multiple modalities (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy) to treat solid malignancies is reviewed. Animal models of human tumors have clearly demonstrated the superiority of combining local treatment (eg, surgery) with systemic treatment (eg, chemotherapy). Although the results of many trials of adjunctive therapy in man are still preliminary, they warrant the caustious generalization that multiple modality therapy will increasingly become more effective than surgery alone for most types of solid tumors. Although the strategy of employing adjunctive therapy is rational, it must be emphasized that the therapeutic efficacy of specific drugs or agents for particular patients or tumor types has not always been satisfactory. Clinical trials now in progress may demonstrate more effective regimens. In the meantime, physicians should be cautious about using adjunctive therapy as standard treatment until long-term benefits and safety have been demonstrated. Participation in clinical trials is encouraged to verify the validity and application of this therapeutic approach.
