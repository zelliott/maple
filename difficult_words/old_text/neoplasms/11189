Molecules belonging to the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and TNF receptor superfamilies have explosively expanded through the era of genomics and bioinformatics. Biological investigations of these molecules have explored their potency as attractive targets for cancer therapy. Anti-tumor mechanisms mediated by TNF superfamily molecules (TNFSF) could be classified into direct actions onto tumor cells and indirect effects through immune or non-immune components of tumor-bearing host. In this review, we focus on TRAIL, CD40, 4-1BB (CD137), and LIGHT as promising molecules to mediate powerful and selective anti-tumor responses, and summarize their unique effector mechanisms. In addition, optimal approaches to manipulate these molecules for cancer therapy are also discussed. We try to provide an insight into a role of TNFSF in cancer therapeutics and highlight each of their potency to be an important player in anti-cancer strategies.
