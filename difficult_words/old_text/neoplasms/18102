A mathematical model for the scheduling of angiogenic inhibitors in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent is formulated. Conditions are given that allow tumor eradication under constant infusion therapies. Then the optimal scheduling of a vessel disruptive agent in combination with a cytotoxic drug is considered as an optimal control problem. Both theoretical and numerical results on the structure of optimal controls are presented.
