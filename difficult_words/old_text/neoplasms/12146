Assumptions on properties of tumor cells are defined. On the basis on them the survival rate of tumor cells is described by the LQ function and the dependence of resorption probability (RP) in the lesion nodule on the number survived tumor cells (tumor volume) and on the total focal dose (TFD) is described by the Poisson function. An analysis of the above approach to the determination of lesion-nodule RP resulted in designing a calculation method for EERC that can be used to estimate the lesion-nodule RP as a function of its volume and TFD. An analytical or graphical description of the RP/TFD dependence for a fixed volume of lesion nodule is needed for the implementation of EERC. There is no need to determine the cell structure of tissue or the radiobiological properties of its cells. The possibility to construct the RP section function and to extend, thus, the volume of useful clinical data belongs to the method's advantages.
