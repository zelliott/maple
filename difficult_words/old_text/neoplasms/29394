Traditional forms of cancer therapy, which include chemotherapy, have largely been overhauled due to the significant degree of toxicity they pose to normal, otherwise healthy tissue. It is hoped that the use of biological agents, most of which are endogenously present in the body, will lead to safer treatment outcomes, without sacrificing efficacy. The finding that pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a naturally-occurring protein, is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor has become the basis for studying the role of PEDF in tumours that are highly resistant to chemotherapy. The determination of the direct role of PEDF against cancer paves the way for understanding and developing PEDF as a novel drug. This review focuses on the patent applications behind testing the anticancer therapeutic effect of PEDF via its receptors as an antiangiogenic agent and as a direct anticancer agent. The majority of the PEDF patents describe the antiangiogenic ability and usage of recombinant vectors as the mode of treatment delivery. PEDF's therapeutic potential against different diseases and the discovery of its receptors open possibilities for improving PEDF-based peptide design and drug delivery modes.
