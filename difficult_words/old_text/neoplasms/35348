In the present study, the effect of singlet oxygen (1O2) (generated by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of methylene blue) on plasmid DNA has been analyzed by UV spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and S1 nuclease digestibility. Both native and 1O2-modified plasmid DNA were treated with a number of restriction enzymes to map out the sites damaged by 1O2. It was also observed that, on exposure to 1O2, native plasmid DNA that is non-immunogenic acquired the ability to elicit an immune response in experimental animals. However, the induced antibodies exhibited appreciable cross reactivity with various polynucleotides and nucleic acids. The data indicate that the antibodies, though cross-reactive, preferentially bind 1O2-modified epitopes on plasmid DNA. Gel retardation assay further substantiated the enhanced recognition of 1O2-modified plasmid DNA over the native form. The antibodies developed were then subjected to competition ELISA with sera from various diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. These results suggest that upon exposure of DNA to 1O2, neo-epitopes are generated, which may be one of the factors for the induction of circulating autoantibodies in the three diseases.
