The efficacy of trofosfamide (Ixoten; Noristan), a derivative of cyclophosphamide, was investigated in 76 patients. Those with solid tumours were given 50 mg/kg in 6 divided doses in 48 hours; those with chronic lymphatic leukaemia were treated with 100 mg orally 3 times a day for up to 10 weeks. Side-effects of treatment included leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, a fall in the haemoglobin level, haematuria and occasional alopecia. Nausea was never severe, and occurred in only half of the patients on a high dose and in none of the patients on a low dose. A therapeutic effect was observed in patients with breast cancer, cancer of unknown origin and pancreatic cancer. Twenty-one of 24 patients with chronic lymphatic leukaemia (all of whom had aggressive disease) responded to treatment, and complete remission (including normal bone marrow), was achieved in 5 of these patients.
