Naturally produced interferon-gamma was evaluated in 187 cases with advanced cancer. Interferon was given by the i.v. routes in doses ranging from 1 X 10(5) IU to 2 X 10(5) IU/day daily or every other day for more than 2 months. Overall, clinical anticancer spectrum, effectiveness, toxicities, and pharmacokinetics were similar to that seen with preparations of interferon-alpha, and beta.
