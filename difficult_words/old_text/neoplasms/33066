Platinum drugs are major chemotherapeutic agents that are used alone or in combination with other systemic agents and/or radiation therapy in the management of many human malignancies. All three platinum drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, are administrated intravenously. Satraplatin is the first orally administered platinum drug under active clinical investigation. Satraplatin and its major metabolite, JM118, have shown antineoplastic activity in in vitro, in vivo, and in clinical settings. Use of satraplatin as an alternative platinum cytotoxic agent is particularly attractive because of the convenience of administration, milder toxicity profile, lack of cross-resistance with cisplatin, theoretical advantage as a radiosensitizer, and activity in cancers historically nonresponsive to platinum drugs. The most mature clinical data for satraplatin come from the recently completed phase III trial that investigated the efficacy of satraplatin and prednisone on hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients who had failed a course of other chemotherapy agents. Preliminary reports show that the combination is statistically superior to placebo and prednisone in multiple end points, including progression-free survival, prostate-specific antigen response, objective tumor response, pain response, and duration of pain response. The difference in overall survival, however, did not reach statistical significance.
