Psychoanalysts working in cancerology have to face three main difficulties concerning their methodology: the selection of representative populations, the identification of prospective factors and the choice and definition of the data they need to collect. Four examples are given hereafter: a prospective study on the psychogenesis of cancer, the question of cancer-prone personalities, the incidence of psychosocial factors on survival in advanced malignant diseases, and a study focused on bereavement and cancer.
