Continuous infusion therapy (CIT) is an alternative to traditional intravenous bolus or brief infusion chemotherapy. The benefits of CIT are improved therapeutic index, reduced toxicity, and modification of drug resistance. CIT administered in the ambulatory setting fosters cost effectiveness and improved patient satisfaction. Nurses use their clinical skill and judgement to assess potential CIT patients prior to treatment for self-care ability and to prepare them for treatment. Topics to include in patient education are care of the vascular access device, introduction to CIT, toxicities and side effects of medication, pump operation, procedures for daily infusion monitoring, discontinuation of the infusion at home, and plans for follow-up. This article is a guide for the oncology nurse performing a pre-treatment assessment of an infusion candidate and planning patient education sessions.
