The continuous intravenous infusion of morphine may control terminal cancer pain unrelieved by conventional narcotic therapy. A retrospective review was conducted of the medical records of 79 terminal cancer patients who received a total of 84 intravenous morphine infusions. Data were recorded on morphine dosage, pain control, adverse effects, duration of infusion, and concomitant medication requirements. Infusion duration varied from less than 24 hours to 162 days (median: 7 days). Morphine dosage ranged from 0.5 to 300 mg/h. All patients experienced an improvement in baseline pain control; however, 54 percent required additional medication to enhance analgesia. Serious adverse effects, including marked sedation, hallucinations, diaphoresis, and respiratory depression, were recorded in 14 patients. These effects may be a reason for reducing the dose. Guidelines for the use of continuous intravenous morphine infusions are presented. Accurate pain assessment, morphine dosage calculation, and monitoring of adverse effects are essential to insure the safe and effective use of these infusions.
