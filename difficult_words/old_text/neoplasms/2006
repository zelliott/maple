As a result of complex hygienic, clinical and cancer epidemiologic studies, dust proved to be a major occupational hazard. Coke and graphite dust absorbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including benz(a)pyrene in concentrations exceeding maximum permitted levels. Screening of 746 graphite workers followed by clinical examination established increased incidence of diseases of the upper respiratory tract (chronic rhinitis pharyngitis, laryngitis, etc.), bronchi and lungs (chronic bronchitis or pneumonia) and skin (hyperkeratosis, naevi, etc.). Among respiratory diseases were hypertrophic laryngitis, papillomatous bronchitis and angiofibroma of the larynx which are now considered to be precancer. Cancer epidemiologic studies referred graphite workers to a group of high risk of cancer.
