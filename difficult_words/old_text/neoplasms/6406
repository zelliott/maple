Ku70 plays an important role in DNA double-strand break repair. Studies revealing conflicting results on the role of the Ku70-1310C/G promoter polymorphism on cancer risk led us to perform a meta-analysis to investigate this relationship. Ten case-control studies with 2566 cases and 3058 controls were identified. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of associations. The overall results suggested no association between the Ku70-1310C/G promoter polymorphism and total cancer risk. However, on stratified analysis, significantly increased risks were observed among the Asian population (GG vs. CC: OR=1.50, 95%CI=1.10-2.06; GG vs. CC/CG: OR=1.47, 95%CI=1.07-2.01) and population-based case- control studies (GG vs. CC: OR=1.57, 95%CI=1.12-2.22; CG vs. CC: OR=1.35, 95%CI=1.11-1.64; CG/GG vs. CC: OR=1.37, 95%CI=1.14-1.65). Additionally, variant genotypes were associated with a significantly increased breast cancer risk (GG vs. CC: OR=1.80, 95%CI=1.26-2.56; GG vs. CC/CG: OR=1.40, 95%CI=1.01-1.95).
