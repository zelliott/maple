Historically, it has been assumed that oxidative stress contributes to tumor initiation and progression solely by inducing genomic instability. Recent studies indicate that reactive oxygen species are upregulated in tumors and can lead to aberrant induction of signaling networks that cause tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here we review the role of redox-dependent signaling pathways and transcription factors that regulate tumorigenesis.
