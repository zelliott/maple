The author reported the results of local RF hyperthermia in combination with radiotherapy applied to 700 cancer patients used jointly in a group of 7 Japanese institutes, the author being the chief of the group. The author also reported clinical results of thermochemotherapy applied to a limited number of patients in 4 institutes. A conclusion has been made that the use of hyperthermia, especially in combination with radiotherapy, holds promise. However, further optimization of the methods of heating and thermometry is required.
