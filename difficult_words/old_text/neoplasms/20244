Children with cancer experience a great deal of anxiety concerning their treatment and invasive tests such as bone marrow aspirations (BMAs) and lumbar punctures (LPs). Responses of pain, fear, and anxiety are well documented and may cause regression, developmental delay, sleeping and eating problems, nausea and vomiting, nightmares, and depression. Diagnostic and treatment procedures need not cause such adverse effects if sufficient pharmacological sedation, analgesia, and anesthesia are used. However, studies show that inappropriate interventions such as underdosing and limited use of medications occur because of certain myths, beliefs, and lack of pharmacological knowledge on the part of health professionals. Studies that specifically address premedication for painful procedures in children with cancer have shown that only a small percentage of children receive premedications and that there is no clear consensus or standard for either drugs or dosages. The issue of premedicating children before procedures remains controversial and deserves further investigation. This study explored the attitudes and perceptions of oncology physicians and nurses concerning medicating children before procedures. Findings showed that most pediatric oncology specialists medicate their patients before invasive procedures and that the most common premedications used are Versed; Demerol, Phenergan, Thorazine; chloral hydrate; Ativan; fentanyl; Demerol; and Xylocaine. Most pediatric oncology specialists believe that premedication is necessary for children for BMAs and LPs.
