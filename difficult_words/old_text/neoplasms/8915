The UK's Institute of Cancer Research, London has broadened its CanSAR knowledgebase, a cancer drug-discovery platform that integrates genomic, chemical, and pharmacologic data. The newly released CanSAR 2.0 adds more prediction methodologies and holds data on more than 8 million experimentally derived measurements, nearly 1 million biologically active chemical compounds, and more than 1,000 cancer cell lines.
