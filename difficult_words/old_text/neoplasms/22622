Cancer treatment has improved extraordinarily in recent years. The development of targeted therapies has widened the cardiotoxic spectrum of antineoplastic drugs. Optimum management of cardiovascular disease before and during antineoplastic treatment is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. This article reviews the incidence and characteristics of cardiotoxic effects of antineoplastic drugs with special focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms. It also emphasizes the importance of early detection and correction of cardiovascular risk factors and the relevance of close cardiac monitoring during antineoplastic treatment in order to reduce cardiotoxicity.
