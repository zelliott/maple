From the analysis and comparison of biological and abnormal chromosomal behaviour between cancer and hybrid cells, I hypothesize that cancer cells might arise from a hybrid cell which comes from normal somatic cell fusion, but obtains a proliferative advantage, a poorly-differentiated state and metastatic capacity. Furthermore, I put forward the concept that the hybridization between tissue cells and the peripheral blood stem cells may be more likely to generate malignant hybrids.
