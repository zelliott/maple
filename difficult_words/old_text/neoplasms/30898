Inhomogeneities in activity distributions over distances from 10 to 10(4) microns are observed in many tumors treated with radiolabeled antibodies. Resulting nonuniformities in absorbed dose may have consequences for the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy. Activity variations may be directly studied with quantitative autoradiography (ARG). Converting these data to absorbed dose distributions requires additional information about pharmacokinetics, the use of a point source function and consideration of the complete three-dimensional activity distribution, as obtained from sequential autoradiographic slices. Thermoluminescent dosimetry with specially prepared CaSO4:Dy dosimeters implanted into tissue can directly measure absorbed dose in selected regions. The conditions under which thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) are used differ markedly from "normal" use conditions in external beam radiotherapy. Therefore special calibration and quality assurance precautions are needed to assure the precision of this technique. Procedures and pitfalls in the use of both techniques in radioimmunotherapy are described.
