Invadopodia are actin-rich membrane protrusions formed by invasive cancer cells. Invadopodia mediate the focal degradation of pericellular extracellular matrix (ECM) by the localized proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Over the last 2 decades, much progress has been made in identifying the molecular components of invadopodia and understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation. Although the physiological and pathological roles of invadopodia have long been elusive, emerging evidence has begun to reveal their importance in local invasion during cancer metastasis. This review highlights recent findings on the roles of invadopodia in cancer invasion and metastasis and discusses the possibility of and strategies for targeting invadopodia formation for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics.
