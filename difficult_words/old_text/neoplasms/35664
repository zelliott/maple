Several large studies have established the usefulness of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) detection as a diagnostic test in patients suspected of having primary hepatoma.  in the current study, 65% of patients from Hong Kong and 50% of eastern U.S. patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had AFP in their sera.  AFP was not found in normal adult sera in any of the reported series.  In this series, AFP was not detected in sera of patients with other hepatic diseases, often associated with AFP occurrence, or in sera of 6 patients with embryonal cell carcinoma of the testis though that disease has also been associated with AFP detection in sera.  However, the occurrence of AFP in various tissue extracts was detected in 1/2 extracts of primary hepatoma and in 2/6 extracts of embryonal cell carcinoma of the testis, but not in other tumors.  The hepatoma extract containing AFP was from a patient with AFP in serum;  the serum from the other patients with hepatoma was negative.  Sera from the patients with testicular cancer were not available for testing.  Theories on the function of AFP and its relationship to carcinogenesis are also discussed.
