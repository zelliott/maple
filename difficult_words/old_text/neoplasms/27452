This work presents initial experimental results obtained with co-incubation of human neutrophilic granulocytes from patients with various diseases (5 patients each group) and collagen- or silver-coated polyester grafts (25 patients each graft).

After two-hour co-cultivation of the graft with human granulocytes of different patients (normal controls; peripheral occlusive vascular disease; diabetes mellitus; carcinoma/chemotherapy; sepsis), the following parameters were determined by flow cytometry: CD11b, CD62L, fMLP, CXCR2.

The change in the receptor expression was taken as a measure of responsiveness, with statistically significant differences seen within and between the groups. For the silver-coated graft, such differences were mainly noted for the fMLP receptor (p=0.01). For the two-hour incubation with collagen coating, the receptors CD62L and CXCR2 were indicative of differences between the various diseases (CD62L p=0.01; CXCR2 p=0.01). Comparison between the grafts revealed statistically significant differences for the CXCR2 and the fMLP receptors (CXCR2 p=0.00; fMLP p=0.03).

The differences noted between the grafts and between the patients groups are suggestive of an altered responsiveness of the granulocytes to the grafts. This enables new aspects with respect to the genesis of accompanying clinical symptoms.
