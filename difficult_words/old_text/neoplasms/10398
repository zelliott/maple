Gene therapy is a new and innovative approach to the treatment of malignant neoplasms, although it is still not capable of eradicating cancer in humans. Selection of the appropriate vector with maximal efficiency and minimal toxicity is crucial for gene therapy and numerous viral and non-viral (synthetic) methods for gene transfer have been developed. There are different gene therapy approaches for cancer treatment such as: 1) gene correction; 2) molecular chemotherapy; 3) proapoptotic gene therapy; 4) antiangiogenic gene therapy; 5) immune gene therapy; and 6) modulation of drug resistance/sensitivity. Cancer gene therapy represents one of the most rapidly developing areas in preclinical and clinical research. However, some problems need to be solved to make sure this strategy is safe, effective and long-lasting before it becomes routinely adopted in clinical practice.
