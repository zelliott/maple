Historically, there has been evidence to support the hypothesis that survivors of childhood cancer have been discriminated against in the private health insurance market in some areas of the United States. Results of previous studies have been inconsistent and have generally focused on a limited number of outcome variables. A retrospective cohort study of young adult survivors of childhood cancer and their siblings was performed to determine the risk of health insurance access problems of childhood cancer survivors in North Carolina. Mailed questionnaires were completed by 182 cancer survivors from three institutions who were diagnosed between 1976 and 1988, and by 101 of their siblings for a response of 62.1%. Using logistic regression in SAS, cancer survivors were found to be more likely to be denied health insurance than their siblings, with an adjusted odds ratio of 15.1. Childhood cancer survivors also had health insurance policies that excluded care for pre-existing medical conditions more often than their siblings (OR = 5.5). In addition, cancer survivors reported problems obtaining health insurance coverage more frequently than their siblings with an adjusted odds ratio of 22.8. In general, survivors of childhood cancer who were diagnosed in North Carolina have had decreased access to health insurance coverage when compared to their siblings of similar age. North Carolina health insurance regulations permit health insurance firms to discriminate against cancer survivors because of their history of illness, often decreasing their access to needed follow-up care.
