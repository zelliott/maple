Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an imaging technique based on multiple bio impedance measurements to produce a map (image) of impedance or changes in impedance across a region. Its origins lay in geophysics where it is still used to today. This review highlights potential clinical applications of EIT. Beginning with a brief overview of the underlying principles behind the modality, it describes the background research leading towards the development of the application of EIT for monitoring pulmonary function, detecting and localising tumours and monitoring brain function.
