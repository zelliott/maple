With completion of the human genome sequence, it is now possible to study the expression of the entire human gene complement of approximately 30,000-35,000 genes. To accomplish this goal, microarrays have become the leading methodology for the analysis of global gene expression. Improvements in technology have increased the sensitivity of microarrays to the point where it is feasible to study gene expression in a small number of cells and even at the single cell level. A summary of developments in the area of expression profiling in single cells will be described, and the rationale for these types of studies will be presented. In addition, from a biologist's point of view, some bioinformatic challenges of expression analysis of single cells will be discussed.
