A retrospective cohort mortality study evaluated ischemic heart disease (IHD) among workers in the "rubber chemicals" manufacturing department of a Western New York plant. A previous study at the plant found elevated chest pain and angina among workers in this department.

Mortality experience of workers employed from 1946-1988 was followed through December 31, 1994. Mortality was compared to U.S. population rates and to local Niagara county rates by using the NIOSH life table analysis system. Poisson regression was used to examine patterns of IHD within the cohort.

The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for IHD among workers in the rubber chemicals department was 1.51 (U.S. rates) and 1.19 (Niagara county rates). Increased mortality from IHD in the rubber chemicals department was most pronounced at younger ages (&lt; 50, SMR = 2.4); workers in a second chemical production department also had an elevated (but not statistically significant) SMR of 1.5 for IHD.

IHD mortality among workers in the rubber chemicals department was elevated, particularly among those under 50 years of age. Potential occupational risk factors for IHD include the rotating shift pattern for employees assigned to two chemical production departments and chemical exposures present in the rubber chemicals department.
