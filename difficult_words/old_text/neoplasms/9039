Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, which display both potent anti-tumor ability of T lymphocytes and non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted killing tumor cells capacity of natural killer (NK) cells are capable of recognizing and lysing a broad array of tumor targets. They have begun to be used in clinical care with good prospects for treatment success. CIK cells are a heterogeneous cell population that contain CD3(+)CD56(+) cells, CD3(-)CD56(+) natural killer (NK) cells and CD3(+)CD56(-) T cells on which much attention has been focused. This review will summarize the connections and differences among CD3(+)CD56(+)CIK cells, CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells and CD3(+)CD56(-) T cells in the following aspects: the main cell surface molecule, killing mechanism, and clinical applications so that treatment with CIK cells can be optimized and further to enhance the antitumor effect.
