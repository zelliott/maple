More than 100 metric tons of formulated pesticides (about 75 pesticides) are used annually in Gaza Strip. It was found that 19 of these pesticides, that have been used, are internationally suspended, cancelled and banned pesticides. About 1100 cases of cancer have been registered in Gaza Strip (1979-1983). The distribution of cancer types among those patients are lymphoma and hematological malignancy, breast, head and neck, gastrointestinal malignancy, reproductive system, urinary system, soft tissue tumors, brain tumors and others. Consequently, the introduction and heavy use of pesticides and other toxic substances in the Gaza Strip environment is suspected to correlate with the growing incidence of cancer and other abnormalities in the nation. Precise determination of the effects of chronic exposure is, therefore, urgently needed.
