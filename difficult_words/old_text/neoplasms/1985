Using designs that several authors proposed, we reanalysed a large number of completed phase III clinical trials of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group as if each had been designed with group sequential stopping rules. With survival the primary endpoint of the large multicentre trials, we discuss the relative merits of each design, as well as the feasibility of group sequential designs in general.
