1. 2,2'-Bipyridyl-6-carbothioamide (BPYTA) is a synthesized compound with chelating properties demonstrating in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity. 2. The BPYTA cytotoxic effect is mainly due to the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RR), a key enzyme in proliferating cells. The active form of BPYTA is its iron chelate [BPYTA-Fe(II), molar ratio 2:1], which destroys the tyrosyl radical of RR small subunit (R2). 3. The copper chelate of BPYTA [BPYTA-Cu(II), molar ratio 2:1] also has antiproliferative activity, but RR is not the only intracellular target. 4. BPYTA potently synergizes in vitro with hydroxyurea, the most widely used R2 inhibitor.
