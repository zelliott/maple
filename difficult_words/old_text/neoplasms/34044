Paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathies constitute a heterogeneous group of conditions. A link between the tumor and the neuropathy has been demonstrated in a subgroup only. Definite paraneoplastic neuropathies correspond to neuropathies associated with antibodies reacting with antigens common to the peripheral nervous system and the cancer. Neuropathies associated with anti-Hu antibodies are the most frequent and consist mainly in subacute sensory neuronopathy. Sensory or sensory-motor neuropathies with anti-CV2 antibodies are less frequent. The link between the cancer and the neuropathy is less clear in the other forms. The frequency of cancer in this group varies from 1 to 18 p.cent.These neuropathies include inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies, neuropathy and vasculitis, lower motor neurone diseases, and autonomic neuropathies. Occasionally, the neuropathy improves with treatment of the tumor. Recent data suggest that gangliosides may be the target of the immune process in neuropathies associated with melanoma.
