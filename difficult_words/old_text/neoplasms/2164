A better understanding of cellular immunology and advances in recombinant DNA technology have led to a new dimension in the immunological treatment of cancer in which the potential for success is greatly increased. The number of biological agents with the ability to enhance the host's anti-tumor defense mechanisms has markedly increased during the last decade. The development of clinical trials with these biological response modifiers is an area of intense research. As a result of these investigations, a variety of malignancies now can be treated successfully by immunological approaches.
