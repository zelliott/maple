The authors studied with scanning electron microscopy the surface of peripheral mononucleated blood cells of healthy subjects and neoplastic patients before and after incubation with thymomodulin, a calf thymus derivative with immunomyelomodulating activity. In the healthy subjects before incubation with thymomodulin a wide number of lymphocytes with villous surface was observed, while monocytes appeared as bigger cells with a central portion of cytoplasm with an adhesion plate. Already after an hour of incubation with the thymic derivative an increase of rough lymphocytes and the appearance of cytoplasmic bridges between lymphocytes and monocytes were observed. Afterwards thymomodulin induced in lymphocytes the forming of cytoplasmic appendages named "uropods" and "pseudopods" which are expression of lymphocytic activation. In cancer patients at base line "monstrous" cells, considered as suffering lymphocytes, were seen and they became morphologically normal after incubation with the thymic derivative.
