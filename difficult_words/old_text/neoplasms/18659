There is a gap between optimal and actual radiotherapy utilization (RTU) rates in New South Wales (NSW). It is uncertain if this is because these investments have been insufficient to meet demand, or demand has been over-estimated. In this study we assess trends in infrastructure, staffing and productivity in NSW over the last 10 years.

The NSW Radiotherapy Management Information System reports annually on activity including new patients, new courses, retreatments, attendances, radiotherapy fields and Area Health Service (AHS) of residence. Data are obtained from interstate radiotherapy departments that treat NSW residents. A census of equipment and staffing is reported. RTU was defined as the number of new cases in a year treated by radiotherapy divided by the number of new cases of cancer in that year.

From 1999 to 2008, 115,941 NSW residents received at least one course of radiotherapy. During this time period there were 325,965 new diagnoses of cancer reported by the Central Cancer Registry. RTU was 38% in 1999 and in 2008. The number of linear accelerators increased from 34 to 42 between 1999 and 2008 but the number of accelerators per 1000 new cases of cancer remained static at 1.2. For AHSs, there was a significant relationship between more linear accelerators per 1000 patients and higher RTU (P = 0.0023).

Radiotherapy utilization in NSW has remained at 38% for the period 1999 to 2008 because investment in new facilities only just kept pace with the increase in the number of new cases of cancer with an indication for radiotherapy. Some regional AHS have shown significant increases in RTU with new facilities.
