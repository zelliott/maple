New designed combined products and its determination for pain management and cancer treatment were studied. A rapid and sensitive stability indicating HPLC method had been developed and validated for the determination of Indomethacin(IDM) in a transdermal patch. This analytical method was successfully applied to the determination of Indomethacin in a transdermal patch and can be used for routine quality control analysis. Chromatographic separation was achieved isocratically on an InertsilÂ® C8-3 column utilizing a mobile phase of acetonitrile / 0.01 M monobasic sodium phosphate and 0.01 M dibasic sodium phosphate buffer (pH 3) (65:35, v/v) at the flow rate of 1 mL/min with UV detection at the wavelength of 210 nm. The system suitability was performed, and the result showed that Indomethacin(IDM) and its impurity were separated. The calibration curve of Indomethacin(IDM) was linear in the range of 0.1~15 ppm (r = 0.9989, n = 3).
