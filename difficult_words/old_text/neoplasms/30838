Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation surveyed approximately 300 off-treatment childhood cancer survivors as well as a comparison group of young adults who had not experienced cancer. Focused group interviews, conducted by a childhood cancer survivor, augmented the questionnaire findings. Selected results include: (1) survivors reported feeling more positive than their peers; (2) self-reported health status was more negative for survivors than their peers; (3) survivors reported more worries surrounding cancer-related illnesses. Conversely, they reported fewer general health worries than their peers. In addition, survivors need services such as information, counseling (interpersonal and career), and meetings with other survivors. These findings suggest the need for improved programming by health care providers during and after treatment, as well as the importance of a national survivor network, to address the unique needs of the off-treatment childhood cancer survivor.
