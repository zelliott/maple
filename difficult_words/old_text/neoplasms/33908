Antisense oligonucleotides can selectively block disease-causing genes due to the specificity of the Watson-Crick base-pairing mechanism of action. A genome-wide view of antisense technology is illustrated via protein kinase A RI alpha antisense. Complementary DNA microarray analysis of the RI alpha antisense-induced expression profile shows the up- and down-regulation of clusters of coordinately expressed genes that define the molecular portrait of a reverted tumor cell phenotype. This global view broadens the horizons of antisense technology; it advances the promise of antisense beyond a single target gene to the whole cell and the whole organism. Along with recent rapid advances in oligonucleotide technologies-including new chemical and biological understanding of more sophisticated nucleic acid drugs-oligonucleotide-based gene silencing offers not only an exquisitely specific genetic tool for exploring basic science but also an exciting possibility for treating and preventing cancer and other diseases.
