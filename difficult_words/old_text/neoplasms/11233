A growing body of experimental evidence supports the view that certain human chromosomal fragile sites have roles to play in cancer. The principle lines of evidence are at the level of mutation mechanism and gene function. Most research in this area has previously focussed on the FRA3B common fragile site and the FHIT gene that spans this site. Here we review recent progress in characterising the second most readily observed common fragile site, FRA16D, and the WWOX gene that spans it. Comparative analyses of FRA3B/FHIT and FRA16D/WWOX reveal some striking similarities suggesting that these sites and their associated genes may play a part in a normal protective response of cells to environmental stress.
