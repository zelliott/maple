Positron emission tomography (PET) is one of the most promising diagnostic procedures in oncology. Using the glucose analogue fluorodeoxyglucose, PET produces whole-body images and is highly sensitive for tumor diagnosis and staging. We review three particular clinical situations in which PET-FDG has proven not only its diagnostic accuracy, but also its impact on patient management, i.e., the staging of non-small cell lung cancer, diagnosis and staging of colo-rectal cancer and head and neck cancer recurrence. Image registration yields anatomo-metabolic images that could be used as additional information for the determination of radiation fields. Tracer and technical issues remain to be solved before PET can be routinely used for that purpose.
