The authors investigated the state of immunity, before and after surgery, in a group of 6 methisoprinol-treated patients and in a 10-patient control group both affected by malignant neoplasia. All the patients exhibited various degrees of immuno-depression. Versus the control group the group treated with 1-g methisoprinol injections at the dosage of 4 g daily for 7 days after surgery showed a positive effect on post-surgical immuno-depression.
