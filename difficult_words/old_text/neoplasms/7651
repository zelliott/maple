At autopsy, the adrenal zona reticularis showed linear hyaline fibrosis in 19 cases of cancer, after averages of six months and 5,000 roentgens of irradiation to the abdominal, lumbar, or pelvic regions. The associated roentgen dose was significantly greater than when postirradiation adrenal fibrosis was absent. Primary radiation damage to the reticular vascular plexus is suspected.
