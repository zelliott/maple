Programmable fusogenic vesicles (PFVs) are lipid-based drug-delivery systems that exhibit time-dependent destabilization. The rate at which this destabilization occurs is determined by the exchange rate of a bilayer-stabilizing component, polyethylene glycol-phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE) from the vesicle surface. This exchange rate is controlled, in turn, by the acyl chain composition of the PEG-PE. We describe in vitro and in vivo studies using PFVs as delivery vehicles for the anticancer drug mitoxantrone. We demonstrate that the PEG-PE acyl composition determined the rate at which PFVs are eliminated from plasma after intravenous administration, and the rate of mitoxantrone leakage from PFV. The nature of the PEG-PE component also determined the antitumor efficacy of mitoxantrone-loaded PFV in murine and human in murine and human xenograft tumor models. Increased circulation time and improved activity were obtained for PFV containing PEG-PE with an 18-carbon acyl chain length, as a result of slower vesicle destabilization.
