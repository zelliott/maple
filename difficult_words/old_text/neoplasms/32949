Comprehensive cancer centres have arisen around the world, very often on the foundations of radiotherapy departments, as in the case of the Cancer Institute in Melbourne. Such centres offer the complete non-surgical approach to cancer through multidisciplinary interaction with full diagnostic back-up, and are centres of excellence in at least one branch of surgical oncology. They are physically or organizationally autonomous entities. They undertake basic as well as clinical research. They provide training of personnel in cancer diagnosis, treatment and research.
