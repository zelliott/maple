To provide an overview of access devices and infusion pumps available for pain management.

Pain still remains a significant problem in patients with cancer. Access devices and infusion pumps have expanded pain management options for patients unable to use simple routes for medication administration. When access devices are selected and used appropriately, pain relief can be accomplished safely.

Nursing assessment is essential to develop an effective pain management regimen. Because patients are the best source of information about their pain, the nurse is in an excellent position to determine if the placement and use of an access device could be useful in controlling a patient's pain.
