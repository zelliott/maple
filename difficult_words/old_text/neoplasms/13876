The rate of onset of action of d-tubocurarine (64 patients) or alcuronium (36 patients) was studied electromyographically in 100 children who had abdominal, bone or cerebral tumours. It was found that there was a significantly delayed onset (over three times longer than controls) or additional doses were required in patients with malignant liver, renal and bone tumours who received d-tubocurarine. The onset of alcuronium blockade was also prolonged but to a lesser extent. When tumours with an abnormal prolongation of onset of relaxation were successfully treated by chemotherapy and/or surgery, the response reverted to normal. Children with benign tumours or masses had normal responses. In contrast, neuroblastomas were associated with little prolongation of onset. Cerebral tumours showed a variable response, with the observed changes being unreliable indicators of degree of malignancy.
