Phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide, which encodes the catalytic p110α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase α, is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers. Targeting mutant p110α holds great promise for cancer therapy. However, it is challenging to develop p110α isoform-specific inhibitors. Most p110α mutations occur at two hot spot regions: an acidic cluster (E542, E545, and Q546) in the helical domain and a histidine residue (H1047) in the kinase domain. We recently discovered that p110α helical domain mutant proteins, but not the kinase domain mutant proteins, directly associate with insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Moreover, we demonstrated that disruption of protein-protein interaction between p110α helical domain mutant and IRS1 inhibits the growth of tumors with such mutations. The direct protein interaction between IRS1 and p110α helical domain mutants may provide a more accessible target for developing novel precision cancer therapy.
