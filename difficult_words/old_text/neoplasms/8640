The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is a potential target for antitumor therapy, because it is expressed at high levels on many human tumor cells and appears to be involved in autocrine stimulation of cell growth in a number of experimental studies. Anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which block ligand binding can prevent the growth in culture of cells that are stimulated by EGF or TGF-alpha. Growth of human tumor xenografts bearing high levels of EGF receptors is also inhibited. A Phase I trial in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung has demonstrated the capacity of a single dose of 120 mg anti-EGF receptor MAb to localize in such tumors and to achieve saturating concentrations in the blood for more than 3 days, without causing toxicity.
