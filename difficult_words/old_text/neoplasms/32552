Recent development in stem cell biology has indicated a new possible approach for the treatment of neurological diseases. However, in spite of tremendous hope generated, we are still on the way to understand if the use of stem cells to repair mature brain and spinal cord is a reliable possibility. In particular, we know very little on the in situ regulation of adult neural stem, and this also negatively impact on cell transplant possibilities. In this chapter we will discuss issues concerning the role and function of stem cells in neurological diseases, with regard to the impact of features of degenerating neurons and glial cells on in situ stem cells. Stem cell location and biology in the adult brain, brain host reaction to transplantation, neural stem cell reaction to experimental injuries and possibilities for exogenous regulation are the main topics discussed.
