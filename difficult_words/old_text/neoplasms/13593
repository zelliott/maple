Methods of synthesis of coproporphyrin and uroporphyrin by using bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter are proposed. Metal complexes of coproporphyrin and uroporphyrin with Pt, Pd, and Zn were synthesized. Their structures were identified by spectrophotometry, IR spectrometry, 1H-NMR, mass spectrometry, and HPLC. Data showing the possibility to use coproporphyrin III-metal complexes as luminophores for fluorescence detection of tumors. The current and prospective uses of metal complexes of water-soluble natural porphyrins in advanced immunofluorescence assays are discussed.
