Hypoxia is a common characteristic of locally advanced solid tumors that has been associated with diminished therapeutic response and malignant progression. Human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) hCA IX and XII isozymes are tumor associated isoforms which contribute to acidification of the tumor environment by catalyzing the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons.In the present study our goal was to investigate the inhibition effects of 15 different antibiotics belonging to the following classes: Lactams, cephalosporins, macrolides etc., on the tumor associated carbonic anhydrase isozymes hCA-IX, hCA-XII and cytosolic carbonic anhydrase hCA-I and hCA-II.
