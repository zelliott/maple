This systematic review was undertaken to identify clinical and economic evaluations of diagnostic assessment units for cancer; summarize measures used to evaluate such programs; and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these evaluations.

The review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, case control studies, and prospective or retrospective cohort studies examining the outcomes of diagnostic centers for patients with a presumptive diagnosis of breast, colorectal, lung, head and neck, or prostate cancer. Data on methodology and study results were tabulated.

Twenty articles were eligible for review. Eleven studies examined outcomes associated with breast cancer assessment units: six with head and neck assessment units and three with colorectal assessment units. No studies were found that examined one-stop diagnostic assessment centers for lung cancer or prostate cancer. Seventeen studies were case series, one was a case-control study, and two were randomized controlled trials. No thorough economic analyses have been undertaken. There were no studies that based their assessment on measures suggested by a conceptual framework or validated model of diagnostic care. Few studies explicitly based their investigations on established quality indicators or clinical practice guideline recommendations. Diagnostic assessment centers appear to decrease the time to arrive at a diagnosis, which in turn appears to decrease patient anxiety and increase patient satisfaction.

A comprehensive understanding of the benefit of diagnostic assessment centers can only be determined if such services are developed for a variety of disease sites and more rigorous evaluations are carried out to assess their benefit.
