It is the opinion of the authors that the molecule of the future for radioimmunodetection (and hopefully radioimmunotherapy and delivery of drugs) will have the following characteristics: It will be an altered fragment, rather than an intact molecule or fragment. It will be small, perhaps 60,000 molecular weight, yet remain in the vascular compartment for a comparatively long period of time, then be eliminated via the kidney. It will be of human origin or a murine molecule altered to mask its immunogenic properties. It will be 111In- or 99mTc-labeled or bifunctionally chelated to another metal ion. It will target a cell surface antigen, but one that does not circulate. It will be used in combination with derivatives of other MoAbs that target other antigens on the cell. It would be a hapten-type device that follows the administration of a "bifunctional MoAb." Whatever the final molecule, it will be administered to a patient who has been "prepped" with an antigen-enhancing substance or one that "unmasks" a gene and allows a repressed marker to be expressed by the tumor cell to which the MoAb was developed. It may be a MoAb that attaches to a white cell, which then chemotactically seeks the tumor that has been previously induced to produce a substance that the white cell recognizes.
