A new approach to the treatment of various viral, oncogenic and associated genetic and transmissible immunogenic, for example, infectious DNA or RNA, induced diseases is proposed utilizing amplitude and frequency modulated Jacobson resonance: mc2 = Bvl coulomb, a general expression of Zeeman and cyclotron resonance. Oncogenic and associated quantum genetic particles, such as oncogene associated proteins, viral nucleic acids and growth factors, may be induced electromagnetically into recrystallized and translocated states based upon various quantum phenomena affording new methodological techniques in magneto-therapy applicable to AIDS, cancer and CNS regeneration. A specific mathematical framework is presented by which to determine the appropriate physiologic amplitude (from about 4 x 10(-5) gauss to about 4 x 10(-11) gauss) and frequency (from about 10(-3) to 10(3) Hz) to subject biological systems therein reorienting atomic crystal lattice structures to congruent extensions of physiologic submolecular and atomic magnetic domains which are vital to homeostasis and health.
