There is a growing interest in analysis of cell kinetics in a field of clinical oncology. The development of a monoclonal antibody to bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), a thymidine analogue, is epoch making in the research of cell kinetics, and flow cytometry (FCM) combined with the antibody facilitates clinical use of information concerning cell kinetics of tumor cells. In this review article, we show flow cytometric analysis of cell kinetics using the antibody. Two color analysis of DNA-BrdUrd makes it easy and rapid to obtain cell kinetic data of both tumor and non-tumor cells, without the use of DNA precursors labeled with isotopes. A fraction of labeled cells in the mid S phase (FLSm) method provides more detail analysis of the cell cycle, although it needs multiple samplings after pulse labeling with BrdUrd. Alternatively, a short term continuous labeling method can roughly estimate cell kinetic parameters but this method very simple. Furthermore, effects of anticancer drugs and radiation to human malignant tumors can be rapidly evaluated with the above methods. The protocol of cancer treatment will be determined based on cell kinetic data from an individual patient.
