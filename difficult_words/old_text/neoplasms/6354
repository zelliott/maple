The biobanking area is highly complex, and its complexity is increasing along with its growth and demand. Due to the advancements in genetic research, stem cell research and regenerative medicine, biobanking has become ever more important and plays a key role in biomedical research. The robustness and the reproducibility of research results depend greatly on the quality and on the number of the samples used, and thus on the expertise of biobanks having supplied these samples. Undoubtedly, the recognition of a research biobank depends on the impact of the research projects conducted with samples obtained from tumour bank(s), but also on many other criteria. It thus seems important to determine a number of indicators within a biobank to estimate objective criteria for the performance of these structures. These indicators can allow to make some strategic decisions knowing that biobanks are expensive structures to maintain in the present hospital context. The use of these indicators could also contribute to the elaboration of an "biobank impact factor of" or so called "bioresource research impact factor" (BRIF). We describe here four major categories of indicators (quality, activity, scientific production, visibility), which seem to be useful for the evaluation of a biobank by making a proposition of allocation of coefficients for the various considered items.
