Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have shown great promise in biomedical applications. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the design and fabrication of core-shell and hetero-structured SPIONs and further outline some exciting developments and progresses of these multifunctional SPIONs for diagnosis, multimodality imaging, therapy, and biophotonics.
