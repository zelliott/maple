Hemostasis profiles from 101 cats presented for medical or surgical evaluation to The Ohio State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital from 1986 through 1991 were reviewed retrospectively; 69% were abnormal. Commonly identified abnormalities included a mixed hemostatic defect compatible with disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia, isolated prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and prolongation of both the APTT and one-stage prothrombin time. The most common disorders associated with abnormal hemostasis profiles in this study were liver disease, neoplasia, and feline infectious peritonitis.
