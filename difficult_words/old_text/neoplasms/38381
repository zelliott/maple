Heat shock protein (Hsp90) inhibitors are an increasingly interesting and important class of compounds where the first in class, natural product derived inhibitors such as 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG), are entering late stage clinical development. Recently the emergence of synthetic, small molecule inhibitors has been described and both NVP-AUY922 and BIIB021 have entered clinical development. The medicinal chemistry of these and other published small molecule Hsp90 inhibitors is described in this review.
