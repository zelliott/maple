Recent advances in antisense methods targeting genes involved in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis provide a potential anticancer effect alone as well as in combination with drugs, and antisense therapy may be useful in overcoming drug resistance and increasing survival in patients with advanced cancer including those with solid tumors. In particular, antisense to Bcl-2 comprises a most promising therapy and is being tested in combination with anticancer drugs in randomized phase III trials for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and malignant melanoma. The targeting of apoptosis-related proteins is promising for enhancing the effect of cancer chemotherapy. The molecular mechanism by which anticancer drugs induce apoptosis has been identified as mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by the release of cytochrome c. Modulation of multiple antiapoptotic signaling pathways involving Bcl-2 and Akt, which are related to growth factor-stimulated signal transduction in cell survival, is essential for enhancement of the cytotoxic effect of anticancer drugs. Herein, we review the current status of antisense therapy and its potential for enhancing anticancer drug-induced apoptosis.
