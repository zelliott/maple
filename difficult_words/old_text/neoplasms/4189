The results from preclinical studies using murine tumor models show that the combination of docetaxel (Taxotere) and fluorouracil (5-FU) is highly synergistic. Phase I studies in patients with advanced solid tumors indicate that 60 mg/m2 of docetaxel administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion followed by a daily intravenous bolus of 300 mg/m2 of 5-FU on days 1 through 5 is the recommended dose for phase II studies. Preliminary results from another phase I study using a continuous infusion regimen for 5-FU suggest that 85 mg/m2 of docetaxel administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion followed by continuous infusion of 750 mg/m2 per day of 5-FU on days 1 through 5 may be the recommended dose for phase II studies. As expected, dose-limiting toxicities included neutropenia and mucositis. Ongoing phase I/II and II studies are investigating the combination of docetaxel with continuous infusion of 5-FU in patients with metastatic breast cancer and with cisplatin (Platinol) and continuous infusion of 5-FU, with and without leucovorin, in patients with head and neck cancer. Preliminary results are encouraging and warrant further study.
