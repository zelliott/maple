The interaction between tumor cells and the nearby environment is being actively investigated to explore how this interplay affects the initiation and progression of cancer. Host-tumor relationship results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that promote the recruitment of leukocytes within and around developing neoplasms. Cancer cells, together with newly recruited tumor-infiltrating cells, can also activate fibroblast and vascular responses, thus resulting in a chronic microenvironment perturbation. In this complex scenario, interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells can be disturbed, leading to a failure of immune-mediated tumor recognition and destruction. On the basis of the recent awareness about tumor promotion and immune deregulation by immune/inflammatory cells, novel anti-cancer strategies can be exploited.
