We evaluated Acyclovir therapy in 16 immunodeficient children with varicella (7 cases) and zoster (9 cases) in a controlled open study. infections were serious in 12 patients. Each patient had daily clinical, biological and virological tests. Sixty minutes intra-venous infusions of Acyclovir were given three times a day (5 to 10 mg/kg/8 hours) for 6 ou 11 days. All patients who received therapy before the first four days, ahd a more rapid cessation of new vesicles formation and more rapid scaring, than those with delayed treatment. Ten controlled children had accelerated clearance of viral antigens from vesicles. In 15 cases, virus was not isolated after the third day. Two children with varicellous interstitial pneumonia died, 8 and 25 days after the end of treatment. Fourteen patients recovered in 8 to 10 days. No relapses of varicella-zoster virus infections had been observed 1 to 14 months after therapy. The drug was well-tolerated, but supervising of renal functions is necessary. Acyclovir had a good therapeutic efficacy to treat chickenpox and shingles in the immunocompromised patients.
