Cancer patients receive numerous medications, including antineoplastic agents, drugs for supportive care, and medications for comorbid illnesses. Therefore, they are at risk for drug interactions and duplicate prescribing.

A questionnaire eliciting information on demographics and medications taken in the previous 4 weeks was given to adult outpatients receiving systemic anticancer therapy for solid tumors. The Drug Interaction Facts software, version 4.0, was used to identify potential drug interactions and to classify them by level of severity (major, moderate, or minor) and the strength of scientific evidence for them (using categories [1-5] of decreasing certainty). Summary statistics and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. All statistical tests were two-sided.

The survey was completed by 405 patients. We observed 276 potential drug interactions, and at least one potential interaction was identified in 109 patients (27%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 23% to 31%). Of the potential interactions, 25 (9%) were classified as major and 211 (77%) as moderate. Nearly half (49%) of potential interactions were supported by level 1 or 2 scientific evidence. Most potential drug interactions (87%) involved non-anticancer agents such as warfarin, antihypertensive drugs, corticosteroids, and anticonvulsants, but some (n = 36, 13%) involved antineoplastic agents. In multivariable analysis, increased risk of receiving drug combinations in which there were potential drug interactions was associated with receipt of increasing numbers of drugs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4 per additional drug, 95% CI = 1.26 to 1.58, P&lt;.001 from the Wald chi-square test), type of medication (drugs to treat comorbid conditions versus supportive care medications only; OR = 8.6, 95% CI = 2.9 to 25, P&lt;.001), and the presence of brain tumors. Thirty-two (8%) patients were exposed to duplicate medications, most often corticosteroids, proton pump inhibitors, or benzodiazepines.

Potential drug interactions were common among cancer patients and most often involved medications to treat comorbid conditions. Duplicate medications were infrequent.
