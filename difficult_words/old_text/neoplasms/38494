Dual parameter analysis of FCM using rhodamine 123 (R 123) and propidium iodide (PI) has made it easy to estimate cell viability. PI stains only dead cells, whereas R 123 accumulates in the mitochondria of living cells which remain unstained by PI. Therefore the combination of R 123 and PI provides a more accurate estimation of cell viability than the conventional methods of dye exclusion. Cell viability has been estimated by this method in HeLa cells treated with adriamycin in vitro. The usefulness of this analysis is suggested for the evaluation of the effect of anticancer drugs on tumor cells.
