Traditional Chinese herbology uses a system of categorizing clusters of symptoms and signs to differentially assess the presence or absence of syndromes for which effective herbal formulas and methods are known. This system can be useful in detecting and counteracting some of the severe systemic and metabolic imbalances that commonly occur in cases of cancer. Basic theory and terminology is outlined, with comparisons between the empirical concepts of Chinese herbology and their approximate physiological correlates.
