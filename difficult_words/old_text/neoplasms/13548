To investigate the effect of calcium and temperature on cancerous cell adhesion.

K-ras transformed rat lung cells (KNRL cels) were used as experimental group, and normal rat lung cells (NRL cells) as normal control. The cells were cultured under the condition of implementation with Ca2+ and at 4 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 41 degrees C, and without Ca+2 at 37 degrees C. Cell adhesion and aggregation were examined.

The average value of adhesive ability (Nt/N0) of KNRL cells was 0.81 +/- 0.15 at 37 degrees C, without CA2+ and 0.60 +/- 0.14, with Ca2+ (P = 0.041). The value was 0.53 +/- 0.12 at 41 degrees C, significantly lower than that at 37 degrees C (P = 0.046).

Appropriate increase of Ca2+ and high temperature will strengthen the adhesive ability of tumor cells.
