The biological properties of the lanthanides, primarily based on their similarity to calcium, have been the basis for research into potential therapeutic applications of lanthanides since the early part of the twentieth century. Up to date, cerium nitrate has been used as a topical cream with silver sulfadiazene for the treatment of burn wounds. A lanthanide texaphyrin complex (motexafin gadolinium) has been evaluated through Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of brain metastases in non-small cell lung cancer. Lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol) as a phosphate binder has been approved for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in renal dialysis patients in both the USA and Europe. This review will highlight therapeutic applications of the lanthanides for burn wounds, cancer, hyperphosphatemia, immune function, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents and osteoporosis, and discuss their future potential in the medical fields.
