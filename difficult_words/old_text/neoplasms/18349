The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member LIGHT has potent anti-tumor activities through activation of the immune response, and it is a promising candidate for use in cancer immunotherapy. However, there are no reports of the anti-tumor effects of LIGHT protein in vivo because of the lack of easy, efficient methods of manufacturing this protein. Here, we developed a method of manufacturing recombinant LIGHT protein using Escherichia coli through refolding of inclusion bodies; we then evaluated the anti-tumor activity of the protein. LIGHT protein expressed in E. coli showed the same biological activities and binding affinities to its receptors as did LIGHT expressed in mammalian cells. In addition, intratumoral injection of LIGHT significantly suppressed tumor growth, with augmentation of antigen-specific IFN-gamma-producing cells in the regional lymph nodes and spleen. These results indicate that LIGHT protein efficiently evokes the systemic tumor-specific immune response, and thus induces tumor suppression.
