Interactions between the cell and the extracellular matrix (ECM) are critical in controlling the fate and behaviour of cancer cells. Alterations in either the ECM or in cellular events affect this interaction. In this mini-review we give an overview of the role of cell-ECM interactions in cancer, with a particular focus on the reciprocal nature of the cell-ECM interactions and how this contributes to cancer progression.
