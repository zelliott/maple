To investigate the prevalence of malignant tumor and its influencing factor among rubber workers in Hainan Province of China, and to study the high incidence of cancer and type of work.

A retrospective cohort study on registered workers over 1 working age among partial rubber factories in Hainan Province in the period from 2005 to 2010.

There was a remarkable difference in the incidence between nature exposed rubber group and non-exposed group (χ(2) = 52.13,P &lt; 0.01). Occupational exposure induced a high risk in malignant tumors (OR = 2.47, P &lt; 0.05). The incidence of tumor may be associated with occupational exposure: the longer occupational exposure time, the higher was the incidence of tumor (χ(2) = 11.40, P &lt; 0.05).

The occupational exposure in rubber workers can induce a high incidence of malignant tumor.
