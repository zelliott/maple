EPIX Medical and Schering are developing gadofosveset, an albumin-binding gadolinium-based intravascular magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent, for the potential imaging of blood vessels and blood flow, particularly in patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD). By February 2004, US approval of the agent was anticipated in October 2004, and in June 2004, Schering filed an MAA in the EU for PVD.
