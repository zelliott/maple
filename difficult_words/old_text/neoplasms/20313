The incidence, aetiology and treatment of fungal infections in a 60-bed department of clinical oncology over 2 years is reported. During the second year, after the moving of the department from an old to a new building with an improved epidemiologic regimen, the incidence decreased rapidly, although the mortality due to systemic disseminated mycosis did not change.
