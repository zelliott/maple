A review is given on the results of a study investigating the state of health and the psycho-social situation of 211 patients who underwent follow-up for malign neoplasm in the oncological Health Center of Magdeburg. In the course of a conversation the patients were questioned about social and other factors specific for their disease. For evaluating the psychic situation the questionnaire of HÃ¶ck and Hess was used. The results of the study allowed to conclude that more than 50% of the patients showed psychoreactive disorders. Depending from age and sex as well as the diagnosis marked differences concerning the frequences of psychic peculiarities and the evaluation of the state of health were revealed. The results demonstrate that in addition to specific oncological knowledge the consideration of social and psychic factors is necessary for an optimum follow-up in order to recognize and prevent disorders in this field.
