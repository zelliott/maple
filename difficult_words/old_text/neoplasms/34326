Lymphocyte sensitisation to encephalitogenic factor (EF) was determined in 131 children with the electrophoretic mobility test (EM-test) to find out, whether this test may be helpful in the diagnosis of malignant disease in children. None of 34 healthy controls showed a decrease of electrophoretic mobility of more than 5%, while all 10 children with malignant solid tumors showed a slowing of more than 5%. 3 of 54 patients with non malignant disease showed a slowing of more than 5% in the EM-test. Children with malignant solid tumors during therapy and children with leukemia during different stages of the disease often showed a slowing of less than 5% in the EM-test. The possible diagnostic help of the EM-test is shown in a case history. Finally some technical remarks are made on improving this test, and further studies are suggested.
