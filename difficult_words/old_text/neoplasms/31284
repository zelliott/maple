In phase II trials, paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) can be safely administered via a 1-hour infusion. One-hour infusions of paclitaxel also have been administered safely in combination with many other cytotoxic regimens, including cisplatin/etoposide/radiation, carboplatin/etoposide (with or without radiation), mitoxantrone/5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, carboplatin, and carboplatin/5-fluorouracil. Notable activity has been seen in patients with several neoplasms, including stages III/IV non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, advanced breast cancer, carcinoma of unknown primary site, urothelial carcinomas, and other advanced squamous cell carcinomas. Further study will determine whether these or similar combinations represent improved therapeutic alternatives.
