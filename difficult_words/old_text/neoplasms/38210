Angiogenesis occurs during the early phase of cancer. Recruitment of new blood vessels by existing cancer cells leads to the release of higher concentrations of cytokines as compared to cells in healthy individuals. Some of the common cytokines observed at higher concentrations, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, are also known to induce increased permeability across an endothelial cell monolayer. A whole-cell-based biosensor has been developed that can detect the presence of small quantities of the abovementioned cytokines individually and in different combinations. It was observed that the biosensor could differentiate between the cytokine concentrations observed in the sera of healthy individuals and cancer patients. The biosensor was also evaluated by exposing it to actual serum. These results demonstrated that the sensor can distinguish between healthy individuals and cancer patients and that the corresponding biosensor responses correlate with the stages of cancer.
