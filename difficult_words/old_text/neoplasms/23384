Pharmacological treatment of anxiety is an important part of drug treatment in palliative care. In this review we searched for the current evidence of pharmacological treatment of anxiety in palliative care.

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, PsycLIT, PsycINFO, CINAHL for studies of anxiety in palliative care was carried out in January 2012. Furthermore we searched the Cochrane Library, references of literature and leading textbooks. Studies were identified and information was filled in a standardized extraction sheet. Studies have been categorized and anxiety as an endpoint determined.

A total of four controlled studies, three uncontrolled studies, two retrospective studies, one case report, two surveys, one systematic Cochrane review and one unsystematic review were analyzed and included in this review. This indicates an overall low number of studies for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety in palliative care. According to our results, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used drugs in palliative care. However, based on our review, there is no evidence-based recommendation for the therapeutic use in palliative care.

With the existing evidence no general recommendations for pharmacological treatment of anxiety in palliative care can be given. Even for the commonly used benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, antidepressants, antihistamines and beta blockers for the treatment of anxiety no evidence based recommendations can be made. However, these medications are commonly used to treat anxiety in other patient populations and can also be used in palliative care patients. According to our review we cannot recommend a single drug or give recommendations regarding the dosage of drugs. There is a strong need for randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effect of drug treatment of anxiety in palliative care patients.
