The objective of this paper was to study the change of P38MAPK and Fas in the apoptosis of THP-1 cells induced by allicin.

The proliferation inhibition rates of THP-1 cells after various treatments were examined by MTT assay. Apoptosis rate was determined with Annexin V- FITC/PI double staining by flow cytometry. The expression and distribution change of the phosphorylation p38MAPK (P-p38MAPK) were detected by immunohistochemical staining. The changes of P-p38 MAPK and Fas proteins were detected by Western blot.

The proliferations of leukemia cell line THP-1 are inhibited by allicin. MTT assay showed that allicin can inhibit the proliferation of the THP-1 cell, and the inhibition was dependent on both dose and time. The IC50 of 72 hours was 12.8 mg x L(-1). Apoptosis rate detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI was proportional to the concentration of the allicin. After the immunohistochemical staining test, the P-p38MAPK was located in the cell nucleus and plasma, showing deep brown, when adding allicin to THP-1 cell. Western blot test showed that the P-p38MAPK proteins expression was proportional to the concentration of Allicin and was also dose dependent. The levels of P-p38MAPK in negative control group, 1/2 IC50 of 72 hours group and IC50 of 72 hours group were 0.259 8 +/- 0.013 2, 0.61 2 +/- 0.008 3 and 0.505 6 +/- 0.005 5 respectively, and the levels of Fas proteins were 0.287 4 +/- 0.008 9, 0.426 8 +/- 0.007 9 and 0.597 1 +/- 0.010 9 respectively. The difference was statistically significant when compared with the negative control group (P &lt; 0.01).

Allicin can significantly induce THP-1 cells apoptosis, and its mechanism may be related to the activation of P38MAPK/Fas.
