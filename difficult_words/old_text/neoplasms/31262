Cancer is a particularly common disease in modern societies. Moreover, epidemiology considers it typical of contemporary pathology. Nevertheless, the abundant ancient literature-in the De Medicina by Celsus, among others-leads us to believe that numerous benign and malignant tumours were observed if not identified as such. Hence, it is possible that both the change in medical conceptualization and the real increase in the prevalence are responsible for the actual importance of cancer.
