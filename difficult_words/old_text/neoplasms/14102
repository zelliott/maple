Pseudouridine, a component of tRNA, was modified to yield the derivatives: succinyl, palmitoyl pseudouridine, and protein conjugates. These derivatives were used in preparation of monoclonal antibodies specifically directed to pseudouridine. MAbs from three hybridomas (OAL 881, 812 and 814) were established and shown to be directed to pseudouridine, uridine and uracil. OAL 881 was equally reactive with the three substrates, OAL 812 showed the same reactivity for pseudouridine and uracil, while OAL 814 showed a reactivity mainly for pseudouridine. MAb OAL 814 was used in a radioimmunoassay (RIA) system unique for pseudouridine. A good dose-response curve was observed in the range between 31.3 and 2000 nmol/ml. Intra- and inter-assay CV values were below 4.1% and 7.4% respectively, and good results were obtained from recovery of added material and dilution tests. The ratio of pseudouridine/creatinin in urine was significantly higher in patients with cancer than in normal subjects.
