Proper repair of DNA damage is critical for protecting genomic stability, cellular viability and suppression of tumorigenesis. Both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways have evolved to coordinate the cellular response following DNA damage. In this review, we highlight the importance of the ubiquitously expressed protein macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) for an appropriate response to DNA damage. We discuss the mechanisms by which MIF affects the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and how this impacts on the integrity of the genome and on cancer.
