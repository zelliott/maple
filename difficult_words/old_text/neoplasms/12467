In order to obtain references for adequate diagnostic procedures of depressive syndromes in cancer patients, the present study analyzes first the prevalence of somatic, emotional, and cognitive symptoms of depression. In a second part, the ability of diagnostic procedures to discriminate between patients with and without comorbid affective disorder is investigated.

From a cross-sectional survey investigating comorbid mental disorders in cancer patients with standardized clinical assessment, a subsample of 71 patients with current affective disorders and depressive symptoms according to the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) were analyzed. In addition to patients' symptom patterns, a discriminant analysis including all depressive symptoms was conducted.

Cognitive symptoms are less prevalent in cancer patients than somatic and emotional symptoms. Loss of interest discriminated best between patients with and without diagnosis of comorbid affective disorder. Additionally, decreased energy and fatigue proved to have discriminatory value.

Cognitive symptoms should receive special attention in diagnostic procedures for affective disorders in cancer patients. In spite of possible symptom overlap with the cancer disease and its treatment, fatigue proves to be a useful criteria for diagnosis of depression.
