Selenium and molybdenum have inhibitory effects on gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. We investigated the levels of selenium and molybdenum in sediments and mortality from cancers at specific sites in 19 areas of Niigata Prefecture, Japan, and compared these factors. The average concentrations of selenium and molybdenum were 0.44 +/- 0.19 ppm (micrograms/g dry weight; mean +/- standard deviation) and 3.82 +/- 1.03 ppm, respectively. Selenium was not associated significantly with cancer mortality. There were inverse correlations between molybdenum levels and female mortality from cancers of the esophagus (r = -.446, .05 &lt; p &lt; .1) and rectum (r = -.529, p &lt; .05). Molybdenum was correlated positively with female mortality from cancer of the pancreas (r = .603, p &lt; .01). Further investigations are needed for causal interpretation of these results.
