This is a commentary on what a cancer cell is and why cancer cells metastasize. Normal cell get transformed to a cancer cell, with excessive production of free radicals that mutate the DNA of a normal cell. The immortality and malignant stage of transformed cell is maintained by higher GSH levels. With the faster rate of proliferation, when the cancer cell finds the place of origin is not conducive to its further growth, cancer cell chooses to take the metastatic course. We argue that if we can stop the exit of cancer cell from place of origin, cancer spread can be stopped or even cured.
