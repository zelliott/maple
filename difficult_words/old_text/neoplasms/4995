3,4-Dihydropyrimidinones of curcumin were synthesized in excellent yield by multi-component one-pot condensation of curcumin, substituted aromatic aldehydes and urea/thiourea under solvent free conditions using SnCl(2)Â·2H(2)O catalyst. All the synthesized compounds have been characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, Mass spectra as well as elemental analyses. The synthesized compounds 4a-n were evaluated for their synergistic antimicrobial (antibacterial and antifungal) activity against bacteria and fungi. Zone of inhibition was measured by adopting disc diffusion method. In vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations were measured using broth microdilution and food poisoning method. In addition to this in vitro cytotoxicity of synthesized compounds against three human cancer lines Hep-G2, HCT-116 and QG-56 were also evaluated. Most of the compounds showed interesting antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity as compared to curcumin, that is, the compounds derived from 2-hydroxy benzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzaldehyde showed the highest biological activity as compared to other compounds.
