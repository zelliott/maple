Of 31 patients with solid, malignant tumours, 15 were shown to have over 0.5 mg/100 ml Serum concentration of alpha-2 pregnancy-associated glycoprotein (alpha2-PAG). These increased values were found for patients with neuroblastomas, Wilms tumours and rhabdomyosarcomas. However, for several different lymphomas and haemoblastoses, alpha2-PAG could not be demonstrated with the electroimmunodiffusion technique used (Laurell). From 230 children with non-neoplastic diseases, 62 had demonstrable concentrations of alpha2-PAG, of 38 healthy children, 2 were positive, while from 50 newborn infants, with different illnesses no increased values were found. Post-operative controls using repeated determination of d2-PAG are complicated by the slow change in concentration, and by the influence of chemotherapy. The determination of alpha2-PAG for the initial diagnosis of malignant diseases in childhood and for post-operative monitoring of the disease, is therefore of only limited value at least until further investigations have been carried out.
