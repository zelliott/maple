The effect of adjuvant combination chemotherapy (vincristine, CCNU/MeCCNU, 5-fluorouracil) on the phagocytic and catabolic properties of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) was studied in 4 patients before and during the anticancer treatment. The results indicate a transient impairment of both these functions, more prolonged with regard to phagocytosis. No significant changes were noted in the mobile macrophage system. This suggests that chemotherapy induces a depression especially of the stationary macrophage populations in the liver, spleen and bone-marrow.
