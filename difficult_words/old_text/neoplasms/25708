DNA hypodiploidy is a unique and rare finding associated with aggressive behavior in solid tumors. Identifying the chromosomal changes underlying this feature may provide important information on the development and progression of these neoplasms.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using alpha-satellite probes for nine autosomes and the two sex chromosomes was performed on interphase cells from 27 solid tumors which had been shown to be DNA hypodiploid by flow cytometry. The chromosomal abnormalities were correlated with the DNA index and tumor subtypes.

The data show mutually exclusive loss of certain chromosomes and compensatory gain of other chromosomes in different tumors. The net loss was slightly more than the net gain for the chromosomes tested. Polysomy of chromosome 7 and monosomy of chromosomes 17, X and loss Y were found in most tumors. Significant differential loss of chromosomes 6,10, and 12 among DNA hypodiploid breast, kidney and lung carcinomas was noted.

Our study shows (i) gain of chromosome 7 and loss chromosome 17 in most DNA hypodiploid tumors, (ii) specific chromosomal loss was noted in breast and renal cell carcinomas, and (iii) that different mechanisms for DNA hypodiploid and hyperdiploid development may exist.
