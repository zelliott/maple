The intersection of two noble endeavors - the scientists' quest to understand life itself and the physicians' dedication to relieve suffering and prolong life - came into sharp focus in 1971 with the United States National Cancer Act. This focus has led to an exponential expansion of our understanding of cancer at the genetic, molecular and cellular levels, and concomitant advances in our ability to disrupt the disease process through prevention, early detection and successful treatment. At the National Cancer Institute we are committed to capitalize on these achievements. A new era is now within our grasp, a time when no one suffers or dies as a result of cancer.
