Evaluation of the risk of thromboembolic disease (TED) was based on the study of reactions of hemostatic and fibrinolytic systems in response to the influence of test-irritant such as twice applied local hypoxia of upper extremities. The study was made on 20 healthy subjects, 15 patients with chronic thrombophlebitis in acute condition and 45 advanced cancer patients. Cancer patients should be considered as having higher risk of TED due to the detected disturbances of hemostatic and fibrinolytic systems. The use of functional test offers useful information of the hemostatic situation.
