The fascinating progress of molecular biology in the last decades has made possible the early identification of persons at risk of developing malignant neoplasms, such as thyroid, colon, and breast cancer. This has changed conventional medical practice and has raised a number of ethical questions. Despite the fact that there has been substantial development throughout the Western countries in legislation dealing with medical information, there is an acute need for further exploration and assessment of the moral and social dimensions of medical practices to achieve more precise and uniform regulations. These topics were discussed in a multidisciplinary European Conference entitled "Molecular Screening of Individuals at High Risk of Developing Cancer: Medical, Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues," which took place in March, 1999, in Athens, Greece.
