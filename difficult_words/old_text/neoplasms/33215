Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, CCN2) is a secreted protein with major roles in angiogenesis, chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, tissue repair, cancer and fibrosis. It is a member of the CCN family of immediate-early gene products which are characterised by four discrete protein modules in which reside growth factor binding domains, functional motifs for integrin recognition, heparin and proteoglycan binding, and dimerization motifs. A primary function of CTGF is to modulate and coordinate signaling responses involving cell surface proteoglycans, key components of the extracellular matrix, and growth factors. Integration of these molecular cues regulates growth factor and receptor interactions, cell motility and mesenchymal cell activation and differentiation in tissue remodelling. Abnormal amplification of CTGF dependent signals results in a failure to terminate tissue repair, leading pathological scarring in conditions such as fibrosis and cancer.
