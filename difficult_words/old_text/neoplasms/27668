An X-ray examination of the gastrointestinal tract was performed on 56 patients with systemic cutaneous disease that is often considered associated with internal malignancies. Found were one case of esophageal cancer, two cases of gastric cancer, and two cases of colon cancer. The prevalence of gastric and colon cancer in these patients showed a statistically significant increase compared to the general population. The rate of gastric cancer was 16.26 times higher than the general population and that of colon cancer 32.26. X-ray examination of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with systemic cutaneous disease is useful for detecting malignancy.
