This article examines available data on genetic defects in germinal tissues of children treated for cancer. The heritability of childhood cancers and germ cell damage and damage to reproductive organs as a result of therapy are reviewed, and the implications for the survivors and for society are discussed. Recommendations are made for approaches and programs for prevention and early detection of cancer and for diminishing its residual effects.
