Our molecular understanding of cancer biology has made substantial progress during the last two decades. During recent years it became evident that inflammation is a major driving force in tumor development since chronic virus infection and carcinogenesis are closely correlated. These insights refined our view on the decisive role of persistent virus infection and chronic inflammation in tumor onset, growth, and metastatic progression. Explanations have been delivered how tumor cells interact and correspond with neighbouring epithelia and infiltrating immune cells for shaping the so-called 'tumor-microenvironment' and establishing tumor-specific tolerance. This extended view on malignant diseases should now allow for rational design of interventions targeting inflammation and underlying pathways for prevention and therapy of inflammation-associated cancer. This chapter outlines the role of virus-mediated inflammations in tumorigenesis thereby shedding light on the mechanisms of cancer-related inflammation and on characteristic features of the tumor-microenvironment, which has been recently identified to play a key role in maintenance and progression of tumors. Finally, the chapter discusses latest aspects in prevention of inflammation-related cancer and provides a short outlook on the future prospects of cancer immunotherapy.
