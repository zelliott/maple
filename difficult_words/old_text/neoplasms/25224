The steroidal receptors play a key role in protein synthesis and maintain the homeostasis in normal and diseased state, including tumorigenesis at the target tissues when overactivated. Thus steroidal receptors may act as potential targets for selective delivery of different therapeutic agents as they are overexpressed by a number of endocrinal tumors. The selective delivery of these agents may be a better treatment strategy for endocrinal cancer as it may also result in cytosolic and nuclear delivery of cytotoxic agents. In this review, the targeting potential of steroidal receptors for the drug or bioactive(s) delivery is discussed. The ligands that have been proven to be effective for specific steroidal receptors can be used as vectors for carrying the drug or drug-delivery system to the desired site of drug action in an optimum concentration. This strategy will not only minimize the undesired side effects associated with nonspecific delivery of drug, but will also maximize the drug utilization. Ligand-conjugated liposomes as a carrier of bioactives prevent passive diffusion of the encapsulated drug to normal cells, increase the time of circulation and reduce the undesirable side effects of a drug.
