The surgical approach to many organ cancers has undergone change in radicality in recent years. A growing trend has been recordable towards more individual surgical approaches, on the basis of interdisciplinary tumour therapy and as a result of widening knowledge of tumour biology and tumour pathology. In this context, attention has to be given to the widest possible range of factors of potential impact upon prognosis. Recommendations are given for therapeutic action, with reference being made to numerous examples of soft tissue and bone sarcomas, mammary carcinomas, parotid tumours etc. The surgeon with oncological training should be an expert partner and should maintain close cooperation with the radiotherapist and chemotherapist.
