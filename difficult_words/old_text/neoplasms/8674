As part of the strategic planning for increasing participation by community residents in cancer screening, a survey about life style and attitudes toward cancer screening was carried out in Samukawa town, Kanagawa Prefecture. Subjects were males 40 years old or over, and females 30 years old or over selected by random sampling from residents. Number of subjects was 1,916 (822 males, 1,094 females). Self administered anonymous questionnaires were sent and returned by mail. The response rate was 73%. The results were as follows: (1) The reported participation rates for cancer screening under "the Health and Medical Services Law for the Aged" did not reflect the actual participation rate of residents. (2) The major reason for not participation in screening was lack of interest in cancer prevention. (3) Socio-economic status of regular participants in screening was different from persons who did not participate. (4) Persons who did not participate in screening were more passive with regard to obtaining knowledge of cancer than regular participants. (5) Results of this study show that cancer prevention education at various levels such as by clinical offices, TV and radio programs, and newspapers may be effective. In order to increase participation in screening programs, health education that considers the life style characteristics of persons who do not participate in the screening programs is vitally important.
