In an attempt to improve the therapeutic ratio of cytotoxic drugs, which have steep dose-response curves, microparticulate drug delivery systems (MDDS) have been designed for regional administration. Introduction of antineoplastic drug containing microspheres, of appropriate size, into the arterial system of an organ harboring primary or metastatic tumor, will cause tumor infarction by an embolic effect and provide a slow release source of drug trapped within the tumor microvasculature. This review describes recent innovations in synthesis of MDDS and their potential clinical application.
