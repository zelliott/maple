An ad hoc panel of dioxin experts convened by EPA's Science Advisory Board found the Agency's claim of cancer causation by dioxin unacceptable. This paper uses the very same two studies [Fingerhut (NIOSH) and Kociba] EPA relied upon to test the observations made in an unused third study [Bertazzi] to conclude that dioxin is (1) a promoter blocker of certain cancers, including all the cancers Agency scientists claimed dioxin promoted; (2) a promoter of some other cancers that EPA scientists failed to identify; and (3) a net anticarcinogen. Three independent total tumor reductions provide evidence of both cancer prevention and quantifiable risk reductions tied to specific dioxin levels. The author indirectly suggests a general cancer prevention treatment, even for cancers already initiated.
