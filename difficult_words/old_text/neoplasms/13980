A number of single measures of quality of life have been developed over the last few years. Some of these instruments have been used more frequently than others. Psychometric properties are reported in many of these instruments, and continued psychometric development is needed. Instruments differ in the content tested, and users are encouraged to have specific objectives in mind when selecting an instrument. The continued research interest and activity in the field of single measures has provided beginning tools for both research and clinical evaluations. Quality of life measures add to the depth of evaluation of the impact on cancer and cancer treatment, and provide a measurement dimension that augments that of the historic evaluation via morbidity and mortality statistics. Continued work on single measures for quality of life will provide both researchers and clinicians with valuable tools.
