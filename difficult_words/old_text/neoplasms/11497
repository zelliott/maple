Cancer is the third most significant cause of mortality in French adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate survival of adolescents with cancer. Overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS) and event-free survival (EFS) were used for the outcome analysis of adolescents (15-19 years) with cancer, recorded by nine French population-based registries during the 1988-1997 period. Five-year OS, DSS and EFS were, respectively, 74.0% (70.7-77.4), 74.5% (71.2-77.9), and 69.0% (65.4-72.5). Five-year DSS was 94% for carcinomas, 89% for germ-cell tumours, 85% for lymphomas, 67% for soft-tissue sarcomas, 64% for CNS tumours, 55% for malignant bone tumours, and 41% for leukaemia. Compared with paediatric series, poor results in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, malignant bone tumours, and soft-tissue sarcomas have to be highlighted, and deserve further studies concerning the type of regimens used for these patients. Multidisciplinary management of adolescent cancer in paediatric, adult, or specialized units will improve cure rates and treatment outcomes for these patients.
