Optimism about the possible clinical applications of monoclonal antibodies has fuelled this burgeoning part biomedical research for nearly a decade. The highest expectations centre on the use of radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. This paper attempts to evaluate the claims for the new technology. A review indicates that the technique is having a limited impact on the practical management of patients. It is suggested that these limitations are mainly because the expected speed of transfer of the technology from research laboratory to clinic may have been previously exaggerated. In the long term the evidence reviewed in this paper suggests that radiolabelled monoclonal anti-tumour antibodies offer the potential of making the next great step forward in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
