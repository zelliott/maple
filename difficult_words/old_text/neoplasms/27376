Fatigue is one of the most frequent symptoms in cancer patients. It is the aim of medical and psychosocial rehabilitation programs to reduce physical impairments and psychosocial distress. There are no reliable data on the prevalence or the pattern of fatigue in patients attending such rehabilitation programs. We therefore initiated a cross-sectional study to evaluate this phenomenon.

Using the EORTC QLQ-C30, HADS and MFI questionnaires in 144 patients with different malignant diseases the incidence, patterns and necessity of treatment of fatigue were evaluated.

One third of the patients were diagnosed with breast cancer, 27% with gastrointestinal cancers and 20% suffered from haematologic/lymphatic diseases. There was a good correlation between fatigue levels in the 3 instruments used. 22% of all patients showed significant symptoms of fatigue. The univariate analysis did not reflect any significant differences in severity of fatigue with respect to diagnosis, haemoglobin levels, medical and therapeutic history or sociodemographic data. However, using cluster analysis we could identify 3 groups of patients that differ significantly in fatigue and quality-of-life measurements.

We conclude from our data that fatigue is an important phenomenon in cancer patients who attend medical and psychosocial rehabilitation programs. This has an impact on the ability and degree to reintegrate these patients into everyday life.
