Cancer-related fatigue is a very frequent problem in cancer, interfering with many patients' life activities. Anaemia is present in a large number of fatigued patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate cancer-related fatigue, in relation with haematic haemoglobin levels and the presence of anxiety and depression.

The Functional Assessment Of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale was used to assess fatigue. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was administered to screen for psychological distress. Haematological values were measured by blood tests. All data were analysed using Chi-squared, and a logistic regression analysis was conducted.

Eighty patients were enrolled in the study. Significant associations were found between fatigue and depression, fatigue and anxiety and between fatigue and haemoglobin.

Anxiety and depression, other than heamoglobin levels, were found associated with fatigue. Hence, implications for a multi-dimensional treatment of fatigue are discussed.
