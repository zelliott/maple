Defects in DNA that activate oncogenes or inactivate tumour-suppressor genes are regarded as a crucial step in tumour development. Understanding the processes that modulate gene activity, the so-called epigenetic processes, is gaining importance in the search for factors responsible for uncontrolled cell growth. Cell proliferation is determined by epigenetic and genetic processes. Abnormal patterns of methylation and other epigenetic processes, such as acetylation, nucleosome formation and compact chromatin structure, can suppress transcription and inactivate tumour-suppressor genes. Methylation status is a promising biomarker for malignancy because the process is not patient-specific, it occurs at an early stage oftumour development and may precede morphological changes.
