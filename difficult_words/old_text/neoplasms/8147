This 2002 European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) activity survey concentrates on current status, increase and decrease in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) activity in Europe and investigates the association of transplant rates with team density. In 2002, there were 20 207 HSCT, 6915 allogeneic (34%), 13 292 autologous (66%) and 3947 additional re- or multiple transplants collected from 586 centres in 39 European countries. Main indications were leukaemias (6523 (32%; 76% allogeneic)); lymphomas (10 760 (53%; 92% autologous)); solid tumours (1913 (9%; 92% autologous)) and nonmalignant disorders (874 (4%; 92% allogeneic)). Compared to 2001, there were increases (&gt;10%) for AML, ALL 1st CR, CML not 1st cP, MDS, SAA and CLL in allogeneic HSCT and for MDS, Ewing's sarcoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and ovarian cancer in autologous HSCT. Decreases (&gt;10%) were observed in autologous HSCT for acute leukaemias beyond 1st CR, CML cP, glioma, breast cancer and lung cancer. Correlation of transplant rates (number of transplants per 10 million inhabitants) with team density (number of transplant teams per 10 million inhabitants) suggests different diffusion patterns for autologous compared to allogeneic HSCT. These data describe current practice for blood and marrow transplantation in Europe and give some hints about mechanisms involved in HSCT rates.
