Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic acute inflammatory disorder, characterized by inflammation of skeletal muscle, progressive symmetrical proximal myopathy and classical cutaneous manifestations. It affects both children and adults, and women more frequently than men. Dermatomyositis is the commonest inflammatory myopathy in all age groups, with an estimated prevalence of 0.6-1.0 per 100 000 (Dalakas and Hohlfeld, 2003). Its association with malignancy mandates a thorough search for underlying neoplasia in all cases.
