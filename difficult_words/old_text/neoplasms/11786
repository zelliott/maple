The cancer morbidity pattern among 788 men with at least five years' exposure to oil mist was investigated. Based on measurements, interviews of workers and a survey of changes over the years, the average exposure level was estimated to have been 5 mg/m3 or more prior to 1965. Exclusive of cancer of the scrotum, there were 39 observed cases of cancer compared to 52.9 expected. There were four cases of cancer of the scrotum among the turners but none among the grinders. Three cases of lung cancer were found, compared to 5.4 expected. Among the grinders there was a doubled, but not statistically significant, increase in cancer of the stomach. The mortality from all causes showed a so-called "healthy worker effect," that is, 126 deaths compared to 154.3 expected.
