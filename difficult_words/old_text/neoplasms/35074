Patients with biliary obstruction due to malignant disease, and judged unfit for open operation, were randomised to have a biliary stent inserted either endoscopically via the papilla of Vater or percutaneously. Analysis after 75 patients had been entered showed that the endoscopic method had a significantly higher success rate for relief of jaundice (81% versus 61%, p = 0.017) and a significantly lower 30-day mortality (15% versus 33%, p = 0.016). The higher mortality after percutaneous stents was due to complications associated with liver puncture (haemorrhage and bile leaks). When stenting is indicated in elderly and frail patients the endoscopic method should be tried first.
