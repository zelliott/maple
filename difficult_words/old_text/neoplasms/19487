Undergoing a course of radiation therapy for cancer does not preclude the need to work during treatment. This study examines the impact of sick leave benefits, individual characteristics, and fatigue on employment during radiation therapy. The conceptual model of nursing and health policy (CMNHP) and the Piper integrated fatigue model (IFM) guided this study. Seventy-seven study participants receiving radiation therapy were recruited from one community hospital. The study employed a prospective, longitudinal design. Data were collected at baseline prior to starting radiation therapy, weekly during treatment, and at the 1-month follow-up visit. Only 49% of study participants had paid sick leave benefits available at the start of radiation. Age, pain, gender, side effects, availability of sick leave benefits, and fatigue were associated with work along the trajectory of radiation therapy. Further research addressing the impact of paid leave policies on the relation between work and cancer-related fatigue is warranted.
