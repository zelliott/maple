The evaluation of the clinical results in experimental applications of local electromagnetic hyperthermia requires strict control of the physical parameters of the treatment and adhesion to close medical protocols. Development and application processes in close cooperation between physicians and electromagnetic experts are reported and discussed, on the basis of experimental and theoretical research work. Attention is concentrated on a 434 MHz apparatus, where the fundamental physical limits have been identified and the operating features in the clinical practice have been evaluated. The cases eligible for treatment were chosen according basically to the limitations posed by depth, volume and steep temperature gradients. Several cases are reported mainly in association with radiotherapy. Lines of technical improvement are suggested, mainly based on the development and optimization of lower-frequency applicators.
