Normal sense of smell is important for well being. Although cancer is reported to be associated with impaired olfactory function, very few studies have directly evaluated this effect.

We performed a quantitative analysis of olfactory status in 42 hospice patients in a hospital-based hospice facility. Olfaction was assessed using the "Sniffin' Sticks" (Burghart Medical Technology, Tinsdaler, Germany) kit.

Twenty-five patients (60%) were found to be hyposmic.

Study results indicate the high incidence of decreased olfactory function among hospice patients.
