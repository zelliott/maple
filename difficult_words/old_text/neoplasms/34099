To describe the pathogenesis of mucositis, summarize the techniques used to study the condition, and describe the current five-phase model that defines mucositis pathogenesis.

Published research articles, ongoing laboratory and clinical studies, and clinical experience.

Defining the biological mechanisms associated with mucosal injury is critical for effective intervention. Research performed over the past few years has shown that the pathobiology of mucositis is complex, and involves all of the cells and tissues of the mucosa.

An understanding of this evolving pathobiologic model of mucositis will enable nurses to more effectively assess and manage mucositis.
