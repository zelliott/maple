Cell surface proteins are posttranslationally modified by tightly regulated enzymes of glycosylation. Typical patterns of glycosylation may signal pathological situations to the immune system. Here, carbohydrate receptors on the surface of cells in the immune system are involved in regulation of effector cells. Moreover, some lectins are circulating in the plasma and take part in host defense. The code of carbohydrate modifications is impaired in malignant cells and yet they are not eliminated. In this review, we focus on recent experimental evidence for regulatory functions of lectins and carbohydrate derivatives in the immune system and tumours.
