A nation-wide questionnaire survey was undertaken concerning low-dose anticancer therapy of CDDP plus 5-FU, which involves (5-10 mg CDDP/body/day + 300-500 mg/body/day) for 4-6 weeks. Out of 1,525 cases from 130 institutions, 847 cases with evaluable lesions were collected from 79 institutions. The response rate was 56.4% in esophageal cancer, 34.3% in gastric cancer, 35.3% in colorectal cancer, 47.2% in liver cancer and 35.9% in lung cancer, respectively. Adverse effects were found to be fewer and compliance was much better than the conventional therapy. Such figures suggest that the present regimen may be more effective than any so far. Problems for medical administration such as unlicensed CDDP for colorectal cancer were pointed out, which hinder the forthcoming third phase study.
