In critically ill children, Candida species and other yeasts appear as an important nosocomial pathogen. The emerging fungal pathogens are usually less susceptible to azole compounds, and the management of such infections could be problematic.

6,065 bloodstream cultures and 627 catheters from intensive care units and hospitalized oncology pediatric patients were studied. Antifungal susceptibility testing of isolates was performed according to the reference broth microdilution method describedby the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (M27-A).

We found a low activity of fluconazole (FCZ) and itraconazole (ITZ) against Candida glabrata, C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. haemulonii. Resistant strains to FCZ and ITZ were detected.

Results reveal the emergence of antifungal-resistant species and a change in the predominant role of C. albicans as a cause of candidemia in hospitalized children.
