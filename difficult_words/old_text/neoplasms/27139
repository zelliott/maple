The deregulation of the cell cycle and checkpoint machinery in cancer presents a highly attractive therapeutic strategy. We review here the strategies used to exploit the dysregulated cell cycle, both through targeting kinases required for cell cycle progression, and checkpoint kinases to inappropriately force cells through the cell cycle. Appropriate control of the cell cycle is critical for proliferating normal cells, and we discuss the importance of defining tumour specific vulnerabilities that could be targeted with cell cycle kinase inhibitors. Recent studies have shown that ER-positive breast cancers rely on CDK4 to promote proliferation. TP53 mutant cancer cell lines are sensitive to WEE1 and CHK1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy, while PTEN-deficient aneuploid cancer cell lines are sensitive to TTK inhibitors.
