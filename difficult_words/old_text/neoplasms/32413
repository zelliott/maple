Known commonly as molecular chaperones for proteins, heat shock proteins (HSPs) have also been found to chaperone small molecular weight cellular peptides. HSP-peptide complexes can prime T cell immunity specific against the peptides bound to HSPs, but not against HSPs per se. This immunomodulatory functions of HSPs are based on two intrinsic properties. One, HSPs are excellent adjuvants due to their ability to activate dendritic cells (DCs). Two, HSPs can bind directly to their receptors on DCs to then channel HSP-associated peptides to associate with MHC molecules. When a specific antigenic peptide is defined, this peptide can also be complexed with either tissue derived or recombinant HSPs in vitro to generate HSP-peptide complexes as peptide-specific vaccines. This article focuses on the methods commonly used to reconstitute HSP-peptide complexes, and discusses assays to verify the efficiency of complexing for immunotherapy against cancers and infectious diseases.
