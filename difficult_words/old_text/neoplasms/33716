After having studied the fundamental possibilities of proceedings allowing an intracorporeal transfer of energy, two systems were investigated in detail in order to achieve a wide range of application: 1. Resistance heating of tissue by modified standard needles and individual regulation of each needle (system KHS-9). 2. Water heating of standard needles as used in interstitial radiotherapy and overall regulation of the total system. These new systems are supposed to be applied in clinical practice and have been developed by GSP-Wien at the suggestion of the University Hospital for Radiotherapy and Radiobiology. Patent is applied for both of them.
