Somatostatin-receptors have been found to be overexpressed in a variety of neuro-endocrine and epithelial cancers. While the introduction of a long-acting somatostatin-analogue, octreotide, exerted mainly anti-cancer activity in neuro-endocrine tumors, no convincing results have been demonstrated in other cancers. RC-160, another somatostatin-analogue has been selected because of its high receptor affinity and its anti-cancer activity. 188Re is a generator produced radionuclide with favourable gamma and beta-emission, allowing diagnostic and therapeutic application. The results of in vivo biodistribution and therapeutic outcome following systemic, intralesional and intracavitary application in animal studies employing 188Re-RC-160 are summarized. Safety considerations, dosimetry estimates and applicable indications are outlined. The clinical impacts of this radiopharmaceutical in cancer management are discussed.
