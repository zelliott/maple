The congenital immunodeficiency disorders in which the defect has been clearly traced to the stem cell can be cured with allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) from an unaffected donor. Widespread application of this treatment modality has been tempered by the fact that risk-benefit considerations do not always favor a procedure that carries a significant risk for morbidity and mortality. Some malignant disorders of childhood eventually have to be treated by an autologous or allogeneic SCT, however nonmalignant disorders can also be treated with this approach. This article reviews the current status of SCT for nonmalignant inherited immunodeficiency disorders.
