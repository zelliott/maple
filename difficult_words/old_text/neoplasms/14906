Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) is primarily localized on the endothelial cells of large blood vessels. EPCR enhances activation of protein C by 5- to 20-fold. EPCR appears to be physiologically significant in the control of blood coagulation and inflammation and in the host response to gram-negative sepsis. In this study, the authors evaluated serum-soluble EPCR level in septic children in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a university hospital. The study was performed between March 2006 and September 2007 and consisted of 39 patients with sepsis and 40 healthy children. Septic patients were enrolled consecutively. Serum-soluble EPCR level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The ages of the children with sepsis and those in the control groups ranged between 59 +/- 68 and 68 +/- 52 months, respectively. The serum sEPCR levels of septic children and those in control groups were 87 (38-260) and 72 (42-180) ng/mL (p &gt; .05), respectively. The mortality rate was 25.6% in our patients. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia were the most common pathogens. Among these children 16 had sepsis, 23 had septic shock, 15 had multiple organ dysfuntion syndrome, and 12 had disseminated intravascular coagulation. sEPCR levels of survivors were 96 (44-260) and those of nonsurvivors' were 82.5 (38-325) ng/mL (p &gt; .05). Serum soluble endothelial protein C receptor level is not elevated in children with sepsis, and it is not a prognostic parameter in septic children.
