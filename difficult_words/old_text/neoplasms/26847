Oncolytic virotherapy is an emerging technology that uses engineered viruses to treat malignancies. Viruses can be designed with biological specificity to infect cancerous cells preferentially, and to replicate in these cells exclusively. Malignant cells may be killed directly by overwhelming viral infection and lysis, which releases additional viral particles to infect neighboring cells and distant metastases. Viral infections may also activate the immune system, unmask stealthy tumor antigens, and aid the immune system to recognize and attack neoplasms. Delivery of live virus particles is potentially complex, and may require the expertise of the interventional community.
