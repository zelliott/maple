Adolescent cancer patients present a unique challenge to health care professionals because of the impact of the disease and its treatment on the successful acquisition of age-appropriate developmental milestones, as well as the psychosocial concerns raised by the illness itself. Understanding normal adolescent development provides a framework for identifying psychosocial concerns, predicting problems, and developing appropriate interventional strategies for adolescents with cancer. A comprehensive support program with specific goals of promoting adjustment to the illness and providing a basis for community reentry by strengthening recognized coping strategies based on identified psychosocial concerns is described as a model.
