A cohort of children born after assisted reproductive technologies (ART) was set up in 2003 in Italy. It aims to follow up the children in order to study the short- and long-term effects of ART. Parents who agreed to participate were contacted for a telephone interview; questions included occupational and non-occupational exposure to carcinogens, reproductive history, history of index pregnancy (including drugs used during pregnancy), delivery and the child's health status. By August 2005, 40 out of the 50 centres contacted (80%) had agreed to participate in the study, and 17 had already sent their data. Information on a total of 2451 cycles ending with a pregnancy are currently available, from 2245 couples. We have contacted 351 of these couples (16%), 309 of whom (88% of the contacts) agreed to participate in the study and were interviewed, while 36 (11%) refused to be interviewed. The total number of children currently included in the database is 411. This study is the first attempt to create a database containing information on children born after ART in Italy. It will provide results on both short- and long-term outcomes in these children.
