Based on previous investigations on several hormones, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17α-HOPRG) was studied in respect to cancer initiation by its metabolites resulting from electron emission. The emission of electrons (e⁻(aq)) from its singlet excited state of 17α-HOPRG and HPLC-analysis of products were studied. Possible carcinogenicity of metabolites originating from 17α-HOPRG and the effect of progesterone (PRG) in this respect were studied in vitro. The results showed that 17α-HOPRG is very sensitive towards oxygen. The highest Q(e⁻(aq)) values were obtained by dissolution and UV-irradiation of substrate in airfree media. 17α-HOPRG metabolites showed a strong anticancer activity, which is, however, lower compared to that of PRG-metabolites. Mixture of both hormones, 17α-HOPRG and PRG, in respect to carcinogenicity showed a synergistic effect of PRG on 17α-HOPRG. Reaction mechanisms are presented.
