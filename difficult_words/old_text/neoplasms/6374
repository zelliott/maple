Recently, the development of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors as a synthetic lethality approach has brought a major breakthrough in the treatment of breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)-mutant cancers. Because sporadic cancers have also been found to commonly have other defects in DNA repair, PARP inhibitors are under active clinical investigation in combination with DNA-damaging therapeutics in a wide range of sporadic cancers. In this review, the authors discuss DNA repair mechanisms and PARP as a therapeutic target and summarize an update on clinical trials of available PARP inhibitors and predictive biomarkers for their efficacy.
