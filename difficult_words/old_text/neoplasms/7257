Evaluation of 314 angiograms revealed that they were often very useful in planning nonablative resection of bone tumors because they demonstrated the relationships of the tumors to major vessels. Increasing experience indicates that computed tomography can accurately define intraosseuous and soft-tissue extent of bone tumors. If vascular relationships are not precisely shown by computed tomography, angiography may still be required. The angiograms occasionally also helped in anticipating operative blood loss, demonstrating variants of vascular anatomy, or planning biopsy. Meticulous angiographic technique and close communication between surgeon and angiographer are essential.
