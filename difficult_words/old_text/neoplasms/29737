Kinetic theories of tumor growth do not appear to provide adequate explanations for treatment failure in cancer. It is proposed that drug resistance results from somatic mutations in tumor cell populations and that "front-loaded" first-line treatment strategy with as many effective agents as possible, in the highest dosages possible, represents the clinician's best approach.
