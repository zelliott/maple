The tendencies in the mortality from neoplasms in the population of the city of Poznań were analyzed with respect to gender and type of neoplasm. The underlying causes of deaths in death certificates of permanent residents of Poznań in years 1981-2000 were analyzed. The higher mortality from neoplasms in the 90's was caused by the rise in mortality from malignancies in both sexes. Throughout the period monitored mortality rates for men were higher than for women, with highest values in 1998 and 1999. In the years 1996-2000 the highest mortality rates for men were from prostate cancer, whereas in 1997-1999 they were highest for bowel cancer.
