Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) is used as an adjunct in the treatment of radiation injury at many sites, including the mandible, larynx, chest wall, bladder, and rectum. In these disorders, HBO2 is effective in stimulating neovascularization and reducing fibrosis. No previous publications report the application of HBO2 to radiation injuries of the extremities. From 1979 until 1997, 17 patients were treated at the Southwest Texas Methodist and Nix Hospitals for nonhealing necrotic wounds of the extremities within previously irradiated fields. All but one wound involved a lower extremity. Most of the patients had been irradiated for soft tissue sarcomas or skin cancers. The rest were irradiated for a variety of malignancies. HBO2 was delivered in a multiplace chamber at 2.4 atm abs daily for 90 min of 100% oxygen at pressure. This report is a retrospective, uncontrolled review of these patients. Eleven patients (65%) healed completely whereas five (29%) failed to heal and one (6%) was lost to follow-up. Three (60%) of those who failed were found to have local or distant recurrence of their tumor early in their course of hyperbaric treatment and were discontinued from therapy at that time. When last seen in the clinic, the wound of the patient who was lost to follow-up was improved but not completely healed. Four of those who failed (including the two with local tumor recurrence) required amputation. If we exclude those with active cancer and the patient lost to follow-up, the success rate was 11 of 13 or 85%. HBO2 was applied successfully with complete wound healing and the avoidance of amputation in a majority of these patients. The consequences of failure in patients suffering from radiation necrosis of the extremities (some complicated by the presence of tumor) are significant, with 80% of the five failures requiring amputation. In radiation injuries of the extremities as in delayed radiation injury at other sites, HBO2 is a useful adjunct and should be part of the overall management.
