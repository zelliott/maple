Activation-induced deaminase initiates three different antibody diversification reactions: class switch recombination, somatic hypermutation (SHM), and gene conversion. We have shown that, in addition to antibody diversification, activation-induced deaminase can also initiate Burkitt's lymphoma-like c-myc/IgH translocations. However, distinct DNA damage- and oncogene-induced checkpoints operate in B cells to produce a normal intrachromosomal class switch recombination event or an aberrant interchromosomal fusion. These findings open the way to study the molecular pathways taking place at the early stages of malignant transformation.
