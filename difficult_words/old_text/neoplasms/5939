Cancer therapy studies using proton accelerators are underway in several major medical centers in the U.S., Russia, Japan and elsewhere. To facilitate dosimetry intercomparisons between these laboratories, alanine-based detectors produced at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and commercially available radiochromic films were studied for their possible use as passive transfer dosimeters for clinical proton beams. Evaluation of characteristics of these instruments, including the LET dependence of their response of proton energy, was carried out at the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics. Results of absolute dose measurements were regarded as a preliminary step of dose intercomparison between ITEP and NIST. Measurements made in a number of experiments showed average agreement between the ITEP and NIST dosimetry standards to 2.5%.
