The objective of this study was to determine the optimal scan delay time after hepatic parenchymal enhancement using a 16-channel multidetector row helical CT (MDCT) scanner. Two hundred fifty-five consecutive patients underwent biphasic CT scans using a 16-channel MDCT. In group A (n = 125), two hepatic venous phase scans (HVP1 and HVP2) were obtained at 40 and 60 seconds, after 100-HU threshold time (T100HU) in the abdominal aorta. In group B (n = 130), HVP1 and HVP2 scans were obtained 50 and 70 seconds after T100HU. Both groups were divided into subgroups that were given different contrast media. Groups A1 and B1 received a contrast medium of 300 mgI/mL; groups A2 and B2 received a contrast medium of 370 mgI/mL. Each patient was injected with contrast medium at a dose of 2 mL/kg at a rate adjusted to the patient's body weight with a constant injection duration of 47 seconds. The attenuation values (HU) for the liver, portal vein, hepatic vein, and aorta were measured. The average HU was compared between the groups. Hepatic enhancement in the images obtained at 50 and 60 seconds after T100HU was greater (P &lt; 0.05) than in images obtained at 40 and 70 seconds. These results were obtained with both contrast media. A few patients showed greater enhancement at a 40 seconds or 70 seconds. Hepatic enhancement was significantly greater in all scans using a contrast medium dose of 370 mgI/mL compared with the 300-mgI/mL dose (P &lt; 0.05). Independent of the concentration of contrast medium, scan delays of 50 to 60 seconds after T100HU may provide optimal hepatic enhancement.
