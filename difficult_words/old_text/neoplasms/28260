Since the publication of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in 1985, there has been an explosion of reports on its use in medicine and science. In this overview the use and limitations of PCR in diagnostic pathology are discussed. As biopsies get smaller, molecular technology will play an ever greater role in improving diagnostic accuracy. PCR is useful in tumour characterisation by assessment of clonality and detection of specific chromosomal rearrangements. This way better targeting of therapeutic intervention is possible. The value of PCR in the diagnosis of cancer, HLA typing and the detection of microorganisms is illustrated by some case reports.
