Age-related changes in different regulatory processes are polymorphic and differ in different strains and organs in terms of onset and progression. Membrane changes have been observed in terms of the association between receptors and class I major-histocompatibility-complex molecules as well as in terms of structural modification of membrane molecules. Various nutritional strategies can differentially affect age of onset and rate of progression. Tumor incidence and progression increase with age; and interesting exception has been described. Principles of experimental design for the exploration of aging processes and evolutionary aspects of aging processes are being discussed. Identification of alleles, which affect initiation and progression of deleterious aging processes, are being considered for their potential in strategies for preventive medicine.
