A national hyperbaric centre was established in 1994 at Haukeland Hospital with responsibility for all hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment in Norway. In hypoxic tissues with symptomatic radiation reactions, hyperbaric oxygen induces the formation of collagen and angiogenesis resulting in permanently improved local microcirculation.

234 patients received elective HBO treatment at Haukeland Hospital in 1997 with a total of 4,048 treatments. All 47 patients treated for radiation reactions in the pelvic area in 1997 received a questionnaire 3-15 months after HBO therapy; 81% responded.

Rectal bleeding and haematuria were reported as much improved in 61% and 55% respectively, while bladder incontinence was much improved in 46%.

This treatment modality may be an alternative in symptomatic radiation reactions of the urinary bladder and the bowel when conventional treatment has given unsatisfactory results.
