An optimal parameter selection model of cancer chemotherapy is presented which describes the treatment of a tumor over a fixed period of time by the repeated administration of a single drug. The drug is delivered at evenly spaced intervals over the treatment period at doses to be selected by the model. The model constructs a regimen that both minimizes the tumor population at the end of the treatment and satisfies constraints on the drug toxicity and intermediate tumor size. Numerical solutions show that an optimal regimen withholds the bulk of the doses until the end of the treatment period. When a drug used is of either moderate or low effectiveness, an optimal regimen is superior to a schedule that delivers all of the drug at the beginning of the treatment. This study questions whether the current method for the administration of chemotherapy is optimal and suggests that alternative regimens should be considered.
