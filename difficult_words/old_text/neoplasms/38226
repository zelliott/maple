The nuclear architecture plays an important role in the temporal and spatial control of complex functional processes within the nucleus. Alterations in nuclear structures are characteristic of cancer cells and the mechanisms underlying these perturbations may directly contribute to tumor development and progression. In this review, we will highlight aspects of the nuclear microenvironment that are perturbed during tumorigenesis and discuss how a greater understanding of the role of nuclear structure in the control of gene expression can provide new options for cancer diagnosis and treatment.
