Selected murine monoclonal antimelanoma antibodies have been extensively evaluated using multiple radioimmunoassay methods, immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry. Use of this approach has permitted more complete definition of the specificity of these reagents and provided information regarding the nature and distribution of the respective tumor associated antigens (TAA). Several patterns of reactivity were identified. Some of the reagents were highly reactive with melanomas but also with a variety of tissues of nonmelanoma origin. Others were less highly reactive but of greater specificity for melanoma. Finally, certain of the reagents were poorly reactive in the assays utilized or demonstrated assay-dependent reactivity. None of the included monoclonal antibodies appeared to detect TAA restricted in distribution solely to melanoma.
