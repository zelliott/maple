The recent discoveries of the RNA-mediated interference system in cells could explain all of the known features of human carcinogenesis. A key, novel idea, proposed here, is that the cell has the ability to recognise a mutated protein and/or mRNA. Secondly, the cell can generate its own short interfering RNA (siRNA) using an RNA polymerase to destroy mutated mRNA, even when only a single base pair in the gene has mutated. The anti-sense strand of the short RNA molecule (called sicRNA), targets the mutated mRNA of an oncogene or a tumour suppressor. The resulting double stranded RNA, using the RNA-induced silencing complex in the cytoplasm dices the mutated mRNA. In cancer-prone tissues, during cell mitosis, the sicRNA complex can move into the nucleus to target the mutated gene. The sicRNA, possibly edited by dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase, converting adenosines to inosines, can be retained in the nucleus, with enhanced destructive capability. The sicRNA triggers the assembly of protein complexes leading to epigenetic modification of the promoter site of the mutant gene, specifically methylation of cytosines. In some instances, instead of methylation, the homologous DNA is degraded, leading to loss of heterozygosity. The factors controlling these two actions are unknown but the result is gene silencing or physical destruction of the mutant gene. The cell survives dependent on the functioning of the single, wild-type allele. An error in RNAi defence occurs when the sicRNA enters the nucleus and targets the sense strand of the wrong DNA. The sicRNA, because of the similarity of its short sequence and relaxed stringency, can target other RNAs, which are being transcribed. This can result in the methylation of the wrong promoter site of a gene or LOH of that region. In the vast majority of these cases, the aberrant hybridisations will have no effect on cell function or apoptosis eliminates non-viable cells. On a rare occasion, a preneoplastic cell is initiated when aberrant hybridisations switches on/off a gene involved in apoptosis, as well as a gene involved in cell proliferation and DNA damage surveillance. Genetic instability results when the sicRNA competes for a repeat sequence in the centromere or telomere, leading to gross chromosomal rearrangements. A malignancy develops when the sicRNAs fortuitously targets a microRNA (miRNA) or activates a transcription factor, resulting in the translation of a large number of new genes, alien to that tissue. This leads to dedifferentiation of the tissue, a resculpting of the histone code, chromosomal rearrangements, along a number of specific pathways, the gain of immortality and the dissemination of a metastatic cancer.
