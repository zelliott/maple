The reciprocal moment of action between ionising rays and heat was defined by Vallebona in the Thirties, and is of primary importance in associations between hyperthermia and radiotherapy as a means of obtaining the maximum effect on the neoplasia without serious damage to healthy tissues. The literature data on the use of such combinations in clinical oncology are assessed, together with three other variables; the interval between radiation and heat, the hyperthermic dose, and the interval between two combined treatments. The conclusion is drawn that the thermoradiobiological bases for the rational execution of controlled clinical studies of the hyperthermoradiotherapy of human tumours now exist.
