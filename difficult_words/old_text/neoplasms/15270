The authors emphasize the importance of early and exact diagnosis of musculoskeletal tumours of the extremities and spine. This aim cannot be achieved by common biochemical, haematological and X-ray examinations. Therefore the authors recommend to use already during the initial examination of the patient a combination of classical roentgenography, arteriography, possibly lymphography, gammagraphy and computed tomography. The authors present a detailed account of experience with the application of the above diagnostic methods in 146 patients. On arteriograms of 37 patients dislocated main arteries were found 16 times, blood lakes 20 times. Lymphography revealed metastatic affection of regional lymph nodes in 21% of all patients, most frequently in bone reticulosarcoma and in synovial sarcoma. All-body gammagraphy helped to make the localization and assessment of size of the tumour more accurate, in two-thirds of the patients it was larger when visualized by this method than on native roentgenograms. In 3 of 14 Ewing sarcomas all-body gammagraphy revealed a polyostotic localization of the tumour. Computed tomography revealed the extent of infiltration and destruction of bone and soft tissues in pelvic and spinal tumours.
