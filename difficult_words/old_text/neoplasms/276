Two hundred one patients were entered in a single-dose phase I trial of WR-2721 [S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid]. Major toxic effects included emesis and hypotension. The observed minor toxic effects were somnolence and sneezing. Two infusion schedules were tested: long-infusion time, which fixed the rate, but varied total time; and short-infusion time, which varied the rate, but fixed the time to 15 minutes. Emesis was significantly influenced by infusion time; the long schedule caused a 57% incidence whereas the short schedule caused only a 28% incidence. Within the long-infusion group, higher-dose patients and women were more likely to vomit. Although only 15% of the entire group had hypotension, the long-infusion schedule had a hypotension incidence of 23%; the short schedule had an incidence of only 3% (P less than 0.0005). Within the long-infusion group, dose and tumor site significantly influenced the incidence of hypotension. No factors were associated with these toxic effects in the short-infusion schedule. However, certain toxic effects were too infrequent to detect significant differences. For future trials we recommend 740 mg/m2 infused in 15 minutes. With this schedule, vomiting was seen in 25% of infusions and hypotension was seen in only one of 68 infusions. To date, no delayed toxic effects have been detected in any organ system, and the trial resulted in no toxic deaths.
