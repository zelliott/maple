Two hundred six consecutive patients were followed from 5 to 15 years after a distal splenorenal shunt operation. Nonalcoholic patients demonstrated nearly twice the survival rate when compared with alcoholic patients. The mean duration of life for the surviving nonalcoholics was 10 years and for the alcoholics, 9 years. We predict that approximately a third of the nonalcoholics will enjoy long-term survival. The operative mortality rate was similar in both groups, being about 4 percent. The risk of liver cancer was highest in the male alcoholics, and long-term survival was greater for women in both the alcoholic and nonalcoholic groups.
