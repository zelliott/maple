Lack of annual population estimates for disaggregated Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) populations limits the ability to examine cancer incidence rates and trends to understand the cancer burdens among NHOPIs.

Utilizing 1990 and 2000 population census data, we estimated the annual populations by age and sex for Native Hawaiians, Samoans, and Guamanians/Chamorros for 1990-2008 in regions covered by 13 of the National Cancer Institute's SEER registries. Cancer diagnoses during 1990-2008 from these registries were used to calculate the age-adjusted (2000 US Standard) incidence rates by sex, calendar year/period, and cancer type for each population. The annual percentage change (APC) in incidence rates was estimated with the 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) calculated for both the rate and APC estimates.

Statistically significant declining trends were found in Native Hawaiians, in men for lung and stomach cancers (APC = -2.3%; 95% CI = -3.3 to -1.3; and APC = -3.8%; 95% CI = -6.0 to -1.6, respectively), and in women for breast cancer (APC = -4.1%; 95% CI = -5.7 to -2.5) since 1998 and lung cancer (APC = -6.4%; 95% CI = -10.7 to -1.8) since 2001. Rising incidence trends were experienced by Samoans, especially by Samoan women for breast (APC = 2.7%; 95% CI = 0.9 to 4.5) and uterus (APC = 7.3%; 95% CI = 6.2 to 8.4) cancers. With limited data, Guamanians/Chamorros demonstrated lower, but increasing, incidence rates than other NHOPIs.

Population-based cancer incidence rates for disaggregated NHOPI populations help identify disparities in cancer burden and provide valuable information to improve cancer control efforts among NHOPIs.
