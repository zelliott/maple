Invasive aspergillosis (IA) has been reported only rarely among patients with solid tumors. In the current study, the authors retrospectively identified 13 episodes of definite or probable IA (using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria) occurring in patients with solid tumors who were treated between 1994-2003. Nine patients had pulmonary IA and three patients were found to have IA of the brain. Seven patients (54%) had primary or metastatic brain tumors and 6 patients (46%) received systemic steroids within 30 days prior to the diagnosis of IA. The majority of patients (69%) had a lymphocyte count &lt; 500/microL but only 1 patient was neutropenic within the 30 days before the diagnosis of IA was made. Nodular infiltrates and cavities were the most common radiologic findings. Seven patients (54%) responded to antifungal treatment.
