The Ti plasmid DNA maintained in octopine-type crown gall tumor lines is variable, but always includes at least part of the Ti plasmid that maps over the region of Hind III fragment 1 of pTiB6-806. The right-hand boundary of transferred DNA (T-DNA) varies considerably among the three independent tumor lines examined; the left boundary was not located definitively. The T-DNA of two sibling clones of the same tumor line, E1 and E9, appears identical. The copy number of T-DNA in E9 tumor DNA appears higher for the right end (about 30 copies) than for the left end (approximately 1 copy).
