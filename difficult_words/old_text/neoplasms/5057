Clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of exercise for cancer survivors. This investigation determined the effectiveness and safety of a disseminated community-based exercise program for cancer survivors who had completed treatment.

Personal trainers from regional YMCAs received training in cancer rehabilitation and supervised twice-a-week, 12-week group exercise sessions for survivors. At baseline and post-program, validated measures assessed patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and physiologic measurements.

Data were collected from 221 survivors from 13 YMCA sites and 36 separate classes. All participants had data available at one time point, while matched baseline and post-program PRO and physiologic data were available for 85% (N = 187). Participants with matched data were largely female (82%), with mean age of 58 (range, 28-91 years). Time since diagnosis ranged from 1 to 48 (mean, 5.6 years), and mean time since last treatment was 3.0 (range, 1-33 years). Physiological improvements were significant in systolic (P &lt; 0.001) and diastolic (P = 0.035) blood pressure, upper and lower body strength, the 6-min walk test (P = 0.004), and flexibility (P &lt; 0.001). Participants reported improvements in overall health-related quality of life (P &lt; 0.001), social support (P = 0.019), body pain (P = 0.016), fatigue (P &lt; 0.001), insomnia (P &lt; 0.001), and overall musculoskeletal symptoms (P = &lt;0.001). Few injuries or lymphedema events occurred during classes.

Community-based exercise groups for cancer survivors of mixed diagnoses and ages, who have completed active treatment, have physiologic and psychosocial benefits, and are safe.

Survivors may expect significant benefit from participating in a community-based exercise program tailored to meet their individual needs as a survivor.
