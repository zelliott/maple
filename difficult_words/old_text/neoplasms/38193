During the past two decades, there have been a number of unsuccessful replication attempts of our finding that group psychotherapy improves cancer survival. One explanation for this failure is that the wrong phenomenon has been studied. Rather than focusing on the effects of the psychotherapeutic relationship, perhaps, the focus should have been on the social support provided and networks developed by these groups. Since the late 1970s, a growing body of research indicates the importance of social networks and social support on reductions in not only all cause mortality, but also disease specific mortality including cancer. We have learned about how the health, well-being, and ultimate survival of cancer patients is improved by social support and social networks. The social milieu within which we live can provide resources that facilitate reintegration into society. These resources at the individual level, such as one's perception of social and emotional support, at the level of one's social ties with family and friends, and at the community level appear to improve survival across disease conditions including cancer. Even though, the mechanisms by which these endpoints are achieved remain elusive, there is much that can be done. The challenge of our time is to translate what we already know into programs to improve quality of life and to focus research toward increasing our understanding the mechanisms.
