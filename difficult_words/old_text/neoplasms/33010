Histochemical and electron microscope studies indicated there was amyloid in corpora amylacea in tumors, duct ectasias and lobular hyperplasias of rat mammary glands. Electron microscopy showed fibrils that closely resembled amyloid fibrils in human and bovine amyloid and in bovine corpora amylacea. Amyloid deposition may be more common in rats than is generally thought.
