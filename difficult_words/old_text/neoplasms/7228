A series of 18 patients with odontoid fractures due to metastatic cancer were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1974--1980. The primary source of cancer was breast (12 cases), lung (two cases), nasopharynx (one case), multiple myeloma (one case), colon (one case), and rhabdomyosarcoma (one case). The clinical features consisted of severe neck pain and neck stiffness in 17 patients; signs of cord compression were noted in only four patients. Tomography and computerized tomography were useful in identifying both the osseous and soft-tissue involvement by tumor. Initial treatment in all patients except those with myelopathy consisted of high-dose steroids, and immobilization in a hard collar. Ten patients were treated with radiation therapy alone; six patients underwent surgical fusion (four before and two after radiation therapy); and two patients died before completion of treatment. Conservatively treated patients were allowed to walk with the support of only a collar following radiation therapy. We believe that the initial management of patients with odontoid fractures secondary to cancer should be high-dose steroids and radiation therapy, unless displacement is marked. Assessment for surgical fusion should be made following radiation therapy, since conservative treatment may suffice in most patients. Early recognition is important so that treatment can be instituted before C1--2 subluxation becomes severe.
