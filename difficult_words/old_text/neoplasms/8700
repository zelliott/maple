Interdisciplinary cancer conferences (ICC), which deal with the problems of individual patients, are an appropriate instrument for coordinating interdisciplinary decisions at an early stage and for ensuring adherence to standard diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. As shown by seven-years experience and data from 1225 cases, about 80% of the decisions made by the conference are followed by the responsible physician. Regular meetings at suitable times and locations, effective preparation with information about the problems to be discussed and rapid distribution of written reports to all participants will guarantee a continuing interest in presenting patients at the ICC.
