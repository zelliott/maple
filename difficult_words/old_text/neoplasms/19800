Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent used for the treatment of recurrent or newly diagnosed malignant gliomas with significant survival benefit. TMZ is generally well tolerated and safe. The most common side effects are mild to moderate, and are represented by fatigue, nausea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. However severe hematologic adverse events (HAEs), including myelodysplastic syndrome and aplastic anemia, have also been reported. In this review we present an overview of the available literature of HAEs after exposure to TMZ.
