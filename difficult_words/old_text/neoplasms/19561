This study reports the findings of a quantitative study determining the satisfaction levels of patients attending a nurse-led oncology day ward. A random sample of 100 patients was surveyed using an adapted version of the Leeds Satisfaction Questionnaire (Hill, 1997) to ascertain the satisfaction levels of patients attending the unit. Satisfaction levels were found to be favorable in general. However, the study did highlight that some aspects of patient information required attention. Moreover, issues with the use of the questionnaire emerged as the inclusion of both positive and negative statements in the Likert-style questionnaire presented contradictory findings.
