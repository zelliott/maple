The purpose of this study was to investigate if KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria could be a useful outcome predictor of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (CIA).

In the period between January 2006 and December 2011, we identified Japanese patients who had been diagnosed with cancer and treated with cisplatin as a first-line chemotherapy at Nagoya University Hospital. The serum creatinine was used to define CIA and determine the KDIGO criteria of each patient after chemotherapy within 7 days.

Eighty-nine patients (5.4%) were classified as having acute kidney injury (AKI) going by the KDIGO criteria, and the numbers of patients classified into AKI stages 1, 2 and 3 were 65 (3.9%), 18 (1.1%) and 6 (0.4%), respectively. Overall survival times were significantly shorter in AKI stages 2 and 3 than in stage 1. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with all patients was 0.68, and that of patients who were diagnosed with cancer stage 4 was 0.80.

These results suggest that KDIGO criteria can be a predictor of CIA mortality in patients with different primary cancers.
