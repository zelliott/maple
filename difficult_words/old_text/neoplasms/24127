Using breast health and illness, this article reviews relevant research literature and compares it for congruency with patient stories. Inconsistencies and issues found are related to desired outcomes and decision-making. Patients may view cancer treatment as an unbroken continuum from pre-diagnosis to completion of treatment. While moving through the continuum, they interact with nursing professionals in several roles and locations. Strategic suggestions acknowledge the need to incorporate health professionals, patients and families in the continuing education activity. Nurses working in continuing education have the opportunity to improve care along the treatment continuum and reduce the distance between research and practice. Implications for nursing practice and continuing education are identified. Suggestions for enhancing continuing education related to this continuum are made.
