In the 1990s, based on the results of studies using beta(2)M, CD4 or CD8 knockout mice, several groups reported that the main effector cells responsible for skin or organ allograft rejection were non-T, non-NK cells. Similarly, we demonstrated that in an animal model of transplantation of BALB/c (H-2(d)) skin onto or Meth A (H-2(d)) tumor cells into C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) mice, AIM, which expressed iNOS, IL-12, and IL-18, were the main effector cells and also that they were cytotoxic against syngeneic tumor cells. Here, we examined whether the same population of macrophages could react with two distinct types of target cell. When BALB/c skin or Meth A tumor cells were transplanted into C57BL/6 mice, cytotoxic activity against the allograft was induced in the transplantation site on days 5-14 and was recovered in non-adherent cells after a 20-min incubation in a serum-coated dish, suggesting the induction of a type of AIM (AIM-1) in the transplantation site. The AIM-1-expressing receptors for H-2D(d)K(d) antigens had no cytotoxic activity against syngeneic tumor cells. In contrast, AIM-2, which were recovered in the fraction adherent to the serum-coated dish, exhibited cytotoxic activities against various types of tumor cells, whereas they were inactive toward BALB/c skin. AIM expressed iNOS (AIM-1 &lt; AIM-2), IL-12 (AIM-1 &gt; AIM-2), and IL-18 (AIM-2 alone) mRNAs. These results indicate that after allografting, two distinct types of cytotoxic AIM were induced in the transplantation site, one against the allografted skin or tumor (AIM-1) and the other against allogeneic or syngeneic tumor cells (AIM-2).
