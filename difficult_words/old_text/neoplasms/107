Eighteen cancer patients receiving intensive chemotherapy developed leukopenia, fever, dysphagia, and oropharyngeal soreness. Superficial esophageal ulceration suggestive of esophagitis was demonstrated by radiographic examination in 33% of the patients (5/15). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed superficial ulceration and white mucosal patches in all patients. There was no morbidity associated with the endoscopic procedures. Sixty-one percent of the patients (11/18) had monilia albicans cultured from the oropharyngeal cavity, and 50% (9/18) had monilia cultured from the esophageal lesions. The evolution of the esophagitis correlated well with the survival of the patients. The monilial esophagitis persisted in six patients who all died within 24 days of systemic moniliasis. After initial improvement five additional patients succumbed; three of them from severe fungal infection. There was resolution of the esophagitis in the remaining seven patients who survived longer. However, two of them had recurrent monilial esophagitis and succumbed to systemic candidiasis. The other five have remained free of esophagitis, their underlying malignancies have remained under control, and so far they have survived an average of one and a half years. Endoscopy is more accurate than radiography in detecting postchemotherapy esophagitis. This complication can be fatal, since it is often followed by systemic candidiasis.
