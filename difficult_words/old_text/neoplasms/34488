In an investigation of a new oral analgesic agent, codeine was chosen as the reference drug because of its established reputation as an effective agent for the relief of pain. Thirty-five patients with cancer pain were studied. Their average age was 58 years, During a 5-day hospital stay they received, on each of three days, either codeine (120 mg or 60 mg) or placebo. At hourly intervals after ingestion the nurse observer collected data on pain intensity and the degree of pain relief, and the patients independently charted the hourly intensity. Statistical analysis failed to show any significant superiority of either dose of codeine over placebo. Moreover, codeine is known to have a constipating effect. Re-appraisal of the value of codeine as an analgesic agent in elderly patients seems justified.
