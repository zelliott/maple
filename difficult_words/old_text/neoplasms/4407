Patient-focused care seeks to improve both patient and staff satisfaction while reducing the costs associated with health care services. Concepts borrowed from inpatient care settings are now being applied to outpatient facilities. Incorporating many of the Planetree principles in design ensures that patients' physical as well as emotional and psychological needs will be addressed. In addition, these same principles, while patient focused, serve the staff needs as well as by providing varied tasks, increasing levels of responsibility, and improving efficiencies in operations by improved design.
