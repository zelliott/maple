Research indicates unmet religious and spiritual needs among cancer patients both internationally and in a secular society like Denmark. Obtaining a patient's spiritual history is a way of identifying religious/spiritual needs. Spiritual well-being has been positively associated with global experience of quality of life and with increased psychological, social, and physiological well-being. Although religiosity/spirituality may represent a way of coping with cancer, at present no causality can be implied with respect to this relationship.
