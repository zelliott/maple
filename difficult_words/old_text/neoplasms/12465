Symptomatic sedation is often required in terminally ill cancer patients and could cause significant distress to their families. The aim of this study was to gather vivid family descriptions about their experiences in palliative sedation therapy.

This report is an additional analysis of a multicenter questionnaire survey. We performed content analysis on 48 statements described by 185 bereaved family members of patients who received palliative sedation therapy.

Family members reported guilt, helplessness, and physical and emotional exhaustion when patients received palliative sedation therapy. They were concerned about whether sedated patients experienced distress, wished to know that the maximum efforts had been made, wished to prepare for patient death, wished to tell important things to patients before sedation, wished to understand patients' suffering, and wanted medical professionals to treat patients with dignity.

To alleviate family distress, clinicians should understand families' emotional distress, ensure that unconscious patients feel no distress, reassure family members that the symptoms are truly refractory despite maximum efforts for symptom relief, give information and coordinate the situation to enable families to prepare for patient death and to tell important things to patients before sedation, help families to share patients' suffering, and treat patients the same as when they remained conscious.
