To identify attendance patterns in a childhood cancer long term follow up clinic, in order to inform decision making strategies for efficient, cost effective local and national surveillance of survivors.

Cross-sectional review of 385 individuals &gt;5 years from completion of cancer therapy in childhood or adolescence, attending a regional paediatric oncology and haematology centre.

Attenders were younger than non-attenders in the &lt;18 age group; no differences were found for &gt; or =18 year age group. Those attending clinic were more recently off treatment; no significant difference existed for those &lt;7 years from completion of therapy. A greater proportion of attenders were in the most affluent socioeconomic groups with a greater proportion of non-attenders in the lower groups. Those in full time education or training were more likely to attend and those unemployed were less likely. Multiple regression analysis confirmed a significant trend in reduction in attendance with increasing social deprivation, and that attenders were more than twice as likely to be in full time education or training.

Following cancer treatment in childhood and adolescence, attendance at long term follow up programmes is determined by social factors including education, employment, and deprivation.
