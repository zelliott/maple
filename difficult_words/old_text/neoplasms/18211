Twenty years ago the fist bona fide death receptor, APO-1/FAS/CD95 was discovered along with the pathways that regulate programmed cell death or apoptosis. From the very beginning, this research was considered to have substantial impact on diseases and to provide a rational strategy for therapeutic intervention. In particular cell death research proved to be the key for the development of novel strategies for cancer therapy. In the past two decades, deregulated apoptosis in tumors has been delineated and possible targets for therapeutic intervention have been identified. However, it still took a long way until this work could be translated into clinical trials only in the past few years. Current strategies involve modification of apoptosis signalling based on our knowledge of sensitivity and resistance for apoptosis induction rather than the use of individual agents for cytotoxicity. In this review, an overview of the developments in the field from basic discoveries to the recent clinical trials is given.
