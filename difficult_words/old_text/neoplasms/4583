Taxol is a novel cytostatic agent which inhibits the depolymerisation of microtubulin. The stabilization of this important substance leads to cellular arrest and consecutively apoptosis. Accordingly, taxol is capable to influence neoplastic growth in several malignancies. At present the following standard regimen is recommended: 175 mg/m2 taxol in a 3-hour i. v. infusion following corticosteroid + diphenhydramine + cimetidine premedication. Its antitumour activity has been proved especially in advanced ovarian and breast cancer. Encouraging results have been reported in various bronchial, testicular malignancies, lymphomas and leukemias. Clinical investigations in several other malignancies are ongoing.
