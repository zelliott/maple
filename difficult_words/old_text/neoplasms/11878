Two commercially available grades of the refractory fibre SAFFIL were administered to rats by intraperitoneal injection and the tissue reaction was compared. Although the fibres differed considerably in surface properties and porosity the tissue reactions were identical and consisted of a mild chronic inflammatory response with a small amount of collagen present. The reaction was quite distinct from the marked fibrosis induced by chrysotile asbestos. As the reaction to all fibres tested had stabilised after 6 months, a longer observation period is unnecessary.
