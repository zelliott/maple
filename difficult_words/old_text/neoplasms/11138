The provision of tele-practice symptom management is often without the provision of evidence-based guidelines. Under the auspices of the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, a nursing task force was established to appraise the evidence and develop guidelines. Promising new efforts to enhance symptom management through tele-practice are emerging. Seven guidelines and one documentation tool were created from evidence compiled from case reports, clinical examples, and nonexperimental studies. The symptom management guidelines contribute to the paucity of literature and may serve as a useful resource for health professionals providing telephone advice and conducting tele-practice symptom management assessments.
