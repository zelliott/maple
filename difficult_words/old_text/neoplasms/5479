Tumor localization using fluorescence has been made practical by current improvements in tumor targeting molecules, especially monoclonal antibodies and their derivatives, by the development of convenient near-infrared emitting fluorochromes and by the availability of digital cameras having high sensitivity in this spectral region. Recent studies in animals have demonstrated that fluorochrome labeling of monoclonal antibodies confers adequate sensitivity and improved resolution. Distribution and catabolism of fluorochrome-labeled and radiolabeled antibodies are similar. Simultaneous localization of multiple reagents is made possible by labeling with several different near-infrared emitting fluorochromes; thus background subtraction and differential labeling of multiple tumor-associated components can be performed. Difficulties in using the fluorochrome labels are mainly related to light scattering and absorption in tissues, but detection of small tumors at depths of several millimeters is feasible. The major medical use of this new technology is likely to be endoscopic location of tumors. Scientific uses include studies of tumor metastasis, uptake and distribution of drugs and tumor-targeting molecules by tumors, and migration patterns of near-infrared labeled cells in vivo.
