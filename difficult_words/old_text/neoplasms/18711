The use of PET/PET-CT is a rapidly growing area of imaging and research in the care of children. Until recently, diagnostic imaging methods have provided either anatomical or functional assessment. The development of fused imaging modalities, such as PET-CT or PET-MRI, now provides the opportunity for simultaneously providing both anatomical and functional or physiological assessment. This review will discuss current established uses of PET-CT, possible uses and potential research investigations in the use of this modality in the pediatric population. The focus of this paper will be its use in children being treated for non-central nervous system and non-cardiac disorders.
