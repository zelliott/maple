Leukotrienes (LTs) are intercellular signaling molecules that evoke a variety of responses. They are best known as potent promoters of inflammation. Normally, LTs are produced primarily by leukocytes. As a result, current models regarding the production of LTs in the context of disease focus on the leukocytes as the site of production. Structural cells, including epithelial cells, are typically relegated to supportive roles. It is recognized that epithelial cells normally contain all the components necessary for LT synthesis except the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). There is accumulating evidence that some populations of epithelial cells normally express low levels of 5-LO and can synthesize LTs autonomously. Moreover, certain factors, including bacterial and viral infection, can promote the expression of 5-LO in airway, gastrointestinal and skin epithelial cells. The appearance of active 5-LO enzyme in epithelial cells at these sites may contribute to diseases like cancer, colitis and psoriasis. This paper reviews the state of our knowledge regarding the expression of 5-LO in epithelial cells, the factors that modify that expression, and the implications regarding pathogenesis.
