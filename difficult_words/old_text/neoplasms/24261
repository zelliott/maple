This study presents data on general mortality and mortality from external causes (traffic accidents and homicides) among adolescents 10 to 19 years of age in Rio de Janeiro Municipality, Brazil, from 1980 to 1994. The purpose of the study was to describe and put into context mortality from external causes and to identify areas of the Municipality where the risk of these occurrences is highest. The study also sought to identify trends and seasonal patterns of this mortality and to place violence within the ambit of public health through application of the epidemiologic surveillance approach. Information on mortality was extracted from death certificates provided by the State Health Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro. A total of 20,224 death certificates were studied. The populations used as the denominators for determining rates were estimated from the censuses of 1980 and 1991. For purposes of the analysis; the Municipality was divided into eight programmatic areas, each composed of diverse neighboring districts. A time series analysis was done for traffic accidents and homicides. The results showed that external causes were the leading causes of death in the 10-19 age group, and that during the study period deaths from these causes had increased, especially among males. The results also revealed that mortality was heterogeneously distributed in areas of the Municipality that differed socioeconomically. The study points to the need for better integration of the health sector with other sectors and institutions and for a restructuring of the health system with regard to epidemiologic surveillance of violence.
