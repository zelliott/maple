Suramin, an antitrypanosomal agent used since the early 1920s for the treatment of onchocerciasis and African sleeping sickness is now under active investigation as an antineoplastic drug characterized by an unusual and interesting mechanism of action and by a peculiar pattern of toxicity. Its capacity to interfere with the autocrine loop which promotes the growth of many human tumors as well as the suggested ability to modify the tumoral environment (chiefly by inhibiting the angiogenesis) holds out great promises for a major step forward in cancer therapy.
