The incidence of viral warts, recurrent herpes simplex and herpes zoster has been assessed in a group of patients with possible secondary immune deficiency states and compared to a control group. Patients with cell-mediated immune deficiency appear to be more prone to warts and zoster infection as compared to patients with humoral immune deficiency. Recurrent herpes simplex infection was not increased in either group.
