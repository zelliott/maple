In an attempt to gain insight into the mechanism of oncogenic transformation by BK virus (BKV), a human papovavirus, we have probed for BKV sequences in transformed hamster cells in which oncogenic transformation had occurred as a result of transfection by human tumor DNA positive for BKV sequences. Even though the sources of the transfecting DNA contained BKV sequences, the transformed hamster cells which arose from the transfection for the most part did not retain BKV sequences. In only one barely detectable case was BKV-specific DNA found associated with chromosomal DNA, and in only a small minority of the transformed cells was BKV DNA detected in the Hirt supernatant, indicating an episomal configuration. Even in these few cases where BKV sequences were present in an episomal form, altered migration on gels of some BKV-positive bands (compared to bands derived from cloned viral DNA) suggested deletions and rearrangements of BKV DNA. We employed several different probe methodologies for these studies, including nick-translation, random primer and a non-isotopic biotinylated probe which gave a sensitivity that could detect better than 0.01 copy of viral genome per diploid cell. We conclude that transformation by transfection with human tumor DNA does not require persistence of the BKV viral genome, suggesting that either BKV virus was irrelevant to original oncogenesis, in analogy with models proposed by others for herpesvirus oncogenesis.
