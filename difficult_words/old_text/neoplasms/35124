Today, patients who have a diagnosis of cancer often face the same concerns as persons who have other types of chronic illnesses. The effects of the disease, the treatment, or both, may leave patients with residual impairments that necessitate sometimes prolonged periods of rehabilitation. Rehabilitation may be preventive, restorative, supportive, or palliative, depending on the type and stage of the disease and characteristics of the patient. Rehabilitation is most effectively planned and carried out by a team composed of various disciplines, as appropriate, but always with the patient and family as the central members of the team. Patients need to be well-informed about the illness and treatment from an early stage and assisted in learning methods to deal with problems they may face in areas such as coping, independent functioning, sexual functioning, employment, and financial pressures. The physician can provide the most effective care to the patient by being familiar with and involving the wide range of rehabilitation services, community support programs, and necessary resources. Through these services, patients can be helped to lead productive and satisfying lives.
