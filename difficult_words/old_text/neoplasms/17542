Free radicals and peroxides of our organism, that are very unstable, are now recognized as a product of biological oxido-reductive processes. The evaluation of free radicals and peroxides in blood was done by counting Heinz-bodies (H.B.) (Beutler method). The Authors examined 40 healthy subjects, at rest, and 37 neoplastic patients (19 carcinomas, 10 leukemias, 8 lymphomas) at the admission to hospital. The results show that the rate per cent of H.B. in neoplastic patients is significantly higher than in healthy subjects. According to us, neoplastic patients have free radicals hematic levels higher than healthy volunteers.
