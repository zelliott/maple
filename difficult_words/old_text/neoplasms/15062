Traditional Chinese Medicine have played a good role in preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis according to the previous studies, so we can suppose that tumor stem cells may be the final target of TCM in preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. To expand the effect and study the mechanism of action we should introduce the tumor stem cells into the study of TCM in treating malignant tumor.
