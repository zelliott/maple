Loss of cell cycle control and tumor-induced neovascularization are major drivers of human tumor growth. The multi-target tumor growth inhibitor ZK 304709 is a nanomolar inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 1, 2, 4, 7 and 9, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase 1-3 and of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta tyrosine kinase. The multi-targeted mode of action of ZK 304709 acting on cell cycle and angiogenesis resulted in superior efficacy compared to standard chemotherapeutic compounds both in s.c. human tumor xenografts as well as orthotopic human pancreatic carcinoma models.
