Beta-transducin repeats-containing proteins (beta-TrCP) serve as the substrate recognition subunits for the SCFbeta-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligases. These ligases ubiquitinate specifically phosphorylated substrates and play a pivotal role in the regulation of cell division and various signal transduction pathways, which, in turn, are essential for many aspects of tumorigenesis. We review the functions of the SCFbeta-TrCP ligases in the light of their relevance to cell growth, survival and transformation. Mechanisms underlying beta-TrCP regulation and their aberration in human and animal cancer as well as prospective of targeting beta-TrCP as a means of anticancer therapy are also discussed.
