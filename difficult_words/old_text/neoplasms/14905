Procalcitonin and C-reactive-protein are inflammatory markers for sepsis. The authors evaluated their sensitivity and specificity in pediatric patients with cancer and febrile neutropenia.

Serum procalcitonin and C-reactive-protein were evaluated. Patients (n = 54) were divided into 2 groups, with severe infection (n = 18) or without documented infection (n = 36).

Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in the high-risk group. Procalcitonin displayed 72.2% sensitivity and 80.5% specificity. C-reactive-protein had a sensitivity of 77.7% and specificity of 77.2%.

Procalcitonin is an accurate predictor of bacterial infection in neutropenic children, while C-reactive-protein may be a better screening test in emergency settings.
