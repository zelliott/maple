Large field fractionated irradiation was provided to 32 patients aged 24 to 75 with tumor dissemination in the absence of the effect of other types of therapy including local gamma-beam therapy. The upper part of the body (as a result of the lung involvement) was irradiated in most of the patients. A single dose of irradiation was 100-500 cGy, the total dose--10-24 Gy. Irradiation was delivered from 2 opposite fields using a ROKUS-M unit. The effect was noted in 5 patients, improvement of the general status--in 22, remission--in 5 patients, 16 patients died. Their mean survival time starting from large field irradiation was 6.5 mos (1-10 mos).
