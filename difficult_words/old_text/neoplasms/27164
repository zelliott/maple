We put forward a model for cancer metastasis as a migration phenomenon between tumor cell populations coexisting and evolving in two different habitats. One of them is a primary tumor and the other one is a secondary or metastatic tumor. The evolution of the different cell phenotype populations in each habitat is described by means of a simple quasispecies model allowing for a cascade of mutations between the different phenotypes in each habitat. The cell migration event is supposed to be unidirectional and take place continuously in time. The possible clinical outcomes of the model depending on the parameter space are analyzed and the effect of the resection of the primary tumor is studied.
