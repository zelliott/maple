The Cancer Pain Role Model Program was established in 1990 by the Wisconsin Cancer Pain Initiative to train physicians to be role models for appropriate pain management. Community and academic physicians along with their "clinical partners," a nurse or pharmacist, were recruited to attend a 1-day education conference that included lectures, small group workshops, and development of an action plan. A total of 44 physicians and 55 clinical partners have attended two conferences (1990 and 1991). Participants listed 199 activities on their action plans; postconference surveys have documented initiation of 212 projects aimed at educating others, improving clinical care, resource development, educating self, or research. The Cancer Pain Role Model Program appears to be a promising means of transferring cancer pain information, legitimizing cancer pain as an important treatment issue, and institutionalizing cancer pain management.
