Angiogenesis is a crucial requirement for tumorigenesis and metastatic diffusion. Recent improvements in the knowledge of these processes allowed the development of multiple inhibitors, among these, three have been approved. Today, none of these drugs is available in combination with radiation therapy. However, multiple preclinical showed synergistic effect. This effect could be explained by a transitory improvement of tumor hypoxia, leading to higher radiation sensitivity. Hence, further studies need to be conducted to assess toxicities, doses and sequences of the combination. Numerous of phases I and II clinical trials are ongoing and answers are awaited.
