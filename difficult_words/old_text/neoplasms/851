Diabetes mellitus is the commonest chronic disease in post-menopausal women and is a predisposing factor for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in this cohort in Western societies. Diabetes and the menopause are two independent risk factors for development of cardiovascular disease. Risk factor modification in terms of diabetes appears straightforward; however, correction of oestrogen deficiency which hallmarks the menopause appears complex. Our aim is to discuss this question based on the evidence available. Co-morbid diseases are common in post-menopausal diabetics. Hence, it not easy to either conduct or establish clear causal relationships in randomised controlled trials. Consequently, making decisions about treatment becomes difficult. However, it is important adopt strategies to help post-menopausal diabetic women alleviate their menopausal symptoms and to minimise the adverse consequences of their condition. We conclude that the low-risk diabetic post-menopausal women should be offered appropriate hormone replacement therapy, whereas non-oestrogen-based treatments should be the treatment of choice for high-risk women.
