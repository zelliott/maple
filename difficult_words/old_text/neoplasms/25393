The human carcinogenic activity of 4-4' amino diphenyl and 2 amino naphthalene, drew occupational physician's attention to "aromatic amines" as potentially carcinogenic compounds. The chemical-physical and biological properties of groups of products with structure very similar to them, show that the expression "aromatic amines" cannot define a class of compounds, but that it is necessary to consider only individual substances. The solutions carried out in industry for the replacement of some human cancerogenic products are reported.
