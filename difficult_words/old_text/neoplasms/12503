Cancer cachexia is a serious and life-treating syndrome that appears in most solid tumor patients. The syndrome is associated with anorexia, loss of protein mass, wasting of lipids, and disturbances of carbohydrate metabolism. Moreover, psychological distress and lower quality of life are often seen in patients with cancer cachexia. The latter is a multimodality process in which cytokine interactions, action of enzymes playing a key role in lipid metabolism, and activity of proteolytic proteinases are the complex net that are responsible for destruction of an organism suffering from cancer cachexia. Recently, it has been shown a growing role of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in cachexia. Biochemical interactions are crucial for further study, mainly, when a novel target therapy appears to treat cancer in different modalities. In case of proteasome, PS-341 (bortezomib, Velcade) an inhibitor of proteasome is under investigation in clinical trials phase I.
