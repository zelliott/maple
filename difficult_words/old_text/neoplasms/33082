Driving high-level transgene expression in a tumour-specific manner remains a key requirement in the development of cancer gene therapy. We have previously demonstrated the strong anticancer effects of generating abnormally high levels of intracellular NO(*) following the overexpression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene. Much of this work has focused on utilizing exogenously activated promoters, which have been primarily induced using X-ray radiation. Here we further examine the potential of the pE9 promoter, comprising a combination of nine CArG radio-responsive elements, to drive the iNOS transgene. Effects of X-ray irradiation on promoter activity were compared in vitro under normoxic conditions and various degrees of hypoxia. The pE9 promoter generated high-level transgene expression, comparable with that achieved using the constitutively driven cytomegalovirus promoter. Furthermore, the radio-resistance of radiation-induced fibrosarcoma-1 (RIF-1) mouse sarcoma cells exposed to 0.1 and 0.01% O(2) was effectively eliminated following transfection with the pE9/iNOS construct. Significant inhibition of tumour growth was also observed in vivo following direct intratumoural injection of the pE9/iNOS construct compared to empty vector alone (P&lt;0.001) or to a single radiation dose of 10 Gy (P&lt;0.01). The combination of both therapies resulted in a significant 4.25 day growth delay compared to the gene therapy treatment alone (P&lt;0.001). In summary, we have demonstrated the potential of the pE9/iNOS construct for reducing radio-resistance conferred by tumour cell hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, with greater tumour growth delay observed following the treatment with the gene therapy construct as compared with radiotherapy alone.
