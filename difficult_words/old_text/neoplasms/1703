Occupational illness plays a prominent role in the health of society, yet physicians frequently neglect occupational history-taking both in clinical practice and in medical education. This study sought to examine the trends as well as related factors that influence the taking of occupationally related histories. A total of 2050 charts were reviewed for occupational information as well as several patient demographics. Physicians obtained gender and age histories in approximately 99% of their patients; however; they only completed an occupational history in 27.8%. Characteristics such as smoking, male gender, family cancer history, middle age, and medical (vs. surgical) admission were all correlated with obtaining an occupational history. Physicians continue to do a poor job of occupational history-taking and medical education must correct the situation.
