Pazopanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeted to angiogenesis, has been tested in preclinical and clinical trials and has shown promising activity against a variety of solid tumors, such as renal cancer, all of which are related to the angiogenic pathway. It has a safety profile related to this mechanism of action. Diarrhea, hypertension, hair depigmentation and nausea are the most common side effects. Pazopanib is currently under evaluation as monotherapy and in combination with some potentially synergistic agents of proven activity.
