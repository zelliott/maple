Malignancy-associated musculoskeletal syndromes can present in a variety of ways which are not distinguishable from idiopathic rheumatic diseases. Furthermore, there are some rare, but typical syndromes with a high association with neoplasms. To perform a quick and exact diagnosis while avoiding useless invasive and expensive diagnostic procedures is a major challenge for the clinician. This article focuses on the clinical features of paraneoplastic musculoskeletal syndromes and theories about the underlying pathogenesis. We try to highlight those clinical and laboratory aspects which could be a clue to hidden malignancies. Paraneoplastic rheumatic syndromes are rare conditions, but timely recognition can save lives.
