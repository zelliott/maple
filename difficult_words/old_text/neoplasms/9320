Pralatrexate is a rationally designed antifolate with greater preclinical antitumor activity than methotrexate. Pralatrexate was synergistic with paclitaxel and with docetaxel in mouse xenograft experiments. This phase 1 study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of pralatrexate plus paclitaxel or docetaxel in patients with advanced cancer.

Pralatrexate was administered i.v. every 2 weeks (days 1 and 15) in a 4-week cycle. Depending on the taxane used and dose being tested, the taxane was administered on days 1 and 15; days 2 and 16; or days 1, 8, and 15. In the latter part of the study, patients in the docetaxel arm were treated with vitamin B(12) and folic acid supplementation to mitigate toxicity and allow pralatrexate dose escalation.

For the combination of pralatrexate plus paclitaxel without vitamin supplementation, dose-limiting stomatitis and peripheral neuropathy were encountered at the lowest dose levels tested. For pralatrexate plus docetaxel plus vitamin supplementation, pralatrexate 120 mg/m(2) plus docetaxel 35 mg/m(2) administered on the same day every other week was defined as the maximum tolerated dose and schedule, with dose-limiting toxicities at higher dose combinations including stomatitis and asthenia. Significant antitumor activity was observed for this combination in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.

Pralatrexate (120 mg/m(2)) plus docetaxel (35 mg/m(2)) plus vitamin supplementation is well tolerated with signs of efficacy against non-small-cell lung cancer that merit phase 2 testing.
