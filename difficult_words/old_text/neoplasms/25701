The purpose of this study was to explore the influence that chronic and potentially fatal illness has on the caregiving process over time. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 26 family caregivers of people experiencing AIDS or advanced cancer over a 4-month period. Constant comparative analysis was used to analyze the data. A substantive theory of family caregiving for people with life-threatening illnesses was developed around a core organizing theme: the labor of caregiving. Four phases emerged: becoming a caregiver, taking care, midwifing the death, and taking the next step. This study validates the taking-care or "tasks" aspect of caregiving, revealing that issues and tasks vary in each phase of caregiving. The key role of the caregiver in contributing to the quality of life of the ill person was apparent in the initial phase of an illness as well as at the time of death.
