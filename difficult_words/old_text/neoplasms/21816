To analyse the effect of GP home visits on the granting of a terminal declaration (TD) and on place of death.

A total of 2025 patients with cancer as the primary cause of death in the period 1997-1998, were investigated in a mortality follow-back design using the Danish Cancer Register and four administrative registers. The Danish TD can be issued by a physician for patients with an estimated prognosis of six months or less. The TD gives the right to economic benefits and increased care for the dying patient.

The island of Funen/Denmark.

Main outcome--hospital death. Intermediate outcome--TD.

A total of 38% of patients received a TD and 56% died in hospital. GP home visits in the week before TD (odds ratio (OR): 16.8; 95% CI: 8.2-34.4), as well as four weeks before TD (OR: 6.4; 95% CI: 4.5-9.2) were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving a TD. GP home visits in the group with TD (OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.11-0.29) and the group without TD (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.05-0.13) was inversely associated with hospital death. A dose-response relationship was found in both groups.

Persistent involvement by the GP is associated with improved end-of-life care for cancer patients. Provided that temporal relations are taken into account, the mortality follow-back design can be a suitable and ethical research method to highlight and monitor end-of-life cancer care.
