Implanted subcutaneous (s.c.) central venous port accesses including Port-A-Cath (PAC) facilitate the administration of chemotherapy or blood products and are frequently used in children with cancer. The incidence of PAC-related infections was determined in 155 consecutive paediatric cancer patients with PAC followed for a total of 134,773 days (median, 738; range, 25-2080). Overall, 48 bloodstream infections occurred in 26 patients. 12 (25%) of these infections and 3 local infections at the insertion site were treatment-resistant and demanded removal of the PAC. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were involved in 12 of these 15 episodes. The rate of clearly PAC-related infections in this so far largest reported series was 0.11 episodes per 1000 PAC days, one of the lowest in the literature. Although catheter-related infections demanded PAC removal in 8% of our patients, the long periods PAC were in use and their benefits argue for continued PAC use in the paediatric cancer population.
