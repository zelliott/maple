Failure of apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer. As an execution-phase caspase, caspase-3 plays a crucial role during apoptosis. To explore the possibility that the genetic alterations of CASP3, which encodes caspase-3, might be involved in the development of human tumors, we analyzed the entire coding region and all splice sites of human CASP3 gene for the detection of somatic mutations in a series of 944 human tumors, including 165 stomach carcinomas, 95 colon carcinomas, 76 breast carcinomas, 80 hepatocellular carcinomas, 181 non-small cell lung cancers, 45 acute leukemias, 28 multiple myelomas, 12 medulloblastomas, 15 Wilms' tumors, 12 renal cell carcinomas, 40 esophagus carcinomas, 33 urinary bladder carcinomas, 33 laryngeal carcinomas, and 129 non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Overall, we detected 14 somatic mutations of the CASP3 gene, including six missense and four silent mutations, two mutations in the introns, one mutation in the 5'-untranslated region, and one mutation in the 3'-untranslated region. The mutations were observed in four of 98 colon carcinomas (4.1%), four of 181 non-small cell lung cancers (2.2%), two of 129 non-Hodgkin lymphomas (1.6%), two of 165 stomach carcinomas (1.2%), one of 80 hepatocellular carcinomas (1.3%), and one of 28 multiple myelomas (3.6%). This is the first report on CASP3 gene mutations in human tumors; these data indicate that the CASP3 gene is occasionally mutated in human tumors.
