Psycho-oncology is only about twenty-five years old, emerging since the diagnosis of cancer began to be revealed and honest discussions could occur about this illness. The stigma has diminished and much progress has been made in that short period. This small new field brings concepts to care that incorporate both prevention and delivery of services to reduce distress and enhance well-being. Its first dimension studies the psychological reaction of patients at all stages of the disease, as well as those of the family and healthcare staff, and the second dimension explores the psychological, social, and behavioral factors that may impact on cancer incidence and survival. Psycho-oncology has a place at the table within the oncology community, both in clinical care and in research, especially related to prevention, quality of life, symptom control, and palliative care. Psycho-oncology is part of the continuum of cancer care that includes primary and secondary prevention at one end, and survivors and palliative care at the other. Our present body of information rests on a large database of research. Implementation of what we know now could greatly improve the psychological well-being and quality of life of patients with cancer.
