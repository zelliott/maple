NeyTumorin is a combination of peptides and proteins of 15 different organs from fetal and young pigs and cows. The list of indications ranges from cancer prevention to long-term treatment of malignancies. One vial of NeyTumorin-Sol costs DM 122.34. The therapy for a patient with a T1-2N0M0 cancer costs about DM 16,500 and an advanced stage up to over DM 100,000. The inventor of the Cytoplasmatic Therapy is K.E. Theurer. About 40 years ago, he founded the Vitorgan-Pharmaceutical Company which produces and distributes NeyTumorin. It is claimed that "physiological repair aids" from the cytoplasm of healthy animal organs induce a "hygiogenization" of the disturbed metabolism and NeyTumorin has immunogenic and immuno-modulatory effects which are important for the efficacy. The promotors classify NeyTumorin as a biological response modifier. The components of NeyTumorin are not defined. Preclinical investigations showing direct cytostatic and immunomodulatory effects are not sufficiently documented. Often extremely high concentrations of NeyTumorin were used. Clinical studies including prospective randomized trials are not conclusive because of false or insufficient documentation. There is no proof for either the claimed mechanism of action nor for a clinical efficacy.
