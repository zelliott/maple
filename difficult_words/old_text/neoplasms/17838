Anemia has an incidence both on the quality of life and the evolution of cancer. Anemia may result in cancer from either a bone marrow infiltration of cancer cells or a cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, or both. EPO is a glycoprotein which stimulates erythrocyte formation by bone marrow progenitory cells. Recombinant EPO has considerably improved treatment of anemic patients, by increasing hemoglobin serum levels and reducing the need for blood transfusion. The quality of life of cancer patients is thus improved and several studies highlight the beneficial role of EPO on the clinical outcome. A preclinical background and some clinical data suggest however a detrimental role of EPO in cancer by a possible stimulation of tumor growth. There is a need of more clinical trials in order to assess the effects of EPO on tumors and their treatment.
