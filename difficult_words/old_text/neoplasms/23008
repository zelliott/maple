Twenty-three patients with advanced solid tumors received 9-hydroxy-2N-methyl-ellipticinium acetate at a single daily i.v. dose of 15-80 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 3 weeks. One partial and one minor response were achieved in two patients with breast cancer. Dryness of the mouth was dose-related and dose-limiting. Local phlebitis was also dose-related and frequently severe at the highest dose levels. Other non-hematologic toxic effects were essentially mild to moderate and included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, fever, weakness, transient renal and hepatic impairment, alopecia and chest pain. Minimal myelosuppression was encountered. It appears that 60 mg/m2/day is the maximum tolerated dose with a five-day schedule. According to our findings, this schedule does not seem to offer any advantage over the previously tested weekly administrations.
