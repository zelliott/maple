Hemagglutinins with different specificity were determined in 270 subjects: of these, 101 were examined in the time course before and after immunization with Proteus vaccine prepared from soluble antigens. The preparation possessed pronounced immunological potency and stimulated the formation of antibodies to the vaccine strain, to heterologous Proteus strains and to the common antigens of Gram-negative bacteria. The combined scheme of the subcutaneous and local administration of the above-mentioned Proteus vaccine ensured an increase in the synthesis of IgM and IgA in patients with Proteus wound infection. Active immunization ensured an essential rise in the level of hemagglutinins to Re-glycolipid in donors and oncological patients not infected with Proteus, but did not ensure the statistically significant shifts in the antibody level to Re-glycolipids in patients with chronic Proteus infection.
