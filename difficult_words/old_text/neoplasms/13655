Older individuals are at risk for adverse events in all settings where cancer is treated. Common geriatric syndromes can complicate cancer therapy, and thus, increase patient morbidity and the costs of care. Furthermore, cancer treatment can worsen geriatric syndromes. It is often difficult to determine whether declining health is a result of cancer treatment or the patient's underlying disease. Baseline assessment of multiple factors may facilitate detection of a decline in the patient's health status, which may be remediable. Geriatric syndromes may substantially affect quality of life and are also important in the prognosis and outcome of cancer therapy. This article reviews the assessment of cognitive syndromes (dementia and delirium), vision and hearing impairment, gait and balance difficulties, malnutrition, incontinence, depression, osteoporosis, sleep disorders, environmental and social issues, and functional decline. Although there are many geriatric domains and many focused assessment tools, assessment does not need to be time-consuming. Streamlined assessment tools have been developed; they are brief, inexpensive, and easily administered, and they may be valuable to the oncologist. Staff such as nurses, social workers, or office personnel could perform these assessments and minimize the impact on the physician's time.
