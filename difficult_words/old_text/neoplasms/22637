Negative-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods utilizing magnetic susceptibility contrast agents have become one of the most widely used approaches in cellular imaging research. However, visualizing and tracking super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPIO)-labeled cells on the basis of negative-contrast can limit specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, there has been a strong motivation to explore MRI methods for cellular imaging with either positive or dual contrast (both positive and negative) for identifying labeled cells; these methods offer the potential to improve significantly the sensitivity and specificity of MRI-based cell-tracking approaches. In this review, current state-of-the-art positive- and dual-contrast MRI techniques and contrast agents are described specifically for applications involving in vivo cellular tracking and imaging.
