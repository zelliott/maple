A wide number of genetic and epigenetic changes are required to drive normal cells towards malignancy. These changes participate in oncogenic intracellular pathways that allow tumor cells proliferation and dissemination. Hanahan and Weinberg' in their seminal paper "The hallmarks of cancer" described the classic cell hallmarks acquired in cancer development and progression: self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, evading apoptosis, limitless replication potential, sustained angiogenesis, tissue invasion and metastasis. This review covers other recently described biological characteristics associated with the emergence of cancer. Some of the main non-classical hallmarks of cancer that are broadly accepted include: genetic instability, evasion of cell senescence, epigenetic alterations of cancer related-genes, RNA interference alterations in the expression of cancer related-genes, changes in glucose and glutamine metabolism, participation of cancer stem cells in cellular proliferation, stromal cell participation in the tumor's micro-environment, and changes in antigenic presentation and immunosuppression due to cytokines in the tumor's micro-environment. The identification of molecular biomarkers of classical and non classical tumor processes in a specific tumor will allow a better understanding of its pathophysiology. It will also permit the design of ad-hoc therapeutic strategies.
