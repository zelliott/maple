The use of computed tomography (CT) is growing, and, consequently, the associated radiation dose to patients is increasing as well. There is also increasing evidence linking the radiation dose within the range of diagnostic CT with a significantly increased risk of malignancy. These two factors combine to make radiation dose from diagnostic CT a public health concern. In order to practise to the best of our abilities and avoid harming patients, the radiation dose from CT must be minimized. Administrators, technologists, radiologists and other physicians are encouraged to work toward this goal through the use of education and a multi-faceted team approach. The objective of this paper is to educate healthcare professionals about the radiation dose from diagnostic CT, including utilization rates, typical examination doses and the risks of this radiation. Our experience in Saskatchewan is discussed. Suggestions regarding CT dose management and optimization are highlighted.
