Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), the sustained-duration form of filgrastim (recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]), is created by the addition of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety to filgrastim. Its approved indication in the US is to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.A single subcutaneous injection of pegfilgrastim once per chemotherapy cycle was more effective than placebo as an adjunct to moderately myelosuppressive chemotherapy for breast cancer, no less effective than daily injections of filgrastim as an adjunct to highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy for breast cancer, and as effective as daily filgrastim as an adjunct to chemotherapy for lymphoma (predominantly non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL]) and acute myeloid leukemia. Pegfilgrastim has also successfully supported delivery of dose-dense chemotherapy, stem cell mobilization, and stem cell transplantation after high-dose chemotherapy in patients with non-myeloid or myeloid malignancies. By offering a convenient alternative to daily filgrastim, once-per-cycle administration of pegfilgrastim has the potential to simplify the management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, further improve patient health-related quality of life, and reduce total treatment costs in breast cancer and NHL, and possibly other cancer settings. Pegfilgrastim should, likewise, permit simplification of G-CSF-based stem cell mobilization and transplantation procedures.
