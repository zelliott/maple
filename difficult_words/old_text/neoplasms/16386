This review highlights the cutaneous side effects associated with the administration of chemotherapy and discusses the management of these conditions. Rapidly growing cells are the targets of chemotherapy, so the skin, hair follicles, and nail matrix are frequently affected by chemotherapy. Chemotherapy skin reactions are more likely toxic than allergic reactions. The most common cutaneous reactions are alopecia, hyperpigmentation, hand--foot syndrome, radiation recall, hypersensitivity, extravasation injuries, and nail dystrophies. While these side effects are generally not life threatening, they can be a source of significant distress to patients, especially alopecia.
