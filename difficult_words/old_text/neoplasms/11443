The National Cancer Survivors Day Foundation defines a cancer "survivor" as anyone living with a history of cancer--from the moment of diagnosis through the remainder of life. Little is known about the size and make-up of this population or about the medical care experience of and social implications for patients who have had a diagnosis of cancer in Singapore. An opportunistic survey was undertaken to understand how members of the public believe about this population.

A sample of the general public was undertaken during the "CancerVive" event in 2004. Questionnaires regarding employment as well as attitudes towards cancer and cancer survivorship were distributed.

Members of the public held certain misconceptions about cancer survivors. They also have certain negative attitudes toward cancer survivors. Beliefs and attitudes about cancer are similar for cancer survivors and the general public. Although members of the public had positive attitudes towards working with cancer survivors, the majority felt that cancer survivors should not be given equal opportunities at work, by not employing cancer survivors if they were in the position to hire.

Further research with larger and more representative samples needs to be undertaken to extend the understanding into cancer survivorship issues.
