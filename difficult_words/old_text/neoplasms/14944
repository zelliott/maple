As the number of childhood cancer survivors continues to increase, the problems of late effects following treatment have become a serious issue. At present, the length of follow-up for late effects of treatment largely depends on the individual treating physicians, and no follow-up teams are organized in most of Japan. Childhood cancer survivors may not only have physical handicaps but also experience psychological and social problems. The establishment of a follow-up system is a serious need in Japan and should involve physicians, other medical professionals, social workers, and cancer survivors themselves. Physicians should always consider whether the recommended treatment or surgery will yield the best results from the viewpoint of probable late effects.
