Treatment of infectious complications with ciprofloxacin in 65 patients provided good and satisfactory results in 67.7 and 20.0 per cent of the cases, respectively. The drug was efficient in sepsis, urogenital infections, respiratory infections and postoperative purulent complications. Ciprofloxacin showed a broad antibacterial spectrum. 96.3 per cent of the isolates belonging to aerobic organisms causing purulent inflammatory processes, including those with high antibiotic resistance levels, such as Pseudomonas spp., Proteus spp., Klebsiella tribe and Staphylococcus aureus were sensitive to the drug. In its antibacterial spectrum ciprofloxacin was similar to ofloxacin. The advantage of ciprofloxacin is its possible use not only orally but also intravenously. Adverse reactions to ciprofloxacin were observed in 5 (7.7 per cent) out of the 65 patients. In two cases discontinuation of the drug use was required. The use of ciprofloxacin in treatment of infectious complications in oncological patients is promising.
