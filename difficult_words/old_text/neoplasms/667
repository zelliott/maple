Mechanical complications in tunneled indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs) often involve a risk of displacement. Fixation procedures are, therefore, of primary importance. We prospectively evaluated the incidence of CVC-related mechanical and infectious complications observed in devices fixated with the Sri Paran technique.

All CVCs inserted in children with cancer at our Institution from October 2005 to January 2007 were prospectively monitored for device-related mechanical and infectious complications. The Sri Paran fixation technique was used in all cases. The complication rate per 1,000 days was calculated as 1,000 times the number of complications divided by the total number of catheter days.

Ninety-five CVCs were positioned in 84 children. The overall length of observation ranged between 41 and 482 days for a total of 18,618 catheter days. Mechanical complications occurred in 5% of the devices (specific rate 0.27); infections were observed in 6% of the devices (specific rate 0.32). No complications were observed during the first 30 days after CVC insertion.

The results, we obtained with the Sri Paran technique are extremely encouraging. Yet, randomized studies are required to prove these preliminary data.
