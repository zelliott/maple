Little progress has been made with regard to the survival of children with metastatic and refractory solid tumors. Preliminary data from haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) suggested a clinically beneficial allograft-vs-tumor effect associated with natural killer cell (NK) donor-recipient mismatch. We hypothesized that interaction between activatory receptors on NK cells and their ligands on tumor cells could be also important. To evaluate the NK-cell-mediated allograft-vs-tumor effect, we conducted a pilot study of haplo-SCT on six children with refractory solid tumors. Our specific goal for this study was NKG2D-major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A interaction. Tasks include specific immunoassays that support haplo-SCT in refractory solid tumors. Patients suffered from neuroblastoma (n = 1), Ewing sarcoma (n = 2), a desmoplastic tumor (n = 1), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (n = 1), and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1). Pretransplantation disease status showed progressive disease in 2 patients, partial remission in 2 patients, and complete remission in 2 patients. NK-cell mismatch was present in three donor-recipients. Ligands for NKG2D receptors, major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A and UL16 binding protein 2 were overexpressed in six of six and four of six tumors, respectively. NK cells led early immune reconstitution. After haplo-SCT, three patients were in complete remission, one patient showed partial remission, and two patients were in stable disease. With a median follow-up of 14 months, three patients were alive and in complete remission, and three patients had died; two due to progressive disease and one of transplant-related toxicity. Blocking NKG2D-major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A interaction in vitro reduced NK-cell cytotoxicity. Our preliminary results suggest a beneficial effect from haplo-SCT in refractory solid tumors.
