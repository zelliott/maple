This guideline provides clinicians with evidence-based recommendations on the use of antifungal prophylaxis in children with cancer and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Recommendations are divided into: (1) allogeneic HSCT (2) autologous HSCT (3) acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and (4) patients with malignancy and neutropenia for &gt;7 days. A systematic review was conducted and evidence summaries compiled. The quality of evidence and strength of each recommendation was determined using GRADE. Implementation of these recommendations will require adaptation to local context. The contribution of this guideline in the prevention of invasive fungal infections requires prospective evaluation.
