There is a growing consensus that psychosocial care should be integrated into the routine care of patients with cancer. This consensus is consistent with the considerable body of evidence about the deleterious effects of allowing psychosocial needs to remain unmet and the growing body of evidence about the beneficial effects of providing psychosocial services to address unmet needs. Despite this evidence, available data suggest that a considerable portion of the population of patients with cancer does not receive needed psychosocial care. Three lines of professional activity initiated in recent years have the potential to address this issue in fundamental ways: the formulation of standards of cancer care that address the psychosocial component of care, the issuance of clinical practice guidelines for psychosocial care of patients with cancer, and the development and implementation of measurable indicators of the quality of psychosocial care in oncology settings. This article provides an overview of accomplishments in each of these areas; it is designed to ensure that oncologists and other cancer treatment providers are knowledgeable about current standards for psychosocial care, existing consensus- and evidenced-based recommendations for clinical practice in this area, and resources and tools for evaluating and, if indicated, improving the quality of the psychosocial care their patients are receiving. The article concludes with a critical appraisal of these activities and a consideration of how current efforts might be enhanced.
