Whole blood catalase levels were estimated using a disc flotation method in 209 random patients with a wide variety of malignancies. Fifty patients had received no treatment, and the remainder, although having undergone prior therapy, had recurrent or metastatic disease at the time of the study. No relationship was found between the presence of cancer and catalase levels. A direct relationship was found for catalase with hemoglobin levels in both normal and patients' samples. Whole blood catalase is of no value in diagnosis and monitoring of cancer. The decreased catalase values found here and reported previously by others are the result of low hemoglobin levels found in many patients with cancer.
