The purpose of this study was to determine reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching (INVR) and the Index of Nausea and Vomiting Form 2 (INV-2) to provide a reliable and valid measure of nausea, vomiting, and retching for Chinese nurses and other healthcare providers. An integrative translation method was used in the study. The reliability and validity of the Chinese versions of the INVR and the INV-2 was evaluated using test-retest, parallel forms, and crossover design. A convenience sample of 177 Chinese-speaking participants was accrued from a large teaching cancer institute and a teaching obstetric hospital in Beijing, Peoples Republic of China. The integrative translation method was proven to be an effective method for translating instruments from the source to the target language. The Chinese versions of both the INV-2 and INVR were found to have high Cronbach's alpha scores and high agreement rates. The responses to the Chinese version of INVR were more frequently consistent than the responses to the INV-2. The majority of the patients voiced preference for the INVR. The findings suggest the significance of the Chinese versions of INVR and INV-2 in terms of nursing practice. The findings also support the cross-cultural method for future study at international level.
