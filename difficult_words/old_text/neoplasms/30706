To assess the long-term effects of cancer treatment and consequences of cure, 102 index cancer cases were compared with 95 neighbourhood controls of similar age and sex and with 78 cardiac controls. The quality of life experienced by these three groups was examined using multiple instruments with proven psychometric properties. All the major quality of life domains (physical, psychological and social) were covered. The findings revealed that the index cases were similar to their neighbours in areas of subjective well-being. However, the index cases exhibited more sexual dysfunction, were more conscientious, determined and emotionally disciplined, and applied the defence mechanisms of displacement and reaction formation more often than the neighbourhood controls. The cardiac controls were older, more anxious, more conventional/less imaginative and used suppression as a defence mechanism to a greater degree than the index cases. In conclusion, young adult cancer survivors enjoy a quality of life similar to their neighbours, whereas coronary bypass survivors adjust less well psychosocially.
