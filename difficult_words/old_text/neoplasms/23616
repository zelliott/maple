Over the last decade, the number of childhood cancer survivors has increased and late effects of therapy on organ function, growth, and development have become evident. Specific healthcare and psychosocial needs of survivors are now being addressed by multidisciplinary pediatric oncology teams. These survivors may eventually transfer their healthcare to an adult practitioner who may lack current information regarding survivorship issues and who may not use a multidisciplinary approach. Transition models developed for adolescents with chronic illness address some issues, but are not entirely applicable to the experience of those cured of cancer. The importance of lifetime annual follow-up must be communicated to young adult survivors and their new practitioners. A pamphlet was developed, as part of a comprehensive program, to facilitate transition by providing an overview of the concept of survivorship, general follow-up recommendations, and resources available to assist clients and their healthcare providers.
