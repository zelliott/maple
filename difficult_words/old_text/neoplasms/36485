We have studied the requirements that have to be met to combine effective cancer chemotherapy with the mobilisation of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). We have shown that there is a differential induction of high numbers of PBSC following standard-dose chemotherapy (VIP) plus treatment with colony-stimulating factors. The combined sequential administration of interleukin 3 (IL-3) plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induced maximal numbers of PBSC, including colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte/macrophage, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM) and colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-Meg), compared with the application of GM-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or chemotherapy alone. The number of CD34+ cells was highly variable depending on the prior treatment given to the patients. Mobilised CD34+ cells--depending on the cytokines used for recruitment--had a varying cloning efficiency, and were heterogeneous as to their level of commitment. Retransfusion of G-CSF-primed progenitor cells to pilot patients following high-dose chemotherapy demonstrated that PBSC recruited by standard-dose chemotherapy plus G-CSF accelerated both neutrophil and platelet recovery.
