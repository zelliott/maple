The ascitic fluid ferritin concentrations were compared with serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG), in their diagnostic ability for detection of malignancy in 60 patients with ascites: 29 with chronic liver disease alone (CLD) and 31 patients with various neoplasms. Of the patients with malignancy, 12 had liver metastases, 9 had no evidence of liver involvement, and 10 had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with or without coexisting liver cirrhosis. Analysis of our data confirms that the ascitic ferritin is a more accurate indicator of malignant ascites (MA) than the SAAG. This new parameter is particularly helpful in distinguishing MA associated with HCC and/or metastatic liver disease from nonmalignant ascites due to CLD alone.
