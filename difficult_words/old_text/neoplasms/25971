This paper reports the results of a qualitative study to evaluate palliative care nurses' knowledge and experiences of providing culturally responsive palliative care within the cost constraints of a work-classification system. Multiple, in-depth interviews were conducted with 50 patients, their families, and health care providers. The study also employed observation techniques and documentary review of patient records. The study concludes that workload-classification measurement initiatives, while useful as a means of budgetary control, are often separate from and unrelated to the interests of cultural groups in palliative care populations.
