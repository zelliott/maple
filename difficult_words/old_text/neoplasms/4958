Endothelial cells from human umbilical veins were first cultured nearly four decades ago, initiating explosive growth in research in vascular biology and leading to major insights into angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and tumor biology. Recent studies now promise to open new horizons in regenerative medicine as well as organ engineering.
