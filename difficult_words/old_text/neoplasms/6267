Wig-1 is a transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor and encodes an mRNA stability-regulating protein. We show here that Wig-1 knockdown causes a dramatic inhibition of N-Myc expression and triggers differentiation in neuroblastoma cells carrying amplified N-Myc. Transient Wig-1 knockdown significantly delays development of N-Myc-driven tumors in mice. We also show that N-Myc expression is induced upon moderate p53-activating stress, suggesting a role of the p53-Wig-1-N-Myc axis in promoting cell cycle re-entry upon p53-induced cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. Moreover, our findings raise possibilities for the improved treatment of poor prognosis neuroblastomas that carry amplified N-Myc.
