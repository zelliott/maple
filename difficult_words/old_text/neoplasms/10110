Study examined content of personal goals, health-related hindrance (HRH; i.e., impact of health on goals), and relationship of HRH to health status and psychological well-being in young adults with cystic fibrosis (CF; n = 48), who survived childhood cancer (n = 57), and without history of chronic illness (n = 105).

Participants completed measures of life events, quality of life, psychological well-being, and goals.

No group differences were found on goal content. HRH significantly related to subjective well-being and distress after controlling for demographics, negative life events, physical health-related quality of life, disease status, and self-efficacy. HRH related to health status variables. Cancer survivors without cancer late effects had significantly less HRH than the other groups.

Health status may affect pursuit of personal goals and relate to well-being of young adults. The assessment of HRH has potential clinical utility for targeting interventions and warrants further research.
