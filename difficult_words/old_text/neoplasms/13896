When analyzing cancer clinical trial data where the treatment allocation is done using dynamic balancing methods such as the minimization method for balancing the distribution of important prognostic factors in each arm, conservativeness occurs if such a randomization scheme is ignored and a simple unstratified analysis is carried out. In this paper, the above conservativeness is demonstrated by computer simulation, and the development of a computer program that carries out permutation tests of the log-rank statistics for clinical trial data where the allocation is done by the minimization method or a stratified permuted block design is introduced. We are planning to use this program in practice to supplement a usual stratified analysis and model-based methods such as the Cox regression. The most serious problem in cancer clinical trials in Japan is how to carry out the quality control or data management in trials that are initiated and conducted by researchers without support from pharmaceutical companies. In the final section of this paper, one international collaborative work for developing international guidelines on data management in clinical trials of bladder cancer is briefly introduced, and the differences between the system adopted in US/European statistical centers and the Japanese system is described.
