Urine from 22 patients with a variety of disseminated cancers and from an equivalent number of nonmalignant controls of similar age and sex was tested for the presence of transforming growth factor (TGF) activity as measured by the ability to promote the growth in soft agar of nontransformed indicator cells. Cancer patients included those with carcinomas of the lung, breast, colon, and ovary, as well as melanomas and sarcomas. The nonmalignant controls included both normals and individuals with a variety of inflammatory and infectious disorders. Aliquots of unfrozen urine were acid extracted, chromatographed on a Bio-Gel P-30 column, and then tested for TGF activity using normal rat kidney fibroblasts and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-competing activity with human carcinoma A431 cells. These assays revealed that a high-molecular-weight TGF activity (Mr 30,000 to 35,000) which coelutes with EGF-competing activity was present in 18 of 22 cancer patients but present in only five of 22 nonmalignant controls (p less than 0.01). In contrast, a low-molecular-weight TGF activity (Mr 6000 to 8000) which does not coelute with EGF-competing activity was found in all urines tested. These results indicate that an EGF-related, high-molecular-weight TGF activity is found in the urine of cancer patients and may be a useful tumor marker. Unlike other tumor markers described previously, high-molecular-weight TGF activity has a biological activity which is related to the expression of the transformed phenotype.
