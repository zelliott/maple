Basic research contributions towards the molecular and cellular understanding of immune mediated control of cancer and infectious diseases have created opportunities to develop new forms of T-cell-based vaccination for cancer and chronic infections like HIV. In the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cell therapy clinical trials around the world aimed at enhancing antitumor immunity, restoring immune function to infectious diseases and augmenting vaccine efficacy.

To provide a review of new and emerging methods of T lymphocyte engineering, gene transfer to T cells and clinical trials.

A review of recent clinical trials, along with a brief historical perspective, with a focus on challenges and recent advances in the field and requirements for successful T-cell therapies.

Advances in the technological approaches and methods for ex vivo manipulation have led to T lymphocytes endowed with enhanced potency and unique functions, with promise as the new generation of infused therapeutics.
