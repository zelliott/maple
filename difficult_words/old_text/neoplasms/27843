This prospective and comparative study was designed to determine the role of cancer pain and attitudes towards morphine in attenuating the intensity and duration of physical dependence following chronic morphine treatment. Morphine was administered via a stepwise ladder approach in order of oral, spinal and intravenous routes depending on the adequacy of analgesia. On-demand titration of a dose, either upward or downward, was liberal and unlimited. Withdrawal strategy was evaluated and initiated either by patients (PI group) or their families (FI group). The manifestation of physical dependence on morphine was compared between patients who successfully withdrew (total withdrawal), and patients who failed to withdraw (episodic withdrawal), from morphine for a period of more than two weeks. Eighty-eight out of 627 patients (14.1%) were excluded from our protocol; 75% of these exclusions were due to objections toward morphine as the major form of analgesic. Drop-out due to poorly tolerated side effects was relatively rare (18.2%). Fifty-four (10.0%) achieved total withdrawal and 212 (39.3%) experienced episodic withdrawal. Non-pain-related abstinence symptoms were highly prevalent but were tolerable for both groups. Pain-related symptoms were more exaggerated during episodic withdrawal. Intolerable pain, rather than physical dependence, contributed to the failure to withdraw from morphine. Among a total of 539, addiction was found in only one patient (0.18%) who began drug use long before entering our protocol. Attitudes towards morphine affect the acceptance of treatment and hasten the withdrawal strategy. Families were more anxious about morphine than the patients themselves which led to more aggressive, but less tolerable, withdrawal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
