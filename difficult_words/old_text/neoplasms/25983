Vaccination of inbred mice with tumor-derived stress proteins hsp70, hsp90, and gp96/grp94 elicits a protective immunity to the tumor from which the vaccine was purified. There is now comprehensive experimental evidence that the antigenicity of tumor-derived hsp70, hsp90, and gp96 preparations results from diverse arrays of endogenous peptide antigens complexed with these stress proteins. Vaccination with tumor-derived stress protein/peptide complexes leads to their uptake and processing by professional antigen-presenting cells and to presentation of associated tumor peptide antigens to cytotoxic T cells. This induces a tumor-specific cytotoxic T cell response. The attractiveness of the concept of using tumor-derived stress proteins as vaccines is derived from two observations: (i) tumor stress protein vaccines mirror the individual antigenicity of a tumor, which results from random mutations due to genetic instability; and (ii) stress proteins represent powerful adjuvants for the peptide antigens complexed to them.
