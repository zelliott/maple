This study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of administering docetaxel (Taxotere; Rh√¥ne-Poulenc-Rorer) as a one-hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion on day 1 combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as a bolus i.v. injection for five (days 1-5) or three (days 1-3) consecutive days every four weeks.

Thirty-seven patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with 115 total courses involving seven dose levels of the two regimens of docetaxel and 5-FU (docetaxel/5-FU [mg/m2]/mg/m2/d]). In an effort to reduce fluid retention and hypersensitivity phenomena related to docetaxel, patients received premedication with dexamethasone 8 mg orally twice daily for three consecutive days beginning 24 hours before treatment.

Severe (grade 4) neutropenia lasting longer than seven days with or without fever and/or severe mucositis, precluded further dose escalation above docetaxel 60 mg/m2 on day 1 and 5-FU 300 mg/m2/day administered on days 1-5 every four weeks. The rates of these toxic effects were also unacceptably high above docetaxel 60 mg/m2 on day 1 and 5-FU 300 mg/m2/day administered on days 1-3 every four weeks. Nine patients experienced various manifestations of fluid-retention that were potentially related to study drugs. However, neither treatment delay nor discontinuation of treatment was required. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue, were mild to modest in severity and occurred infrequently (&lt; 10% of courses). Two patients with metastatic breast cancer experienced complete responses and a partial response occurred in a patient with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.

Based on the results of this study, the regimen of docetaxel 60 mg/m2 on day 1 followed by 5-FU 300 mg/m2/d i.v. for three or five days every four weeks is well tolerated and these doses are recommended for further evaluations. The feasibility of administering docetaxel 60 mg/m2 followed by 5-FU 300 mg/m2 for three or five days every four weeks and the preliminary antitumor activity noted indicate that further disease-directed studies of docetaxel and 5-FU are warranted in patients with relevant solid malignancies.
