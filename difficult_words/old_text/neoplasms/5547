Although two studies have potentially linked cancer in children of HIV-positive women to those who use AZT to prevent perinatal HIV transmission, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends that the current U.S. Public Health Service guidelines remain in effect. The studies found high (3 times higher than recommended) to very high (12 to 50 times higher than recommended) doses of AZT caused cancer in mice. A Blue Ribbon advisory panel for NIAID pointed out that there are major differences in how AZT is distributed and metabolized in humans compared to mice. The panel adds, however, that women should be informed about the findings to help them make informed decisions, and that all children exposed to antiretroviral therapy in utero undergo long-term medical follow-up. Advocates insist that until more definitive information is known, no long-term policies be implemented requiring HIV-infected pregnant women to take AZT. While AZT is the most extensively studied prevention for perinatal HIV transmission, preliminary studies using the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor drug nevirapine show promise.
