Survival in childhood cancer has improved, but the child's learning capability and psychosocial adjustment are affected by intense therapy, the side effects, and psychosocial issues. The resulting problems of school attendance and performance need to be addressed by pediatric oncology nurses. This article describes an education intervention program that is based on a treatment trajectory with interventions that occur from diagnosis through long-term survival and are directed toward the patient/parent, school personnel, and classmates. Both anecdotal and empirical evaluations of the program are being completed. This program provides pediatric oncology nurses with a model for program development and resource materials.
