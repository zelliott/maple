We developed a dextran-magnetite conjugated cisplatin (DM-Cis) complex for use in thermal ablation and as a chemotherapeutic drug. To produce DM-Cis we reacted Cis with 1 mL DM (56 mg/mL iron). The temperature rise of DM-Cis was measured in vitro and in vivo under a portable induction-heating (IH) device. Platinum desorption from DM-Cis over 24 hours was measured in bovine serum. In in vivo accumulation and magnet and exothermic experiments we used four rat groups. In group 1 we delivered DM-Cis intraperitoneally (ip) and placed magnets subcutaneously (sc). In group 2 we injected saline (ip) and placed magnets (sc). In group 3 we injected DM-Cis (ip) and placed a sc incision (sham). The control (group 4) received an ip injection of saline. Rectus abdominis muscle tissue was stained with hematoxylin-eosin and iron-stained tissue areas (μm(2)) were calculated. The maximum platinum concentration in DM-Cis was approximately 105.6 μg/mL. Over 24 hours, 33.48% of platinum from DM-Cis was released. There was a significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) in the iron-stained area between group 1 and the other groups. The temperature in muscle tissue registered a maximum of 56°C after about 4 min. DM-Cis may represent a magnetically-accumulated anticancer drug with hyperthermic effects.
