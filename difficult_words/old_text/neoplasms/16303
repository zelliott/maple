The members of the nuclear receptor superfamily are known to mediate a wide array of basic biological processes, such as regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and induction of apoptosis. In several human malignancies, this central control function of nuclear receptors is disturbed, which seems to play an important role in tumor development and progression. Many nuclear receptor genes have been reported to be downregulated in malignancies; however, only a few mutations, gene arrangements, deletions or similar genetic changes have been shown to occur in these tumors. During the last decade, increasing attention has been directed towards epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation such as DNA methylation. Many nuclear receptor genes can be silenced through aberrant methylation in tumors; epigenetic silencing, therefore, represents an additional mechanism that modifies expression of key genes during carcinogenesis. This review will give insights into the role of DNA methylation in the silencing of nuclear receptor genes and its involvement in human malignancies.
