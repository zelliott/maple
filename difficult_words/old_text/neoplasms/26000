This study looked for a relationship between immunity and one's spirits while investigating the effect musical therapy produces on Immunoglobulina A (IgA) found in saliva and a Patient's Opinion on the Likert Scale (OPEL). There were 30 children as patients, 15 in a control group and 15 in an experimental group. They were 5 or 16 years of age and checked into the Sant Joan de Deu Hospital in Barcelona due to neoplastic illness.
