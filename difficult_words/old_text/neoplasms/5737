The taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel, are the two presents clinically available representatives of a cytotoxic class with a new mechanism of action: they enhance microtubule assembly and inhibit their depolymerization. Their activity has been demonstrated in ovarian, breast and lung cancers. Paclitaxel and docetaxel are also promising agents in the treatment of head and neck, gastric and pancreatic cancer. Neutropenia is the dose limiting toxicity. Currently, use of premedication allows to circumvent hypersensitivity reactions encountered earlier with paclitaxel. For docetaxel, measures to prevent fluid retention are essential.
