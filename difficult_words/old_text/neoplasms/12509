ZD6474 is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2/KDR) tyrosine kinase, with additional activity against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. ZD6474 inhibits angiogenesis and growth of a wide range of tumor models in vivo. Gefitinib ("Iressa") is a selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal transduction pathways implicated in cancer cell proliferation. Here, the ability of gefitinib and ZD6474 to inhibit tumor cell proliferation was examined directly in eight cancer cell lines in vitro, and a strong correlation was noted between the IC(50) values of gefitinib and ZD6474 (r = 0.79). No correlation was observed between the sensitivity to ZD6474 and the level of EGFR or VEGFR expression. The NSCLC cell line PC-9 was seen to be hypersensitive to gefitinib and ZD6474, and a small (15-bp) in-frame deletion of an ATP-binding site (exon 19) in the EGFR was detected (delE746-A750-type deletion). To clarify the involvement of the deletional mutation of EGFR in the cellular sensitivity to ZD6474, we examined the effect of this agent on HEK293 stable transfectants expressing deletional EGFR that designed as the same deletion site observed in PC-9 cells (293-pDelta15). These cells exhibited a 60-fold higher sensitivity to ZD6474 compared with transfectants expressing wild-type EGFR. ZD6474 inhibited the phosphorylation of the mutant EGFR by 10-fold compared with cells with wild-type EGFR. In conclusion, the findings suggested that a small in-frame deletion in the EGFR increased the cellular sensitivity to ZD6474.
