"Second-look" operations were performed in 32 infants and children with initially unresectable or recurrent solid tumors treated with combination chemotherapy and/or irradiation. Tumors were resectable in 26 of 32 cases (81%). These procedures often yielded information affecting staging and treatment. Disease-free survival was achieved in 18 of 32 patients (56%). Mortality was related to progressive disease in seven cases and opportunistic infections due to immunosuppression in three. Four additional patients are alive with evidence of persistent tumor. Second-look procedures were beneficial in patients with Wilms' tumor previously operated upon by a flank approach and in children with bilateral tumors. These procedures were particularly useful in children with stage III localized neuroblastoma and cases of metastatic neuroblastoma that respond to chemotherapy. Second-look operations were also useful in selected cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, teratoma, and Ewing's sarcoma. These observations suggest that combination chemotherapy has increased the use of second-look operations in a variety of less favorable (e.g. initially unresectable or recurrent) pediatric solid tumors.
