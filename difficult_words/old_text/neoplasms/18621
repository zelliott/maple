Air-pollution studies in the area where the traffic officers of the road-patrol service of the State Inspectorate for Road Traffic Safety, who patrol road traffic safety, breathe at the stationary militia inspection stations (MIS) and in the areas of the heaviest motor traffic highways of a city ascertained the cancer risk from exposure to carcinogenic agents, such as benzo(a)pyrene, benzene, and formaldehyde. The mean concentrations of these substances do not exceed the hygienic limits. In terms of the hazard index (1.04) and the individual's cancer risk index (4.8 x 10(-5)), the cancer risk for the traffic officers of MIS may be considered acceptable. Both indices (1.28 and 1.3 x 10(-4), respectively) for traffic officers and traffic controllers are suggestive of an increased cancer risk, which constitutes a potential threat to a rise in cancer morbidity in this occupational group and needs preventive measures to be undertaken.
