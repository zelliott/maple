Histone deacetylase inhibitors are presently used in the routine clinic treatment against cancers. Recent data have established that some of these treatments have potent anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory effects at noncytotoxic doses that might be of benefit in immuno-inflammatory disorders or post-transplantation. At least some of these effects result from the ability of histone deacetylase inhibitors to modulate the immune system. Dendritic cells are professional antigen presenting cells that play a major role in this immune system. Data summarized in this review brings some novel information on the impact of histone deacetylase inhibitors on dendritic cell functions, which may have broader implications for immunotherapeutic strategies.
