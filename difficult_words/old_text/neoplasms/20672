Cancer initiation is classically associated with the induction of mutations on specific oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, due to the presence of unrepaired DNA lesions produced by endogenous or exogenous genotoxic agents. Among several DNA repair pathways, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the most important and versatile one in removing the bulky adducts induced by physical and chemical carcinogens. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), characterized by a deficiency in NER and an over 1000-fold increased risk of skin cancer, represents a paradigm to understand the role of unrepaired lesion in the development of cancer. We reviewed here several NER assays used in epidemiological studies investigating the association between DNA repair efficiency and cancer risk. Reduced DNA repair could contribute to the development of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC), although discordant results have been reported. More consistent findings were observed between cellular sensitivity towards genotoxic agents and smoking-related cancers.
