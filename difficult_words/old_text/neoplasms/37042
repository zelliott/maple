Oncogenic viruses have evolved direct and indirect mechanisms to overcome the tumour suppressor p53. Fortunately, tumour development is limited by the narrow cell tropisms of the viruses concerned and the host immune response. However, such viruses are helping to elucidate the p53 response pathway and may play a future role as novel cancer therapeutic agents.
