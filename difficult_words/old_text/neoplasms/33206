To examine the frequency and types of complementary and alternative medicine use in patients undergoing radiotherapy and to analyze the effects these therapies have on the toxicities of radiotherapy.

A total of 210 consecutive cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy were included. After radiation therapy, each patient completed a standard questionnaire, and the association between radiation toxicity and complementary and alternative medicine use was analyzed.

Among the study population, 44.3% of patients reported using at least one form of complementary and alternative medicine during radiotherapy. The most commonly chosen complementary and alternative medicine was stinging nettle. Complementary and alternative medicine use decreased lower gastrointestinal (F = 3.26, P = .009) and genitourinary toxicities (F = 2.38, P = .043), while it increased laryngeal toxicity (F = 2.63, P = .028). A significant correlation between the type of complementary and alternative medicine used and the degree of these toxicities was not demonstrated.

Use of complementary and alternative medicine among cancer patients during radiation therapy may affect the degree of radiation toxicity. Further randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the benefits and risks of complementary and alternative medicine use during radiation therapy.
