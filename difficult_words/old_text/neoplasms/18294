Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is mediated by the integrin family and has been known to modify radiation sensitivity and resistance in several cell types, including cancer cells. In particular, beta1 integrin signaling has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of various cancers and has been shown to facilitate resistance to radiation therapy.

In this mini-review, we provide a brief overview of integrin targeting in radiation therapy. We specifically focus on the updated findings of beta1 integrin-mediated signaling pathways after exposure to ionising radiation (IR) using in vitro and in vivo experimental models, which could represent promising therapeutic targets for breast cancer.
