The original theory in the 1920s on the mode of action of Laetrile is described along with the research that followed in light of this theory. For over 40 years, studies were conducted, using test animals, in an attempt to substantiate the theory. All of these studies have shown Laetrile does not preferentially kill cancer cells. In spite of these studies, the misconception persists that Laetrile prevents and cures cancer. The legal and socioeconomic implications of Laetrile are examined and the role of health education in combating this problem is explored.
