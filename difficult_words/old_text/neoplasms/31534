To assess clinical usefulness of an intermittent-flow blood cell separator in peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection and transplantation.

The Haemonetics Multi Component System (Multi) was used to collect PBSC (52 aphereses in 17 patients). The mean processing blood volume and the mean PBSC yield were 7407 ml and 2.16 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg, respectively. When CD34+ cells exceeded 0.3% of the peripheral WBC, more than 2.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg could be collected by a single apheresis. Eight patients underwent PBSC transplantation after high-dose chemotherapy. Hematopoietic recovery was achieved in a median period of 10 days.

(1) A single-arm, light-weight machine has sufficient capability to collect PBSC. (2) The percentage of CD34+ cells in the peripheral WBC is a good predictor of the CD34+ cell yield of the collection.
