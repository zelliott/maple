The clinical potential of radiolabeled peptides such as octreotide and VIP has been widely established for tumor localization. Radiotherapy based on the tumor binding potential of the peptides and the radiotoxic effects of beta- or a-emitting radionuclides is an extension of such applications. Rhenium-188 (T1/2 16.9 hr, beta-max 2.1 MeV) coupled to the analogue RC-160 has been used to establish the feasibility of treating tumors with radiolabeled peptides, and our experience with this approach is summarized. In three different experimental tumor models (human prostate, mammary gland, and small cell lung carcinomas) in nude mice, treatment resulted in significant reduction or elimination of tumor burden. Two routes of administration were used: intra-lesional injection (prostate carcinoma) and intra-cavity injection (mammary and SCLC). Re-188-labeled negative control peptides bound to tumor cells to a low extent and did not exhibit therapeutic benefit. RC-160 by itself did not result in therapeutic benefit. Tumors which did not bind Re-188-RC-160 did not evidence a therapeutic benefit. Uncoupled Re-188 (control) was rapidly excreted via the urinary bladder and did not accumulate in either tumors or normal tissues even following direct injection. Instant radiolabeling kits containing 200 micrograms of RC-160 were labeled with &lt; 3000 MBq of Re-188 in 30 minutes with no need for subsequent purification. These studies establish the conceptual feasibility of targeted radiotherapy based on the local or regional administration of radiolabeled peptides.
