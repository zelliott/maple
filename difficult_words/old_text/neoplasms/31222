A model is presented in this paper to describe how the contrast of a reconstructed object and slice sensitivity profile are affected by (1) the table speed or helical pitch, (2) the x-ray collimations, (3) the size of the object, (4) the alignment between the reconstructed slice and the object, (5) the distance of the object from the axis of rotation, and (6) the helical CT reconstruction algorithm employed. This contrast model is validated by both computer simulations and experiments. With this model, the contrast of a reconstructed object, slice sensitivity profile, and the longitudinal MTF can be accurately predicted. The optimal scan strategy and the point of diminishing returns can be determined prior to scanning. Several conclusions can be drawn from this model. First, overlapping reconstruction significantly improves overall scan contrast sensitivity of helical CT. Second, with a given x-ray collimation, low pitch helical scans provide better longitudinal resolutions. Third, with a given volume coverage rate (i.e., a given table speed), narrow collimation high pitch helical scans provide better longitudinal resolutions than wide collimation low pitch ones and therefore are recommended for high-contrast thin-slice applications. A lesion conspicuity model is also established.
