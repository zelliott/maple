Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a member of the ATF/cyclic AMP response element-binding (ATF/CREB) family of transcription factors. It is an adaptive-response gene that participates in cellular processes to adapt to extra- and/or intracellular changes, where it transduces signals from various receptors to activate or repress gene expression. Advances made in understanding the immunobiology of Toll-like receptors have recently generated new momentum for the study of ATF3 in immunity. Moreover, the role of ATF3 in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis has important implications for understanding susceptibility to and progression of several cancers.
