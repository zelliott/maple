Statins can profoundly affect cellular metabolism by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for cholesterol synthesis. Many physicians prescribe statins to lower plasma cholesterol levels, which has beneficial effects in both the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. However, in vitro, in vivo, animal, and clinical studies have all shown that statins may also have important pleiotropic properties. In fact, a number of clinical studies have suggested that statins are involved in modulating diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis, and dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). However, because these studies have been only preliminary and observational in nature, large randomized, placebo-controlled studies are needed to confirm the modulatory role of statins in these important diseases.
