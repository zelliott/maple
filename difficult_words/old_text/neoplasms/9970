In randomized trials, the better therapy may depend on values of a prognostic factor. This article presents methodology for subdividing a target population into three subsets: one region of superiority of each treatment, and one region of uncertainty. The basis of such a subdivision is treatment by prognostic factor interaction. The importance of this analysis in group trial sequences is discussed briefly.
