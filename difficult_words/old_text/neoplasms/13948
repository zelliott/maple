This brief communication highlights some observations that have raised the possibility that the oligosaccharides of glycoproteins may have roles as ligands or recognition structures in cell growth regulation. The initial experience with a new technology designed for investigating roles of glycoprotein oligosaccharides as recognition structures is also discussed.
