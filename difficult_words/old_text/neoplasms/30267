A retrospective study assessing treatment-related toxicities in tumor-bearing cats treated with temozolomide (TMZ) alone or in combination with doxorubicin was conducted. TMZ was administered orally once a day for 5 days every 3 weeks at a dose of 20 mg/cat. Tumor response was evaluated with standard World Health Organization criteria and toxicity was monitored using veterinary co-operative oncology group-common terminology criteria for adverse events (VCOG--CTCAE) criteria. Ten tumor-bearing cats with various types of malignancies were treated with TMZ-based chemotherapy. Eight cats were evaluable for response. Two cats achieved a complete response, one achieved stable disease and five achieved a partial response. Four grade III and one grade IV hematological toxicities, and one grade IV gastrointestinal toxicity were observed. Four cats were euthanased as a result of apparent toxicity. One cat was euthanased as a result of severe and prolonged myelosuppression with fever. Three were euthanased for grade III pleural and pericardial effusions. Effusion was seen in cats treated with higher cumulative dose of TMZ (P = 0.0046). Planned additional case accrual was discontinued because of unacceptable levels of toxicity despite evidence of efficacy in some of the cats. Additional investigation is needed to elucidate this unexpected apparent cumulative toxicity.
