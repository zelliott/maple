The initial results of a Phase I evaluation of misonidazole in the U.S.A. are described, as well as the U.S. National Cancer Institute programme for radiosensitizer development. A total of 12 patients have been given 1--6 doses of 1--2 g/m2. Serum levels ranged from 25--87 microgram/ml at 4--6 h. One patient has developed mild peripheral neuropathy. Urinary excretion was chiefly of a demethylated metabolite as measured by HPLC assay.
