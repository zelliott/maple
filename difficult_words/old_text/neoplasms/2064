More than 40 oncogenes have been described and characterized. These oncogenes code for products intimately associated with cell proliferation. Their products include growth factors, growth factor receptors, transmembrane signaling molecules, second and third messengers, and nuclear proteins involved in gene regulation. Some oncogenes seem to be expressed in every malignancy, while others seem to be expressed only in certain malignancies. This expression pattern suggests some oncogenes may have tissue type specificity. Some oncogenes may also be expressed in only a fraction of the malignant cells, such as the proliferating cells. Flow cytometry has only recently been applied to the simultaneous measurement of oncoprotein levels and DNA content of malignant cells. As this application is developed, our understanding of oncogene expression in malignancy will be enhanced and its diagnostic importance will be realized.
