During the period from 1950 to 1983, 1633 patients with cervical carcinoma in situ (CIS) were treated at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Tokyo. These cases were retrospectively investigated to determine the relation between the epidemiologic features and social phenomena. The number of patients with CIS tends to increase year by year. The incidence of CIS tends to be larger in the younger age group. Delay in the age of primiparity, a lower incidence of multiparas and a higher incidence of artificial abortion were seen in the CIS patients. Recurrence was seen in 0.4% of the CIS patients, and the recurrence site was most frequently the vaginal stump.

1,633 cases of cervical carcinoma in situ treated at Cancer Institute Hospital in Tokyo from 1950 to 1983 were studied from epidemiologic points of view.  Carcinoma situ increased from 4% in 1950 to 41% of all the cervical cancer in 1980.  It was most common among 40-44 year olds in 1950's and among 35-39 year olds in 1980's.  Average age of the patients was 43.  Recent patients tended to have their 1st births later, to have fewer births and to have abortions.  31% had their 1st births at 25; 19.9%, at 23; 18.1%, at 27.  30.7% had 5 births in 1950 while only 4.5% had the same in 1980.  27.8% had one abortion; 22.2% had 2; 10.3% had 3.  Success rate of cytodiagnosis was 54% in 1950's and 88.6% in 1980's.  Moreover, 92% of those which tested negative in the tissue test proved to be positive in the cytodiagnosis.  10.3% had fathers with cancer; 11.9% had mothers with cancer.  Most common cancer among their fathers was stomach cancer and that among mothers was uterine cancer.  5.8% had mothers with cervical carcinoma in situ.  95.6% of 1633 cases studied had abdominal panhysterectomy and only 2.6% had radiation therapy.  Recurrence rate among those who had panhysterectomy was 0.4% and it mostly occurred in the surgical stump.
