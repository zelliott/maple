To tabulate data obtained over a 21-year period to determine the efficacy and safety of an intravenous (IV) allopurinol preparation.

IV allopurinol was provided on a compassionate plea basis to patients of any age in whom xanthine oxidase inhibitor therapy was indicated as an adjunct to chemotherapy and for whom oral intake was restricted. Three hundred twenty-seven investigators at multiple hospitals in the United States treated 1,172 patients with IV allopurinol. The vast majority of these patients had a malignancy and were in danger of developing tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and subsequent acute uric acid nephropathy (AUAN) and were unable to take oral allopurinol. Data referable to the time period of IV allopurinol administration were collected, collated, and analyzed retrospectively. There was no randomization.

In patients initiating treatment for an elevated serum uric acid (SUA), the SUA normalized or improved in 87% of adult patients and normalized or improved in 95% of pediatric patients. IV allopurinol, administered prophylactically to patients at high risk of developing hyperuricemia and TLS, prevented an increase in SUA levels in 93% of adults and 92% of children. Toxicities caused by IV allopurinol were minimal and consisted of 10 instances of mild to moderate skin or allergic reactions.

IV allopurinol is as efficacious and safe as oral allopurinol and will be of significant benefit to patients at risk of TLS and AUAN and unable to take oral medication.
