The human ROCO proteins are a family of four proteins characterized by a conserved supradomain: a Ras-like GTPase domain. This domain consists of ROC (Ras of complex proteins) occurring in tandem with a COR (C-terminal of ROC) domain. Together, these proteins are linked to various pathologies including cancer and PD (Parkinson's disease). Despite an increasing research focus on these proteins, their functions in general, and their specific roles in disease, are still unknown. In the case of MASL1 (malignant fibrous histiocytoma amplified sequences with leucine-rich tandem repeats 1), a predicted oncoprotein in MFHs (malignant fibrous histiocytomas), there is a particular lack of information available in the literature. The aim of the present review is therefore to summarize the existing information on MASL1 and also to compile data that could be linked to MASL1 and thus help our understanding of this neglected ROCO protein.
