A new aspirating and severing soft tissue biopsy needle that is small, disposable, relatively simple (3 components), and very thin-walled has been used percutaneously for many lesions of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, extremities, subcutaneous masses, and lytic spinal bodies. In the vase majority of instances, the tissue cores were sufficient for regular histologic cell block preparation. Among the 143 pulmonary biopsies, the diagnostic accuracy was 89 per cent. There were 16 cases of post-biopsy small pneumothorax, 6 cases of large pneumothorax, and 9 incidences of mild hemoptysis of no consequence. Of the 81 nonpulmonary biopsies, 71 (88 per cent) were diagnostically accurate; and there were no complications.
