This paper is a review of the biological effects of hyperthermia and of their mechanisms. A great interest has been stimulated for the treatment of the tumors by hyperthermia alone or associated to chemo and radiotherapy. The clinical application needs an accurate control of the temperature which raises difficult technical problems.
