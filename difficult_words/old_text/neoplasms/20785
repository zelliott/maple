Recent basic science research has greatly added to our knowledge of pain mechanisms. Application of this knowledge to cancer pain syndromes has led to new and innovative approaches to cancer pain management.

The mechanisms involved in the three main cancer pain syndromes (somatic, visceral, and neuropathic) are reviewed, and various therapeutic options are discussed.

Advances in knowledge in neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, and pharmacology have allowed a greater understanding of the peripheral and central mechanisms of pain. New drugs and interventional techniques based on this knowledge have improved the control of cancer pain.

Understanding the neurophysiology of cancer pain promotes use of the most appropriate palliative measures for pain control.
