From 1988 to 1998, we identified nine patients with Candida guilliermondii fungemia. Four of the five patients with nosocomial infection died, while all of the non-nosocomial cases survived, even though one half of them (2/4) did not receive any treatment Nosocomial C guilliermondii fungemia is often associated with poor outcome despite aggressive antifungal therapy.
