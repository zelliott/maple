Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed in primary care for anxiety disorders and insomnia. However, they can cause dependence with withdrawal symptoms that are both physical and psychological. These complications are also more common with short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam. This case report describes a previously stable 62-year-old male who inflicted serious stab wounds to himself, twice within a month, during changes in his benzodiazepine regime.
