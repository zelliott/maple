Because there can be no certainty of diagnosis without it, thoracotomy is indicated in cases in which there is roentgenographic evidence of mediastinal tumor. "Watchful waiting" is considered unwise because the tumor may be malignant when first observed or may later undergo malignant change. Even if the lesion is and remains benign, an increase in the size of the mass may cause obstructive pressures necessitating operation ultimately. Moreover, infection and inflammation may develop at the site during prolonged observation, making operation more difficult. The hazards of thoracotomy, which have been greatly reduced in the last few years, are less than the hazards of waiting.
