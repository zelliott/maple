A super-nanodevice engineered at molecular level integrates various desired properties in a smart and coordinated way, and can "switch on" or "turn off" certain functionalities as required. Importantly, it can break through complex physiological barriers, and then precisely ferry potent toxic triptolide into tumor cells in vivo, thus significantly maximizing the therapeutic efficacy and reducing the drug toxicity.
