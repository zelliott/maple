Cancer pain has traditionally been studied from a unidimensional/medical model. However, limitations of the medical model have led researchers to the development of multidimensional models of cancer pain. The current manuscript describes a multidimensional model of cancer pain with six components: physiological, sensory, affective, cognitive, behavioral and sociocultural. Research relevant to each component of the model is reviewed with an emphasis on future research directions.
