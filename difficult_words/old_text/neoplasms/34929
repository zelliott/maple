Fifty-one cases of congenital and neonatal malignant tumors were collected from the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles Department of Pathology files and reviewed. The study covered a 28-year period, 1958-1985. Thirty (59%) of the patients died. The types, incidence, clinical features, and behavior of neoplasms occurring in the neonate were different from those seen in older children and adolescents. Moreover, the response to therapy was also dissimilar. Leukemia and neuroblastoma were the most frequent malignancies and were responsible also for the largest number of deaths.
