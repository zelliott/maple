The technologies for providing better pain management for cancer patients are widely available, but barriers still exist that prevent their optimal use. One of the most important barriers is a knowledge deficit among primary care physicians in adequate pain assessment, in opioid pharmacology, and in the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to the management of pain.

The authors prepared a CD-ROM multimedia cancer pain management module to overcome the physician knowledge barrier.

Tests of the module with primary care physician and primary care resident volunteers indicate that the cancer pain management multimedia module meets its educational objectives.
