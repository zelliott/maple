We examined trends in caller queries on tobacco, mammography, Pap tests, and clinical trials to the NCI-sponsored Cancer Information Service (CIS) of Ohio via its toll free telephone number (1-800-4-CANCER) during 1986-1991. Calls on NCI-approved clinical trials and treatment protocols tripled during the study period (from 6% in 1986 to 20% in 1991, p &lt; 0.01) primarily due to counselor-initiated (proactive) recommendations and actions. Calls on breast cancer showed a significant increase whereas calls on respiratory system cancers showed a decline over the time period. There was also a dramatic increase in calls on mammography, reflecting the impact of national and local promotion of breast screening. Queries on tobacco use and Pap tests declined, perhaps due to a perceived saturation effect of public education on these two topics. Our results support the use of CIS as a technology transfer system.
