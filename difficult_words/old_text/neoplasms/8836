Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of cancer treatment in children; however, measurement of CIPN has been hampered by limitations in available tools, which may impact prevalence estimates. The purpose of this study was to assess the relative ability of the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) rating process to detect sensory and motor neuropathy as compared to administration of the pediatric modified Total Neuropathy Score (peds-mTNS).

The ped-mTNS was administered to 60 children/adolescents ages 5-18 undergoing treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma, or non-CNS solid tumors. CTCAE v3.0 scores for the same time point were abstracted from the medical record by a separate trained rater. Comparisons were made between scores using descriptive statistics, correlations, and specificity and sensitivity calculations.

The median ped-mTNS score was 9 (32 possible), while the median sensory and motor CTCAE ratings were 0 and 2, respectively (4 and 5 possible, respectively). There was no correlation between ped-mTNS and combined sensory and motor CTCAE scores. The only ped-mTNS item with significant correlation to CTCAE scoring was strength testing. Medical record abstraction of CTCAE scores failed to identify sensory neuropathy in 40 % and significant motor neuropathy (manual muscle test grade 3 or worse) in 15 % of subjects.

Prospective measures of CIPN using the ped-mTNS identified a far greater proportion of subjects with peripheral neurotoxicity as compared to CTCAE v3.0 sensory and motor neuropathy ratings, and thus we recommend the use of a specific measure of CIPN such as the ped-mTNS.
