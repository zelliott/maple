A balance between oxidant carcinogens and endogenous antioxidant defence is of particular relevance to the carcinogenesis. Ceruloplasmin (Cp) carries up to 90% of Cu in plasma and performs ferroxidase, antioxidant and amine oxidase activity. Cu and Zn, as trace elements, have been recognized to play an important role as cofactors of SOD. The study presents the relationship of the Cp oxidase activity and concentrations of Cu and Zn in serum of 62 patients with breast (BCA), lung (LCA), gastrointestinal (GICA) and gynecological (GYNCA) cancer. The Cp oxidase activity was determined in serum with o-dianisidine as a substrate. Cu and Zn concentrations in serum were measured by using atomic absorption spectrometry. The results of the study have shown significant increase in the mean serum Cp oxidase activity and total Cu concentrations in all patient groups compared with the control one. The total mean serum Zn concentration was found to be decreased only in LCA group as compared with the control. The effect of the cancer progress on the Cp oxidase activity and concentrations of Cu and Zn was observed within the group of all cancer patients (ALLCA) and within the GICA group. The only significant difference in Cu concentrations among various stages of the disease was observed in GICA between local and distant one. Significant positive correlation coefficients were caLculated for the Cp activity and Cu concentrations in the control group and all patients groups, also according to the cancer progress. Future research is needed to evaLuate the consequences of the elevation of the serum Cp oxidase activity and concentration of Cp, Cu and Zn for the host antioxidant-oxidant balance.
