To provide an overview of the methods and clinical applications of three dimensional (3D) medical imaging in the oncologic patient.

We briefly outline the techniques currently used to create 3D medical images with an emphasis on their strengths and shortcomings as they relate to oncologic imaging and radiation therapy planning. We then discuss some of the most important and promising oncologic applications of 3D imaging and suggest likely future directions in this rapidly developing field.

Since the first application of 3D techniques to medical data over a decade ago, 3D medical images have evolved from relatively crude representations of musculoskeletal abnormalities to detailed and accurate representations of a variety of soft tissue, vascular, and oncologic pathology. The rapid development of both computer hardware and software coupled with the application of 3D techniques to a variety of imaging modalities have expanded the clinical applications of this technology dramatically.

3D medical images are clinically practical tools for oncologic evaluation and effective radiation therapy planning.
