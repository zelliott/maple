A subset of survivors has cognitive impairment after cancer treatment. This is generally subtle, but may be sustained. In October 2006, the second international cognitive workshop was held in Venice. The workshop included neuropsychologists, clinical and experimental psychologists, medical oncologists, imaging experts, and patient advocates. The main developments since the first Cognitive Workshop in 2003 have been the following. (i) studies evaluating cognitive function in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancers other than breast cancer, and in patients receiving hormonal therapy for cancer. (ii) The publication of longitudinal prospective studies which have shown that some patients already exhibit cognitive impairment on neuropsychological testing before receiving chemotherapy, and some patients have deterioration in cognitive functioning from pre- to postchemotherapy. (iii) Studies of the underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairment both in patients and in animal models. (iv) Use of structural and functional imaging techniques to study changes in brain morphology and activation patterns associated with chemotherapy. (v) At present cognitive research in cancer is limited by methodological challenges and the lack of standardization in neuropsychological studies. The current workshop addressed many of these issues and established an international task force to provide guidelines for future research and information on how best to manage these symptoms.
