Until recently, febrile neutropenic patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics in inpatient settings. Because of work completed in the last several years by various investigators, identification of a low-risk group of febrile, neutropenic patients has allowed successful treatment with both parenteral and oral antibiotics in an ambulatory environment. This accomplishment has been facilitated by advances in broad-spectrum antibiotics with long half-lives and stabilities, the introduction of the quinolones providing oral antipseudomonal activity, home health care, improvements in vascular access devices, and technically enhanced antibiotic delivery systems. This review focuses on the rationale of risk stratification and the progress made in treating low-risk febrile neutropenic patients as outpatients.
