Targeting of immunological effector cells to tumor cells could be an efficient strategy of adoptive immunotherapy. The success of this strategy depends on the specificity of the effector cells and their availability in sufficient numbers. The aim of this study was to target the human natural killer cell line YT specifically to tumor cells. The cell line was modified by transfection with the cDNA of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). This C-type lectin recognizes carbohydrates containing terminal galactosyl (Gal) residues, including the beta1-Gal bearing Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen, which is found on tumor cells. Binding assays revealed that the ASGPR-gene-transfected YT cell line binds significantly higher to tested target tumor cell lines than the mock-transfected control cells. Cytolytic activity against the tumor cell lines Raji, Jurkat and the TF-positive KG1 subline was increased. Genetic modification of YT cells could provide a useful tool for tumor targeting in immunotherapy.
