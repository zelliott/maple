Infections associated with neoplastic disease and its treatment are well described. Associations between specific infections and particular immune defects have also been defined. Despite the awareness that certain patient populations are at risk, potential prophylactic regimens for many of these infections have not been studied. The development of isoniazid for the prevention of tuberculosis is reviewed. The requirements for the study of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with neoplastic disease are discussed based on this example. Specific infections associated with neoplastic disease are suggested as candidates for multicenter controlled trials of prophylactic regimens.
