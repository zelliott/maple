Charged particles have moved from the physics laboratory to the clinic because of their advantageous dose profile and biologic effects. This brief review will summarize the basic phenomenological laboratory data that led to the successful clinical use of these modalities in selected tumor sites, and the emerging new genomic and proteomic research that have provided translational evidence for potential molecular mechanisms underlying some impressive clinical results.
