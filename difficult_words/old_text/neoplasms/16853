Endometrious may be located in many parts of the body which are not limited to the pelvic region. While the classical theory of menstrual reflux easily accounts for the genital locations, other theories, notably metaplasia, have been propounded to explain more remote locations. Among the sites of implantation of the disease, the most common is the ovary followed, in order of frequency, by the anterior and posterior parts of the vaginal fornix, the broad ligament of the uterus and the uterosacral ligaments. Endometriosis of the digestive or urinary tract may create problems of differential diagnosis with cancer. External locations are much less frequent.
