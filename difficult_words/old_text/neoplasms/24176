Screening for cancer is the focus of increasing interest and activity in general practice. Where clear evidence and guidelines are available, the GP has a key role in the promotion of screening. Where the evidence is inconclusive, GPs are faced with the more difficult task of negotiating screening decisions with their patients which reflect this uncertainty and incorporate patients' preferences. GPs play a central role in cancer screening in Australia, whether or not they actually provide the tests. Critical activities include the provision of information and coordination of the screening process. On-going education and skill development in this area is, therefore, a high priority for Australian GPs.
