As intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) becomes routine clinical practice, its advantages and limitations are better understood. With these new understandings, some new developments have emerged in an effort to alleviate the limitations of the current IMRT practice. This article describes a few of these efforts made at the University of Maryland, including: i) improving IMRT efficiency with direct aperture optimization; ii) broadening the scope of optimization to include the mode of delivery and beam angles; and iii) new planning methods for intensity modulated arc therapy (IMAT).
