Advanced theranostic materials hold promise for targeted delivery of drugs, with the ability to follow the transport as well as its consequences. This should, ideally, be possible with minimum invasive surgery and having no or minimum cytotoxicity of the materials. It requires development of newer materials whose physical properties would allow for easy probe, which could carry the therapeutic molecules, which will be stable under physiological conditions, and at the same time would be able to permeate barriers to the target. We report the development of a composite consisting of highly fluorescent Au nanoclusters and the biopolymer chitosan, which could easily be converted into nanoparticles and would form a stable polyplex with suicide gene for induction of apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. The simultaneous red, green, and blue fluorescence from the nanoclusters provided convenient optical imaging and flow cytometry probes, without having to use additional dyes. Moreover, the colloidal nanocluster-polymer composite could be converted into solid film and be stored with the retention of optical properties. The pH tunable optical properties in the medium were also intact in the films that quickly dissolved in water with retention of properties.
