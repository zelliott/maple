Provision of targeted care to the adult survivors of childhood cancer is a current need, likely to only increase in the future. The definition of the long-term effects of cancer, the magnitude of the treatment delivered, and the care required as a consequence fall within the domain of pediatric oncologists. The actual delivery of care including targeted follow-up and interventions, require the combined dedication and talents of pediatric oncologists working with adolescent medicine, internal medicine, medical-pediatrics, and family practice physicians to contribute by making this domain of care a priority and a collaborative goal, developing both an educational approach to and a structured care delivery model for the special needs of adult survivors of childhood cancer.
