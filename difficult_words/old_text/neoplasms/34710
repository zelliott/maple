Immunosurveillance is an extrinsic mechanism of cancer suppression that eliminates nascent tumors. However, the selection imposed by immunosurveillance can drive tumor evolution and the emergence of clinically apparent neoplasms. Mechanisms of immune escape acquired by less immunogenic variants during this process, termed immunoediting, may contribute significantly to malignant progression. In this review, we summarize the evidence that up-regulation of the nonclassic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecule HLA-G in tumor cells plays an important role in cancer and immune escape.
