Between january 1, 1983 and december 31, 1986, 360 implantable infusion devices were inserted for systemic chemotherapy. Most of the devices were Port A Cath systems. The main complications observed were thrombosis (18 cases, 5%) and infection (8 cases, 2.2%). Since one year the catheters are being introduced by subcutaneous puncture of the subclavian vein, the chambers being placed in a small lateral subclavicular cavity. Intra-operative radiography is necessary to minimize the risk of malposition and thrombosis. These systems, relayed by external pumps, enable chemotherapeutic regimens to be administered sequentially over a 24-hour period.
