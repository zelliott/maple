As more children are now being cured of cancer, increasing attention needs to be focused on the long-term sequelae of cancer therapy, principally late-appearing second cancers and damage to organ systems. To this end, the authors have established an oncology follow-up clinic specifically designed to examine former pediatric cancer patients who are likely to be cured. Patients receive a physical examination and appropriate organ function studies based upon initial diagnosis, pre-existing conditions, treatment received, and any complications experienced during the course of therapy. The late effects noted among the first 200 such survivors examined reveal a high proportion of severe sequelae secondary to radiation therapy in early childhood. Second malignant neoplasms may also be related to alkylating agent chemotherapy and to genetic conditions. Although certain therapeutic practices have improved the outlook for these patients, and, in some cases, reduction in intensity of therapy has been found to be effective, increased survival and newer treatment modalities have made extended follow-up increasingly necessary in order to detect and possibly prevent the occurrence of such late effects.
