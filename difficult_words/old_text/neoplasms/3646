Electrospray ionisation (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) has been used extensively for the detection of peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This review focuses on the optimisation of electrospray mass spectrometry and the use of tandem mass spectrometry to sequence MHC class I peptides. We review the isolation of MHC class I peptides from the surface of cells with particular reference to tumour cells. In addition, we also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the methods available to concentrate and fractionate the peptides prior to analysis by electrospray mass spectrometry.
