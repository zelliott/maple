As predictors of tumor response by radiotherapy, tumor with or without c-myc amplification and DNA histogram pattern were analyzed and evaluated for patients' prognosis. There was no relation between c-myc amplification and DNA ploidy pattern in this study. These factors also showed no relation to response rate and survival. But all of the tumors with c-myc amplification and aneuploid pattern exhibited a complete response by radiotherapy. The tumors with c-myc amplification and aneuploid pattern may be more radiosensitive than without amplification and diploid. These data suggested that c-myc amplification and ploidy pattern might be a predictive parameter before radiotherapy.
