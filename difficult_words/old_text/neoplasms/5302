We studied perceptions of the importance and difficulty of coping behaviors, from the perspectives of cancer patients (n = 33) and health care providers (i.e. nursing and technical personnel, n = 24). They rated the importance and difficulty of 43 behaviors that correspond to six domains of coping with cancer. Generally, ratings of importance were similar for both patients and providers. However, patients rated the domains of Coping with Treatment Related Side Effects and Seeking Support as less important than staff. Ratings of difficulty were quite divergent. Patients perceived coping as less difficult than the medical staff in the following domains: Maintenance of Activity and Independence, Coping With Treatment-Related Side-Effects, Accepting Cancer/Maintaining Positive Attitude, and Seeking Support. These differences in difficulty ratings between patients and health care providers may reflect distinct perspectives or schemas about coping. That is, patients may hold 'positive illusions' about their coping capacity and, therefore, rate coping as less difficult. Health care providers may overestimate patients' distress and, therefore, underestimate patients' coping capacity. An understanding of these different perspectives may assist medical staff in fostering self-efficacy expectations for coping behaviors.
