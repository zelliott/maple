The hygienic analysis of working conditions at a rubber production plant revealed that measures aimed at the decrease of dust load of the preparatory process were not sufficient. High dust load was accompanied by unfavourable microclimatic conditions. The content of carcinogens, such as benz(a)--pyrene, acrylonitrile, and vinyl chloride on the average did not exceed MACs. Their highest concentrations exceeding MACs were detected in vulcanization and compaction bays. Preventive measures should be directed at reducing workers' exposure to carcinogens and nonspecific occupational damaging factors by means of automatization and hermetic sealing of the equipment along with the introduction of robotized systems.
