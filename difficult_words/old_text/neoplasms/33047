Both neuronal and vascular development require guidance to establish a precise branching pattern of these systems in the vertebrate body. Several molecules implicated in axon navigation have also been shown to regulate vessel sprouting. Among these guidance cues, Netrins constitute a family of diffusible molecules with a bifuncional role in axon pathfinding. Recent findings implicate Netrins in other developmental processes, including vascular development. We here review recent studies and discuss the possible dual function of Netrins and its receptors during branching of blood vessels in developmental and pathological angiogenesis.
