Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has the potential to improve efficacy of established and novel cancer therapies and to assist more rapid and rational progression of promising novel therapies into the clinic. This is due to PET's unrivalled sensitivity and ability to monitor the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs and biochemicals radiolabelled with short -lived positron emitting radioisotopes. PET is a multidisciplinary science which employs chemists, biologists, mathematical modellers, pharmacologists as well as clinicians. Clinical research questions in oncology determine the methodological challenges faced by these other disciplines. Within this context we focus on the developments of the radiolabelled compounds that have underpinned the clinical work in oncology for monitoring tumour and normal tissue pharmacokinetics, assessment of tumour response, cell proliferation, gene expression, hypoxia, multidrug resistance and status of receptors on tumours.
