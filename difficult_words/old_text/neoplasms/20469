In this prospective cohort study, minocycline-ethylenediaminetetraacetate (M-EDTA) was used as a lock solution in indwelling ports inserted in 14 children with cancer. No port infections, thrombotic events, or other adverse events were observed, compared with 10 port infections that occurred in 48 control patients whose ports were flushed with heparin. M-EDTA is a promising lock solution in long-term catheters.
