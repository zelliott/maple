Radiation may be used for the treatment of neoplastic lesions, either as a palliative measure or in an attempt at cure. Particulate or electromagnetic radiation can be obtained from a variety of machines and isotopes. Radiation therapy is the treatment of choice for certain malignancies and may be an acceptable alternative to surgery in others. Pre- or postoperative radiation is increasingly used to improve local control and survival. As with any therapeutic tool, acute and chronic complications may occur.
