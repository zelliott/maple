Cancers must evade or suppress the immune system in order to develop. Better understanding of the molecular regulation governing tumour detection and effective activation of the immune system (so called immune regulatory checkpoints) has provided new targets for cancer immunotherapy. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against these targets are currently undergoing clinical evaluation with more in pre-clinical development; buoyed by the recent licence approval of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilumumab, for use in melanoma. This article will review the current status of the various antibodies and target molecules being investigated.
