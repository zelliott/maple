Of the various forms of radiation injury resulting from irradiation several reactions are important in lymphology since they respond well to manual lymphatic drainage according to Vodder-Asdonk, to surgery or to fibrosis stretching. In acute and sub-acute radiation injury there is usually transient inflammatory swelling, e.g. in the extremities, and radiogenic oedema of the breast which reacts favourably to manual lymphatic drainage. Late sequelae such as ulcerating radiodermatitis and lymphatic oedema may be improved by manual lymphatic drainage or surgery as well as radiogenic fibrosis which is treated with intensive but careful stretching which may, in part, prevent further plexus injury.
