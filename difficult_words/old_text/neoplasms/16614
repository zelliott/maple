Human cancers are generally characterized by acquisition of a series of somatic mutations. Molecular techniques, such as those described in this volume, have been used to identify a plethora of chromosomal translocations and mutations associated with carcinogenesis. The analysis and comparison of the array of genetic changes occurring in malignancy will enable a move toward a better understanding of cancer development. This will eventually lead to the development of improved therapies tailored to take into account the cytogenetic and molecular characteristics of specific human cancers.
