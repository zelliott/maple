Univariate and multivariate analyses have been made of the relationship of systolic and diastolic blood-pressure measured at study entry to subsequent 14-year mortality among 1233 White males originally age 40-59 in 1958 from the Chicago Peoples Gas Company prospective study. With age, serum-cholesterol, and cigarettes per day controlled, both elevated systolic and electaed diastolic blood-pressure in 1958 were found to be strongly related to subsequent mortality from cancer in the men of this study. The possibility that this finding was due either to an association between antihypertensive medication in general, and cancer, or to an association was found that could explain the excess cancer mortality among those with elevated blood-pressure in 1958, either with medication in general, or with reserpine and rauwolfia in particular. These findings thus pose the question, is high blood-pressure associated with an increased risk of death due to cancer?
