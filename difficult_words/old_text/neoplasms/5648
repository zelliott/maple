The combination of specific gene targeting technologies with efficient gene delivery systems could provide the means to evaluate the concept of anticancer strategies designed to block expression of potentially rate-limiting tumor promoting factors. Here, we constructed adenoviruses expressing hammerhead-ribozymes targeted to two of these factors, the tyrosine kinase receptor HER-2/neu or the growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN). Adenovirus-mediated transduction of either HER-2/neu- or PTN-targeted ribozymes depleted the respective RNAs and inhibited protein expression significantly in three different human cancer cell lines. This resulted in almost complete abrogation of HER-2/neu- or PTN-dependent cancer-cell proliferation, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this approach as a future cancer gene therapy.
