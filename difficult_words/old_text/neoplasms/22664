The Wisconsin Cancer Reporting System (WCRS) collects data on cancer diagnoses in the state of Wisconsin. California and Minnesota cancer registries have reported that Hmong have higher rates of certain cancers than the general population. WCRS collaborated with the Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (WCCCP) and Wisconsin United Coalition of Mutual Assistance Associations (WUCMAA) to investigate the reporting of cancer cases in the Hmong population by medical facilities.

WCRS, WCCCP, and WUCMAA conducted a mail survey of facilities in 12 Wisconsin counties where Hmong populations reside.

The survey found that &lt;30% of facilities collected Hmong as a demographic category or identified cancer patients as Hmong; most facilities reported Hmong patients only as Asian. A training webcast was developed for facilities to reinforce WCRS reporting requirements and to elucidate the Hmong culture. A pamphlet for Hmong patients was developed to explain the importance of self identification for more racially representative cancer data in Wisconsin.
