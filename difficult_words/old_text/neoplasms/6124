Our study aims to investigate whether information given by radiation oncologists to their patients is tailored to the patient's desired level of information and, if so, what the effect of tailoring is on patient-reported outcomes, i.e. satisfaction, health, anxiety and self-efficacy.

Consecutive radiotherapy patients (n = 150) completed a baseline questionnaire one week before their initial consultation, immediately following this consultation, and again one week prior to their first follow-up visit. The initial consultation was videotaped and 10 radiation oncologists' information giving behavior (content and duration) analyzed.

The overall amount of information provided by the radiation oncologists matched with patients' information needs in 50.8% (k = 0.07) of the consultations. No significant associations between tailored information giving and patient-reported outcomes were found, except for tailoring of information on procedures, and patients' anxiety and global health. These associations were no longer significant when correcting for patients' background characteristics.

This study shows that radiation oncologists poorly tailor their information to the needs of their patients. However, lack of tailoring is not associated with worse patient-reported outcomes. Until more evidence is available, radiation oncologists may explicitly ask patients about their information preferences and tailor the information provided accordingly.
