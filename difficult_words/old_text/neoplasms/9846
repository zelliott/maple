The neurosurgeon has many approaches to pain control, depending on the location of the cancer and its tissue characteristics. By far, the most common procedure to be employed is percutaneous chordotomy, which is relatively risk-free and easy for the patient to undergo. It is most important to recognize that pain relief should be effected early in the course of the disease before the ravages of drug addiction and the complications of directed therapy like radiation or chemotherapy have taken their toll. Inanition, under these circumstances, may well be the result of treatment and drugs, rather than the disease itself. We have often seen patients, once given pain relief, make sudden weight gains and go on to a comfortable existence for a surprisingly long period of time thereafter. It is urged that pain relief be considered early, as a major contribution to enhanced quality of living and longevity of survival.
