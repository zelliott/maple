To examine the association between communication self-efficacy, working environment perceptions and burnout in an Israeli sample of oncology nurses.

A non-randomized convenience sample of nurses (n=39) was recruited from six oncology units in a major tertiary medical center in Israel. Measurements included a socio-demographic survey, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, a communication skills self-efficacy inventory and the Working Environment Scale.

Frequent experiences of emotional exhaustion were reported by &gt;60% of participants, cynicism by 28%, and self-actualization by &gt;80%. Several statistically significant associations were demonstrated between communication skills self-efficacy and burnout, as well as between cynicism and reported positive characteristics of the working environment.

In our study, emotional exhaustion and self-actualization were found to be separate and distinct experiences that can occur simultaneously. Communication self-efficacy and a positive perception of the working environment appear to buffer the occurrence of emotional exhaustion and promote self-actualization.
