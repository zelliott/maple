Cancer pain remains undertreated and a significant number of patients with cancer pain die from severe untreated pain. With increasing survival rate in cancer, the prevalence of cancer pain is also increasing in number. Though majority of patients with cancer pain can be effectively treated with conventional medical management, still a significant portion of patients required some form of interventional pain management techniques. Among the interventional techniques, intrathecal drug delivery is increasingly used in cancer pain management. Our objective of this article is to review literatures and clinical studies on intrathecal drug delivery system (IDDS) in cancer pain management and to provide updates on its use, precautions, contraindications, side effects and its management, socioeconomic consideration, and management of IDDS in difficult or uncommon situations.
