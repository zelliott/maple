With increasing survival rates in pediatric oncology, the medical and psychosocial costs of cure are becoming apparent for the child and his family. The focus of our concern is now how to prevent and to reduce these adverse late effects of cancer and its treatment. To reduce the late psychosocial consequences for the child and its family a booklet was written for parents. We decided to address parents because of the young age of many children when treatment is completed, the essential role of parents in alleviating late effects for the child and his siblings, and the possibility to discuss the whole range of psychosocial late effects: those for the patient, the siblings, and for the parents themselves. The booklet acknowledges the specific emotional problems in patients, parents, and siblings that results from surviving childhood cancer and provides information and support on how to deal with them. The booklet can enhance open communication with the health care team about late consequences. In this way the booklet supports the further integration of medical and psychosocial aftercare.
