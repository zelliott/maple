Despite improvements in surgical technique, organ preservation, immunosuppression, and management of infection, the long term survival following lung transplantation remains low, mainly due to immune mediated complications such as acute and chronic rejection. Almost all immunosuppressive agents used in the prophylaxis and treatment of rejection following lung transplantation are targets of T cell maturation, function or proliferation, which in theory should cause sufficient disruption of the adaptive immune system to prevent graft rejection. However the five year survival rate of only 50% suggests this is not the case. More recent evidence suggests that NK cells may play a significant role in immune processes following lung transplantation. This article reviews the literature on the potential function of NK cells in rejection, infection, malignancy and tolerance following lung transplantation.
