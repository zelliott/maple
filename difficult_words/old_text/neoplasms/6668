A unique primary placental tumor, designated "hepatocellular adenoma of the placenta," is reported. The tumor was composed of cells resembling fetal hepatocytes. The hepatocellular nature of the tumor cells was supported by ultrastructural and immunohistochemical findings. Histogenetically, this tumor most likely represents a highly specialized monodermal teratoma.
