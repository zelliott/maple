The FDA's approval of filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) for accelerated recovery of neutrophil counts following chemotherapy has prompted discussions regarding the cost and benefits associated with such expensive new therapies. One method to evaluate the cost effectiveness of a therapy is decision analysis, which provides a quantitative method of cost analysis. Using the principles of decision analysis, we created a decision-analysis tree for evaluating the cost effectiveness of G-CSF therapy. Based on data gathered from a retrospective review of ambulatory oncology patients, we found that routine administration of G-CSF to all outpatients receiving chemotherapy is not cost effective, although it would be justifiable for some patients.
