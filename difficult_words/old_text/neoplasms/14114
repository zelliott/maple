Recent progress in the understanding of drug resistance has led to the discovery of new targets for chemotherapy. By attacking the molecules that make cancer cells insensitive to chemotherapy, it is hoped that drug-resistant disease will respond to treatment. This review describes some of the latest advances in understanding of the biochemistry of drug resistance. Following a general introduction four areas of topical interest are discussed: (1) multidrug resistance and P-glycoprotein, (2) glutathione and its related enzymes, (3) topoisomerase II and (4) DNA repair.
