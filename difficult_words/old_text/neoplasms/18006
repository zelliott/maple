In this article we review many important epigenetic changes in early carcinogenesis and discuss the possibility of these alterations being targeted for therapeutic intervention in the future. Both regional DNA methylation and global chromatin packaging are interrelated partners that function in concert to control gene transcription. We first summarize briefly DNA methylation and its role in gene expression. Then, we focus on how the DNA is packaged into chromatin and the tight relationship between chromatin and DNA methylation. A more complete understanding of these key, regulatory events is vital in approaching a more rational drug therapy to various malignancies.
