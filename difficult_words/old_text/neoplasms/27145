Extraordinary progress has been made in our detailed understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms responsible for oncogenesis and cancer progression. Empowered by next-generation sequencing, many new targets and pathways have been identified to exploit oncogene and non-oncogene addiction and synthetic lethality. Kinase inhibitors feature strongly in the druggable cancer genome and 19 have been approved in oncology. While survival gains are valuable, drug resistance has emerged as the major challenge. The clonal heterogeneity and evolution of cancers is an intrinsic problem, together with feedback loops, kinase switching and activation of alternative targets and pathways. The solution to drug resistance will require the use of rationally targeted combinational regimens. The application of adaptive treatment cycles based on ongoing multi-technology profiling will be the key to long-term therapeutic success.
