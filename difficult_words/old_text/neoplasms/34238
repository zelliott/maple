A ten-compartment flow-limited pharmacokinetic model scaled from rabbit tissue distribution data was used to predict plasma adriamycin concentrations in 23 patients and adriamycin tissue uptake in nine surgery patients following iv bolus doses of 10--60 mg/m2. The predicted concentrations were compared to experimentally determined adriamycin using a specific thin-layer chromatographic fluorescence scanning procedure. The predicted plasma time course for 11 of 16 patients with relatively normal liver and kidney function agreed closely with the observed plasma time course. Deviations in the other five patients were ascribed to possible changes in the profile of metabolite formation and/or fluctuations in biliary clearance. All four patients with elevated serum bilirubin demonstrated significantly  higher and more prolonged plasma levels than predicted. The results of two patients with impaired kidney function and one patient with both hepatic and renal involvement were inconclusive. The comparison between predicted and observed tissue concentrations in biopsy samples was varied; however, all were within an order of magnitude. It is concluded that the model depicts adriamycin uptake and distribution reasonably well; however, more needs to be known concerning individual variation in metabolic and biliary excretion rates for this to become more patient-specific. Also, a tumor compartment appears to be an important addition in modifying the model to allow for clinical utility.
