A genetic study of hybrid Baltimore blacks in relation to the presence of cancer may be timely since the mortality rate in blacks compared with the mortality rate in whites has increased considerably. The appearance of white genes in black persons may provide some help in such a study. A positive relationship was not established in a group of randomly selected black patients when Duffy phenotypes were examined in patients with cancer.
