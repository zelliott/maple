The majority of clinically effective anticancer drugs inhibit some aspect of the machinery responsible for DNA replication and chromosome segregation. Drug action also arrests cells at defined points in the cell cycle called checkpoints. These checkpoints ensure that subsequent cell cycle events are inhibited until the inflicted damage is repaired. The fidelity of checkpoint control and susceptibility of cells to apoptosis while repair is underway may be important factors in the success of chemotherapy. We discuss these concepts and focus particularly on possible applications to improved antitumor therapy with DNA damaging agents.
