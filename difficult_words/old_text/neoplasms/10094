On June 20, 2008, a meeting entitled "Translation of new cancer treatments from canine to human cancer patients," sponsored by the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, was convened to discuss the potential value, opportunity, risks, and rewards of an integrated and comparative drug development path for new cancer therapeutics that includes naturally occurring cancers in pet animals. A summary of this meeting and subsequent discussion are provided here to afford clarity on the conduct of these studies so as to optimize the opportunities provided by this novel drug development and modeling strategy.
