153 regional lymph nodes obtained during surgical operations because of cancer of various cites from 50 cancer patients were studied. Failure of local immunity is explained by the following factors: 1) depletion of T-cell population with a decrease of activated lymphocyte-killers; 2) high activity of B-cell population able to block T-cell cytotoxic effect; 3) deficiency of T-suppressors and T-helpers; 4) a decrease of macrophages-monocytes of phagocytic capacity; 5) high activity of dendritic reticular cells stimulating transformation of B-lymphocytes and low activity of interdigitating reticulocytes determining T-cell immunity stimulation.
