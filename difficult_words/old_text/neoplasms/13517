Based on our experience of telemedicine in Kansas, we have identified several key factors in the success of a telemedicine practice. Very early in any project, it is important to bring together all participants (especially the physicians who are expected to refer patients) to define the need, outline specific goals, analyse and test the technology, and develop a plan for the implementation. As with traditional health-care, many partners must come together, including primary-care practitioners willing to shoulder day-to-day responsibility for management of complex patients, nurses with special expertise and consultants willing to work with a remote team using telemedicine. These individuals must accept the challenges and appreciate the rewards of working in a different practice model, in which communication and interdependence are critical for success. The telemedicine consultant is only as good as the local health-care team. The technology itself is only a small part of the equation.
