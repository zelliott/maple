Navelbine (NVB) (5'-noranhydrovinblastine) is a new semi-synthetic vincaalkaloid (VA) exhibiting a high affinity for tubulin and considerable anticancer activity in patients. A better hematologic tolerance and a weak neurotoxicity have been reported for this drug as compared to other VA. Moreover, NVB presents a relatively high bioavailability and a good digestive tolerance, thus offering original perspectives for the treatment of ambulatory cancer patients. A clinical pharmacokinetic study of NVB was carried out on 12 patients after oral administration of the drug. The pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those of intravenous administration and also showed a high interindividual variability. Studies on the in vitro metabolism of NVB using hepatic microsomal fractions from 22 different donors demonstrated the formation of 3 metabolites. The biotransformation rate quantitatively varies from one human liver specimen to another, a fact which could be, in part, at the origin of the interindividual variability of the therapeutic response.
