Current knowledge about adriamycin cardiomyopathy indicates that the major cause of this condition is increased oxidative stress although the drug's antitumor action in patients may involve other mechanisms. Controversies about the different antioxidants in preventing cardiomyopathy likely stem from the fact that antioxidants must be effective in both the lipid and water phases, and the dose must be optimal, in order to be protective. Probucol, an antioxidant and promoter of endogenous antioxidants, is one such agent. Conducting clinical trials with an optimal dose of probucol is the next step and should make this great anticancer drug safer and more efficient in the fight against the cancer.
