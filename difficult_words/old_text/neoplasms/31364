To review empirical studies of psychological treatments for (1) reducing physical symptoms in children and adolescents with asthma, (2) improving glycemic control in children and adolescents with diabetes, and (3) reducing chemotherapy side effects in children and adolescents with cancer.

We identified peer-reviewed studies of effects of psychological treatments for asthma symptoms, diabetes symptoms, and side effects of cancer chemotherapy through computerized databases (i.e., PSYCHLIT and MEDLINE). Treatment approaches are evaluated with respect to meeting criteria for being "promising," "probably efficacious," or "well-established" based on the Chambless criteria (Chambless et al., 1996).

Two well-established treatments (EMG biofeedback for children with emotionally triggered asthma and imagery with suggestion for children undergoing chemotherapy) and two probably efficacious treatments (relaxation for children with emotionally triggered asthma and distraction with relaxation for children undergoing chemotherapy) were identified. Additional research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of treatments for diabetes-related symptoms.

Future research would be enhanced by identifying characteristics of children who are likely to respond to psychological treatment as an adjunctive strategy for symptom management and by clearly elucidating mechanisms of effect of various interventions.
