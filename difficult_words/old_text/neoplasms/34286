Urticaria developed above the site of injection with doxorubicin hydrochloride in 11 patients with malignant neoplasms. Generalized urticaria without anaphylaxis developed in one patient, while only local reactions developed in the other ten. A reaction developed in two patients on their first exposure to doxorubicin. Two of the seven patients who received subsequent doxorubicin therapy had further reactions. Urticaria does not seem to be a contraindication to further treatment with doxorubicin if the patient is closely observed. The value of prophylactic antihistamines of corticosteroids is not clear.
