The tumor response in solid neoplasias can be evaluated through volumetric measurements. The advance of the technology and the appearance of new therapeutic alternatives as: hyperthermia, immunotherapy, photodynamic therapy have originated discrepancy with the volumetric measurement of the tumor because the tumor mass can increase or remain in the same size but with tissue modification and increase of the inflammatory and necrotic reaction. There are also other types of morphometric measurement, for the evaluation of the amount of hypoxic cells in the tumor tissue through indirect methods that measure the metabolic level of the tumor tissue; one of this morphometric measurement quantitates apoptosis by light microscopy as tumor regression response. This technique could facilitate experimental studies because of the use of peripheral tumoral tissue obtained with thin needles directed through image equipment.
