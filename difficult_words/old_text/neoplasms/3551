The basic surgical procedures for all diseases and organs were established by the end of the 20th century. However, the results of surgical treatment in cancer patients are still unsatisfactory. Despite radical resection based on the conventional diagnostic system for cancer metastases, disease recurrence and relapse are major problems in the clinical field of oncology. Standarized therapy without understanding the biology of tumors has not contributed significantly to cancer patients. Here, we propose that molecular biology-based surgery, or a strategy of surgical oncology based on information obtained from new molecular techniques should be urgently established to improve the management of cancer patients.
