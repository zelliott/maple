The purpose of this exploratory-descriptive pilot study was to explore the use of photography to examine the meaning of health among adolescents who have been diagnosed with cancer. The sample consisted of 4 adolescents who had been diagnosed with cancer and were attending a weekend retreat. Participants were given Polaroid cameras with instructions to take pictures that illustrated health. The participants were then interviewed to obtain an understanding of how their pictures demonstrated health. The participants produced 22 pictures and 35 descriptive expressions of health, which were content analyzed for common themes and elements. The meaning of health held by these adolescents may have implications for influencing their adherence to cancer treatment regimens as well as other health behaviors that promote or risk their health.
