A deep heating hyperthermia device TRIPAS (a triapplicator system) consisting of three independent, dielectrically loaded horn applicators operating in phase at 300 MHz was investigated. The heating characteristics produced by this hyperthermia system were analyzed by means of thermochromic liquid-crystal cards and a modified CDRH (Center for Devices and Regulatory Health) elliptical phantom. Both homogenous and inhomogeneous phantoms were used, simulating high and low permittivity tissues (muscle and lung). These equivalent tissues were made of polyacrylamide gel. The semiquantitative heating pattern analysis showed a central heating of 1/3 of maximum heating at a depth of 10 cm in both homogenous (muscle) and heterogenous (muscle/fat) phantoms. Also more uniform temperature/SAR distributions were generated in muscle equivalent material than those in lung.
