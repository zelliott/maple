Seventy-seven sequential patients referred to a radiation oncology clinic for treatment of malignant neoplasms were tested for their immediate recall of information presented, recorded, and signed on informed consent documents. An experimental group of 40 patients were given the intervention of taking the completed form home before signing. Results support the usefulness of the intervention. The experimental patients were found to possess greater information than the 37 patients who signed the form after the usual clinic procedure in virtually every area required of informed consent. The most significant gains were made in patients' understanding of proposed treatment procedures and appropriate treatment alternatives. Women recalled more information relevant to informed consent than did men. Results also indicated a tendency for younger patients to recall more informed consent information than older patients.
