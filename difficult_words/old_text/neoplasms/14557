Interferons are endogenous proteins produced by vertebrates in response to viral infections and is immunoregulatory agents. Three types of interferon are known today: IFN-alpha, IFN-beta und IFN-gamma which show different degree of relationship to each other in molecular structure and activity. Several interferons are produced in large amount by recombinant DNA technology. Their most important properties are their antiviral activity, their antiproliferative and immunoregulatory activities. Clinical trials showed that interferons can be used as therapeutic agents in viral infections and malignant diseases. Results of treatment in certain viral infections or virally induced tumors and some particular haematologic malignancies are very good. Many frequent forms of tumors still respond less or not at all to interferon treatment. Interferons have many different effects in vivo and can act synergistically with other agents. Further success in cancer therapy can therefore be expected from investigations on optimum dose schedule and effective combination regimes.
