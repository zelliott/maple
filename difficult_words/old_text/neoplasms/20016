Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) is one of the most studied enzymes in cancer. MMP-9 can cleave proteins of the extracellular matrix and a large number of receptors and growth factors. Accordingly, its expression must be tightly regulated to avoid excessive enzymatic activity, which is associated with disease progression. Although we know that epigenetic mechanisms play a central role in controlling mmp-9 gene expression, predicting how epigenetic drugs could be used to suppress mmp-9 gene expression is not trivial because epigenetic drugs also regulate the expression of key proteins that can tip the balance towards activation or suppression of MMP-9. Here, we review how our understanding of the biology and expression of MMP-9 could be exploited to augment clinical benefits, most notably in terms of the prevention and management of degenerative diseases and cancer.
