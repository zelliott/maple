Cellular quiescence is a state characterized by decreased cell size and metabolic activity. Quiescence acts to reduce the resources, energy and space. Quiescence might also protect cells from accumulating metabolic damage that could result in malignancy. Recent studies have shown that cell quiescence is an actively maintained rather than a default state in the absence of signals. Quiescence factors represent potential tumor suppressor genes because alterations in their expression or function contribute to progression of malignancies. There is growing evidence that quiescence is under active transcriptional control. The regulation of cell proliferation involves dozens of extracellular signals and intracellular factors of various types. In the present review we will focus on the role of Tob, a member of the APRO family members in regulating cellular quiescence and inhibition of cellular proliferation.
