Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is a major clinical problem because it represents the dose-limiting side effects of a significant number of antineoplastic drugs. The incidence of CIPN varies depending on the drugs and schedules used, and this can be quite high, particularly when neurophysiological methods are used to make a diagnosis. However, even when CIPN is not a dose-limiting side effect, its onset may severely affect the quality of life of cancer patients and cause chronic discomfort. In this review the features of CIPN due to the administration of the most widely used drugs, such as platinum drugs, taxanes and vinca alkaloids, and of two old drugs with new clinical applications, suramin and thalidomide, will be discussed. Moreover, the earliest data regarding the neurotoxicity of some new classes of very promising antineoplastic agents, such as epothilones and proteasome inhibitors, will be discussed. Finally, the data available on neuroprotectants, evaluated in the attempt to prevent CIPN, will be summarised.
