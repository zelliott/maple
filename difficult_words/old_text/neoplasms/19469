Since April 2002, when the Swedish National Food Administration first reported its finding of elevated levels of the substance acrylamide in commonly consumed foods (Swedish National Food Administration, 2002), there has been considerable debate about the health effects of dietary exposure to acrylamide. In particular, researchers have speculated on whether the amount of acrylamide consumed through the typical diet could increase the risk of cancer in humans. In this paper, we review the epidemiological data to date examining dietary acrylamide in relation to cancer risk. We highlight the strengths and limitations of using epidemiology to address this public health question. Finally, we provide an overview of future directions of epidemiological research on the health effects of dietary acrylamide.
