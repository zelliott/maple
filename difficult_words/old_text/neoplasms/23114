A report is given of the results obtained on implementing sonography routinely in the diagnosis of general surgical conditions. Fields in which this procedure has proved of particular value are acute surgical emergencies, polytrauma, biliary surgery, post-operative complications, septic processes, palpable abdominal masses and the investigation and follow up of patients with tumours. Ultrasound-directed fine-needle puncture plays an important role within this last-mentioned group of indications. In order to make optimum use of sonography in interpreting specifically surgical problems, this readily-available bedside examination is performed by the experienced surgeon himself. Further diagnostic tactics and their consequences are discussed.
