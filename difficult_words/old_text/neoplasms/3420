The recent progress in molecular biology and pharmacology has increased the likelihood that cancer prevention will rely increasingly on interventions collectively termed 'chemoprevention'. Cancer chemoprevention is the use of agents to inhibit, delay or reverse carcinogenesis. A number of potential targets for chemoprevention have recently been identified. Many classes of agents including antioestrogens, anti-inflammatories, antioxidants and other diet-derived agents have shown a great deal of promise. In this review, we will begin by describing the general classes of chemopreventive agents and the mechanisms by which these agents act. We will then describe the opportunities that presently exist for chemoprevention of specific cancers.
