This paper will focus on three aspects of work which we have conducted in our laboratory over the past several years. Firstly, it will present results of studies in which we have found a selective inhibition of suppressor cell function in solid tumor cancer patients treated with cytotoxic drugs. Secondly, it will show that this selective inhibition results in an augmentation of other forms of immune reactivity and, in particular, an enhanced interleukin-2 production and response to this. Finally, it will demonstrate how we have made use of that information to intervene pharmacologically to modulate the immunosuppression which usually follows the use of cytotoxic drugs in solid tumor cancer patients.
