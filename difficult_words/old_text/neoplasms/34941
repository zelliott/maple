This paper describes the present state of research on application of immunology for cancer diagnosis and therapy, especially with emphasis on the recent progress of monoclonal antibody and recombinant cytokines technologies. In the history of immuno-diagnosis and- therapy of cancer, a new era has been coming because of the progress of these technologies, in addition to an increase of our knowledges on host-defense mechanisms against cancer and development of new types of instruments and chemical synthesis technology. A number of approaches of cancer diagnosis and therapy with monoclonal antibodies and cytokines in Japan were introduced in this paper, and problems of these trials to be solved in the future were discussed. Together with almost established surgical treatment, chemotherapy and physicotherapy, including radiation and hyperthermia, biotherapy, including immunotherapy and therapy with hormones and various biological response modifiers (BRM) are required for the purpose of complete cure of cancer. Further energetic and systematic efforts should be made in the future.
