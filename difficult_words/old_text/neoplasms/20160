This review describes molecular cytogenetic techniques for detection and characterization of genetic aberrations associated with human disease. The techniques of fluorescence in situ hybridization, primed in situ labeling and comparative genome hybridization are described, as are probes for repeated sequences, whole chromosomes and specific loci. Also reviewed are applications of these technologies to pre- and neonatal diagnosis and to the characterization of human malignancies.
