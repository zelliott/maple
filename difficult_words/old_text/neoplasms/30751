We assessed the analgesic efficacy and safety of single-entity oxycodone solution at doses greater than 10 mg orally every 4 hours in 24 patients with chronic cancer pain not controlled by weaker analgesics.

Twenty of 24 patients completed the study. Pain relief was obtained with doses up to 60 mg every 4 hours. When oxycodone was taken for long periods, further dose increments could be made safely. The side effects of oxycodone are mild, and common to all opioids, with sedation and constipation most frequent. Nausea was more common in females in all age groups and in patients of either sex less than 50 years of age. Episodes of serious toxicity were rare, and responded to dose reduction. Patients older than 65 years required lower doses, suggesting pharmacokinetic similarities between oxycodone and morphine. Patients changed from oral oxycodone to morphine remained pain-free when relative milligram potency ratios of 1:1 to oral morphine and 3:1 to intravenous morphine were used.

Oxycodone has been shown for the first time to be as versatile and flexible as oral morphine in the management of chronic pain in patients with advanced cancer.
