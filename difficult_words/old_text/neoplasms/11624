Tissue isoferritins are a family of proteins whose role in the storage of iron has been established for many years. More recently, isoferritins have been detected and quantitated in serum. Their concentrations, which vary in different pathological states, facilitate a follow-up examination of an iron deficiency or of an iron overload. The use of this single parameter instead of classical methods of investigation presents real progress in the treatment of patients with abnormalities of iron metabolism.
