Somatic cell hybridization (fusion) was carried out between cells of the murine lymphoma L-5178Y(r) and peripheral human lymphocytes. The L-5178Y(r) line is deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphorybosyl transferase (HGPRT). Using a selective medium system, it was possible to isolate hybrid cell clones having the complete complement of murine chromosomes as well as the human X chromosome on which the gene for HGPRT is located. This model system may be used to study the effect of the human X chromosome on the phenotype of the murine lymphoma.
