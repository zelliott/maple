A real-time optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimetry system for potential in vivo use during radiotherapy treatments is proposed. Single-crystal europium-doped KBr samples were grown in a Bridgman furnace, and characterised using optical absorption techniques. An algorithm for the processing of the OSL signal was defined for use in real-time measurements, and its performance was studied on data obtained with a home-built reader, using optical-fibre-coupled dosemeters. OSL dose-response, fading properties and temperature dependence of the signal were investigated in correlation with the concentration of Eu(2+) dopant in the sample.
