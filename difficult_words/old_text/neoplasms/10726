MR-visible lipids or mobile lipids are defined as lipids that are observable using proton MRS in cells and tissues. These MR-visible lipids are composed of triglycerides and cholesterol esters that accumulate in neutral lipid droplets, where their MR visibility is conferred as a result of the increased molecular motion available in this unique physical environment. This review discusses the factors that lead to the biogenesis of MR-visible lipids in cancer cells and in other cell types, such as immune cells and fibroblasts. We focus on the accumulations of mobile lipids that are inducible in cultured cells by a number of stresses, including culture conditions, and in response to activating stimuli or apoptotic cell death induced by anticancer drugs. This is compared with animal tumor models, where increases in mobile lipids are observed in response to chemo- and radiotherapy, and to human tumors, where mobile lipids are observed predominantly in high-grade brain tumors and in regions of necrosis. Conducive conditions for mobile lipid formation in the tumor microenvironment are discussed, including low pH, oxygen availability and the presence of inflammatory cells. It is concluded that MR-visible lipids appear in cancer cells and human tumors as a stress response. Mobile lipids stored as neutral lipid droplets may play a role in the detoxification of the cell or act as an alternative energy source, especially in cancer cells, which often grow in ischemic/hypoxic environments. The role of MR-visible lipids in cancer diagnosis and the assessment of the treatment response in both animal models of cancer and human brain tumors is also discussed. Although technical limitations exist in the accurate detection of intratumoral mobile lipids, early increases in mobile lipids after therapeutic interventions may be useful as a potential biomarker for the assessment of treatment response in cancer.
