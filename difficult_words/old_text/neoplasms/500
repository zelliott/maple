Tumor-maximum ratios and back-scatter factors were measured for 8 MV x-rays. The measured TMR's are found to conform to the empirical expression TMR(t) = K(t) At m(t). Hence, log-log plots of TMR vs. area at various depths in water, yield straight lines from which values of TMRo (for 0 x 0 cm2 field) are obtained by extrapolation. From these values, scatter-phantom ratios are also derived.
