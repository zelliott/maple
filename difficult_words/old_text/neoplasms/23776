Hickman catheters were the major venous access devices utilized at the University of Maryland Cancer Center from November 1978 to 1987. This study provided an opportunity to standardize insertion technique, to manage catheter-related activities and daily maintenance procedures in order to examine the progression of Hickman-catheter-related problems, to identify those factors that may minimize them, and to develop guidelines for the management and prevention of complications and malfunctions. In all, 690 Hickman catheters (368 double lumens) were placed in patients with acute leukemia and other cancers: 401 catheters were placed in patients with leukemia; 269 were placed during neutropenia; and 230 at platelet counts of &lt; 50,000/microliters. Two surgeons inserted 490 catheters, and the remaining 200 were placed by a group of rotating surgeons. All catheters were placed with the intention that they would remain in place as long as clinically necessary. Total Hickman catheter days were 134273. Infectious complications included exit site infections (160), tunnel infections (46) and bacteremias (397). There were 438 instances of noninfectious complications including thrombosis, lack of function, catheter migration, fracture and hemorrhage. Recommendations for prevention and treatment of Hickman-catheter-related complications include the development of a select group committed to placement, daily maintenance and management of problems; prompt removal of catheters with Candida sp. fungemia and bacteremia due to Bacillus sp. or a bacteremia that persists for &gt; 48 h after initiation of appropriate antibiotics, tunnel infections or Hickman-catheter-associated thrombosis. The majority of bacteremias and exit site infections can be effectively treated with antibiotics and local care.
