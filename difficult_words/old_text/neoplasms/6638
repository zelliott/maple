The cytological diagnosis of malignant Lymphoma in serous effusions can be difficult because reactive lymphocytes may be morphologically indistinguishable from malignant cells in lymphocytic and other low grade Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. As a result of the present study, diagnostic accuracy can be improved by means of B- and T-cell enumeration using an immunoalkaline-phosphatase method (IAP). 30 cytological specimens, including 28 pleural, 1 pericardial and 1 ascitic fluids, were studied with a panel of monoclonal anti B- and anti T-cell antibodies (PAN B, kappa, lambda, T1, T2, OKT4, T8). Reactive lymphocytic effusions were characterized by a predominance of T cells constituting greater than or equal to 80% of all lymphocytes with an excess of helper/inducer cells (mean helper to suppressor ratio 3.0) and by a surface kappa to surface lambda ratio of 1.6 on B-cells. Tuberculous effusions showed a similar distribution of lymphocyte-subpopulations whilst most of the carcinomatous fluids showed a lower percentage of T cells (lowest value 67%) and lower Th: Ts ratio (mean 2.0). Lymphoid cells in samples of five B-cell lymphomas were characterized by T-cell depression (less than 70%). B-cells in three cases expressed clear cut light chain monoclonality which was at least suggested in the other two cases. Lymphoid cells from two cases of Hodgkin's disease expressed an indistinct immunological pattern. Labelling of cytoplasmic immunoglobulins (heavy and light chains) using the peroxidase antiperoxidase method (PAP) may be important to characterize neoplasms of the plasma cell series. It is concluded that the chosen panel of antibodies in combination with IAP labelling method may be of great value in identifying B-cell lymphomas. The technique can be used in the routine laboratory and storage of unlabelled and labelled slides over long periods is possible.
