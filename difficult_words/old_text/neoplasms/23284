Cells of the innate immune system are involved in discriminating between the innocuous cell death (apoptosis) which occurs in tissues during homeostasis, and the cell death associated to tissue damage (necrosis). Recently, a new variant of apoptosis termed immunogenic apoptosis has been described. In cancer, this type of cell death has acquired great relevance. In vitro and in vivo experimental models support that radiotherapy and some chemotherapeutic drugs induce the immunogenic apoptosis of malignant cells. Dying cells express at cytoplasmic membrane or release several nuclear or intracytoplasmic molecules termed "danger signals" or damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs alert the organism and play a role inducing an efficient anti-tumor immune response. In this review, the importance of cell death by immunogenic apoptosis, the cytotoxic drugs that induce this type of cell death, the biologic role of some DAMPs and their participation in the activation of the antitumor immune response, in particular in the phagocytic cell, are indicated. The goal of this information should impact in improving the participation of the immune system in the recognition and efficient elimination of the residual tumor cells and to overcome the evasion mechanisms of tumor cells. This knowledge should lead to a better control of the growth of tumors with a concomitant reduction in the tumor recurrence. Also, an increase in the survival of the cancer patients or probably their definitive cure could be reached in the future.
