For patients, being diagnosed with cancer means being confronted with a life-threatening illness and can thus be considered a traumatic experience. This situation is compounded by the fact that having cancer is usually not an isolated event but is generally a long-term stressor. The aim of the present study was a) the assessment of psychotraumatic and comorbid distress in tumor patients both in the acute stage (T1) and over time (T2), b) the identification of possible protective factors, and c) the identification of risk factors for the development of a posttraumatic stress reaction (PTSR) following the diagnosis of a tumor. The sample consisted of 46 patients who had to undergo surgical treatment for a newly developed tumor for either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. The following psychosocial factors were examined: posttraumatic stress, dissociative reactions, anxiety, depression, cognitive-emotional distress, social support and processing the illness. More than 25 % of the patients demonstrated signs of a clinically relevant PTSR at the acute stage (T1) and almost 40 % did so four months later (T2). Significantly more women showed a PTSR at both points of measurement, but particularly at follow-up. No significant relationship could be found between the type of the tumor at T1 and the emergence of a PTSR at T2. Patients with PTSR at T2 showed higher scores for anxiety and depression. The most important predictors for the development of clinically relevant posttraumatic symptoms at the four-month follow-up examination were female sex, PTSR at T1 as well as elevated levels of depression. The results indicate the clinical relevance of psychotraumatic screening examinations in patients with acute cancer illnesses both for diagnostic as well as therapeutic investigations.
