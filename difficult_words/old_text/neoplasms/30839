Children may be targets of dietary intervention for the prevention of childhood cancer or to establish dietary habits that may prevent cancer later in life. With respect to the former, there are few etiology studies to suggest that diet plays a major role in the cause and prevention of childhood cancer. The nature of the association of diet and adult onset cancer suggests that long-term exposure is needed, and the limited dietary exposure of children may not provide sufficient opportunity for dietary carcinogenesis. Potentially more significant is the opportunity to prevent adult onset cancer by interventions begun at young ages. Studies document the need to improve the dietary knowledge and practices of young people. Evidence also is available that indicates the feasibility of achieving dietary improvement by school-based and other intervention models.
