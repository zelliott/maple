Urinary incontinence can have a major effect on quality of life, and may contribute to overall disability in patients with abdominal and pelvic malignancy. It can lead to isolation and depression, and delay rehabilitation and integration within family and society. With prompt assessment and correct management, urinary leakage can be controlled and many of the problems associated with urinary incontinence can be prevented to the patient's satisfaction. In oncological patients, this is best achieved in a multidisciplinary approach. This involves close co-operation between the oncologist, urologist, specialist nurses and individual patient, setting realistic expectations, guided by the patient's views and wishes. This paper reviews the management of urinary incontinence and its surgical treatment in the palliative setting.
