In 2003, the number of deaths due to malignant mesothelioma in Japan was 878; however, only 85 cases of mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure were authorized for compensation. The reasons for this discrepancy require evaluation.

We examined medical records, X-rays, and pathology results to evaluate mesothelioma cases in Japan between 2003 and 2005; used a questionnaire to identify occupational and environmental histories, and determined the concentration of asbestos fibers in pathology specimens.

We identified 442 definite cases of malignant mesothelioma with a median age of 68 years. There were 316 malignant mesothelioma cases with occupational asbestos exposure, 12 cases with neighborhood exposure and 5 cases with likely domestic exposure. Most (78%) of the 87 cases exceeded 1,000 asbestos particles per gram of dry lung tissue.

We conclude that 79.2% of cases of mesothelioma in Japan in recent years were caused by asbestos exposure.
