Nausea and vomiting occur in a majority of patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy despite prophylactic single agent antiemetic therapy. Three potent antiemetics, metoclopramide, droperidol and dexamethasone, and diphenhydramine to prevent potential extrapyramidal reactions, were combined in prophylaxis of 67 patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy. Of the patients studied, 76.1% experienced complete protection from both nausea and vomiting in their first course and 62.7% in all their courses of treatment. In 73.3% of 161 evaluable courses, there was neither nausea nor vomiting. Vomiting did not occur in 79.5% of courses. There was no evidence to suggest tachyphylaxis. The efficacy in preventing nausea and vomiting was independent of primary disease site, age, sex, performance status, prior chemotherapy, and prior vomiting. Toxicities were mild and infrequent. Reversible transient extrapyramidal reactions, sweating or twitches occurred in 5.6% of courses. The combination of metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, droperidol and dexamethasone was highly efficacious in preventing nausea and vomiting in moderate or high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy with little toxicity.
