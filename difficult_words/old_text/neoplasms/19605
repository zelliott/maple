Consumption of berries has been implicated with diverse health benefits, such as prevention of stroke, of age-related degenerative diseases and cancer. Some berry constituents have been proven to have cancer preventive actions on chemically induced tumors in vivo and cancer suppressive effects in in vitro studies. Many of these effects were attributed to certain berry phytochemicals with high antioxidative potential that could contribute to, or enhance by induction, the endogenous antioxidant properties of living cells or organisms. Producers and the consumers of berry products need more comprehensive and accurate information on the type and level of health benefits that can be expected from different products. The choice of the chemical or biological test that best predicts specific health benefits of berries is crucial to provide targets for berry breeding programmes or to improve processing methods. The aim of this review is to examine the chemical and biological tests developed to characterize the impact of berries on consumer health.
