As part of our series featuring reviews from the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, this paper reports the key findings of a systematic review carried out by Devine and Westlake (1995) investigating the impact of programmes designed to improve the psychological and physical well-being of patients with cancer. Overall, the researchers suggest such programmes are beneficial for patients and nurses should be encouraged to support these interventions.
