Of the various prognostic factors for cancer, biological parameters of the Host/Tumour relationship allow objective evaluation of the conflict between the organism and the disease. Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Orosomucoïd), which belongs to the Acute Phase Reactant's Proteins, and prealbumin, a highly sensitive nutritional protein, are two compounds whose blood levels vary in inverse proportion during perceptible-stage cancers: alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations increase while prealbumin values drop. The ratio of the blood levels of these two parameters provides a more sensitive index than either parameter taken alone. Study of the orosomucoïd/prealbumin ratio (ROP) in a population of 132 patients and 63 controls revealed a good association between the ratio values and the different stages of the disease. The highest values corresponded to patients with active disease; normal levels were obtained for patients in partial or complete remission. During the course of disease, the orosomucoïd/prealbumin ratio is more reliable than the sedimentation rate. Furthermore, when measured at the onset of the disease, this ratio is an undeniable prognostic element, independent of the stage of disease extension.
