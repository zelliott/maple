The study of phenomena occurring in the tumor microenvironment is a challenging task because of technical difficulties, particularly when dealing with hypocellular specimens. Laser scanning cytometry (LSC) is a new laboratory technology that has been recently introduced to overcome the limitations of other traditional technologies. By combining the properties and the advantages of flow cytometry (FC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), LSC allows the investigator to obtain objective information on DNA content, protein expression and cellular localization is combination with morphological features. It has been already shown that LSC results are reliable compared to more traditional technologies, and its implementation in the clinical routine is under way. Its use in oncology, which is rapidly expanding, spans from apoptosis analysis to DNA content quantitation and tumor cell phenotyping. Here we describe the technology underlying this novel fluorescence-based device, review its use in oncology by dissecting the phenomena occurring in the tumor microenvironment and propose its application for the immunological follow-up of malignant lesions undergoing immunotherapeutic manipulation.
