There is currently considerable effort to incorporate both diagnostic and therapeutic functions into a single nanoscale system for the more effective treatment of cancer. Nanoparticles have great potential to achieve such dual functions, particularly if more than one type of nanostructure can be incorporated in a nanoassembly, referred to in this review as a hybrid nanoparticle. Here we review recent developments in the synthesis and evaluation of such hybrid nanoparticles based on two design strategies (barge vs. tanker), in which liposomal, micellar, porous silica, polymeric, viral, noble metal, and nanotube systems are incorporated either within (barge) or at the surface of (tanker) a nanoparticle. We highlight the design factors that should be considered to obtain effective nanodevices for cancer detection and treatment.
