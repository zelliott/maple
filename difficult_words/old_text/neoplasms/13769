Lactate dehydrogenase (LD) activities are measured by the Japanese Society of Clinical Chemistry (JSCC) recommendation method (lactate to pyruvate direction). LD exists in a tetrameric form by the combination of M(A) and H(B) subunits. The quantitative distribution of the LD isozymes is different and characteristic. Therefore, LD activities and isozyme patterns are applied to laboratory diagnosis. However, the serum LD isozyme pattern is often modified by the differing elimination rates of each isozyme, and is sometimes modified by various other factors, such as LD-immunoglobulin complex, genetic variants, or tumor producing LD.
