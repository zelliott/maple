The T-box transcription factor Tbx3 plays multiple roles in normal development and disease. In order to function in different tissues and on different target genes, Tbx3 binds transcription factors or other cofactors specific to temporal or spatial locations. Examining the development of the mammary gland, limbs, and heart as well as the biology of stem cells and cancer provides insights into the diverse and common functions that Tbx3 can perform. By either repressing or activating transcription of target genes in a context-dependent manner, Tbx3 is able to modulate differentiation of immature progenitor cells, control the rate of cell proliferation, and mediate cellular signaling pathways. Because the direct regulators of these cellular processes are highly context-dependent, it is essential that Tbx3 has the flexibility to regulate transcription of a large group of targets, but only become a active on a small cohort of them at any given time or place. Moreover, Tbx3 must be responsive to the variety of different upstream factors that are present in different tissues. Only by understanding the network of genes, proteins, and molecules with which Tbx3 interacts can we hope to understand the role that Tbx3 plays in normal development and how its aberrant expression can lead to disease. Because of its myriad functions in disparate developmental and disease contexts, Tbx3 is an ideal candidate for a systems-based approach to genetic function and interaction.
