2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that is produced inadvertently during the synthesis of some organochlorine compounds, such as the chlorinated phenoxy pesticides. It is biologically and ecologically persistent, with an estimated half-life of 7 years in humans. It possesses high acute toxicity in rodents and is a carcinogen, teratogen, and immunotoxin. In chronic bioassays for carcinogenicity, TCDD at a dose of 10 ng/kg/day increases the incidence of liver tumors in female rats, making it one of the most potent animal carcinogens ever tested. A recent study in humans has shown an increase in the incidence of respiratory tract tumors in workers in chlorinated phenoxy herbicide plants. Considerable controversy and uncertainty remain, however, concerning its carcinogenic potency in humans and the reliability of using animal data to predict human risks. It is generally accepted that most, if not all, of the effects of TCDD require its binding to the Ah receptor. In addition to its toxic effects, TCDD produces a number of biochemical effects, such as induction of CYP1A1, downregulation of binding activity of the estrogen and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, and changes in cytokine pathways. These effects suggest that the Ah receptor plays an important role in regulating the cell cycle. A number of structural analogs of TCDD, such as the polychlorinated dibenzofurans, also interact with the Ah receptor, and they produce the same spectrum of responses as TCDD in animal and cell models. The potency of these compounds is strongly correlated with their binding affinity to the Ah receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
