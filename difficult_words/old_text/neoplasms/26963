Cell invasion through the extracellular matrix (ECM) of connective tissue is an important biomechanical process, which plays a prominent role in tumor progression. The malignancy of tumors depends mainly on the capacity of cancer cells to migrate and metastasize. A prerequisite for metastasis is the invasion of cancer cells through connective tissue to targeted organs. Cellular stiffness and cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics have been proposed to affect the invasiveness of cancer cells. Here, this study investigated whether highly invasive cancer cells are capable of invading into dense 3D-ECMs with an average pore-size of 1.3 or 3.0 μm when phagocytized beads (2.7 and 4.5 μm diameter) increased their cellular stiffness and reduced their cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics compared to weakly invasive cancer cells. The phagocytized beads decreased the invasiveness of the α5β1(high) cancer cells into 3D-ECMs, whereas the invasiveness of the α5β1(low) cancer cells was not affected. The effect of phagocytized beads on the highly invasive α5β1(high) cells was abolished by specific knock-down of the α5 integrin subunit or addition of an anti-α5 integrin blocking antibody. Furthermore, the reduction of contractile forces using MLCK and ROCK inhibitors abolished the effect of phagocytized beads on the invasiveness of α5β1(high) cells. In addition, the cellular stiffness of α5β1(high) cells was increased after bead phagocytosis, whereas the bead phagocytosis did not alter the stiffness of α5β1(low) cells. Taken together, the α5β1 integrin dependent invasiveness was reduced after bead phagocytosis by altered biomechanical properties, suggesting that the α5β1(high) cells need an appropriate intermediate cellular stiffness to overcome the steric hindrance of 3D-ECMs, whereas the α5β1(low) cells were not affected by phagocytized beads.
