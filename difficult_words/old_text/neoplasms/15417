CANCER OF THE LIP: The primary lesion can be controlled by irradiation in approximately 80 per cent of cases. For lesions with metastases there is only about a 25 per cent chance of five-year arrest (irradiation of the primary lesion followed by excision of involved nodes). CANCER OF THE TONGUE: Lesions in the anterior two-thirds are controllable by irradiation in about 50 per cent of cases if the nodes are not involved; the salvage is only about 15 per cent if the nodes are involved (nodes treated surgically). Lesions in the posterior third of the tongue are seldom controlled in the author's experience. CANCER OF THE EAR (AURICLE): Five-year arrest of basal-cell lesions should be attained by irradiation in about 80 per cent of cases; of squamous-cell lesions in about 60 per cent. If the lesion is extensive, radiation does not offer a superior cosmetic result to operation and entails danger of late chondronecrosis. Therefore extensive lesions are probably best treated surgically. In either event, it appears probable that results of irradiation can be improved by the use of more adequate fields and greater fractionation.
