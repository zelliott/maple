The delivery of quality care for adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer and survivors requires an understanding of the unique qualities of this group--the shared norms, attitudes, and beliefs that determine their behavior as well as the unique stresses they face on a day-to-day basis. All AYAs have typical concerns about being comfortable with who they are and who they want to become (identity development, including sexual identity), their bodies (body image), initiating intimate and emotional relationships, separating from parents, and making independent decisions about future goals such as career, higher education, and/or family (autonomy). Yet efforts of AYA patients with cancer and survivors to mature are often confounded by restrictions and limitations placed on them by their disease and treatment. This article promotes understanding of psychosocial challenges faced by AYAs when diagnosed with and treated for cancer. It reviews evidence-based psychosocial support interventions for AYAs with cancer and other life-threatening or chronic diseases, particularly the positive effects of peer support, technology-based interventions, and skill-based interventions. The article concludes with recommendations for clinical care that are intended to promote the ability of AYAs to cope with cancer.
