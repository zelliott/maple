The discovery that the transforming activity of oncogenic Ras depends upon its post-translational farnesylation has led to the development of farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs). FTIs inhibit the growth of ras-transformed cells in vitro and induce tumor regression in Ras-dependent tumors. Currently, FTIs are undergoing clinical trials in various solid or hematological malignancies. In this review, we will summarize our current knowledge on cellular effect and molecular mechanism of FTIs. We will then describe recent clinical trials and propose some clues for their interpretation. Based on pre-clinical findings, we will emphasize on the optimal use of FTIs in anti-cancer strategy and lastly, we will insist on the interest of combining FTIs with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other targeted agents.
