To investigate the effect and safety of zoledronic acid (Zoledex) in patients with cancer-induced hypercalcemia.

Seventeen patients with cancer-induced hypercalcemia (corrected blood calcium &gt; 2.70 mmol/L) were treated intravenously by 4 mg zoledex within 15 minutes on the first day. The corrected blood calcium was observed every 4 days in the following 28 days.

The response rate was 94.1% (16/17). The mean corrected blood calcium became normal after the first dose of zoledex (P &lt; 0.01). The lowest value was found on the fourteenth day after treatment. The main side effects consisted of fever (29.4%, 5/17), hypocalcemic tetany (11.8%, 2/17) and arythmia (5.9%, 1/17).

Zoledex is effective and safe in the treatment of patient with cancer-induced hypercalcemia.
