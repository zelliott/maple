Polydermatomyositis is a chronic, non-suppurative disease of the striated muscle. In practice, the diagnostic criteria are often associated with other factors--alcoholism, corticotherapy--which, by themselves, may induce myopathy. In adults, the possible association of dermatomyositis with cancer rises the problem of scanning for neoplasia at regular intervals. In addition to corticotherapy, physical therapy helps the patient to maintain maximal autonomy.
