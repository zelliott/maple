To report a study protocol to explore the experience of cancer screening from the perspective of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong

Cancer is a major health problem, but screening can be effective in decreasing the incidence and mortality rates. Providing information on how to participate in recommended preventive measures and on accessibility to these services is a crucial step in promoting healthy behaviour. Ethnic minorities in Western countries are found to be less likely to use preventive services and encounter more barriers in doing so than the general population.

A mixed-method design with two phases has been chosen to meet the aims and objectives of the study, with Phase 1 using a self-reported survey and Phase 2 involving focus-group interviews.

A convenience sample of 1540 South Asians (770 in each gender) will be recruited from community centres for the Phase 1 survey in 2013-2014, of whom 72-96 will be invited to participate in the Phase 2 interviews. The Survey and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee of the local university approved the study in March 2012.

The findings will provide detailed information on the use of cancer screening and the barriers that this minority population faces in Hong Kong. The findings will inform the government and policy-makers on the implementation of culture-specific interventions, so as to increase the screening uptake rate of this ethnic minority.
