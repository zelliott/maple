Whole-body hyperthermia at moderate temperatures (40.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C) is currently being investigated to assess its effectiveness as an adjuvant to other cancer therapies. At our institution, the whole-body heating is achieved by a combination of hot air circulation and rf inductive heating at 27.1 MHz. This paper reports the results of a study of the thermal energy deposition pattern associated with the rf applicator. The applicator consists of a single loop of nearly elliptical shape with dimensions 20 x 46 cm. The loop is embedded in a mattress and is fed by lead wires entering the side of the mattress. Temperature mapping in a heated gelatin phantom placed just above the rf loop showed maximum heating near the lead wires and a cool region above the center of the loop. Calculations of the magnetically induced and capacitive contributions to the electric field near the applicator indicate that the heating near the lead wires is largely capacitive in nature. This feature of the rf heating is of interest because capacitive fields result in preferential heating of fatty tissues. Further calculations showed that the capacitive heating contribution falls away much more rapidly than the induced field contribution with increasing distance from the plane of the rf loop.
