The detection of high activities of two sex-steroid biosynthetic enzymes-aromatase and 5-alpha-reductase-in pancreatic carcinoma tissue suggested the possibility that these enzymes may influence the circulating concentrations of sex-steroid hormones. Mean serum testosterone concentrations in 22 men and women with exocrine carcinoma of the pancreas were significantly lower than those in 20 healthy controls and 27 patients with other known malignancies, who were of similar age and sex composition. Low serum testosterone concentrations may be due to uptake by and metabolism within the tumour; alternatively, patients with low androgen concentrations may be at greater risk of developing pancreatic carcinoma.
