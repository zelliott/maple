High density lipoprotein (HDL) plays an important role as an anti-atherogenic molecule, but also possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties. The effect of extremely low levels of HDL on the risk of sepsis and malignancy were therefore examined.

A retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized at the Edith Wolfson Medical center was conducted. Patients were divided into Group 1: 108 patients with serum HDL levels &lt; or =20 mg/dl. Group 2: 96 patients with serum HDL levels &gt; or =65 mg/dl. Medical history and laboratory data was recorded.

The mean HDL levels in Group 1 were 16.1 +/- 33 mg/dl compared to 74.9 +/- 12.6 mg/dl in Group 2. Using a multivariate logistic regression analysis, low HDL was inversely associated with death (OR 0.96, 95% 0.93-0.99, P = 0.02), 3.98 fold increase in odds of fever (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.3-11.8, P = 0.01), and 6.7-fold increase in the risk of cancer (OR 6.68, 95% CI 1.8-24.5, P = 0.004). HDL serum levels were inversely associated with sepsis. For each 1 mg/dl increase in HDL, a relative 11% decrease in odds of sepsis was observed (OR 0.886, 95% CI 0.8-0.976, P = 0.01).

Extremely low serum HDL levels (&lt; or =20 mg/dl) are associated with an increased risk of death, sepsis and malignancy.
