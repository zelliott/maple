PD-1 is a receptor inducibly expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells following activation. PD-1-deficient mice develop signs of autoimmunity, suggesting a negative regulatory role for PD-1 in dampening lymphocyte responses. The expression of one ligand for PD-1, designated PD-L1 or B7-H1, on tumor cells of a variety of histologies has suggested a potential mechanism for tumor escape from immune destruction. This review summarizes data regarding PD-1 and related negative regulatory receptors, focusing on implications for potentiating antitumor immunity in vivo.
