Various types/sources of interferons were tested for their ability to modulate the (cytotoxic) activity of natural killer (NK) cells in different effector cells (human peripheral blood lymphocytes) and target cells (K 562 or PC 9) ratios and the concentration of IFN. NK activity was examined by two methods: IFN and lymphocytes were added in the assay system directly or were precultured before assay. NK activity increased with the dosage of IFN in both experiments and reached a peak level at six to 12 hours preculture with every IFN. The augmenting effect of each interferon on NK activity was different even if the same unit of interferon was used for experiment. For the determination of optimal BRM dose of interferon, the measurement of NK activity provides the essential tool.
