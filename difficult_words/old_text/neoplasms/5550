Measurement of urokinase receptor (uPAR) in tumor extracts has prognostic value, but assay of the soluble uPAR (suPAR) in peripheral blood may offer wider applications in cancer patient management. A tumor extract uPAR ELISA was modified to eliminate nonspecific plasma protein interference, enabling specific detection of suPAR in plasma and sera with &gt;90% recovery of added calibrator. suPAR concentrations in citrate plasma correlated with sera in 93 healthy blood donors (r = 0.84, P &lt;0.0001), with a median value for both of 1.2 microg/L. The plasma median for 19 advanced breast cancer patients was 2.9 microg/L suPAR, and a similar increase was found for 10 advanced colon cancer patients, consistent with release of suPAR from tumors into blood. Repetitive monitoring of suPAR in cancer patients' blood may have value in assessment of prognosis and tumor recurrence.
