Darbepoietin-alpha is a novel erythropoiesis-stimulating protein that may help address some of the unmet needs of anemia treatment in patients with cancer. Compared with recombinant human erythropoietin, darbepoietin-alpha has increased sialylated carbohydrate content, associated with a prolonged serum half-life and increased in vivo biologic activity. Data from trials in patients with cancer with a range of tumor types, whether receiving chemotherapy or not, indicate that darbepoietin-alpha is effective in alleviating anemia when dosed at intervals of once every 1, 2, or 3 weeks and may effect greater and more rapid responses than recombinant human erythropoietin. Health-related quality of life benefits have been observed with darbepoietin-alpha treatment, and in a study of patients with small-cell lung cancer, darbepoietin-alpha was associated with increased progression-free survival. Administration of darbepoietin-alpha at extended dosing intervals offers the possibility of enhanced patient convenience and compliance and a reduced burden on healthcare resources. Confirmation of improved response and response times with this novel therapy may enable patients with cancer to benefit more rapidly.
