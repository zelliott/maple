Vinyl chloride has been associated recently with findings of angiosarcoma in animals and man. The present study examines the mortality experience of individuals occupationally exposed to vinyl chloride and lesser amounts of vinylidene chloride and other compounds. Employees were grouped into four exposure categories according to the highest levels of vinyl chloride exposure experienced for at least one month. Although no angiosarcomas were found and there were no deaths due to any liver malignancy, the observed malignancy deaths exceeded the expected among workers in the high-exposure category. Fewer than expected malignancy deaths were observed in the remaining exposure catergories.
