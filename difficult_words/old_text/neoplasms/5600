HIV surveillance and screening programs were established at Khartoum Teaching Hospital (KTH) following the first identified HIV case diagnosed in a hemophiliac boy in November 1987. As of December 1995, 15 cases of symptomatic HIV infection have been observed in Sudanese children (&lt; or = 16 years) at KTH. An HIV seroprevalence rate of 35.7% was documented in a group of 28 patients (adults and children) with various congenital coagulation defects. The postulated mode of transmission was through contaminated factor concentrate. Screening of 52,000 volunteer male blood donors (March, 1987-1989) showed an HIV-seroprevalence rate of 0.05%. Selected groups, including 1118 children admitted to KTH during the period 1985-1995, were screened for HIV infection. These included aseptic meningitis/encephalitis group (n = 52), high-risk group (n = 523), children with various chronic and malignant diseases (n = 181), and chronic blood recipients (n = 330). A group of 32 displaced homeless children who survived on the streets were also included. Overall, an HIV seroprevalence rate of 1.2% was established. Among the 15 children with symptomatic HIV infection, tuberculosis accounted for the majority of admissions (33.3%) followed by admission for recurrent infections (20.0%). Of the 13 children with nonparental mode of HIV transmission, a vertical mode was documented in 61.5%. The pattern of HIV infection in Greater Khartoum is similar to that in North Africa and the Middle East. However, the geographic influence of high endemicity in neighboring sub-Saharan countries might change it in the future.
