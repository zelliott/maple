Glutamine is a nonessential amino acid contained in most dietary proteins and provides immune functions and fuel for the small intestine. For healthy people, dietary glutamine (from protein) usually is considered adequate. Results of research evaluating the potential benefits of glutamine during cancer therapy are encouraging but remain inconclusive. Some researchers have suggested recently that glutamine may, in fact, be a conditionally essential amino acid (Buchman, 2001). Decreases in glutamine levels after trauma or major burns, postoperatively, and in patients with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, AIDS, and cancer are widely recognized and acknowledged (Medina, 2001; Miller, 1999). The interpretation of data suggesting that glutamine supplementation is of benefit in almost any clinical situation is controversial. Additional research is needed to confirm the mechanism of action and efficacy of glutamine as adjuvant therapy in patients receiving cancer treatment.
