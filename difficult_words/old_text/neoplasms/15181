To study mutagen-induced chromosome instability in cancer disposition, late S and G2 lymphocytes of 15 patients with common variable immunodeficiency and 14 healthy controls were exposed to bleomycin in vitro. The groups did not differ in the frequency of spontaneous chromosome aberrations. In bleomycin-treated samples we found higher numbers of break events per cell and increased frequency of cells with aberrations compared to the control group. A slightly reduced breakage of chromosome group D was noted in patients. These results support the hypothesis that a higher incidence of cancer in patients with genetically determined immunodeficiencies may be explained by an increased mutagen-induced chromosome instability in at least some of them.
