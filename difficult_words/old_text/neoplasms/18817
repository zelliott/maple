Sophoridine (1), a natural anticancer drug, has been used in China for decades. A series of novel N-substituted sophoridinic acid derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxicity with 1 as the lead. The structure-activity relationship indicated that introduction of an aliphatic acyl on the nitrogen atom might significantly enhance the anticancer activity. Among the compounds, 6b bearing bromoacetyl side-chain afforded a potential effect against four human tumor cell lines (liver, colon, breast, and lung). The mechanism of action of 6b is to inhibit the activity of DNA topoisomerase I, followed by the S-phase arrest and then cause apoptotic cell death, similar to that of its parent 1. We consider 6b promising for further anticancer investigation.
