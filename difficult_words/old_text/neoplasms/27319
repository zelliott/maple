Intensive treatment regimes that are known to have a potential risk of infertility sometimes have to be given to boys who have aggressive malignant disease. Long-term care must therefore include further discussion of these patients' impaired fertility. This study describes the results of a series of semi-structured interviews with 15 young male cancer survivors regarding their experience of receiving feedback on their probable fertility status. All the interviews were conducted by a psychologist formerly uninvolved with their treatment. The interviews were analysed qualitatively using a grounded theory approach. The findings of the study are organised under four headings: (a) Emotional reaction to news of probable infertility. (b) Coping style adopted. (c) Response to the offer of semen analysis. (d) Implications for clinical practice.The results of this thematic analysis are compared to the wider research literature in oncology and health psychology.
