Isopycnic density floatation centrifugation has been proven to be a suitable technique to enrich bone marrow aspirates for clonogenic cells on a small scale. We have tested a Haemonetics semicontinuous blood cell separator in order to process large volumes of bone marrow with minimal bone marrow manipulation. The efficacy of isopycnic density floatation was tested in a one and a two-step procedure. Both procedures showed a recovery of about 20% of the nucleated cells and 1-2% of the erythrocytes. The enrichment of clonogenic cells in the one-step procedure appeared superior to the two-step enrichment, first separating buffy coat cells. The recovery of clonogenic cells was 70 and 50%, respectively. Repopulation capacity of the low-density cell fraction containing the clonogenic cells was excellent after autologous reinfusion (6 cases) and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (3 cases). Fast enrichment of large volumes of bone marrow aspirates with low-density cells containing the clonogenic cells by isopycnic density floatation centrifugation can be done safely using a Haemonetics blood cell separator.
