BAG-1 is a multifunctional protein that exists as several differentially localised and functionally distinct isoforms. BAG-1 isoforms interact with a diverse array of molecular targets and regulate a wide range of cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, transcription, apoptosis, metastasis and motility. The BAG domain of BAG-1 interacts with chaperone molecules and this is considered important for many BAG-1 functions. The ability of BAG-1 to regulate such a wide variety of cellular processes suggests it might play an important role in many cancer types. For example, regulation of nuclear hormone receptor function and susceptibility to apoptosis might have a major impact on cancer development, progression and response to therapy. There is also increasing evidence that BAG-1 expression is altered in a variety of human malignancies relative to normal cells, and with further understanding of BAG-1 function it might become a powerful prognostic/predictive marker in human cancer. This review describes the structure and function of BAG-1 isoforms and the potential clinical implications of their expression in tumour cells.
