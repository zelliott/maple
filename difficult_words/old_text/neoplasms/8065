Colorectal cancer accounts for more than 10% of all cancer deaths but is curable, if detected early. We reported previously on a stool-based screening test in which DNA from stool samples is subjected to genome analysis; sensitivity of the test has been limited in part by inefficiency of retrieving DNA from stool. Our aim was to test the impact of a new purification method that would increase the yield of human DNA from stool. DNA from 86 cancer and 100 non-cancer subjects (diagnosed by colonoscopy) were purified from stool with a new method for DNA recovery based on sequence-specific capture with acrylamide gel immobilized capture probes as well as with a previously developed magnetic bead-capture procedure. The new purification method gives an average 5.4-fold increase in the quantity of human DNA that can routinely be retrieved from fecal samples. The increased recovery of DNA corresponds with an increase in assay sensitivity from 53% (CI: 42 to 64%) to 70% (CI: 59 to 79%); P = 0.0005 (by McNemar's test), with no change in specificity. The newly developed sample preparation method mitigates a major problem in detecting rare cancer-associated genetic changes in heterogeneous clinical samples such as stool.
