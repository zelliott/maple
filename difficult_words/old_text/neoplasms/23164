Colloidal inorganic nanocrystals are abound with magnetic, luminescent and plasmonic properties that are attractive for medical diagnostics and therapy. Our group, among others, have been interested in conferring nanocrystals, by design, with new capabilities that are not possible with conventional materials approaches. Two areas where the fruits of these efforts are paying dividends are in their implementation as in vivo imaging probes and as biosensors that dynamically respond to the local chemical or physical environment in cells and tissues. For applications in medical imaging, nanocrystal probes with unusual shapes are showing exceptional promise over existing technologies, while for environment-responsive probes, a hybrid approach involving tailored organic coatings is being implemented alongside the nanocrystals for the realization of dynamic, information-rich optical outputs.
