Chemosensitivity test is useful in evaluating the appropriate cancer chemotherapy for solid tumors which are less sensitive to conventionally available antitumor agents. Most of assays used in clinics are in vitro assay, in which the cutoff concentration and contact time should be determined to mimic the clinical response of the chemosensitivity test. Since the antitumor effect of most of antitumor agents depends on their concentration x contact time, and the contact time will be determined according to the assay, the cutoff concentration will be calculated from the cumulative efficacy curve or 50% inhibitory concentration and in vivo response of human tumor xenografts in nude mouse. The clinical result obtained from chemosensitivity test was discussed.
