Pediatric HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a pandemic predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. Approximately 2.2 million children aged less than 15 years are infected with HIV, representing almost 95% of the total number of children globally infected with HIV. Therefore, increasing numbers of HIVi or -exposed but uninfected children can be expected to require a surgical procedure to assist in the diagnosis of an HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related complication, to address a life-threatening complication of the disease, or for routine surgery encountered in HIV-unexposed children. HIVi children may present with both conditions unique to HIV infection and surgical conditions routine in pediatric surgical practice. HIV exposure confers an increased risk of complications and mortality for all children after surgery, whether they are HIV infected or not. This risk of complications is higher in the HIVi group of patients. These findings seem to be independent of whether patients undergo an elective or emergency procedure, but the risk of an adverse outcome is higher for a major procedure. Surgical implications of HIV infection are comprehensively reviewed in this article.
