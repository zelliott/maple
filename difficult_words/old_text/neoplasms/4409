Health care facility design must incorporate four key elements: Strategy, Assessment, Flexibility, and Efficiency.

They respect the integrated nature of functional operations by clustering them in ways that permit growth or consolidation. In the rapidly changing health care environment, flexibility is fundamental to successful design.
