This study determined whether there are significant differences in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer among Palestinians with respect to different demographic variables using secondary data from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. Living in the Gaza Strip was a protective factor, with this group being 21% less likely to have diabetes, 35% less likely to have hypertension, and 48% less likely to have CVD than those living in the West Bank. No significant difference was found for cancer. Being a refugee was a significant risk factor for diabetes and CVD while being married/engaged or divorced/ separated/widowed was a risk factor for diabetes and hypertension. Gender was a risk factor for hypertension with females being 60% more likely to have hypertension than males. Living in a rural setting was protective against hypertension. As expected, age was a risk factor for diabetes, hypertension and CVD; the magnitude of this increased risk was alarming, 36 to 434 times greater in those aged 40-65 years compared with those aged 0-19 years.
