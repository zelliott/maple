The authors conducted the first long-range study to demonstrate possible negative effects on the recipients of corneal transplantation from donors who had died of a systemic malignancy or of chronic neurologic disease. The results are reported of a long-term retrospective analysis of 73 patients who received 86 grafts from donors with various systemic malignancies. These patients were followed for a mean of 127 months. There was no evidence of the transfer of the same malignancy to any of the recipients. There was no increased incidence of malignancy or earlier mortality in our patient population when compared with a reference population. Graft infection, endophthalmitis, or local tumor growth was not observed. The authors state that at the present time there is no basis for excluding donors dying of systemic malignancy as a source of material for use in keratoplasty. The authors examined the case histories of six patients who received grafts from donors who had died of a neurological disease with a suspected viral etiology. In a follow-up period ranging from 120 to 174 months, no evidence of neurologic disease developed in any of the patients. The sample was too small to provide data necessary for drawing conclusions concerning the safety of the use of material from this source. The authors strongly advise excluding any patient with a neurologic disease of suspected viral etiology as a source of corneal donor material.
