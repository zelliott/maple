We report the morphological and clinical results in a series of patients with advanced thoracopulmonary, abdominal, pelvic and lower limb tumors treated with stop-flow perfusion (SFP).

We performed 77 SFPs with the percutaneous angiographic technique in 55 patients (25 women and 30 men; mean age: 53 years). Eighteen thoracic perfusions with aortocaval block (ASI) were performed in 11 patients, 33 abdominal hypoxic perfusions (HAP) in 26 patients, 17 hypoxic pelvic perfusion (HPP) in 11 patients and 9 hypoxic lower limb perfusions (HILP) in 7 patients. 42/77 procedures were followed by hemofiltration.

No technical complications were observed. Twenty-eight patients in our series are still alive (mean follow-up: 14 months) and 23 have died (mean survival: 8 months), 20/23 of them (87%) for disease progression. Three of 77 patients (3.8%) died within 7 days of the procedure (2 AS, 1 HAP). At CT or MR follow-up, responses &gt; 50% were observed in 56% of the procedures and clinical CR was achieved in 53/77 patients (69%). In the subgroups classified by procedure, positive responses were observed in 56, 48, 59 and 78%, respectively for ASI, HAP, HPP and HLP. Clinical CR was observed in 67, 67, 71 and 78%, respectively. The death rate for disease progression relative to the overall death rate was 100, 86, 75 and 100%. Hematologic toxicity according to WHO criteria (mean: 2) was observed in 77% of the whole of procedures (59/77). Statistical analysis showed no relationship between morphological responses and type of antiblastic drug or previous antiblastic treatments.

SF procedures permit the effective control of many advanced tumors which cannot be treated otherwise, with a high rate of positive morphological and of complete clinical responses. The best results were obtained in hypoxic perfusion of the lower limb. The results were not correlated with previous antiblastic treatments. However, the high rate of sequels and the low hematologic tolerance of those procedures must be emphasized.
