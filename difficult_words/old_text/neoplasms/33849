An occupational epidemiological study was organised among workers in an acrylonitrile using factory in Hungary. Of the 888 workers, 783 were included in the study and three groups were differentiated: Group A (N = 452) with direct and continuous exposure, Group B (N = 171) with direct but occasional exposure and Group C (N = 160) without direct exposure, as referent. There were two main objectives: to determine the occurrence of cancer in workers and congenital abnormalities in their liveborn infants. The study did not indicate a higher occurrence of cancer among workers: only one lung cancer patient was found, prostate cancer did not occur. Among congenital abnormalities, the group of specified multiple congenital abnormalities showed a higher rate than expected but characteristic defect-pattern was not found among seven multimalformed babies, though five had cardiovascular malformations. In conclusion, our study did not indicate the carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic effect of acrylonitrile among workers using this chemical in the factory.
