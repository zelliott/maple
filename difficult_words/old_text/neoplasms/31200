A substantial proportion of mortality in the United States can be attributed to three major behaviors: using tobacco, maintaining an unhealthy diet, and being physically inactive. Using data from the South Carolina mortality files and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System we were able to document state trends in mortality, cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy dietary practices. We found that, in spite of the declines in heart disease and stroke mortality noted nationally and in the state, the risk factor profiles for most women in South Carolina did not improve. This analysis further suggests that physical inactivity and dietary issues (excess caloric intake, low fruit and vegetable consumption) would be good choices for lifestyle interventions among women in South Carolina, not only because they ultimately affect mortality, but also because they exert interim effects on morbidity, including physical functioning and independence.
