To update the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Technology Assessment guidelines on chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance assays (CSRAs) published in 2004.

An Update Working Group reviewed data published between December 1, 2003, and May 31, 2010. MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were searched. The literature search yielded 11,313 new articles. The limits for "human and English" were used, and then standard ASCO search strings for randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, guidelines, and reviews were added, yielding 1,298 articles for abstract review. Of these, only 21 articles met predefined inclusion criteria and underwent full text review, and five reports of randomized controlled trials were included for data extraction.

Review of the literature does not identify any CSRAs for which the evidence base is sufficient to support use in oncology practice.

The use of CSRAs to select chemotherapeutic agents for individual patients is not recommended outside of the clinical trial setting. Oncologists should make chemotherapy treatment recommendations based on published reports of clinical trials and a patient's health status and treatment preferences. Because the in vitro analytic strategy has potential importance, participation in clinical trials evaluating these technologies remains a priority.
