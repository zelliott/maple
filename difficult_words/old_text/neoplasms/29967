The monoclonal antibody UJ13A was raised following immunization of mice with human foetal brain and subsequent somatic cell hyridization of spleen cells with the mouse myeloma cell line P3-X63-AG8-653. The antibody is of the IgG1 subclass and has been shown by indirect immunofluorescence studies on normal foetal, paediatric and adult tissues to selectively bind to most tissues of neuroectodermal origin. Many tumours of neural origin also express the UJ13A antigen and the reagent can be used to distinguish primary intracranial neural tumours from secondary carcinomas and lymphomas. UJ13A is also useful as one of a panel of reagents employed for the identification of metastatic spread of neuroblastoma cells to bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid. Knowledge of the full spectrum of normal and malignant tissues binding UJ13A suggests that the antibody may have a role in the radioimmunolocalization of neuronal tumours such as neuroblastoma.
