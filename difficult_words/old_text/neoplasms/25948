Based upon in vitro and animal studies, a number of Phase I and II clinical trials have been initiated to test whether bispecific antibodies could redirect immune effectors against tumor cells in cancer patients. Recently, results from those trials showed beneficial effects in some patients but it is clear many problems remain to be solved. In addition, molecular engineering approaches are providing new and improved sources of clinically relevant bispecific antibodies.
