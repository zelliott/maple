The cancer occurrence in relatives (N = 407) of 40 case probands (who had leukemia and rearrangements at the same chromosomal location as at least one of 23 recognized rare [heritable] autosomal fragile sites [Sutherland and Mattei 1987]) was compared both to cancer occurrence in relatives (N = 390) of 40 control probands (who had leukemia or other hematologic illness but no recognized chromosomal rearrangements) and to cancer incidence in the general population of the United States. Fragile-site carrier status was not determined in case or control probands. No significant excess of cancer in case relatives, compared with either control relatives or to general (SEER) population expectancies, was found. Furthermore, there was neither evidence of cancer at younger ages, when cases were compared with control relatives, nor an excess of cancer at multiple sites. Male relatives of cases did, however, show a small excess of cancer, especially in older age groups. There was a slight, but not statistically significant, excess of lung cancer in case relatives, with this deviation occurring almost exclusively in relatives of probands having rearrangements at 11q23 and having lymphoid leukemia. It is possible that heritable tendency to chromosomal rearrangement--and thus to cancer--is expressed in such a small proportion of family members that cancer excess in these families could not be detected with the numbers of relatives analyzed in this study, although there was no significant evidence for a hereditary predisposition to cancer in the families of probands with leukemia and with chromosomal rearrangements at the same apparent chromosomal location as rare fragile sites.
