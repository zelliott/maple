For prophylaxis of cancer and treatment of manifest cancer Morerman recommends as the basis of his therapy a lactovegetable diet and, in addition, the '8 essential substances': vitamins A, B, C and E, iodine, sulfur, iron and citric acid. At a later stage he also recommends supplementary vitamin D and selenium. The most important aspect is the change in dietary habits required by the diet prescribed by Moerman and the ingestion of the '8 essential substances' in the form of conventional preparations. The daily cost of treatment of a prostatic cancer, for instance, ranges from about Fr. 3.- to Fr. 6.-. Side effects are not mentioned. The diet and therapy were developed by the Dutch physician Dr Moerman (1893-1988) as long ago as the 1930s. The promoters are the iridiologist J. Landman, the nutritional consultant E. Wannee and the writer R. Jochems. All three have written a book on Moerman. In Switzerland, the Lifecare Association endeavours to disseminate this form of therapy. A chronic deficiency of the '8 essential substances' is said to lead to metabolic disturbances, structural and behavioural anomalies of the regeneration tissue and alkalosis, which is claimed to be a fertile soil for the 'symbionts' that can transform healthy cells into cancer cells. Moerman came to this conclusion on the basis of his observations of pigeons. By means of a lactovegetable diet and substitution of the '8 essential substances', this metabolic disorder is said to be reversible, thus robbing the 'symbionts' of their growth medium. The results of the experiments with pigeons have, as far as we know, never been published.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
