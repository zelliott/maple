An interactive program for prescribing radiotherapy treatments has been developed with the aim of improving radiation dose accuracy by preventing mistakes in quantitative data handling and calculations. The program also aims to decrease the time required to prescribe treatments and check the calculations. The interactive dialogue closely follows present, manual methods of prescription. The program provides a comprehensive choice of treatment options which either individually or in combination cover all the treatments carried out on the Cobalt units for which the program was designed. Each of the treatment options has been highly optimized to reduce the amount of data entered and for ease of use. The program allows changes to the prescription at time of entry and during the treatment course. The treatment sheet and patient record resulting from the interactive dialogue are discussed and compared with the existing system. The modular program structure is described and some of the results from use of the program are discussed. Possible future improvements are outlined.
