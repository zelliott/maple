The immunosuppressive properties of cyclophosphamide prevent formation of anti-DNA antibodies and prolong lifespans in autoimmune NZB/NZW mice, an animal model of systemic lupus erythematosus. In the current study, NZB/NZW mice were treated with weekly doses of cyclophosphamide to determine if intermittent pulses of the drug were effective therapy. Life-long treatment with cyclophosphamide, 56 mg/kg/week, was started at the mean age of 6 weeks; results were compared with saline-injected control mice. Pulse therapy with cyclophosphamide suppressed anti-DNA antibody levels, prevented severe glomerulonephritis and prolonged longevity. Seventeen of 19 treated mice developed neoplasms; 7 of these immunosuppressed animals had 2 to 4 separate neoplasms. Examination of earlier studies in this laboratory in which NZB/NZW mice were treated each day with cyclophosphamide showed that daily and weekly therapeutic regimens had similar immunosuppressive and oncogenic effects.
