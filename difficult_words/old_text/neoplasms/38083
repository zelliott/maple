Family caregivers of a loved one with advanced cancer are at risk for developing bereavement complications following the loss of the person they cared for. However, little research has studied caregiving and bereavement experiences as an ongoing process. This study was conducted with the aim of identifying the main elements constitutive of the experience of providing care and assistance to a patient with terminal cancer that influence the grieving process. This qualitative study, conducted among 18 family caregivers, led to the specification of six principal dimensions of the caregiving experience: characteristics of the family caregiver and of the patient, symptoms of the illness, the relational context, social and professional support, and circumstances surrounding the death. Among these dimensions, the constituent elements of the caregiving experience that might positively or negatively influence the grieving process were identified. This knowledge is useful for a more perspicuous identification of caregivers who might experience bereavement complications.
