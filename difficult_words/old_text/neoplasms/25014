DNA vaccines have emerged as an attractive approach to generate antigen-specific T-cell immune response. Nevertheless, the potency of DNA vaccines still needs to be improved for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we explored whether functional linkage of a Th1-polarizing chemokine, IP-10, to a model tumor antigen, human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7, enhanced DNA vaccine potency. IP-10 linkage changed the location of E7 from the nucleus to the endoplasmic reticulum and led to the secretion of functionally chemoattractive chimeric IP-10/E7 protein. In addition, this linkage drastically enhanced the endogenous processing of E7 antigen through MHC class I. More importantly, we found that C57BL/6 mice intradermally vaccinated with IP-10/E7 DNA exhibited a dramatic increase in the number of E7-specific CD4(+) Th1 T-cells and CD8(+) T-cells and, consequently, were strongly resistant over the long term to E7-expressing tumors compared to mice vaccinated with wild-type E7 DNA. Thus, because of the increase in tumor antigen-specific T-cell immune responses obtained through both enhanced antigen presentation and chemoattraction, vaccination with DNA encoding IP-10 linked to a tumor antigen holds great promise for treating tumors.
