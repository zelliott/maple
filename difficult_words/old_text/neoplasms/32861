A previous study of the MOD-MEM test showed promising results. We have attempted to repeat the study using a blind coded series of 210 blood samples from normal subjects and patients with either benign or malignant disease. Using standard criteria the false negative rate for cancer patients averaged 43% and the false positive rate for non-cancer patients averaged 34%. The results indicate that the test at the present time, under routine laboratory conditions, is not reliably reproducible and does not have the ability to effectively discriminate between benign and malignant disease. It is suggested that blind coded studies be used more frequently in assessment of tests with cancer detection potential.
