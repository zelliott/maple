Bioelectrical impedance-derived phase angle is a potentially sensible indicator of protein-energy malnutrition and of fat-free mass loss, frequent in patients with advanced cancer. We evaluated in 13 patients with advanced cancer some biochemical (serum albumin, lymphocyte count, cholesterol, cholinesterase) and clinical (Karnofsky index, Subjective Global Assessment, dietary inquiry) parameters and bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. In addition to albumin, cholinesterase, and the Karnofsky index, phase angle (R(2)=0.384, P=0.024) was found to be strictly related to survival time and can be therefore considered a prognostic tool in patients with advanced cancer.
