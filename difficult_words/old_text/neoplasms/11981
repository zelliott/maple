A new simplified system for updating a cancer registry has been developed in the Biostatistics Department of Roswell Park Memorial Institute. It was designed to serve the needs of maintaining a registry for a cooperative cancer research group. The Data-Update Procedure at a Remote Terminal (DUPART) system has general value for registry applications.
