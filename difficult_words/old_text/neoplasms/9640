Bispecific antibodies are unique in the sense that they can bind simultaneously two different antigens. This property enables the development of therapeutic strategies that are not possible with conventional monoclonal antibodies. The large panel of imaginative bispecific antibody formats that has been developed reflects the strong interest for these molecules. Although in many cases the manufacturing of clinical grade material remains challenging, several bispecific antibody formats are currently in clinical trials.
