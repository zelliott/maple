Percutaneous fine-needle biopsies guided by X-ray were performed in 100 patients utilizing the Nordenstr√∂m canula. All cases have now been clinically controlled for at least 14 and up to 30 months. The follow up allowed further conclusions due to the dignity of histologically negative biopsies. Positive results on malignant lesions were obtained in 74% of cases. Our experience revealed that negative aspiration biopsies should be considered false negative until they could be confirmed by further investigations.
