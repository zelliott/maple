Limited vascular access hinders administration of chemotherapy, blood products and antibiotics in cancer patients. Repeated venous cannulation is often psychologically traumatic to patients. The use of a subcutaneous infusion port allows convenient vascular access. Twenty-two cancer patients had ports implanted for venous access (17 patients) and administration of regional chemotherapy (5 patients). The period of indwelling ranged from 70 to 470 days (median 270 days). Two patients (9%) had wound dehiscence that required port revision. Despite this, the wound did not heal in 1 patient and the port had to be removed. Other complications included venous thrombosis (5%) and subcutaneous haematoma (5%). There was no catheter-related bacteraemia. The subcutaneous infusion port provides a suitable vascular access in cancer patients.
