Various ventricular functions, as obtained by echocardiography (M-mode), were measured on 14 patients with solid tumours receiving adriamycin (mean total dosage 330 +/- 188 mg/m2 body surface area), the results being compared with those on 14 normal subjects of similar ages. There were statistically highly significant differences between the two groups. In those receiving the drug there was (1) a decrease in the percentage shortening fraction and (2) a reduction in the maximal velocity of endocardial circumferential fibre shortening, as expression of reduced contractility. The abnormal filling was characterized by a marked decrease in maximal velocity of endocardial fibre stretch, diminution of diameter increase during the rapid filling phase, and a shortened duration of the rapid filling phase. There was no electrocardiographic or radiological evidence of myocardial damage. The findings suggest that it will be possible by serial echocardiography to recognize a higher tolerance to the drug in some individuals and, at the same time, reveal abnormal contractility and filling due to adriamycin before irreversible heart failure has occurred.
