The clinical usefulness of a newly developed ultrasound hyperthermia system was evaluated.

The hyperthermia system uses a modified planer transducer operated at frequencies of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 MHz. The transducer has a nonvibrating part at the center to reduce the central hot spot. Frequency sweeping technique is also used to eliminate the annular hot spot around the center. Thirty-eight tumors in 29 patients were examined in this study. In 35 tumors, hyperthermia was given in conjunction with irradiation and/or chemotherapy, and in the remaining 3 tumors, hyperthermia alone was given. In all, a total of 153 hyperthermia sessions were performed.

The number of hyperthermia sessions per tumor ranged from 1 to 7 (mean, 4.0 +/- 1.3). The number of intratumor thermometry points per session ranged from 1 to 8 (mean, 4.3 +/- 1.5). The average intratumor temperature for tumors with a maximum depth of &lt;3 cm, 3-6 cm, and &gt;6 cm was 42.1 +/- 1.2, 41.7 +/- 1.4, and 39.9 +/- 2.0 degrees C, respectively. The percentage of monitored intratumor points with temperature exceeding 42 degrees C was 56 +/- 31%, 43 +/- 34%, and 21 +/- 24%, respectively. Of the 30 evaluable tumors treated with combined irradiation, 12 showed complete response, 14 partial response, and 4 no change. Observed complications included pain at the treatment site in 13 of the 153 treatment sessions and vesicle formation in 3 of the 38 treatment sites. No serious complication was seen.

These results indicate that the newly developed ultrasound hyperthermia system is clinically useful for the treatment of localized superficial and subsurface tumors with a maximum tumor depth of no more than 6 cm.
