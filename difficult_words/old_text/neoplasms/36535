To evaluate clinical characteristics and functional outcome of malignant epidural spinal cord compression associated with a paravertebral mass.

Between 1987 and 1990, 136 patients with epidural spinal cord compression were treated with irradiation. Of these, 25 patients (18%) had epidural spinal cord compression associated with a paravertebral mass. This report is based on analysis of these 25 patients. Fourteen patients received 3000 cGy in 10 fractions. Seven received 4000 cGy in 16 fractions. Four received 2000 cGy in 5 fractions. Motor function was evaluated by five grades.

Lung cancer accounted for the majority of epidural spinal cord compression with a paravertebral mass (60%) followed by lymphoma (8%) and kidney tumor (8%). This pattern of epidural spinal cord compression has a longer duration of pain before developing neurologic symptoms and has a high propensity of the upper thoracic spine involvement by an apical lung cancers. The functional outcome of radiation treatment reveals a significant difference between moderately radiosensitive tumors (lung, prostate, cervix, esophagus) and very radiosensitive tumor (lymphoma). None of the nonambulatory patients became ambulatory following radiotherapy except for the very radiosensitive tumors. Higher doses of radiation treatment (4000 cGy in 16 fractions) did not improve functional outcome.

Due to the larger tumor burden, radiation treatment for epidural spinal cord compression associated with a paravertebral mass is not as effective as treatment of epidural spinal cord compression without a paravertebral mass except for the very radiosensitive tumor. Therefore, combined treatment modality might be beneficial for improving functional outcome.
