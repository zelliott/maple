It is established that application of the test-system "age-normal antibodies-leucocytes-lymphocytes" permits refusing in certain cases from the generally-accepted laboratory immunological tests and prognosticate their values depending on the test-system indices when using the regression models. The great incongruity of the predicted and real values of the concrete immunological index may be the manifestation of the risk factors associated with the oncological and other diseases.
