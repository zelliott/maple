To review the evidence that supplementation with dehydro-3-epiandrosterone (DHEA) is beneficial in aging, cardiovascular disease, immune function, and cancer.

English-language literature search using MEDLINE with subject headings DHEA, adrenal steroids, and androgens.

Although some randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have been conducted, most of the evidence supporting use of DHEA for any disease state is of poor quality and consists of case reports and case-control and open-label clinical trials.

Dehydro-3-epiandrosterone is available as a health food supplement and is touted as being beneficial for a variety of diseases. It might be beneficial for improving someone's sense of well-being; minor improvements in body composition have been noted for men only. No consistent relationship has been demonstrated between levels of DHEA and risk of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, or immune function. Insufficient evidence exists to support using DHEA for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. High levels of DHEA are associated with adverse effects, such as increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer at certain ages and reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Current enthusiasm for using DHEA as a panacea for aging, heart disease, and cancer is not supported by scientific evidence in the literature. Given the potentially serious adverse effects, using DHEA in the clinical setting should be restricted to well-designed clinical trials only.
