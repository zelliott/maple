In a single-center, case-control study the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of epoetin alfa in pediatric cancer patients receiving platinum- or nonplatinum-based chemotherapy. Thirty-seven patients with solid tumors received epoetin alfa 3 times weekly at a dose of 150 IU/kg (hemoglobin [Hb] &gt; or = 12 g/dL and &lt; or = 16 g/dL) or 300 IU/kg (Hb) &lt; 12 g/dL) for 28 weeks. Data from treated patients were compared to data from 37 untreated control patients. Significant between-group differences in favor of the epoetin alfa-treated Patients were observed in overall red blood cell transfusion requirements (p = .007) and overall platelet transfusion requirements (p = .010). Additionally, significant between-group differences favoring epoetin alfa were seen by Kaplan-Meier plots, estimating mean time to first red blood cell transfusion (p = .0004). Mean Hb (g/dL) was maintained at baseline levels in the epoetin alfa group for most of the course of the study. No drug-related adverse events were seen in epoetin alfa-treated patients.
