Cytological diagnosis of malignant cells in effusions is hampered by difficulties in the differentiation from reactive mesothelial cells. Because interphase cytogenetics by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) might complement cytological evaluation, we determined the power of tumor cell detection using FISH and cytology in 201 effusions from patients with advanced cancer. Furthermore, 9 primary breast tumors were FISH-karyotyped, and chromosomal aberrations were compared with those of corresponding metastatic effusion cells. By using centromeric probes representing chromosomes 7, 8, 11, 12, 17, and 18, a rate of malignancy-associated aneusomy combined for the 6 chromosomes was detected in an overall of 44.8% of effusion specimens (range, 31.8% to 39.3% for the individual chromosome), comparable to cytology (43.3%). The combination of just 2 FISH probes (namely, representing chromosome pairs 8/11 and 8/17) was almost equally efficient in the identification of aneusomy. Approximately one fourth of the cytologically negative effusions were FISH positive and vice versa. From the initially FISH-negative effusions, 18.9% could be subsequently classified positive with dual-color FISH by visualization of intranuclear chromosomal complexity in rare aneuploid cells. Thus, "overall FISH analysis," including dual-color evaluation, identified tumor cells in significantly more effusions (55.2%, P = .001) than conventional cytology, implying greater sensitivity. Finally, our finding that numerical aberration patterns in primary breast tumors and corresponding metastatic effusions are comparable indicates that FISH examination of primary tumors will indicate the centromeric probe(s) best suited for an efficient search for metastasis in the individual case.
