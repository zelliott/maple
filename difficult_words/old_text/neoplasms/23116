New immunological aspects have broadened the therapeutic possibilities of treating surgical infections. An insufficient defence mechanism will increase the risk of postoperative infectious complications. The in-vivo-skin test using 3 antigens is apt to control the defense mechanism of a surgical patient. The author emphasizes that anergy mostly depends on the patients age and/or the presence of a malignant tumour. Anergy makes the patient more sensible to infections.
