Human biological liquids comprise various surfactants, which adsorb at liquid interfaces and lead to a variation in surface tension. The adsorption processes involving low molecular weight surfactants, proteins and phospholipids play a vital role in the physiological functions of the human organism, especially if large surfaces are involved (e.g., gas exchange in lungs, metabolism of kidneys, liver and brain). Dynamic surface tensiometric studies of biological liquids like serum and cerebrospinal fluid provide surrogate parameters that reflect surface tension phenomena. We provide dynamic surface tension data of serum and cerebrospinal fluid that were collected from healthy volunteers and patients with rheumatic, neurological or oncological diseases. Our studies indicate that dynamic surface tension data are helpful for diagnostic purposes and for monitoring of therapeutic interventions.
