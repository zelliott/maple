A biomarker for discriminating mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) (i.e. increased platelet destruction and decreased platelet production) would be valuable in managing treatment.

We explored the discriminating value of platelet size indices for this purpose in a population of adult oncology patients.

Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) were compared between patients with (i) thrombocytopenia possibly due to increased platelet destruction; (ii) thrombocytopenia possibly due to decreased platelet destruction; and (iii) no thrombocytopenia.

We obtained negative results, suggesting that these indices are not useful for discriminating different CIT mechanisms.
