Cancer prevention is possible when the causes and risk factors for this disease are known and can be avoided. Lung, breast, stomach and cervical cancers are those with the highest incidence internationally. Smoking, diet, physical activity and certain viruses are factors that have potential for modification, and they determine most of the cancers in the world. To reduce cancer risk, the following is recommended at the individual level: increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, decreasing consumption of red meats, animal fats and alcoholic beverages, avoiding smoking, exercising regularly and avoiding weight gain. Health education, restrictions as to where smoking is prohibited and establishing taxes on tobacco consumption are the principal strategies for designing population prevention programs.
