This study examines differences in perceived social support during oncology treatment of cancer patients, whilst taking into account the presence of psychiatric disorder. Of particular interest were cancer patients who received psychopharmacology treatment compared with those who did not. A total of 760 cancer outpatients were recruited from one hospital in Spain. Multivariate analysis of variance with the general linear model procedure was used. The Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey was used to assess social support perceived. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule using DSM-III-R criteria was utilized for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders. There were significant differences between the patients diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder and those not diagnosed with psychiatric disorders in terms of perceived Emotional/Informational Support (F = 19.11, p &lt; 0.01), Affectionate Support (F = 12.30, p &lt; 0.01) and the Overall Support Index (F = 16.73, p &lt; 0.01). In patients requiring psychopharmacology treatment, significant differences were presented with Structural Support (F = 4.32, p &lt; 0.05), Emotional/Informational Support perceived (F = 7.87, p &lt; 0.01), Instrumental Support (F = 4.17, p &lt; 0.05) and Overall Support Index (F = 7.84, p &lt; 0.01). Psychopharmacology treatment helped to increase the perception of social support received by the patient. Healthcare professionals could provide support that would normalize cancer patients' distress, taking into account the importance of perceived social support for the psychological well-being of patients.
