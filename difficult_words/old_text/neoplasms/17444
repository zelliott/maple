Prevention of adverse psychological sequelae of cancer begins at the time of diagnosis (D'Angio 1975). By proper management, in which accurate information is given in a positive way, misinformation is corrected and a supportive continuous relationship to a physician and staff is established. Information should similarly be given about when termination of therapy is anticipated and re-entry to normal life can be expected. Attachment to the hospital, staff and fellow patients is expected and can be used as a positive force by development of "veteran" and "fellow" patient groups. When symptoms of psychological distress do occur in a long-term survivor, they warrant immediate attention and a workup that takes into account the vulnerability to endocrine and neurologic delayed effects, as well as psychological. Interventions should be based on diagnostic findings and include consideration of maladaptive patterns of interaction within the family and the patient's social setting. More clinical studies of long-survivors are needed to clarify the interaction of medical and psychological variables which contribute to quality of life of the cured cancer patient.
