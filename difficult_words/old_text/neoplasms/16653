The ideal cancer screening tool would be one that is sufficiently sensitive to detect early malignancy, specific to only cancer and not a host of other conditions, specific for the type of cancer, specific for the location of the cancer, commensurate to the tumor bulk, cost-effective, easy to use, safe, acceptable to the general population, and acceptable to the medical community. No one laboratory test or radiograph meets all of the preceding criteria. Great strides have been made, however, in the early diagnosis of cancer. For example, breast cancer is being diagnosed at much earlier stages because of mammography. Just a few years ago, safety was a major issue because of the high level of radiation exposure connected with mammography. Today, radiation exposure is minimal, and the benefits far outweigh the potential harm. Research must continue to perfect the existing screening tools and develop new tools that will enable the early detection of malignant disease.
