Owing to improved treatment pro-tocols in the last 25 years there have been dramatic improvements in the 5-year relative survival rate of the most prevalent childhood cancers. For instance, the 5-year relative survival rate among children for all cancer sites combined, improved from 58% to 80% in patients diagnosed in 1975-1977 and in 1996-2004 respectively. However, as survival rates have improved, there has been an increasing recognition of adverse short and longer term effects associated with treatment and cancer itself, which we describe in detail in this chapter. There is growing interest in those interventions that can counteract the adverse effects of treatment and cancer. Because such adverse effects are further aggravated by physical inactivity, a special emphasis is being placed on physical activity (PA) interventions. Results are promising: there is increasing evidence that regular PA can improve the overall health status, functional capacity, and quality of life (QOL) of children with cancer as well as of older survivors of childhood cancer.
