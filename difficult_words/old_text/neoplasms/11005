Prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) is one of the major enzymes that play a key role in metastasis and angiogenesis. PHD regulates tumor progression by the degradation of hypoxia inducible factor-α (HIF-α), an important factor associated with angiogenesis. This review will provide an overview of the role of PHD and HIF in tumor progression and how it can serve as potential targets for cancer therapy.
