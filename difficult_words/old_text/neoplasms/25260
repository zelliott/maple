At the suggestion of its Research Ethics Committee, one of Britain's leading teaching hospitals is proposing to let cancer patients give oral consent to participation in clinical trials.  The patients would be given a "sensitive" verbal explanation of the trial and a written copy of the oral explanation.  The regional health authority is balking at the proposal, however, recommending instead that patients give written consent following a verbal description of the proposed trial.
