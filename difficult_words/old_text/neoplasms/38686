The biochemical modulation of 5-fluorouracil (FU) by using it in combination with leucovorin (LV) is reviewed. One of the mechanisms of action of FU is inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS), a critical enzyme in the de novo synthesis of thymidylate required for DNA repair and synthesis. In the presence of 5, 10-methylene tetrahydrofolate, 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP), which is an active nucleotide of FU, forms a ternary complex with TS, resulting in enzyme inhibition. The rationale for the use of LV with FU is to increase of formation and stability of catalytically inactive ternary complexes. In clinical trials, the dose schedules of 500 mg/m2 iv bolus or 500 mg/m2 continuously iv infusion is frequently used in order to obtain an ideal plasma concentration of active LV metabolites. Preliminary clinical trials using the combination of FU and LV appear to be capable of increasing of the clinical activity of FU for colorectal and breast cancers. Several randomized studies have supported the increase in response rates seen in the uncontrolled trials but additional studies are required to demonstrate a positive impact on the survival of treated patients.
