Human mitomycin C-treated PBL were mixed with cells of an NK sensitive hybrid cell line (PUTKO-I). A fraction of tumor cells survived this treatment and could be recovered from the cultures. These surviving cells were completely NK-resistant and this property persisted for 2-3 weeks after cultivation in fresh medium. Treatment of a clone (C13) of PUTKO-I with PBL-PUTKO mixed lymphocyte-tumor-cell culture (MLTC) supernatants resulted in a marked reduction in NK sensitivity after 8-12 h of treatment. The kinetics of induction of NK resistance by MLTC supernatants was similar to that of purified IFN-gamma and was faster than for IFN-alpha. The active component in the supernatants was characterized as a mixture of IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha based on neutralization of activity with specific antisera. The role of mycoplasma contamination was investigated and it was found that cell lines free of detectable mycoplasma stimulated production of NK-protective activity by PBL and this activity was neutralized by anti-IFN-gamma serum. Separation of PBL on discontinuous Percoll gradients demonstrated a correlation between the NK activity of cell fractions and their ability to produce IFN in response to tumor cells. Taken together, the selection-dependent variations in NK sensitivity, the kinetics of IFN production and induction of resistance suggest that tumor cells may be able to escape elimination by NK cells due to protection by IFN produced by the effector-cell-containing population.
