A bombesin derivative was successfully radiolabeled in high labeling yield. Biodistribution studies and scintigraphic images in Ehrlich tumor-bearing mice were performed. This compound showed high accumulation in tumor tissue with high tumor-to-muscle and tumor-to-blood ratios. Thus, (99m)Tc-HYNIC-Bombesin((7-14)) could be used as an agent for tumor diagnosis.
