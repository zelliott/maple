Adrenomedullin (AM) is a regulatory peptide involved in several physiological processes. Among them, AM has been implicated in the regulation of growth, both with mitogenic and antiproliferative activities on normal cells. AM is widely expressed during embryogenesis and may have a significant role in the proliferation and differentiation processes associated with development. AM is also expressed by cancer cell lines and tumors and has been implicated in the growth of malignant cells. Some additional activities associated with AM (antiapoptotic capabilities, angiogenic potential, and upregulation in hypoxic conditions), together with its wide distribution in cancer, suggest that AM may be an important factor in carcinogenesis. Besides its implication in growth, embryogenesis and tumor biology, AM is also involved in pancreatic regulation and diabetes. AM regulates insulin secretion and is overexpressed in the plasma of diabetic patients. Several findings indicate that AM may participate in the pathogenesis and/or clinical complications of this disease.
