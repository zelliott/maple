Hypercalcaemia results from the failure of renal calcium excretion to compensate increased influx of calcium into the circulation from the intestine, the kidneys and the skeleton. Hypercalcaemia is a common metabolic abnormality of varying severity that can be adequately diagnosed and treated. Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignant neoplasms are responsible for &gt;90% of all cases. The management of hypercalcaemia depends on the underlying cause and involves approaches aiming at reducing serum calcium concentrations and correcting associated metabolic disturbances. A number of pharmacological interventions are currently available for the treatment of hypercalcaemia related to malignancy as well as other forms of hypercalcaemia. Knowledge of the pathophysiology of hypercalcaemia and of the properties of these interventions is essential for the successful management of affected individuals. We herein review available therapeutic interventions for hypercalcaemia of varying aetiology.
