The CA-50 enzyme immunoassay kit (EIA kit) that has been developed with the use of C-50 monoclonal antibody prepared by L. Lindholm et al. was evaluated for diagnosis of human cancer. The levels of CA-50 in the sera were determined using this kit supplied from Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Co. in 759 healthy donors, 728 patients with benign disease and 1,263 untreated patients with cancer. A CA-50 concentration of 40 U/ml of serum was used as the cut-off value. Patients with pancreatic cancer and patients with bile duct cancer had high positive incidence of 75% and 68%, respectively, compared with a low positive incidence of under 40% in patients with other cancers. On the other hand, positive rates in patients with benign disease were as low as 13%. Comparison of the serum levels of CA-50 with CA19-9 in the same samples did not exhibit complete positive correlation in patients with pancreatic cancer, patients with bile duct cancer and patients with liver cancer. These findings indicated that C-50 antibody reacted with two epitopes of CA19-9 and sialosyllactotetraose. From the above results, the usefulness of CA-50 as a tumor marker for pancreatic cancer and bile duct cancer was recognized with this EIA kit.
