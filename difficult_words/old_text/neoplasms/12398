A total of 138 patients whose stem cell mobilization failed following chemotherapy and granulocyte colony--stimulating factor (G-CSF) at a dose of 5 microg/kg/d were given a higher dose of G-CSF (10 microg/kg/d) for 5 days after a 7-day resting period. Stem cell mobilization was successful in 90 patients, who yielded a median of 3.5x10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg, partially successful in 17 patients (1-2.4x10(6) CD34+ cells/kg) and failed in the remaining 31 patients.
