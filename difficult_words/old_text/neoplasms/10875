The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of health care professionals (HCPs) on the transition of heart failure (HF) patients to a palliative care approach.

Qualitative data were generated from 24 HCPs specializing in cardiology, care for the elderly, and palliative care. Data were analyzed using the principles of thematic analysis.

Emergent themes related to the unpredictable trajectory of HF, causing prognostic ambiguity; the use of structured pathways in end-of-life decision making; and comparison of HF and cancer patients in terms of their requirements and access to high-quality palliative care.

There is a need for both established prognostic guidelines and further education to develop the communication skills to facilitate end-of-life discussions with HF patients.
