This study aimed to estimate survival at 5 years by localization, sex and stage of the patients who presented a new cancer in 1994 in the Ile-de-France area.

A cohort study began in 1994 by an exhaustive collection of the incidental cancers notified in the Ile-de-France area at the health insurance (27,080 patients). A stratified random sample based on tumor localization was followed at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years. The analysis of the observed survival was carried out according to Kaplan-Meier method. Relative survival was calculated according to Ederer II method.

The follow-up sample concerned 4,166 patients. For all cancers, relative survival at 5 years was 65% for the women and 51% for the men. Relative survival rate at 5 years was 82% for the women with a breast cancer (98% for the patients in stage I) and 66% for those with a cancer of the cervix. Relative survival at 5 years for colonic cancer was 67% for men and 54% for women. For lung cancer, the relative survival rate fell from 47% for patients in stage I to 5% for those in stage IV.

Our study produces population-based survival data for a entire geographical area covering 20% of the French population. Survival improves with earlier diagnosis but depends also on quality of care and availability of care: access to medical care can be a favouring factor. While in terms of incidence the situation in the Ile-de-France area is close to the national situation, survival at 5 years for a set of tumors appears to be better in this area than the nationwide figures. Besides providing information useful to determine mortality and incidence, the health insurance data offer additional insight to cancer epidemiology and contribute to better knowledge of this disease.
