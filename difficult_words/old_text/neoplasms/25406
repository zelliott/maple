Two distinct forms of intercellular communication have been found in animal tissues, one using the familiar, trans-membrane, extracellular route and the other using an entirely intracellular route. The intracellular route depends on specialized, permeable (gap) junctions which form at areas of contact between adjacent cells. The junctions contain aqueous channels which directly link the cytoplasms of the coupled cells. Small ions and molecules pass through these channels and move freely between all cells in coupled populations. The structural protein which forms the gap junctional channel has been isolated and characterized. It has an apparent M.Wt. of 16,000 and readily forms multimeric structures. In the membrane, six protein subunits surround the central aqueous pore. Addition of retinoic acid to cells appears to close the junctional channels. This effect of retinoic acid on the junctional pathway of intercellular communication may explain some of its biological activities.
