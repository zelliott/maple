Some peculiarities of the procedure for cryodestruction of neoplasms of various sites developed by the authors are considered. The regularities of variation in the adhesion of cryoapplicator to tissues on gradual cooling are discussed. The report is concerned with cryogenic procedures designed to ensure destruction of tumor cells and to prevent tumor cell dissemination in the course of surgical intervention. The cryogenic installation Penguin was used. Such effects as applicator's adhesion to tissue and its freezing-induced fixation in tissue were employed. Thawing period was prolonged with cryoapplicator still in contact with tissue. Tumor tissue adjacent to normal one was allowed to thaw to 0 degrees C.
