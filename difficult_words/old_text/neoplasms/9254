As researchers consider gendered patterns in men's prostate cancer experiences, little attention has been devoted to how men manage 'cancer', more generally. Drawing on the experiences of 30 Canadian men with a variety of cancer types, this article details how men engaged illness self-management and help-seeking activities with lay and professional support persons. Results indicate three broad responsive strategies: fortifying resources, maintaining the familiar, and getting through. In these pursuits, the participants drew on a variety of performances to respond to social contexts demanding that men embody masculine ideals including strength, control, and stoicism. Considering gendered dynamics in how men manage the challenges of cancer, this article broadens understandings about men's cancer experiences by highlighting the drivers orienting participants' responsive efforts and challenging assumptions of help-seeking as essentially problematic for men in Western society.
