Estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the clearance of chromium 51 EDTA ((51)Cr-EDTA) (or other radiolabelled isotopes) is reliable, but invasive and not always practicable. Mathematical models have been devised for estimating GFR using readily obtainable patient characteristics. Unfortunately, these models were developed using various patient populations and may not provide the optimal prediction of GFR in children with cancer. The current study uses population pharmacokinetics to determine the relationship between (51)Cr-EDTA clearance, and patient covariates in 50 paediatric cancer patients. These models were validated using a separate group of 43 children and were compared with previously published models of renal function. Body size was the major determinant of (51)Cr-EDTA clearance and inclusion of weight or surface area reduced the residual variability between individuals (coefficient of variation) from 61 to 32%. Serum creatinine was the only other parameter that significantly improved the model. Mean percentage error values of -5.0 and -1.1% were observed for models including weight alone or weight and creatinine, respectively, with precision estimates of 21.7 and 20.0%. These simple additive models provide a more rationale approach than the use of complex formulae, involving additional parameters, to predict renal function.
