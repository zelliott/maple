Despite recent attempts to take advantage of dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines for cancer immunotherapy, the results of clinical studies have been disappointing. This is mainly as a result of the diverse immune escape mechanisms used by the tumor together with the insufficient ability of DCs to mount an effective immune response against these mechanisms. In this regard, several approaches have been devised to improve the efficacy of DC-based vaccines. However, the application of each individual approach per se might not be sufficient to overwhelm the diverse immune escape mechanisms. In this review, we focus on current strategies for the ex vivo potentiation of DC-based vaccines, with an emphasis on combinational therapy methods as a promising alternative for tumor immunotherapy.
