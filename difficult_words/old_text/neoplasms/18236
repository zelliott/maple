Men diagnosed with malignancy are often referred for semen banking to preserve their fertility prior to cancer treatment. The chances of cancer patients for achieving future fecundity will be determined by the sperm quality including the integrity of the genomic material in the frozen samples. The objectives of this study were to compare the sperm quality and DNA integrity in men diagnosed with testicular and systemic malignancies before receiving treatment and to identify the optimum cryopreservation protocol for their samples including a remote semen collection option. In comparison with fertile donors, patients with testicular malignancies had significantly lower sperm concentration, while both testicular and systemic malignancy patients had significantly lower sperm motility and cryosurvival rates. In addition, the SCSA defined DNA fragmentation index was significantly higher in patients with testicular and systemic malignancies compared with fertile donors. It was noted that the extent of deterioration in sperm quality and DNA integrity seen in cancer patients did not reach the previously defined statistical threshold for impaired fertility. Freezing spermatozoa with the seminal plasma offers the highest protection against cryo-injury. Nevertheless, remote semen collection can still be used as it yields adequate results.
