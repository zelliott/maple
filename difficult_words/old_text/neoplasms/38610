Age per se is not a contraindication to the aggressive management of cancer. Screening, accurate staging of disease, and specific antineoplastic therapy are as effective in lowering cancer mortality in the elderly as they are in younger groups. Treatment programs should be guided by physiologic rather than chronologic age.
