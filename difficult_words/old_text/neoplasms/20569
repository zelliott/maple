This is a retrospective study aiming to determine the cause, the survival and the factors influencing survival in cancer patients admitted to an ICU. Between January 1998 and June 1999, 181 cancer patients were admitted to the ICU of HDF hospital (a general academic hospital of 300 beds). One hundred fifteen patients were admitted after surgery and 66 for medical reasons. Among the non-surgical group, 37 had solid tumors and 29 had hematological malignancies. Most of non-surgical patients were admitted for respiratory or infectious complications due to their disease or treatment-related (59 patients). Among the non-surgical group of patients, 44 required mechanical ventilation (MV). The mortality rate was 41% during ICU recovery, 62% during the hospitalization period, 73% at 2 months from discharge and 83% at last follow-up. The duration of stay in the ICU was the only factor affecting mortality. Age, disease type and MV did not influence the mortality rate in this population.
