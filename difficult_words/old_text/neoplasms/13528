Adult cancer survivors have reported experiencing persistent changes in cognitive function following treatment with chemotherapy. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that standard-dose chemotherapy can produce cognitive deficits in a subgroup of adult cancer survivors. Although these cognitive changes tend to be subtle deficits in memory, concentration, and the ability to remain focused or organized, these alterations in cognitive ability can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life generally, and on meeting career and educational goals specifically. This manuscript reviews the literature relevant to the cognitive impact of standard-dose chemotherapy in adults, outlines methodological issues related to the study of cognitive functioning in people with cancer, and discusses future directions for research in this area.
