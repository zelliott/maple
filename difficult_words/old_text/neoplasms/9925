Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels on blood obtained from 28 cadavers were compared with that of healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes mellitus. Levels of HbA1c did not correlate with post-mortem intervals of four to 36 hours, suggesting that HbA1c is stable under these conditions. All deceased with a history of diabetes mellitus, five cases, had an elevated post-mortem blood HbA1c. Twenty-three deceased had a negative history for diabetes mellitus and seven of this group had an elevated HbA1c. These seven cases had diagnosis of malignancies and a history of prolonged exposure to steroids in excess compared to the remaining 16 cases.
