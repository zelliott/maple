TERT-CLPTM1L genomic region has been extensively associated with several types of cancer. However, results were inconsistent. We performed this meta-analysis to estimate the association between TERT (rs2736100, rs2736098), as well as CLPTM1L (rs402710, rs401681) polymorphisms and cancer risk.

Electronic search in PubMed, EMBASE and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was conducted to select the studies. Studies containing available genotype frequencies of those 4 polymorphisms were chosen, and overall odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the association.

The final meta-analysis included 16 published case-control studies. Increased cancer risk was found between TERT-rs2736100, as well as CLPTM1L-rs402710 and cancer susceptibility. In addition, we found an increased risk of cancer in both rs2736098 and rs401681 homozygous variant genetic model.

This meta-analysis suggested that TERT-CLPTM1L genomic region was associated with increased risk of cancer. To validate the association between these polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility, further studies with larger participants are needed.
