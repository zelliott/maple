Oncogenes are one of the most important structures in tumor pathogenesis. Both extracellular (growth factors, membrane receptors, tyrosine kinase) and intracellular (phospholipids and nuclear phosphoproteins) signals are involved in cell proliferation. New data are becoming available that will allow a better understanding of tumor etiology.
