The development of recombinant antibodies has facilitated the exploitation of the Ab-Ag interaction specificity for targeted therapies. A fully human antibody, with custom integrated designs, can be obtained in one-third the time, compared to development of antibodies by hybridoma technology. Recombinant antibodies can be tailored for specific applications, "armed" with cytotoxic agents in a controllable fashion, and used for extracellular and intracellular targeting. Multitargeted and combination therapies are rapidly evolving for the treatment of cancer. Antibody therapeutics, costly to develop and produce, have proven beneficial in the clinic.
