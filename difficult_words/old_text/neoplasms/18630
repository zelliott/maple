We examined analytical characteristics of new CA 15-3, CA 19-9, CA 125 II, Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA), and Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) assays on the Dimension Vista® System.

Imprecision studies used CLSI-EP5-A2, Limit of Blank and Limit of Detection used CLSI-EP17 and measurement ranges were determined. Method comparisons were evaluated with Passing-Bablok, least-squares regression and residual plots. Reference intervals were determined and valid specimen types, lot-to-lot variability and sample storage stability were defined. Clinical monitoring patterns for each tumor marker in patients were examined.

Reproducibility for each method was &lt;6.5%. Limits of Blank and Detection were low. Comparisons between methods showed slopes ranging from 0.89 to 1.32 with low y-intercepts and scatter. Minimal lot-to-lot variability was documented; serum/plasma specimens provide valid results; sample stability at -70°C was &gt;9months. Clinical monitoring patterns correlated with established methods in &gt;89% of cases.

Measurement of CA 15-3, CA 19-9, CA 125 II, CEA and AFP on the Dimension Vista® System is an attractive alternative.
