In Japan, the approach to medical treatment for sexual dysfunction in male cancer patients is not very positive. Injury to the nerves for erection after intrapelvic surgery causes erectile dysfunction. Moreover, a patient suffering from cancer loses interest in sex because of psychological stress, and in many cases, cannot enjoy sexual activity with a partner. In addition, changes to the body, such as stoma creation, are factors that render a patient hesitant to initiate or seek sexual contact. Typically, PDE5 inhibitors, intracavernous injection of vasoactive agents, and vacuum contraction devices are used to treat erectile dysfunction. The purpose of treating sexual dysfunction is to recover a satisfying sexual relationship and to rebuild the relationship with a partner after beating cancer. Healthcare workers need to support these patients actively.
