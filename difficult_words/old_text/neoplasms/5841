A total of 18 patients received 6-week ambulatory infusions of carboplatin in groups at dose levels of 14, 28, 35 and 42 mg/m2 per day. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. At 42 mg/m2, three of four patients had WHO grade 4 and one of four had grade 3 neutropenia, whereas two patients had grade 3 thrombocytopenia. At 35 mg/m2, two of five patients had grade 3 neutropenia, whereas one had grade 4 and two had grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Non-hematological toxicities were predominantly gastrointestinal, with 3 of 18 patients experiencing grade 3 emesis. Total and ultrafiltrable platinum (UFPt) were assayed by flameless atomic absorption spectrometry in weekly and post-infusion plasma and urine samples. In plasma, levels of total platinum increased throughout the infusion, and the protein binding slowly increased from 60% platinum bound at week 1 to 90% bound by week 4. Although the UFPt level reached a steady state within 1 week, the concentration did not increase with the dose level, remaining at a mean value of 0.58 +/- 0.24 microM. Renal excretion of platinum accounted for 70 +/- 12% of the dose at steady state. There was a high inter-patient variability in both total body clearance of UFPt (range, 83-603 ml/min) and renal clearance (range, 67-390 ml/min). A terminal elimination half-life of 13-27 h was noted for post-infusion UFPt. Neutropenia was linearly related to the total daily carboplatin dose, but neither neutropenia nor thrombocytopenia could be related to steady-state UFPt or the UFPt area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). The recommended dose for phase II studies is 28 mg/m2 per day.
