The non-selective actions of cytostatic drugs are responsible for both the required therapeutical effects and for some undesirable side effects on the human organism. The undesirable side effects are most hazardous to the occupationally exposed health personnel. This has led in a number of countries, including Czechoslovakia, to the elaboration of guidelines for the safe handling of cytostatic drugs. The occupational risk can be minimized by strict adherence to safety measures and the use of protective equipment of the workplace.
