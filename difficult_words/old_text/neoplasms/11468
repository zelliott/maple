It has long been recognized that interference with the blood supply of a tumour is an effective way to halt tumour progression, and even induce tumour regression. This can be accomplished by anti-angiogenic treatment which prevents the formation of a tumour neovasculature, or anti-vascular treatment, which aims at destruction of existent tumour vessels. The latter has received relatively little attention because there is a lack of specific tumour-endothelial markers. Instead, the current detailed knowledge on the factors and mechanisms, involved in angiogenesis, has enabled the development of a variety of angiogenesis inhibitors, especially those that target cellular signalling by vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), the most potent angiogenic factor known. These inhibitors have received lots of attention because they effectively inhibit tumour growth in pre-clinical models. However, in clinical trials these same inhibitors showed very poor anti-tumour activity. In this review we discuss this discrepancy, and we show that the tumour microenvironment is crucial to the sensitivity of tumours to anti-angiogenic therapy.
