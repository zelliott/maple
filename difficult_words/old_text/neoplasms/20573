A computer image analyzer (imager-CG with a version of ploidometry program "Avtan-San") was utilized for raising quality of differential diagnosis process in pathohistological examinations of biopsies. The results of ploidometry performed on histological slides stained by Felgen allowed to diagnose the degree of intraepithelial neoplasia and different stages of infiltrating carcinomas differentiation. The use of stereometric methods and immunocytohistometry for pathohistological diagnosis is described.
