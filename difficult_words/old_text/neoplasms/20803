Hemorrhage, an infrequent but serious complication of malignant ulceration, can be difficult to manage. Although many methods exist for treatment, none is wholly satisfactory. The use of topical formalin was studied in a group of patients with bleeding from malignant ulcers, and the results show that the agent achieved control of bleeding in 86% of the patients after two applications. There were no significant complications arising from the treatment. Topical formalin is a safe, inexpensive, effective agent for control of bleeding from malignant ulcers.
