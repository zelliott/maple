Critical levels of selected cigarette smoke constituents have been expressed in terms of maximum numbers of pre-1960 cigarettes that a smoker may consume daily without increasing his mortality risk substantially above that of a nonsmoker. This could still imply an important risk, although it may be difficult to detect. We relate these levels to the yields of 27 current low tar and nicotine commercial cigarettes, as measured at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In addition, the yields of these selected constituents concomitant with the yield of 1 mg of nicotine are provided as a guide for the smoker who titrates or adjusts his smoking pattern to accommodate a fixed daily intake of nicotine.
