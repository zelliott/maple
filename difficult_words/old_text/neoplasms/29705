Blood samples from 304 children aged 6 months to 16 years were tested by radioimmunoassay for antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV). Of several factors examined for a possible association with the prevalence of anti-HAV--age, sex, race, geographic location and presence of malignant disease--only age showed a positive correlation with the prevalence of these antibodies.
