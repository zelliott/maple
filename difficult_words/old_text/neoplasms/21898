During the period of five years (2000-2004) we monitored 46 patients (25 males and 21 females) who were admitted to Clinical Institute for Rehabilitation and Orthopaedic Aids in Zagreb for the first prosthetic rehabilitation following the lower limb amputation which was caused by a tumour. The average age of patients was 51 +/- 17.11 years. According to the pathohistological diagnosis the most common cause of lower limb amputations was osteosarcoma. According to the level of amputation the most frequent was trans-femoral amputation (50%) and the least frequent was knee disarticulation (8.7%). The average number of days from the amputation to the beginning of prosthetic rehabilitation was 108 +/- 67.05. At the time of admission 15.2% of patients had local complications of the stump and 34.8% of patients complained of phantom pain. The average number of days of prosthetic rehabilitation was 35 +/- 7.94. The medium daily use of the prosthesis was 5 hours and the medium walking speed was 12 sec/10 m. At the time of admission for the prosthetic rehabilitation 10.9% of patients used a wheelchair, 8.7% walked with a walker and others with two crutches. At the time of discharge 89.1% of patients were able to walk with a prosthesis and two crutches, 4.4% with one crutch and 6.5% were able to walk without crutches. We can be satisfied with the results of prosthetic rehabilitation because patients regained mobility and full independence in performing their daily activities.
