This paper reviews current approaches to the use of ifosfamide/mesna alone or in combination with other agents or modalities in the treatment of pediatric malignancies. Included are data from current or recently completed studies conducted by major pediatric oncology cooperative groups and large individual oncology centers for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent tumors. Sarcomas, neuroblastoma, lymphomas, recurrent solid tumors, brain tumors, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia are discussed. Randomized trials to determine the relative efficacy of ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide in various childhood malignancies are under way. The long-term consequences of ifosfamide in survivors of childhood cancer, in terms of development of bladder cancer or other malignancies thought to be associated with alkylating agents, are not known, and will only be determined through follow-up studies of adult survivors. Ifosfamide's future role in pediatric oncology will depend on evaluation of its therapeutic benefits against long-term toxicity.
