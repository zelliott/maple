The inaccuracy of cancer registries at oncological dispensaries is due to the incomplete and delayed supply of statistical data on cancer patients and deaths from neoplasms by the district oncological service authorities, treated cancer patients and consultations given--by general clinical hospitals and diagnoses of cancer established post-mortem or shortly before death--by the local authorities of general medical services. As a result of the efforts made by the staff of the Cancer Control Department of the Sverdlovsk Regional Oncological Dispensary to obviate this difficulty, cancer registry coverage rose from 59.8% in 1960 to 100% in 1980.
