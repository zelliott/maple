Cancer-specific health-related quality of life instruments are often used to evaluate the patients' quality of life in clinical trials. However, these instruments cannot be used in economic evaluation to guide resource allocation decisions. Mapping is an approach that enables utilities to be predicted for use in cost-utility analysis. The purpose of this study was to review the literature on the mapping methods used to determine utilities from two cancer-specific instruments. Thirteen studies were identified and a total of 53 models were reported. Most of the studies employed an ordinary least squares method and did not conduct an out-of-sample validation. There is a need for more rigorous and robust mapping studies to be conducted to ensure appropriate funding recommendations are being made.
