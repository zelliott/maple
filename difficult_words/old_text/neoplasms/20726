An outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) occurred in an adult oncology ward of a large teaching hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. The outbreak strain was identified as an Enterococcus faecium carrying the vanA resistance genotype. Macro-restriction analysis showed that the majority of strains were clonally related. Modified infection control interventions were implemented and control of the outbreak was achieved. Although the epidemiology of VRE is well documented in Europe, North America and Australia, this problem has only recently emerged in South Africa. The epidemiology of the outbreak appears similar to that described for outbreaks elsewhere.
