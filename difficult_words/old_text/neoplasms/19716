The results from the UPMC Cancer Center's experience with Via Pathways and those reported by other pathways programs suggest that these are effective models for improving quality, reducing unwarranted variability in care, and reducing the rate of growth in the cost of cancer care. A robust pathways program that reduces unwarranted variability can serve as the vehicle to improve the value of cancer care to patients, payers, and providers through increasing quality and decreasing costs. Oncologists must take an active role in defining and implementing cost-effective care for patients, payers, and referring physicians.
