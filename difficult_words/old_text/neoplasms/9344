Monoclonal antibodies are now established as a key therapeutic modality for a range of diseases. Owing to the ability of these agents to selectively target tumour cells, cancer has been a major focus of development programmes for monoclonal antibodies so far. Here, we overview trends in the clinical development and regulatory approval of monoclonal antibodies for cancer since 1980, with the aim of informing future research and development for this class of therapeutics.
