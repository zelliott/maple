Recent studies of normal and neoplastic lymphocytes have revealed overlapping metabolic rewiring in activated Tâ€ƒcells and Myc-transformed lymphocytes. Myc expression is attenuated in normal lymphocytes that return to the basal state, but Notch-activated or Myc-transformed lymphocytes persistently express Myc, which activates genes involved in glucose and glutamine metabolism. Although this difference could provide a therapeutic window for the treatment of cancers, the overlapping metabolic profiles suggest a potential for immunosuppression by metabolic inhibitors.
