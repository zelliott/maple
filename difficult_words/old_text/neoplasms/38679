Seven monoclonal antibodies of rat origin were generated against human epidermal keratins and were assayed by immunoblot and by immunoperoxidase staining of frozen sections from various human epithelial tissues. By immunoblotting, the antibodies recognized two different subsets of high molecular weight cytokeratin polypeptides. Unlike the majority of the reported mouse monoclonal antibodies obtained to similar immunogens, these rat monoclonal antibodies showed an unexpected degree of specificity, i.e., they stained only stratified squamous epithelia and not simple epithelia nor urothelia. The potential of using rats and the appropriate immunogen to generate more tissue-specific anticytokeratin monoclonal antibodies is discussed.
