A proposal is made to extend the commitment theory of cellular aging to the process of tumorigenesis. Indirect data are cited in support of a scheme whereby human tumors arise from a small number of unique cells which are termed "uncommitted." The process of tumorigenesis as described is both multistep and reversible.
