Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been established as a key component of the crosstalk between tumor cells and their microenvironment. The ability of CAFs to orchestrate tumor-promoting inflammation is central to their role in facilitating tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Here we review pathways by which CAFs and their soluble mediators provide multiple complex signals that modulate the recruitment, functional activation status, and retention of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.
