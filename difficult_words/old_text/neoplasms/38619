A hybridoma producing monoclonal antibody (H11) directed to lactoneotetraosylceramide (paragloboside) has been established from spleen cells of a mouse immunized with paragloboside. The monoclonal antibody H11 (immunoglobulin M type) was selected from five clones showing different reactivities with paragloboside. The monoclonal antibody was highly specific to paragloboside and lacked reactivity with other glycolipids including glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, globotriaosylceramide, globotetraosylceramide, gangliotriaosylceramide, gangliotetraosylceramide, and GalNAc beta 1-4[NeuAc alpha 2-3]Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer. However, the monoclonal antibody (H11) was found to bind to lactosamine-containing glycolipids at their terminals, such as i- and I-type glycolipids as well as paragloboside. A two-step sandwich radioimmunoassay method for paragloboside antigen in serum was established by using the monoclonal antibody. The mean paragloboside antigen concentration in the sera from 20 normal individuals was 25.3 ng/ml. If the cutoff value was set at 80.9 ng/ml [25.3 + 2 x 27.8 (SD)], only 1 of 20 healthy controls had an elevated paragloboside value in the serum, whereas sera from 9 of 12 (75.0%) hepatoma, 4 of 10 (40%) pancreatic cancer, 16 of 40 (40.0%) stomach cancer, and 6 of 10 (60%) lung cancer patients had elevated paragloboside values. Sera from 3 of 8 hepatitis patients and 7 of 10 liver cirrhosis patients were estimated to be positive but sera from 16 patients with benign disease had paragloboside levels lower than the cutoff value. A larger amount of the antigen was found in liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma compared to the normal counterpart. The antigen was also detected in the medium of various human cancer cells and meconium. However, the antigen in the sera, medium, meconium, and cancer tissue seemed to be associated with glycoprotein or lipoprotein, because most of the antigen activity was eluted in the void volume fraction on high-performance liquid chromatography with a gel filtration column.
