Anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity has a substantial negative impact on long-term survivors of childhood cancer. The detection of cardiotoxicity is currently based on echocardiography or radionuclide angiography. However, as they depict only the final outcome of myocardial injury in terms of reduced heart contractility, heart specific biomarkers of myocardial destruction or dysfunction could be advantageous by allowing for an earlier detection of cardiotoxicity. In the present study, the usefulness of cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides, the most commonly used biomarkers of myocardial destruction and ventricular dysfunction respectively, to detect and to predict the development of anthracycline cardiotoxicity has been reviewed.
