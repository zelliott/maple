In this report, we examine several morphologic aspects of blue nevi of internal organs, and compare them to similar conditions of the skin. From a morphologic point of view, blue nevi of internal organs are more similar to the so-called dermal melanocytoses. Nevertheless, since melanocytoses and blue-nevi seem to have the same benign prognosis, and since blue nevus is a historically consolidated term to refer to pigmented spindle cell lesions of internal organs, a most appropriate term, to refer to the latter, will not be easily accepted in literature.
