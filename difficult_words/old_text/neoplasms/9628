Synovial disorders often affect the knee joint and are a common cause of morbidity. Before MR imaging, radiologists were limited in their ability to provide information about the presence or absence of synovial disease. With the advent of MR imaging, useful information can now be provided to referring clinicians, often at a time when the initiation of therapy may mitigate significantly the long-term sequelae of synovial disorders. MR imaging, owing to its superior soft-tissue contrast, is the imaging modality of choice for demonstrating and quantifying pathologic changes of the synovium. MR imaging provides invaluable information to the clinician regarding the need to either initiate or modify therapy in those patients suffering from diseases of, or affecting, the synovium.
