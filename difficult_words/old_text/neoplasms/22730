Identification of the genetic basis of variable treatment response, prognosis and survival in cancer patients (i.e. personalized medicine) is an important aim in current medicine. Millions of genetic variations exist in the human genome, some of which are already found to be directly involved in variable treatment response and survival among cancer patients. GENETIC VARIATION DATABASES: Special databases curate, compile, organize and post information related to these genetic variations for the scientific community in a user friendly and free-to-access manner via the World Wide Web. FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUSION: Clinicians have a critical role in genetic predictive and prognostic studies. In this review, main public-domain databases on genetic variations, including the two comprehensive genetic variation databases (dbSNP and HapMap), a pharmacogenomics database (PharmGKB), two resequencing-based genetic variation databases (SeattleSNPs and EGP), a population-based genetic variation database (JSNPs), and a copy-number variant database (DGV), and their utility in cancer research are discussed. Utilization of these databases can assist clinicians in their studies related to treatment response and prognosis in cancer patients.
