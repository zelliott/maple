As the understanding of the magnitude and social impact of cancer has advanced, three major forces have shaped the current state of the art in cancer prevention and control: the maturation of organization approaches to solving the cancer problem; the accumulation of scientific evidence that justified and illuminated the concept of cancer as a controllable disease; and, most recently, the development of a systematic cancer control research process that provides efficiency and clearer direction to the planning of a national cancer control program. The National Cancer Institute, recognizing the need for goal setting and scientific accountability in the conduct of cancer control research, has established quantified mortality reduction objectives for the year 2000 related to smoking cessation, diet changes, early detection, and state-of-the-art treatment. The cancer control research process and these objectives will guide the allocation of cancer control resources toward the application of effective health promotion strategies.
