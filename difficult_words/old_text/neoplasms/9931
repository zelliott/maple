The antiemetic effect of domperidone against nausea, vomiting, and anorexia induced by antineoplastic agents was compared with that of chlorpromazine. Twenty patients with malignant neoplasms given 2 cycles of a combination chemotherapy including cisplatinum and adriamycin received domperidone in one cycle and chlorpromazine in another cycle. Antiemetics 10-20 mg were given 30 minutes before chemotherapy and every 4-6 hours afterwards by div, iv, or po. No significant differences in severity of nausea and vomiting and duration of anorexia were noted between domperidone and chlorpromazine. Side effects were observed in 11 patients who received chlorpromazine, while none was observed in domperidone. It was concluded that domperidone was as effective as chlorpromazine as antiemetics and more useful because of its lower incidence of side effects. The antiemetic effect of domperidone, however, was not great enough for some patients, especially when they received cisplatinum. A higher dose of domperidone or domperidone with concomitant use of glucocorticoids should be considered as promising antiemetics for these patients.
