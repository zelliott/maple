Substantial evidence suggests that psychosocial interventions are effective in reducing the psychological distress associated with cancer. As the requirement for more cost-effective health care becomes a global concern, considerable focus has been directed towards group interventions with cancer patients. This review examines the literature of intervention groups provided across a wide range of approaches used and illustrates the mental health benefits seen from these studies. Methodological limitations in previous work are examined and ways towards improving research using cancer intervention groups are suggested.
