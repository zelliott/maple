VEGF, mTOR, and EGFR inhibitors have demonstrated anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects alone and in combination with each other. This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab, everolimus, and erlotinib combination.

Doublet therapy consisted of bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg every 14 days and everolimus 5 mg daily which escalated to 10 mg daily. Erlotinib 75 mg daily was added to the phase II dose recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of bevacizumab and everolimus. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was assessed in cycle 1.

Forty-eight patients with advanced solid malignancies were evaluable for DLT and efficacy. No DLTs were observed in the doublet dose escalation. Two DLTs (grade 3 mucositis and grade 3 rash) were observed with the addition of erlotinib 75 mg daily. Consequently, triplet doses were adjusted and were better tolerated. Four patients had a partial response. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for the doublet therapy was 6.0 months (0.5 to 32+ months) and 5.5 months (0.8 to 27+ months) for the triplet therapy. Systemic exposure of everolimus was significantly higher in combination with erlotinib (476 ± 161 ng h/mL) compared to when given alone (393 ± 156 ng h/mL; P = 0.020).

The RPTD for the doublet therapy is bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 14 days and everolimus 10 mg daily, and the RPTD for the triplet therapy is bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 14 days, everolimus 5 mg and erlotinib 75 mg daily. Prolonged disease stability was demonstrated in tumors known to respond to mTOR inhibition and potentially resistant to VEGF blockade.
