Fungal infections continue to cause major complications in cancer patients. With the increasing use of aggressive chemotherapy causing prolonged granulocytopenia, and the progress made in the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial infections, the risk of invasive mycoses has increased, particularly in patients with hematological malignancies. The prognosis of these infections is poor unless they are diagnosed and treated promptly. Early diagnosis, particularly in neutropenic cancer patients, is often difficult and antifungal therapy is frequently unsuccessful because it is not instituted until the infection is in an advanced, fatal phase. In order to reduce the mortality associated with invasive fungal infections, antifungal therapy, usually amphotericin B, has been empirically carried out in neutropenic patients with fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. However, the absence of a marker of the fungal infection, the frequent occurrence in these patients of non-infective fever, which does not require any antimicrobial therapy, and the possible toxicity of amphotericin B represent the major limits of empiric antifungal therapy. In view of the above, the study of improved and less toxic antifungal agents, and the evaluation of new clinical and laboratory methods for an early diagnosis, have been the major goals in research on the opportunistic invasive fungal infections in the last years.
