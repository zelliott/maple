Dietary intake of selenium has been associated with reduced risk of several cancer types, and this is likely due to its role as a specific constituent of selenium containing proteins. One of these, selenium-binding protein 1 (SBP1), is a protein of unknown function that has been shown to be reduced in tumors of diverse tissue types as compared to the corresponding normal tissue. More importantly, SBP1 has also been reported to be a predictor of clinical outcome. Levels of SBP1 are inversely associated with the levels of another protein representative of a different class of selenoproteins, glutathione peroxidase1 (GPx-1). GPx-1 is an anti-oxidant, selenocysteine containing enzyme implicated in several diseases, including cancer, due to the association of specific alleles with disease risk. The relationship between SBP1 and GPx-1 represents a unique example of a molecular interaction between selenium containing proteins with a likely significant impact on human health and disease.
