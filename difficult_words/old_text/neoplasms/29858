Cytogenetic analysis was used to supplement the cytologic diagnosis of malignancy in serous effusions. Current methods of analysis involve immediate preparation, but our study showed that prior culture of the cells is a more practical approach to the use of chromosome analysis in the routine cytology laboratory. This method permits the retrospective selection of specimens for chromosome analysis from patients in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion of malignant disease but who have negative or equivocal cytology reports. The preparative technique and the recognition of structural and numerical chromosome anomalies can be readily learned by the cytotechnologist and incorporated into the routine cytology laboratory.
