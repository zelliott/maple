The analysis has been made of the literary and the author's own experimental evidences on the antigenic diversion of tumor cells resulting from the expression of hetero-organic antigens, which is one of the most characteristic manifestations of disturbance of cytodifferentiation in carcinogenesis. Studies of hepatocellular tumors and liver of rats subject to single hepatocarcinogen injections being exemplified, the author considers some cases of detection of hetero-organic antigens of kidney origin in the cytosol, on the outer cell membranes and within the chromosomal non-histone proteins (NHP). Under discussion is the interrelation between the expression of hetero-organic antigens, attributed to the same tissue type in different cell structures, and a possible role of NHP as factors directing the disdifferentiation of neoplastically transformed cells.
