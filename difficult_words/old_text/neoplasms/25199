It is estimated than one out of 3 people in Spain will suffer of cancer along the life. In fact cancer is responsible for the 25% of deaths in our country. The good news is that the overall survival at five years is around 66%. For the future it will be necessary to review the way we are developing clinical trials in order to approve the drugs by the regulatory agencies. Other important topics is how to approach the long survivor and also the economic issues related to it. In addition it will be also critical to establish the adequate policy for the prevention of cancer (primary and secondary) including the early diagnosis, the screening and the genetic counsel.
