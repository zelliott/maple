This study compared the efficacy and the adverse effects of controlled-release morphine (CRM) suspension (SAR 213) and CRM tablets (Moscontin) in the treatment of cancer pain. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study was carried out on 52 patients. Each patient received both study treatments given at an equivalent dosage of morphine during each of two 7-day periods. The primary outcome variable was the severity of pain assessed three times daily by means of a visual analogue scale. Secondary criteria of efficacy were the severity of pain assessed by verbal rating scale, the need for "rescue" doses of immediate-release morphine, treatment preference, and indices of quality of life (activity, mood, sleep). There were no statistically significant differences in the parameters assessed when comparing the two groups. This study shows that, when prescribed at the same doses, CRM suspension and CRM tablets have similar efficacy and adverse effects, as well as the same duration of action. The results of this first clinical study carried out on CRM suspension are especially relevant for patients with cancer pain who have difficulty swallowing.
