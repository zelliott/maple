A tabulation of neoplastic incidence in various strains of control rats from the scientific literature of 1960 to 1978 is presented. The report includes information on the strains origin, diet, age and/or weight of rats, duration of study, and type and incidence of tumors. The tabulation outlines the differences in types of neoplasms among strains and the variability of tumor incidence in a given strain, attributable to various parameters. Among these, diet is one of the most important factors.
