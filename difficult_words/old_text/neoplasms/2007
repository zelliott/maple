Cortiphen, a newly developed hormonal cytostatic ester of 11-desoxy-17 alpha-hydroxycorticosterone and chlorophenacyl, is described. It was studied in transplantable, spontaneous and induced tumors of 7 sites: hemoblastosis (5), hepatoma (3), mammary gland (5), lung (2), gastrointestinal tract (3), sarcoma (2) and melanoma. Practically all the tumors were shown to respond to cortiphen action. Among the antitumor effects of the drug were: long-term inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression, contribution to longer survival, antimetastatic action and sustained action during repeated courses of administration. Cortiphen was found to interact with glucocorticoid receptors in both animal and human tumors. The role of the hormonal component of the drug's molecule in the realization of its antitumor effect is discussed.
