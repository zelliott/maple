The success of a predictive assay for radiotherapy relies on the use of one or more tumor cell traits that equate with tumor radioresistance or radiosensitivity. These traits can be divided into intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (epi-genetic) factors. Most probably, a tumor's response to radiotherapy will be influenced by both of these sets of traits. Radiobiological analysis of cultured cells derived from explanted tumors of head and neck patients has shown that in vitro survival of tumor cells is not the only factor affecting tumor radiocurability. Two possible reasons are the high degree of selection involved in growing the cells in vitro and the inability to assess the contribution of the cell-cell contact effect with cultured cells. A possible means of overcoming both of these problems would be an assessment of the radiosensitivity of the cell population immediately after removal from the tumor. Since a good correlation exists between intrinsic cellular radioresistance and DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) as assayed by the Neutral Elution technique [21], we have investigated the feasibility of using asymmetric field inversion gel electrophoresis (AFIGE) in identifying resistant tumor cells in vitro. AFIGE has several advantages over neutral elution in that it is faster (approximately 60-80 samples can be run on the same agarose gel) and, most importantly, one can visualize DNA damage and repair by staining the DNA with ethidium bromide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
