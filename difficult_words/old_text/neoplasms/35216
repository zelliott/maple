Variation from the normal in the distribution patterns of the DNA content of interphase tumor cells is considered in relation to the chromosome abnormalities that occur in these cells. The possible diagnostic and prognostic significance of the DNA distributions, particularly the modal values, of human tumors is discussed. Tumors with normal or near-normal modes frequently have a favorable prognosis, but this is not true for all tumor sites or types, including squamous-cell carcinomas of the cervix uteri and carcinomas of the large bowel, in which near-triploid tumors may have a relatively favorable prognosis.
