The field of cancer genomics is rapidly advancing as new technology provides detailed genetic and epigenetic profiling of human cancers. The amount of new data available describing the genetic make-up of tumors is paralleled by rapid advances in drug discovery and molecular therapy currently under investigation to treat these diseases. This review summarizes the challenges and approaches associated with the integration of genomic data into the development of new biomarkers in the management of cancer.
