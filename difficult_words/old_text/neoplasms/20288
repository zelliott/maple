Patient education should be a central component of pain control regimens for cancer patients. Few systematically developed and carefully evaluated pain control patient education programs have been reported. Patient education for cancer pain control should include five phases: assessment, goal setting, selection of educational strategies, implementation and reassessment. Each of these phases should be included to maximize the goals of pain prevention and pain relief.
