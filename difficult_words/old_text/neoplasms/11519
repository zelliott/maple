Tetracyclines are broad-spectrum antibiotics that act as such at the ribosomal level where they interfere with protein synthesis. They were first widely prescribed by dermatologists in the early 1950s when it was discovered that they were effective as a treatment for acne. More recently, biologic actions affecting inflammation, proteolysis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, metal chelation, ionophoresis, and bone metabolism have been researched. The therapeutic effects of tetracycline and its analogues in various diseases have also been investigated. These include rosacea, bullous dermatoses, neutrophilic diseases, pyoderma gangrenosum, sarcoidosis, aortic aneurysms, cancer metastasis, periodontitis, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma. We review the nonantibiotic properties of tetracycline and its analogues and their potential for clinical application.
