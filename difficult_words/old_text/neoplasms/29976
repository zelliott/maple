To evaluate the knowledge, perceptions, and effectiveness of an human papillomavirus (HPV)/cervical cancer education/prevention program.

Approximately 50 middle and high school girls and their mothers participated in the 7-part educational series. Qualitative pre-evaluations and postevaluations were completed for every session, followed by culminating focus groups with mothers and daughters separately.

Common themes included lack of basic knowledge about HPV and its related cancers. Additionally, mothers and daughters expressed difficulty in communicating with one another about healthy relationships; however, during the focus groups, both mothers and daughters discussed how they had utilized effective communication tools to discuss sensitive topics and make informed decisions together.

Despite recent HPV prevention campaigns, more innovative strategies must be implemented to educate more mothers and daughters of HPV and its dangers. Additionally, in educating communities about HPV and associated cancers, more innovative strategies should be mobilized to trigger discussions regarding protective behaviors against HPV.
