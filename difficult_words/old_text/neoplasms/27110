This study is aimed at the evaluation of the absorbed dose to the thyroid gland from scattered/primary radiations in patients who have undergone radiotherapy. In this study, the skin entrance dose (SED) on the anterior neck at the level of the thyroid gland was measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters for 57 patients during radiotherapy with (60)Co teletherapy unit. Phantom dosimetry was also performed to find the correlation between the SED and the dose at the depth of the thyroid. SED of patients treated for breast cancer was 6.77±3.49 Gy and that of those with Hodgkin's disease and Ca. lung irradiation were 21.29±13.52 Gy and 28.80±14.94 Gy, respectively. SED at the level of the thyroid gland was found to be highest for patients whose thyroid gland was within the radiation field, while lowest for patients with skull irradiation. Thyroid gland is recommended to be shielded or excluded from the field whenever possible.
