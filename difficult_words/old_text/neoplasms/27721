Previous medical investigations have indicated a connection between heavy metal pollution from the metallurgical industry in the Russian town of Nikel on the Kola peninsula and an observed increase of incidence of cancer among the Norwegian population living near the Russian border. This report contains the latest measurements of heavy metals in the local environment and discusses exposure levels in relation to possible health effects. It is concluded that exposure to heavy metals via food, water and air is considered so low as to be unlikely to cause any increase in incidence of cancer. Thus, the previously held hypothesis of a connection between heavy metal pollution from Nikel and cancer in Pasvik is not confirmed.
