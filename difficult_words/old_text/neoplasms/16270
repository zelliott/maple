More than 75% of all types of cancer are due to environmental factors. These latter include nutrition. A diet rich in fruit and vegetables, carotenoids, and vitamin C has a protective effect against cancer. A high-calorie, high-fat diet, and the consumption of alcohol have the opposite effect. New data appear to show that the daily consumption of up to 20 g alcohol in women, and 40 g in men, previously considered innocuous, must be considered a risk for certain types of cancer. A particularly close association with alcohol is found in the case of cancer of the breast, and tumours of the mouth, pharynx and esophagus.
