The survey of 150 "visitors" to the Developmental Therapeutics Clinic of the M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute revealed that this population is composed of three distinct subpopulations, not only in terms of status in the clinic but also in terms of cancer information needs. New patients information needs vary greatly from those of patients familial with the clinic. Relatives and/or friends accompanying patients to the clinic present a set of information needs distinctly different from those of the other two groups. The three subpopulations are also different from each other along several other study dimensions. Among these are clarity of the tests and examinations performed, understanding cancer metastasis, fear of the tests, effects of discussion of the disease, and need for counseling. All three groups desire more communication with social workers and with chaplains rank second and third. Most participants in the study desire cancer information in pamphlets, while private discussions and films or television programmes are next on the priority list. When planning a hospital-based cancer education programme, careful attention must be paid to the differential needs of the population visiting various clinics. To better understand these needs, similar studies in other clinics are recommended.
