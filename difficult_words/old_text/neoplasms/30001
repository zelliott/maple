Urgent solutions range from re-engineering of the macroeconomic basis of cancer costs (e.g. value-based approaches to bend the cost curve and allow cost-saving technologies), greater education of policy makers, and an informed and transparent regulatory system. We have analyzed a total of 856 cancer patients were registered in the onco-AIFA for various drugs. The results have shown that 38.1% of patients have received only few drug administrations and their treatment was stopped within 4 or 12 weeks (depending on the type of the drug schedule). We have examined the reasons, why their treatment was immediately suspended.
