The study of fluctuating asymmetry has been controversial because of conflicting results found in much of the primary literature. It has been suggested that the source of this conflict is the fact that the basis of fluctuating asymmetry is poorly understood and that, as a consequence, methodology of fluctuating asymmetry studies may be flawed. A new model for the phenomenological basis of fluctuating asymmetry, that variation in fluctuating asymmetry is in large part due to the random exponential growth of cell populations (geometric Brownian motion) that are terminated randomly around a genetically programmed development time, is presented here. If termination of development has a genetic component, then scaling effects and kurtosis in the distribution of fluctuating asymmetry should increase with genetic redundancy of the population. This model prediction was tested by comparing the distribution of multivariate size and shape fluctuating asymmetry in large samples collected from both wild populations and four moderately inbred lines of Drosophila simulans. It was found that while wild populations were best described by a lognormal distribution with power-law scaled tails, the inbred lines derived from the wild stock were dramatically normalized (half-normal) in three of four cases. As predicted, the scaling exponent of the upper tail of the distribution of fluctuating asymmetry increased with inbreeding while the kurtosis and mean fluctuating asymmetry decreased with inbreeding. The model suggests an additional explanation of leptokurtosis in fluctuating asymmetry. Kurtosis and scaling of the statistical distribution of fluctuating asymmetry in a population is related directly to genetic differences between individuals and these differences affect their ability to buffer the process of development against random perturbations.
