One of the most commonly detected abnormalities in human cancer is mutation of the p53 tumour suppressor gene. Intrinsic to the function of p53 is its ability to induce apoptotic cell death and to cause cell cycle arrest. Moreover, p53 plays an important role in controlling the cellular response to DNA damaging agents such as ionizing radiation and cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. Loss of p53 function causes increased resistance to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents, and there is increasing evidence that p53 mutational status is an important determinant of clinical outcome in cancer. This review will focus on recent data describing the biochemistry of p53 function, its role in mediating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and in the control of tumour growth and death.
