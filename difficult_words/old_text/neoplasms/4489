Fluorescence in situ hybridization has emerged as an extremely important tool for detection and characterization of nonrandom chromosome aberrations in cancer. Fluorescence in situ hybridization assays have been very reliable in cytogenetic tumor preparations, but have been more unpredictable in archival, paraffin-embedded specimens. We describe novel approaches for detection of chromosome aberrations in frozen tumor specimens, touch preparations, and cytological preparations. These approaches are both simple and reproducible, with minimal case-to-case variation in hybridization efficiency or hybridization signal quality. We demonstrate potential applications of these novel approaches by evaluating: 1) significance of normal karyotypes in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors; 2) p15/p16 copy number in prostate cancer; and 3) clonal chromosome 3p deletion in cytological preparations of pleural fluid from patients with mesothelioma.
