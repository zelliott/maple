The aim of this project was to establish the importance of a pharmacist in the health-care team in improving drug use in an oncology ward in the Department of Oncology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

The pharmacist participated in the medical round in the mornings and worked as a member of the health-care team. Drug-related problems (DRPs) were identified by drug chart reviews based on data from medical files, laboratory tests and interviews with patients and/or relatives. A questionnaire to physicians and nurses was used to evaluate their experiences of the pharmacist's contribution to the oncology ward.

In total, 114 DRPs were identified in 58 patients. For each DRP, the pharmacist gave proposals for solutions. Sixty-eight suggestions out of 114 (59.6%) were implemented by the physician. Two suggestions (1.8%) were partly followed. For 32 suggestions (28.0%) it was unclear if they had caused any change in medication. Twelve suggestions (10.5%) were not followed. Most of the physicians and nurses acknowledged the pharmacist's contribution to improved drug use in the ward.

A pharmacist can improve drug use in an oncology ward as a member of the health-care team. The pharmacist contributes with a systematic focus on the patient from a drug perspective.
