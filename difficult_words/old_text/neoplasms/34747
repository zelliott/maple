Combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a relatively new imaging modality, combining the functional images of PET with the anatomical information of CT. Since its commercial introduction about 5 years ago, PET/CT has become an important tool in oncology. Currently, the technique is used for primary staging and restaging of cancer patients, as well as for surgery and radiation therapy planning. The abilities of PET/CT to measure early treatment response as well as drug distribution within the body make this technique very useful in the development of novel anticancer drugs. In this paper, the recent literature on the current role of PET/CT in drug development is reviewed.
