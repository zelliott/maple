In this newly developed method, the ultrasonic diagnosis has become quantitative. The data will remain quantitative so far as an image storage tube is used. With the conventional storage type CRT, it is impossible to memorize the reflected echo signals of different strength levels. But with our method, it becomes possible to memorize the images according  to individual levels. By the direct digitalization of the ultrasonic echo images, more information is obtained from the reflected echo signals. By processing the original information with a computer, more accurate diagnosis is possible. It is hoped and believed, that this computer aided ultrasonic examination, with single scan display in colour or black and white, will further promote ultrasonic diagnosis in future.
