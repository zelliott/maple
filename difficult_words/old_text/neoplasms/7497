The applications of ultrasound diagnosis within the framework of general medicine are discussed on the basis of case reports. Ultrasonic equipment with manual moving of the probe is used in this department for the investigation of the abdomen in cases of occult neoplasms and metastases to differentiate between cysts and solid tumours and to determine the situation and size of parenchymatous organs like liver and kidney and spleen. Special fields of application are: follow up of patients after renal transplantation, investigation of systemic haematological diseases such as lymphogranuloma, or the demonstration of abnormal fluid masses such as haematomata in haemophilic patients, ascites or pericardial effusions.
