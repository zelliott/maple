TNF is cytokine derived from macrophages and shows much promise for use in cancer therapy because of its marked antitumor effects and its high specificity to tumors. The clinical application (Phase I-II) of TNF has been started because human recombinant TNF (rH-TNF) can be produced on a large scale. In spite of notable antitumor effects, little is known concerning the mechanism of its cytotoxic action. In this article, the antitumor effects of rH-TNF against human and murine tumors, the mechanism of its action and the synergistic effects of rH-TNF in combination with IFN-gamma, various anticancer drugs or with hyperthermia are reviewed.
