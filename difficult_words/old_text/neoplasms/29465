the loss or impairment of ovarian function is an irreversible side effect that can occur in young cancer patients undergoing anticancer treatments. Its incidence varies according to the type of chemotherapy and the patient's age.

the review includes studies or data available in literature from 1987 to 2010, examining current strategies to protect ovarian function and/or fertility in patients undergoing chemotherapy, which include oocyte, embryo or ovarian tissue cryopreservation, and temporary ovarian suppression during chemotherapy obtained by the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa). The reader will gain an understanding of the incidence of premature ovarian function loss associated with chemotherapy; the advantages and disadvantages of the different strategies in protecting ovarian function; and the magnitude of the effect of GnRHa strategy in preserving ovarian function during chemotherapy.

the administration of GnRHa before and during chemotherapy is associated with an absolute reduction in the incidence of early menopause of nearly 20%. Such a strategy may be offered to young cancer patients who are candidates for chemotherapy. The capability of such an approach in inducing long-term preservation of ovarian function including fertility is still unknown.
