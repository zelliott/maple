C-reactive protein (CRP) binds with high affinity to fibronectin (Fn), a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), but at physiological pH the binding is inhibited by calcium ions (Ca2+). Because CRP circulates in the blood in Ca2+ -bound form, the occurrence of CRP-Fn interactions in vivo has been doubtful. To define the basis of inhibition of CRP-Fn interaction by Ca2+ at pH 7.0, we hypothesized that Fn-binding site on CRP consisted of amino acids co-ordinating Ca2+. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids co-ordinating Ca2+ drastically decreased the binding of CRP to Fn, indicating that the Ca2+ -binding site indeed formed the Fn-binding site. To determine the requirements for possible interaction between Ca2+ -bound CRP and Fn, we investigated inhibition of CRP-Fn interaction by Ca2+ as a function of pH. Ca2+ did not inhibit binding of CRP to Fn at pH 6.5 and lower. The contrasting Fn binding properties of CRP at physiological and mildly acidic pH indicated that the interaction of Ca2+ -bound CRP with Fn was controlled by pH. We conclude that the inhibition of binding of CRP to Fn by Ca2+ at pH 7.0 is a mechanism to prevent CRP-Fn interactions under normal conditions. CRP, in its Ca2+ -bound state, is capable of binding Fn but only at the inflammatory sites and tumors with low pH. CRP, Fn, and the ECM all have been implicated in cancer. Taken together our data raise the possibility that CRP-Fn interactions may change the architecture of ECM to modify the development of tumors.
