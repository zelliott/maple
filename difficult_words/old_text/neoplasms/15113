An integrative approach to the combined challenges of aging, cancer and stress is a necessary part of a global vision of wellness. Recent research into the mechanisms of aging, cancer and stress has established the biological links between these processes. Understanding these links is an important stepping-stone for developing approaches and therapies that ensure wellness throughout all stages of aging. This paper will consider the most recent developments in research into the molecular mechanisms common to aging and cancer and will discuss the effectiveness of natural approaches for preventing disease. Metabolic regulators as well as nutrient and energy sensors are involved in the processes of aging and cancer, and these are open to external manipulation and control. It is now becoming possible to demonstrate how nutrition, physical activity and stress control can lead to disease-free aging.
