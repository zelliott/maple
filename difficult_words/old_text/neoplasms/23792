Malignant neonatal tumors are rare (2% of childhood cancers, 1-2 cases/30,000 births). However, specificities in diagnosis and therapy must be underlined at this period of life; furthermore, the possibilities of antenatal sonographic diagnosis are improving and it may contribute to increase their incidence. Topographic analysis allows etiologic investigations since these tumors have the same diagnostic features as compared with older children, except Pepper's syndrome and leukemias. Therapeutic management depends on a rather good prognosis and fragility of such newborn. Indeed, surgical excision is the main step of treatment. Radiotherapy must be avoided whenever possible. Chemotherapy may be indicated (metastatic or unresectable tumors, omission or delay of irradiation in brain tumors) and has to be elaborated cautiously, according to the peculiar physiology of the neonate. Whatever the therapeutic strategy is, neonatal homeostasis must be well balanced, which implies a multidisciplinary specialized team. Respecting these conditions will help to cure more than the present 50% and better for future well being of such children.
