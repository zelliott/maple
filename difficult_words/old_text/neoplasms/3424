In order to assess the risk factors for breakthrough candidemia (candidemia occurring in patients receiving at least 3 days of systemic fluconazole or amphotericin B), 270 cases of candidemia occurring in two tertiary hospitals were analyzed. Using multivariate analysis, profound neutropenia (&lt;100/mm(3)) (odds ratio [OR], 9.14), use of corticosteroids (OR, 3.17), and heavy antibiotic exposure (previous use of 2 or more antibiotics for at least 14 days) (OR, 2.93) were identified as risk factors. Neither the susceptibility of the isolates nor the presence of a catheter was found to be a risk factor. These data suggest that gastrointestinal colonization plays a major role in the development of breakthrough candidemia.
