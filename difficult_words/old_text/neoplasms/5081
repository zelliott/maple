Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, also known as SERPINE1) is a member of the serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) superfamily and is the primary physiological regulator of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity. Although the principal function of PAI-1 is the inhibition of fibrinolysis, PAI-1 possesses pleiotropic functions besides haemostasis. In the quarter century since its discovery, a number of studies have focused on improving our understanding of PAI-1 functions in vivo and in vitro. The use of Serpine1-deficient mice has particularly enhanced our understanding of the functions of PAI-1 in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In this review, the results of recent studies on PAI-1 and its role in clinical conditions are discussed.
