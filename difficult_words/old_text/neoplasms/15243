Oncology nursing is concerned with pain relief and overall Quality of Life (QOL). The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of controlled-release morphine on QOL for patients with cancer. Eighty-three subjects were randomly assigned in a clinical trial of short-acting versus controlled-release analgesia (MS Contin, Purdue Frederick Co., Norwalk, CT). Data was collected in a repeated measures design every 2 weeks for 6 weeks yielding a total of 240 visits. Five instruments were used to assess QOL, pain, and functional status. Study findings indicate improved pain management with controlled-release MS Contin and important nursing implications for the management of analgesia-induced gastrointestinal symptoms. Through appropriate pain management with pain therapies such as controlled-release analgesia, nurses can greatly enhance QOL for the patient with cancer.
