Cancer stem cells are defined as rare cells in cancer tissues with indefinite potential for self-renewal that drives tumorigenesis. It was first extensively documented for leukaemia and multiple myeloma. It has also been found in solid cancers such as human breast cancer and nervous system tumors. Studies of cancer stem cell biology and mechanisms of tumorigenesis are lending insight into the origins of cancer and will ultimately yield new approaches to fight cancer.
