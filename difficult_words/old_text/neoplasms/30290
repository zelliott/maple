Overnight (ON) storage of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) occurs frequently in clinical settings. However, there are no standard guidelines for optimal storage conditions of freshly harvested PBSC. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of storage temperatures on the quality of autologous PBSC and establish optimal storage conditions before cryopreservation.

A retrospective analysis was performed on 260 PBSC harvests according to pre-cryopreservation conditions: immediate processing or ON storage at room temperature (RT). For direct comparison, 30 autologous PBSC products were collected prospectively and prepared under three different pre-cryopreservation conditions: immediate processing, ON storage at 4°C and ON storage at RT. The recovery of CD34(+) cells, post-thaw CFU-GM count and viability were analysed.

Retrospective analysis revealed that post-thaw CFU-GM count was significantly lower when PBSC were stored ON at RT compared to when immediately processed (136·4 vs. 409·6/μl). Prospective analysis showed a mean recovery of CD34(+) cells of 65·5 ± 25·1%, 70·5 ± 27·4% and 35·9 ± 25·1% for immediate processing, ON storage at 4°C and ON storage at RT, respectively. Similarly, mean viability and CFU-GM counts were significantly reduced when stored ON at RT compared to when immediately processed or stored ON at 4°C (60·4 ± 25·6 vs. 84·1 ± 12·9 vs. 82·7 ± 12·6%, 15·7 ± 25·7 vs. 398·5 ± 906·2 vs. 350·0 ± 847·9/μl, respectively).

ON storage of autologous PBSC at RT significantly decreased the quality of HPCs. These data indicate that ON storage of autologous PBSC at 4°C would be the most reasonable approach for maintaining the quality of HPCs when immediate processing is not possible.
