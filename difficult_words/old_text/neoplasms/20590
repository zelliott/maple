This paper introduces double ultrasound pulse transmitting and receiving circuits used in ultrasound thermometry. Using the circuits, double ultrasound pulses could be made synchronously to satisfy the requirements of ultrasound thermometry, and the weak ultrasound echo signals are received successfully. The crux experiment waveform offered shows that the circuits have high reliability.
