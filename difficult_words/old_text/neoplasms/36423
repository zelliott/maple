Two groups of mathematical models used in the quantitative assessment of cancer risk resulting from exposure to chemical substances for identifying a dose-response relationship are presented. They are as follows: statistical and stochastic models or those biologically motivated. Among statistical models, the logit, probit and Weibull models were considered. Among those biologically motivated, a one-hit model was analysed with special reference to they way from assumptions of the carcinogenesis theory to obtaining a dose-response curve. The two remaining models--multi-hit and multi-stage are discussed very briefly. An example of the fitting dose-response curves to experimental data is presented.
