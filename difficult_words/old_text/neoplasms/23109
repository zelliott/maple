A Phase I-II study with 4'-epi-doxorubicin (epi-DX) was performed in 108 patients with various types of advanced malignancy. The pattern of acute toxicity was similar to that of doxorubicin (DX). However, epi-DX was better tolerated than DX because of comparative lower incidence of vomiting, stomatitis, complete alopecia and severe myelosuppression. Cardiac toxicity was studied by utilizing noninvasive methods, and the electrocardiographic results suggested a slightly lower cardiac damage after epi-DX compared to DX. Antitumor activity was documented in a variety of neoplasms, and objective response was also observed in those considered refractory to DX such as malignant melanoma and renal cancer.
