A totally implanted venous and arterial access system was tested in 30 cancer patients. The device, an injection port (Infuse-A-Port, Infusaid Corp., Sharon, Mass.), consisted of a 3.5 by 1.5 cm conical chamber with a self-sealing silicone rubber septum connected to a Silastic catheter. Ten patents had the injection port operatively placed for arterial access. A total of 39 bolus injections and 18 continuous infusions lasting an average 5.4 +/- 3.4 days were administered through the port. The total time of arterial access ranged from 70 to 370 days. No special program of heparinization was required to maintain patency. The injection port was used for central venous access in 20 patients. The first six patients had a small lumen catheter of 0.38 mm internal diameter, and five had occlusion between 142 and 447 days. Subsequently, 19 ports with a larger catheter lumen of 0.63 mm were used. These ports functioned for an average of 274 +/- 110 days (23 to 382 days). There were 380 single bolus injections and 64 continuous infusions. A variety of anticancer agents as well as whole blood, blood products, and antibiotics were administered with the device without difficulty. Patient acceptance was excellent.
