With the advance in the molecular understanding of cancers and proliferative disorders new approaches to managing these diseases may become feasible. It has been recognized that a key feature of these diseases is the pathological alteration in the molecular machineries of signalling pathways. This recognition which began to emerge in the early 1980s induced us to explore the possibility of targetting the aberrant signalling pathways for disease therapy. I now present evidence for the validity of the approach.
