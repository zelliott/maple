Inflammation appears to be a necessity for both metastasis and elimination of tumor cells. IL-17, a proinflammatory cytokine produced by Th17 cells, contributes to both the processes by playing a dual role in the antitumor immunity. On one hand, IL-17 promotes an antitumor cytotoxic T cell response leading to tumor regression. On the other hand, by facilitating angiogenesis and egress of tumor cells from the primary focus, IL-17 promotes tumor growth. Thus, the therapeutic application that uses IL-17 needs to be refined by minimizing its protumor functions.
