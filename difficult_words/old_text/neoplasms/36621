Two major difficulties occur as soon as one is confronted to a patient suffering from chronic urticaria: the determination of an etiology that might be amenable to treatment and the establishment of an efficient treatment and satisfying follow-up for the patient. After having reviewed the different possible etiologies of chronic urticaria, this paper attempts to propose a logical diagnostic approach for the primary care physician. This will allow him to identify the etiologies that are the most common and responsive to a specific treatment and then to detail the modalities of this treatment.
