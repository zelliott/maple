Technological advances in the medical management of oncological and haematological malignancies have seen the introduction of long-term central venous access as common practice in this setting. The result of this has been an influx of a variety of lines onto the market, thus creating a minefield of choice for the practitioner. As a newly appointed Macmillan clinical nurse specialist for oncology and haematology to a unit with no established policy regarding the use of central venous catheters, the author was presented with an opportunity to introduce the most advanced line into clinical practice. In this centre the decision was made to introduce this line for a number of reasons, not only for the benefits associated with enhanced patient safety but also because of the educational and supportive role Bard Access Limited had offered. When instigating change and development it was of paramount importance that all members of the health care team were well educated regarding the use and maintenance of these lines to ensure success. This paper aims to share our experience of the Groshong line and includes a detailed audit of each line placed in a 12-month period. The information collated includes details regarding insertion method, infection rates, episodes of thrombosis and numbers of catheters removed due to malfunction.
