The formation of cancer translocations requires the physical interaction of the translocating chromosomes. It has been postulated that the nonrandom spatial organization of the genome within the cell nucleus contributes to determining the outcome of chromosomal translocation. Comparative analysis of the spatial arrangement of translocations partners and their frequency of translocation suggests that translocations occur preferentially among proximally positioned genome regions. This model makes predictions about mechanisms of translocations and the dynamic properties of genome regions in vivo. Elucidating the contribution of spatial genome organization to the formation of chromosome translocations is an integral part of understanding how translocations form in vivo and has provoked the interrogation of several fundamental aspects of genome cell biology, including tissue-specific differences in genome organization, dynamics of genomes in vivo, and the mechanisms that are determining genome organization in vivo.
