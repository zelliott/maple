Between 1979 and 1982 446 patients with clinically and bacteriologically established septicaemia were ascertained in a prospective study in a university hospital complex with 1200 beds. This corresponded to an incidence of 8,4 cases of septicaemia in 1000 admissions. In 47.1% of patients the infection had been acquired as out-patient, 52.9% were hospital-acquired. 53.1% of patients were more than 60 years of age, 71.3% had predisposing underlying diseases or risk factors. Main signs of infection were increased temperatures of more than 38.5 degrees C (77.8%), anaemia and leukocytosis. The fairly equal distribution of gram-positive (207) and gram-negative (200) organisms was remarkable. The most frequently isolated bacterial species were E. coli (25.3%), Staph. aureus (21.8%), streptococci (11.1%), Staph. epidermidis (8.4%), enterococci (8.2%), and Klebsiellae (6.5%). 29.1% of patients succumbed. Nosocomial disease, liver cirrhosis, underlying malignant diseases, infections with Staph. aureus, enterococci, pneumococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and polymicrobial aetiology had an unfavourable prognostic influence. Thus, frequency and mortality of septicaemic diseases remain of unchanged considerable relevance in medical and surgical units. At present, aetiology and treatment will again have to consider gram-negative organisms to an increased extent.
