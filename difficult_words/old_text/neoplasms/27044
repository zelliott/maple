Mucositis is a frequent side-effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Assessment of oral cavity is important to detect alterations in the mouth and plan appropriate interventions. A reliable tool can help to have a better assessment of mucositis and a major knowledge about this phenomenon. Since no valid and reliable tool for the assessment of mucositis is still available in Italy, the aim of this study was to establish the validity and reliability of the Italian version of the Oral Assessment Guide (OAG). A panel of health care experts  established the content validity of the tool both for the items and the descriptors. To establish the reliability of the tool, a sample of 14 inpatients with haematological diseases were recruited. Couples of dental hygienists separately performed 60 pairs of assessments (for a total of 120 assessments) on the sample. The Italian version of OAG was found to have an acceptable Content Validity Index (CVI) for items and related descriptors ranging between 0.67 and 1. Cronbach's alpha was 0.84, agreement of assessment ranged between 0.87 and 0.65 with Cohen's Kappa coefficient  ranging from good to very good. This study showed that the Italian version of the OAG has good psychometric properties of validity and reliability to assess mucositis  in patients undergoing chemotherapy. This tool will have a great importance to carry out future research in Italy aimed to  improve the patient's outcomes particularly in terms of functional ability and quality of life.
