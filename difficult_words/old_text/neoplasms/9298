Virtually every surgical oncology patient faces pain, and it can become a major barrier to rehabilitation and quality of life. Pain must be assessed as to its severity, etiology (somatic, visceral, or neuropathic), causation (directly from malignancy or from treatment side effects), and its impact on daily function. Treatments can include physical modalities, exercise, opioids, adjuvant medications, and interventional techniques. Barriers to treatment may include side effects, finances, and attitudes. New technologies in medication delivery systems, intrathecal pumps, injections, and surgery have greatly strengthened the armamentarium available to manage pain.
