In 31 children with different cytostatic treated malignancies delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity (DCH) and their relationship to different peripheral white blood-cell counts was investigated. DCH was assessed by a multi-antigen-test device, which allows the simultaneous intracutaneous application of 7 standardized recall-antigen solutions. The grade of DCH reaction was measured by a "score", which reflects the sum of the diameters of all single positive reactions. The follow-up time was 3 years for each patient. At start of therapy 17 out of 31 children had pathologically decreased score values. In 16 out of these 17 children score values increased to normal during the cytostatic treatment. Patients with score values increasing from low to normal had a significant better outcome of their disease than patients with other score courses. A good correlation was found between an increase of score values and tumor-mass reduction. No positive correlation between the score and the peripheral white blood-cell counts could be evaluated, but a significant reciprocal correlation was found between the score and the peripheral absolute lymphocyte counts. Cytostatic drugs had no influence on the score. The results suggest, that the DCH can reveal immunological alterations, which are caused by the extent of tumor burden and by specific influences on the immune system and which are almost not influenced by the administration of cytostatic drugs.
