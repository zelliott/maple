Our study compared cancer incidence rates and stage distribution between non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanic Whites in the United States between 1992 and 2009.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted for the years 1992 through 2009.

Data represent 13 registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, which reflect 14% of the total US population.

The incidence rates for most cancer sites were significantly higher in non-Hispanic Whites than in Hispanic Whites. Exceptions included cancers of the stomach and liver and, for females only, kidney and renal pelvis and cervix uteri. Overall, cancer incidence in non-Hispanic Whites was 40% greater in males and 34% greater in females as compared with Hispanic Whites. Cancer sites with higher incidence rates among non-Hispanic Whites than Hispanic Whites in 2009 compared with 1992 were melanoma, thyroid cancer, oral cavity and pharynx cancer, lymphoma, urinary bladder cancer, and all cancers combined for males and melanoma, thyroid cancer, cervical cancer, and lung and bronchus cancer for females. However, difference in rates narrowed between the ethnicities for colon and rectal cancer and corpus and uterus cancer. Non-Hispanic Whites tended to have a higher percentage of early staged cancer, with little evidence that disparity between the ethnic groups was narrowing in terms of early detection. However, two exceptions involved liver cancer and thyroid cancer in females. The disparity appeared to widen for lung cancer in males.

Cancer incidence rates are generally lower in Hispanic Whites than non-Hispanic Whites. The difference in rates between groups has widened over the study period for many cancer sites, with a few exceptions. Poorer screening practices among Hispanic Whites have tended to persist.
