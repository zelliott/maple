This study was designed to evaluate and characterize the molecular basis of antitumor activity of naturally occurring resveratrol (RES; 3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) derivatives. The compounds were isolated from plants in previous studies and characterized spectroscopically. The antitumor activities of 31 RES derivatives, including dimers, trimers, and tetramers of RES, were evaluated using cell-based assays and validated on a murine model. Several trimeric and a tetrameric stilbenoids induced tumor cell apoptosis or growth arrest of several tumor cell lines with IC50 values (2.8-19.7 μM), significantly lower than that of RES (IC50&gt;70 μM). Using pauciflorol B (PauB) as an example, we showed that the compound induced apoptosis p53 dependently, inducing p53 accumulation and p53-modulated gene expression in cells with wild-type p53, but not in those with nonfunctional p53. Reexpression of p53 in p53-null cells rescued cell death response. In parallel, the MAPK/p38 was activated and critical for PauB-induced killing. Interestingly, activation of p38 in p53 deficient cells was sufficient to drive cells into senescence via the p16-pRb pathway. Finally, PauB dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth on nude mice. Naturally occurring trimeric and tetrameric stilbenoids are potent antitumor agents. Those compounds exert antitumor effect through p53-dependent induction of apoptosis or senescence.
