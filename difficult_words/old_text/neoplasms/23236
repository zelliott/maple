PERA/Ei (PE) mice are susceptible to tumor induction by polyomavirus (Py), while C57BR/cdJ (BR) mice are resistant. Antigen-presenting cells from BR mice respond to the virus with interleukin-12 (IL-12) and those from PE mice with IL-10. These polarized cytokine responses underlie the development of effective antitumor immunity in BR mice and the lack thereof in PE mice. An ex vivo cytokine production assay using spleen cells from infected [PE × BR] F2 mice together with a genome-wide SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism)-based QTL (quantitative trait locus) analysis was used to map the determinant of cytokine production to a region of chromosome 4 carrying the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene. Genotyping of infected F2 mice showed concordance of TLR4 allele-specific DNA sequences with the cytokine profile. Cytokine responses elicited by Py are MyD88 dependent. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known TLR4 ligand, induced the same polarized responses as the virus in these host strains. Spleen cells from C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScNJ LPS-nonresponsive mice challenged in vitro with Py showed an impaired IL-12 response but were unaffected in IL-10 production. TLR4s of strains PE and BR differ by 3 amino acid substitutions, 2 in the extracellular domain and 1 in the intracellular domain. cDNAs encoding the TLR4s signaled equally to an NF-κB reporter in 293 cells in a ligand-independent manner. When introduced into TLR2/TLR4 double-knockout macrophages, the TLR4 cDNA from BR mice conferred a robust IL-12 response to Py and no IL-10 response. The TLR4 cDNA from PE mice failed to confer a response with either cytokine. These results establish TLR4 as a key mediator of the cytokine response governing susceptibility to tumor induction by Py.
