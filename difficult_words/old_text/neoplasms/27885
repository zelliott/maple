Activities of arginase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase were determined in sera obtained in a group of healthy women, women with verified carcinoma of the breast, benign mastopathy, a group of patients with carcinoma of various organs and a group of patients with acute viral hepatitis. Preoperative values of serum arginase activity in patients with breast carcinoma were up to 4-fold those found in healthy women. Sensitivity of the test was 86%. After the surgery, the activity decreased abruptly during the first week and normalised within 15-30 days. In benign diseases of the breast, the activity of arginase was normal. Serum arginase activity is raised in both benign and malignant liver diseases, however, the quotients alanine aminotransferase/arginase, aspartate aminotransferase/arginase and alkaline phosphatase/arginase differ significantly. Thus, use of alanine aminotransferase/arginase quotient implies a high degree of confidence in differentiating between increased arginase activity in mammary carcinoma (alanine aminotransferase/arginase = 0.572 +/- 0.278) and high arginase activity in hepatitis (alanine aminotransferase/arginase = 12.226 +/- 1.822).
