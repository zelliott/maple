The objective of this paper is to give an overview of the epidemiological studies completed in Italy during the past 25 years, about the role of occupational exposures on the development of adverse health effects on women. The implications for research developments are also discussed. The epidemiological investigations of selected categories of work-related health effects published in Italy in the years 1970-1995 were identified from the medical literature databases. The total number of studies is 142, including cohort mortality studies (n = 12), case-control studies of different neoplasms (n = 14), investigations of adverse reproductive effects (n = 8) and studies of occupational diseases different from the above (n = 94). In most investigations, women workers were not the main study objective and hence the number of females under study was small. The conclusions is that in Italy, given the dearth of studies of female workers and the preponderance of women in many economic sectors, i.e. the textile and shoe industry, health care, personal services and schools, there is a need to identify women workers in the above industries and occupations as priorities for epidemiological research and surveillance.
