The aim of this article is to highlight the link between bisphosphonates and osteonecrotic lesions of the jaws ("osteochemonecrosis") and to alert general practitioners to the implications these drugs may have on their day-to-day practice. We review the use of this class of drug, the indications for which have widened recently, describe their effect on bone metabolism and outline the proposed mechanism for bisphosphonate-induced osteochemonecrosis. Predisposing and initiating factors and management are outlined, and suggestions made as to how the dental profession can help with this increasingly prevalent problem.
