The accumulating data from all randomized trials conducted by the Cancer Therapy Committee (CTC) of the British Medical Research Council are monitored on a regular basis. However, for important practical reasons the form of this data monitoring may vary from trial to trial. Thus a trial addressing what is considered a major question in the treatment of cancer patients, (a 'pivotal' or 'high profile' trial), has a formal data monitoring committee (DMC). This is usually made up of two clinicians and one statistician who are completely independent of the trial organization and do not enter patients into the trial. Other trials, which constitute the majority, are monitored by a less formal trial progress group made up of the clinical co-ordinator and trial statistician, sometimes supplemented by a trial participant. Experience with this dual system has led to a new proposal: if the trial progress group wish to modify or stop a trial then they are required to set up and consult an ad hoc DMC for independent advice. This proposal has many advantages, including maximizing the use of resources available, while achieving the degree of objectivity in decision-making required for the many different types of cancer trials conducted by the CTC.
