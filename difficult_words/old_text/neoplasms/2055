The inactivation of antioncogenes has been postulated to be important in the development of human malignancies. In 1986, a cDNA clone of the putative retinoblastoma antioncogene (Rb gene) has been isolated by molecular genetic approach. Recent work has shown that the neoplastic phenotype of retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma cells can be suppressed by the introduction of a cloned Rb gene. Interestingly, the product of the Rb gene has recently been shown to associate with the transforming proteins of DNA tumor viruses.
