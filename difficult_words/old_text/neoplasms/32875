Misonidazole has been given to a total of 87 patients. Neurotoxicity has occurred--convulsions with the higher doses and peripheral neuropathy with the lowern ones. The data from 34 patients receiving 4--7 doses has been analysed. Peripheral neuropathy is related to the total tissue exposure. By monitoring serum levels and controlling the total dose given, convulsions are avoidable and peripheral neuropathy restricted to a low and acceptable level.
