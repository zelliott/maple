To address the limited tumor penetration of nanoparticle drug delivery vehicles, we report the first pH-responsive polypeptide micelle that dissociates at the low extracellular pH of solid tumors. This histidine-rich elastin-like polypeptide block copolymer self-assembles at 37 Â°C into spherical micelles that are stabilized by Zn(2+) and are disrupted as the pH drops from 7.4 to 6.4. These pH-sensitive micelles demonstrate better in vivo penetration and distribution in tumors than a pH-insensitive control.
