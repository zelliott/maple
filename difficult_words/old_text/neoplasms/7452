Transfer factor (TF) is a dialysable and ultrafilterable extract from human leukocytes. It contains only substances with a molecular weight of less than 10 000. Several biological activities of TF are so far known. These refer to the transfer of specific cellular immunity from one individual to another and a stimulating effect, probably of an unspecific nature, on the cellular immune system. So far, favorable therapeutic results have been obtained in chronic candidiasis and a few other chronic infectious diseases, in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and possibly also in some special malignant tumors. The small number of treatments does not permit any firm conclusions to be drawn.
