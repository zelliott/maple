This DNA vaccines conference was aimed at examining the viability of DNA vaccines as a credible prophylactic/therapeutic technology rather than simply as an effective research tool. Presentations and panel discussion sessions focused on many of the issues facing the sector, including efficacy, manufacturing costs and public acceptability of the technology. Clinical trial data were presented for DNA vaccines in development for both human and veterinary use, including cancer, HIV infection and malaria. Presentations also covered delivery technologies (microparticles, electroporation and epidermal 'tattooing'), and the manufacturing industry reported on the latest production advances. Issues concerning human vaccine development are covered in this review.
