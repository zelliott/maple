The eukaryotic DNA is wrapped around histone octamers, which consist of four different histones, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. The N-terminal tail of each histone is post-transcriptionally modified. The modification patterns constitute codes that regulate chromatin organisation and DNA utilization processes, including transcription. Recent progress in technology development has made it possible to perform systematic genome-wide studies of histone modifications. This helps immensely in deciphering the histone codes and their biological influence. In this review, we discuss the histone modification patterns found in genome-wide studies in different biological models and how they influence cell differentiation and carcinogenesis.
