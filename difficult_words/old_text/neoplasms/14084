Progress in organic-technical medicine has been considerable in the field of oncology. Since cancer patients are confronted with enormous psychological problems both by their disease and its treatment, improvement in the psychological care of these patients is an absolute necessity. At present, help in coping with cancer is seldom provided. Psychological care of cancer patients would be of great importance for improving the quality of life, which always has to be assessed according to the patient's subjective point of view. The aim should be to keep patients not only alive but also all terms with life. In the terminal stages pain relief and consolidation of the sick are prerequisites for dying in dignity.
