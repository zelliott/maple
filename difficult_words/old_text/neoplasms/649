We developed a novel dual-modal contrast agent for the structural and functional imaging of cancer. The contrast agent was fabricated by encapsulating indocyanine green (ICG) in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microbubbles using a modified double-emulsion method. More stabilized absorption and fluorescence emission characteristics were observed for aqueous and plasma suspensions of ICG-encapsulated microbubbles. The technical feasibility of concurrent structural and functional imaging was demonstrated through a series of benchtop tests in which the aqueous suspension of ICG-encapsulated microbubbles was injected into a transparent tube embedded in an Intralipid phantom at different flow rates and concentrations. Concurrent fluorescence imaging and B-mode ultrasound imaging successfully captured the changes of microbubble flow rate and concentration with high linearity and accuracy. One potential application of the proposed ICG-encapsulated PLGA microbubbles is for the identification and characterization of peritumoral neovasculature for enhanced coregistration between tumor structural and functional boundaries in ultrasound-guided near-infrared diffuse optical tomography.
