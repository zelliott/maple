Severe impairment of the lymphopoietic cell renewal system is an important etiological factor of cancer development and it may be the consequence of massive radio and/or chemotherapeutic regimens. In a comparative study, we analysed the potential, systemic immunorestoratory capacity of bestatin, a microbial leucil-aminopeptidase inhibitor and of the ubiquitous trace element zinc. In vivo administration of bestatin in mice stimulated both Interleukin 1 and Interleukin 2 production, and enhanced T cell, B cell as well as macrophage mediated immunoreactions. In a phase II clinical trial on 41 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin disease and solid tumors, bestatin treatment corrected the pathological frequency of both OKT4 and OKT8 lymphocyte subpopulations. Zinc-saturated transferrin had a significative stimulatory effect on the ongoing DNA synthesis of antigen activated human lymphocytes in culture. Oral administration of zinc-gluconate to patients who manifested a severe T cell subpopulation defect corrected preferentially the OKT8 suppressor/cytotoxic T cell unbalances. The clinical results obtained by both bestatin and zinc were observed only on a short-term, so further studies are needed to elaborate long lasting regiments and to establish whether these treatments have determinant influence on the underlying disease.
