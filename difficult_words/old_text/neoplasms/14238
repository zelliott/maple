Plasma levels of selected hematopoietic cytokines: interleukin 3 ( IL-3), stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and the tumor marker carcinoma antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) in breast cancer (BC) patients were investigated and compared to control groups: benign breast tumor patients and healthy subjects.

Cytokine levels were determined by ELISA, CA 15-3 - using the CMIA method.

A significant differences in the concentration of cytokines (with the exception of IL-3) and CA15-3 between the groups of BC patients, benign breast tumor patients and the healthy controls have been demonstrated. M-CSF has demonstrated higher or equal to CA 15-3 values of diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and the predictive values of positive and negative test results. The M-CSF area under the ROC curve (AUC) was the largest from all the cytokines tested and marginally lower than the AUC of CA 15-3.

These findings suggest the usefulness of M-CSF in diagnosing breast cancer, especially when discriminating between cancer and non-carcinoma lesions.
