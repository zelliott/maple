A new heterologous system of radioimmunoassay (p24 of bovine leukemia virus--antiserum to Rous sarcoma virus) has been developed which demonstrated for the first time the existence of a common antigenic determinant in the major inner protein of unrelated oncoviruses: avian leukemia-sarcoma virus, bovine leukemia virus, mammalian type C viruses (mouse, hamster, monkey) and type D viruses (simian Mason-Pfizer virus). These data suggest a common origin of unrelated oncoviruses and open new approaches for the search of unknown agents associated with human and animal neoplastic diseases.
