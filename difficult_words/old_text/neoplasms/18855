The presence of boron atoms has made carboranes, C(2)B(10)H(12), attractive candidates for boron neutron capture therapy. Because of their chemistry and possible conjugation with proteins, they can also be used to enhance interactions between pharmaceuticals and their targets and to increase the in vivo stability and bioavailability of compounds that are normally metabolized rapidly. Carboranes are isosteric to a rotating phenyl group, which they can substitute successfully in biologically active systems. A reverse ligand-protein docking approach was used in this work to identify binding proteins for carboranes. The screening was carried out on the drug target database PDTD that contains 1207 entries covering 841 known potential drug targets with structures taken from the Protein Data Bank. First, for validation, the protocol was applied to three crystal structures of proteins in which carborane derivatives are present. Then, the model was applied to systems for which the protein structure is available, but the binding site of carborane has not been reported. These systems were used for further validation of the protocol, while simultaneously providing new insight into the interactions between cage and protein. Finally, the screening was carried out on the database to reveal potential carborane binding targets of interest for biological and pharmacological activity. Carboranes are predicted to bind well to protease and metalloprotease enzymes. Other carborane pharmaceutical targets are also discussed, together with possible protein carriers.
