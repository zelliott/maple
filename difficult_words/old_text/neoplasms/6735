Progressive and continuing advances in the care of the child with cancer have resulted in potential cure of over 50% of our children. However, no matter how encouraging these statistics, nearly one half of our children now die from their disease. To bring the family through the cancer experience, we must meet the challenge of attending to their practical, spiritual, emotional and experiential requirement from diagnosis, treatment through possible relapse, death, hoped for cure, and survival as an adult with the stigmata of a history of cancer as an obstacle to jobs, insurance, and productive lives, and the further shadow of a possible late second cancer caused by their curative treatment. Families require access to a firm, unfragmented foundation of support, incorporating a multidisciplinary network of resources, involving the combined efforts of the primary health care team and the family's community. Medical and emotional counseling, peer support, spiritual guidance, and special community services contribute to the optimal care of both patient and family. In addition, legal advisory assistance and help with financial planning are important ingredients in assisting families.
