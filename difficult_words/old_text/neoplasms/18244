soluble urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (suPAR) levels reflect inflammation and elevated suPAR levels are found in several infectious diseases and cancer. suPAR exists in three forms; suPAR(I-III), suPAR(II-III) and suPAR(I) which show different properties due to structural differences. Studies suggest that full-length suPAR is a regulator of uPAR/uPA by actingas uPA-scavenger, whereas the cleaved suPAR(II-III) act as a chemotactic agent promoting the immune response via the SRSRY sequence in the linker-region. This review focus on the various suPAR fragments and their involvement in inflammation and pathogenic processes. We focus on the molecular mechanisms of the suPAR fragments and the link to the inflammatory process,as this could lead to medical applications in infectious and pathological conditions.
