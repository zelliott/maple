A self-administered dietary assessment questionnaire was developed for the microcomputer to identify individuals whose dietary patterns may put them at risk for cancer. It was tested among 50 adult volunteers in a New York school district. The quantitative food frequency portion of the questionnaire (FFQ), administered twice one month apart, was reproducible for calories, fat, percentage of calories from fat, cholesterol, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and dietary fiber (Spearman r = 0.56-0.87). To test for relative validity, individual nutrient intake calculated from each administration of the FFQ was compared with the nutrient intake calculated from seven-day food records collected one month after the second FFQ administration. Nutrient intake from the first and second FFQ compared with food record nutrient intake yielded a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.58 and 0.62, respectively, for percentage of kilocalories from fat. No significant difference in mean intake of percentage of calories from fat was found between the FFQ 1 and FFQ 2 or between the FFQs and the food record. However, there were significant differences between mean food record and FFQ estimates of kilocalories, fat, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and dietary fiber. We concluded that computerized nutrient assessment, which utilizes the subject in data entry, may be suitable for some clinical and educational uses and research studies of intake of fat as a percentage of calories among healthy adults.
