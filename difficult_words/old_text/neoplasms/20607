The role of high mobility group (HMG) proteins and their poly-ADP-ribosylation (PAR) in betel nut induced initiation of carcinogenesis in mice has been studied. A known carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was used as a positive control. Swiss albino mice were chronically exposed to aqueous extract of betel nut (AEBN) or DEN at low doses for up to 4 weeks. The poly-ADP-ribosylation (PAR) of spleen cell HMG proteins was monitored using [32P]-NAD+. Parallel to this, chromatin was subjected to DNase I cleavage and the organizational state of the chromatin was monitored. The PAR of HMG proteins showed a marked progressive reduction at different times following AEBN- or DEN treatment. HMG proteins isolated from the control and carcinogen treated mice were allowed to reassociate with the untreated spleen cells chromatin. The reassociated chromatin showed progressive relaxation in its superstructure. The results suggest that under the influence of potential carcinogens AEBN or DEN, the mouse spleen cell HMG proteins created molecular conditions favourable to initiation of cancer.
