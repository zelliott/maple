This annual meeting was organised by R Sobol and A Deisseroth (Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, San Diego, CA, USA) and K Scanlon (Keck Graduate Institute, Claremont, CA, USA). The meeting covered a wide range of topics in cancer gene therapy and included five sessions. The topics were: (1) Tumour suppressors/apoptosis/antisense-ribozymes/angiogenesis; (2) Vector systems; (3) Therapy sensitisation/'suicide' gene therapy; (4) Haematopoietic gene transfer; and (5) Poster/discussion sessions. The following meeting highlights have focused mainly on the recent progress in antisense/ribozyme-based approaches useful for cancer gene target validation and drug development.
