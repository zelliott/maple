Rubidazone, a semisynthetic daunorubicin derivative, was administered to 33 patients with advanced solid tumors or malignant lymphomas. The doses used were 200, 150, or 100 mg/m2 repeated at 3-week intervals. The antitumor effect was very modest. Partial remission was obtained in only one patient and stable disease was observed for periods of 4--18 weeks in seven additional patients. The major toxic effects were gastrointestinal and myelosuppressive. In two patients, cardiac toxic effects were noted and one patient had an anaphylactic-like reaction. No clinical cross-resistance seemed to exist between rubidazone and adriamycin.
