Controlled intracellular protein degradation is crucial for the maintenance of normal cell functions. An evolving concept claims that alterations in the exact timely degradation of proteins involved in growth control, apoptosis, signaling and differentiation contribute to carcinogenesis. This tightly regulated process is facilitated by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system, a multi-enzyme complex, and inhibitors of this pathway have already been developed as potential anticancer agents. In order to generate proteasomal protein expression patterns of tumor cells and to provide an analytical tool we applied two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF with LIFT technology) in ten individual tumor cell lines (Saos-2; SK-N-SH; HCT-116; Caov3; A-549; HL60; A-673; A-375; MCF-7; HeLa) widely used in tumor research. A series of 39 proteasomal/proteolytic proteins was unambiguously identified by this proteomic approach, comprising proteins of the 20S core complex, the 19S regulatory complex, the 11S regulator, components of the ubiquitin pathway and proteases. Construction of individual protein maps by 2-DE and mass spectrometry provides an analytical tool and reference base for studying the pivotal importance of the proteasome and other proteolytic enzymes in tumor cells, independent of antibody availability and specificity. This preliminary database enables for designing studies in this area of research and reveals proteins that can be used as targets for new therapeutic strategies.
