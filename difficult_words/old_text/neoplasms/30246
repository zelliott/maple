A computer model of the spatial structure of transketolase-like protein (TKTL1), a marker of certain tumor tissues, has been constructed using the known spatial structure of transketolase found in normal human tissues. The structure of the two proteins at all levels of their organization has also been compared. On the basis of the revealed differences in structures of these proteins, we assume it is unlikely that TKTL1 can be a thiamine diphosphate-dependent protein capable of catalyzing the transketolase reaction.
