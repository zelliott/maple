Recombinant, soluble TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is currently being developed as a promising natural immune molecule for trial in cancer patients because it selectively induces apoptosis in transformed or stressed cells but not in most normal cells. In cancer patients, phase 1 and 2 clinical trials using agonistic mAbs that engage the human TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 have also provided encouraging results. It is now evident that TRAIL suppresses autoimmune disease in various experimental animal models, suggesting that the therapeutic value of recombinant TRAIL and agonistic DR4 and DR5 mAbs might also extend to the suppression of autoimmune disease. This review provides an insight into our current understanding of the role(s) of TRAIL in disease, with a specific focus on cancer and autoimmunity. We also emphasize biological agents and drugs that sensitize tumour cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and discuss the potential molecular basis for their sensitization.
