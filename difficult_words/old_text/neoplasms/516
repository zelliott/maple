Application of the refractometric method for estimating intramolecular sorption of hydrocarbon by proteins permitted detecting some differences in the hydrophobic structure of immunoglobulin G peculiar to the malignant growth and of immunoglobin G of the healthy organism. An increase in the specific hydrophobic capacity of immunoglobulin G peculiar to the malignant growth due to large hydrophobic regions makes it possible to conclude that this protein globular packing is less compact and looser.
