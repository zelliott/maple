Porfiromycin was given to a group of patients with a variety of solid tumors. Of 114 patients admitted to the study, 103 yielded evaluable data. The following dosage schedules were used to determine the toxicity of porfiromycin when given in multiple doses by intravenous injection: 0.2 mg/kg x 5 days, 0.3 mg/kg x 5 days, 0.35 mg/kg x 5 days, 0.4 mg/kg x 5 days, 0.24 mg/kg x 10 days and 0.6 mg/kg weekly. Toxic effects noted were mainly leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and, when injected paravenously, local tissue necrosis. Biological effects were noted at all dosage levels and were more severe at the higher dosages. The data suggest that profiromycin administered intravenously at a dose of 0.35 mg/kg daily for 5 days results in moderate hermatological toxicity and clinical evaluation in a Phase II study at this dosage level is indicated.
