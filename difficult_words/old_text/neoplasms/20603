Our paper aims at indicating the disadvantageous epidemiological situation concerning cancer, which constitutes the second most important health problem after cardiovascular diseases in the Lodz voivodeship. Our statistical calculations are based on data for 1999-2001 provided by the Department of Demographic Studies of the Statistical Office, by the Regional Centre for Public Health in Lodz and by the Centre of Oncology in Warsaw. Cancer caused 6832 deaths in our region in 2001, i.e. more than one death in five (22.03%). The analysis of mortality curves by sex shows the impact of cancer on the phenomenon of excessive male mortality in nearly all age groups. The specific mortality rate amounted to 296.6 out of 100,000 males, and 209.5 out of 100,000 females. The median reached 68.2 years for males and 70.1 for females, whereas the modal was 71.4 and 76.3 years, respectively. The structure of cancer deaths in 2000 according to ICD-10 indicates the most serious problem among males: lung cancer (the proportional mortality rate was 31.9% and the specific mortality amounted to 94.3 out of 100,000), and among females: the neoplasm of the large intestine (the proportional mortality rate was 12.1% and the specific mortality amounted to 23.9 out of 100,000). Cancer mortality rates for the populations of the Lodz voivodeship, Poland and the United States have been compared by applying the method of direct standardisation.
