Angiogenesis, the growth of new capillary blood vessels, is a multistep process required for tumor growth and metastasis. The significant correlation between density of microvessels and occurrence of metastasis was shown in cutaneous melanoma, cancers of breast, lung (non-small-cell), and bladder. It has been shown that heparin play a crucial role in angiogenesis. In this review the mechanism of this regulation was summarized, and it was compared to action of specific antagonists of heparin in angiogenesis. It is known that heparin can promote this process, but some fractions may not. Knowing the complex action of heparin in the angiogenesis, the exact role of heparin in tumor growth and metastasis is unknown. Therefore, we suggest that it is needed to confirm if an use of heparin for treating patients with cancer can prolong their survival.
