The present-day therapeutical programmes allow physicians to cure as many as 70% of children with malignant neoplasms, in some tumor forms, the proportion of recovered children is much higher, which shows it urgent to elaborate comprehensive rehabilitation programmes required for the effective integration of prior patients of children's cancer clinics into a group. The paper presents a complex rehabilitation programme worked out at the Research Institute of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Russian Cancer Research Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. The basic directions of the programme are medical, psychological, pedagogical, and social rehabilitation. For medical rehabilitation, phytotherapy, medical laser, climate therapy, and therapeutical exercises are widely used. Of particular value are physical and recreational activities, which include the use of therapeutical exercises, active recreational activities, participation in sporting events, and conditioning swimming. Psychological and pedagogical rehabilitation is aimed at solving personality and familial problems, at developing intellectual abilities, and at eliminating steady-state bad habits and behavioral deviations. A psychological and pedagogical programme is based on the work of art-therapeutical shops where a child realizes his/her strivings, which promotes the recovery of his/her mental and social status. The work of psychologists and psychotherapeutists with children's parents occupies a highly important place since correction of child-parent relations serves as a necessary basis for mental recovery in a child. The most important factor of social rehabilitation is an educational programme aimed at acquiring knowledge and at stimulating cognitive activities. To implement the comprehensive programme increases life quality in children who have sustained cancer diseases, improves their social adaptation and thus facilitates integration of these children in society.
