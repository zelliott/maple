Major changes are taking place at a great pace in modern medicine, and surgical oncologists are at the forefront when new skills are to be tested and implemented. Perhaps the most significant change we are facing relates to the aging of our population, with most solid tumors presenting at age 70 years (+/- 5 years). The demographics and epidemiological details are covered in the appropriate sections of this special issue, but it is important to realize how such a shift influences our day-to-day practice. These principally are occurring in improved anesthetic care, minimally invasive surgery, nonoperative therapies, risk assessment, and quality-of-life estimates.
