Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)is a key mediator in angiogenesis, an essential step in tumor growth and metastasis. Elevated levels of VEGF observed in solid tumors are correlated with worse clinical outcomes. Research has therefore focused on developing agents that target VEGF to inhibit tumor growth. Bevacizumab(Avastin), a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF. Bevacizumab with conventional chemotherapy has shown antitumor activity in several cancer types with acceptable toxicity. In April 2007, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved bevacizumab for patients with unresectable colorectal cancer.
