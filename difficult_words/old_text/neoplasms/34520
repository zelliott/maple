Antivascular and targeted therapy are now an integrated part of the treatment of myelogenous leukemias, GIST tumours, B-cell lymphomas and breast cancer. In various malignancies improved responses and prolongation of survival for several months is regularly reported. The progress in this field is relevant for hyperthermia. Heat has among other effects documented antivascular effects, and can be considered as one of the established methods in the field based on several randomised phase III studies. Hyperthermia should be considered for combination with other antiangiogenic agents.
