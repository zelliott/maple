Stem cells have been shown to exist in a variety of tissues. Recent studies have characterized stem cell gene expression patterns, phenotypes, and potential therapeutic uses. One of the most important properties of stem cells is that of self renewal. This raises the possibility that some of the clinical properties of human tumors may be due to transformed stem cells. Similar signaling pathways may regulate self renewal in normal and transformed stem cells. These rare transformed stem cells may drive the process of tumorigenesis due to their potential for self renewal. There are important ramifications for clinical cancer treatment if the growth of solid tumors is at least partially dependent on a cancer stem cell population. In the cancer stem cell model, tumor recurrence may be due to the non-targeted stem cell compartment repopulating the tumor. If cancer stem cells can be prospectively identified and isolated, it should be possible to identify therapies that will selectively target these cells.
