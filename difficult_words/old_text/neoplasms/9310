The literature suggests that cancer survivors with more aggressive treatments are more at risk for postcancer fatigue. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of fatigue after completion of stem cell transplantation (SCT). Furthermore, we studied if medical variables are associated with fatigue and if the model of perpetuating factors of postcancer fatigue derived from previous studies in cancer survivors, without SCT, is applicable in SCT survivors. Ninety-eight patients treated with autologous or allogeneic SCT filled out several questionnaires. Medical characteristics were obtained from the medical charts. All patients had to be in persistent complete remission for at least 1 year. Thirty-five per cent of the patients experienced severe fatigue. The percentage of patients with severe fatigue remained stable during the years after transplantation. Several psychosocial factors, but no medical factors, were associated with fatigue. The model of perpetuating factors appeared to be applicable. Contrary to cancer survivors without SCT, we found no decrease in fatigue complaints during the first years after SCT. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is a general form of psychotherapy directed at changing condition-related cognitions and behaviours. CBT especially designed for postcancer fatigue, aimed at perpetuating factors, can also be used to manage fatigue in cancer survivors treated with SCT.
