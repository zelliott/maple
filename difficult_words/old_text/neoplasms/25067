Gene silencing mediated by siRNA has been widely investigated as a potential therapeutic approach. The success of these therapies depends on effective systems capable of selectively and efficiently conveying siRNA to targeted cells/organs with minimal toxicity.

This review discusses current experimental approaches to siRNA delivery strategies available for arthritis treatment and the management of other musculoskeletal disorders. The review covers literature on the subject from 2000 to 2010.

In the last decade, extensive improvements have been made to optimize siRNA-based gene therapy and have been tested on several arthritis and orthopedic conditions. However, except for Phase I - II DNA-based gene therapy trials on arthritis, no clinical studies have reported siRNA application in these domains.

Most musculoskeletal disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, fracture, aseptic loosening, cartilage and intervertebral disc degeneration are non-fatal and age-related chronic inflammatory conditions, but represent significant morbidity and a socio-economic burden. siRNA-based gene therapy offers treatment opportunities that are less invasive, more effective and less expensive than existing modalities. Future directions for siRNA therapy include the development of safe and more efficient delivery systems and the selection of optimal gene targets for disease control.
