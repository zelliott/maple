The authors report two cases of paralysis of the posterior branch of the radial nerve as a result of compression of the nerve by a benign tumour, in both instances a lipoma. Analysis of the sixteen cases appearing in the literature reveals that the symptoms and signs are constant, characterised by the progressive development of paralysis of the muscles supplied by the deep branch of the radial nerve with the appearance of a tumefaction around the lateral part of the elbow. X-rays of the elbow confirm the diagnosis in the presence of a radiotranslucent polylobulated image. Surgical excision  is followed by regression and the disappearance of a-l neurological signs after an average period of 8 months. In addition to a lipoma, compression may be caused by repeated contusion of the nerve by the border of the superficial part of the short supinator muscle in association with "tennis elbow". Section of this part of the muscle border results in complete recovery.
