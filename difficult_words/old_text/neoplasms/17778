We present an analysis of a stochastic model of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor. This analysis addresses the contribution of ligand-binding-induced oligomerization, activation of src-homology 2 domain-carrying kinases and receptor internalization in the overall behaviour of the VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) system. The analysis is based upon a generalization of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation of the solution of the corresponding master equation. We predict that tumour-mediated overexpression of VEGFRs in the endothelial cells (ECs) of tumour-engulfed vessels leads to an increased sensitivity of the ECs to low concentrations of VEGF, thus endowing the tumour with increased resistance to anti-angiogenic treatment.
