In the human body, the production of three polyamines--putrescine, spermidine and spermine--is largely associated with tissue growth, while that of a fourth--cadaverine--seems to be the result of bacterial action. In 37 (88%) of 42 cancer patients and in 24 (44%) of 54 patients with various nonmalignant diseases, increased amounts of polyamines were found in the urine. In the nonmalignant group, which served as a control group, the increased polyamine excretion was especially evident in patients with infections. There were, however, differences in the excretion patterns of the cancer and control groups: combinations of elevated levels of putrescine, spermidine and spermine were seen exclusively in the cancer patients; spermine was not found in the urine of women in the control group. The determination of urinary polyamines appears to hold promise as an aid in the diagnosis of malignant disease and in following up the results of therapy.
