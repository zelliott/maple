A longitudinal study was made in a single individual of the effects of 5 increasing doses of diethylstilbestrol, alternated with peroids of no treatment, on the concentration of serum sialic acid, haptoglobin, beta-glucumonidase,  thyroxine-binding globulin, ceruloplasmin, plasminogen, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids.  Except for salic acid and haptoglobin, all these substances reacted with the same pattern of increase during treatment and returned toward control values during the periods off treatment.  The responses of corticosteroid-binding globulin and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids were most closely correlated with r=.91 (p..001).  They were responsive to a dosage of .1 mg per day of diethylstilbestrol.
