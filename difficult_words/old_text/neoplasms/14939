The discovery of stem cells in the adult central nervous system implied the potential for endogenous repair and exogenous cell-based therapeutics. The development of experimental protocols, like the neurosphere assay and the neural-colony forming cell assay, enable the accurate and meaningful investigation of neural stem cell properties and allow the exploration of mechanisms related to the role of neural stem cells in aging and cancer.
