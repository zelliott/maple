A nanohybrid based on nanoscale graphene oxide (NGO) and dextran has been designed and employed for effectively killing drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells. This graphene-based nanohybrid was readily prepared through π-π interaction of NGO and hematin-terminated dextran (HDex), being denoted as NGO-HDex. It revealed an improved stability in physiological conditions as compared to native NGO. Besides, NGO-HDex could efficiently load doxorubicin (DOX), an anticancer drug, with drug loading capacity of 3.4 mg/mg NGO and liberate the drug with a pH-dependent profile. Cell viability assay indicated that the NGO-HDex displayed lower cytotoxicity against MCF-7/ADR cells as compared to native NGO. DOX-loaded NGO-HDex, however, revealed more efficient killing effect in the cells than free DOX because the nanohybrid caused a higher amount of DOX accumulated in the cells. The results of this study highlight that the NGO-HDex has high potential for killing drug-resistant cancer cells.
