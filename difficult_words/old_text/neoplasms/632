Over 12 months, 26 malnourished patients had 30 episodes of leukopenia while receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). There were 22 episodes of leukopenia associated with high temperatures (greater than 37.8 degrees C) A TPN-induced septicemia was the cause of fever in one patient. One patient with slight transient fever received no antibiotics, and 21 febrile patients were treated with various broad-spectrum antibiotics. The average duration of leukopenia was 6.9 days, and the average nadir of leukopenia was 789/cu mm. Eleven patients died during or within two weeks of the neutropenic episode. No deaths were related to TPN-induced septicemia. With proper care, TPN can be given to neutropenic patients without additional risk of sepsis.
