The 67 kDa high affinity laminin receptor (67LR) is a non integrin cell surface receptor for the extracellular matrix whose expression is increased in neoplastic cells and directly correlates with an enhanced invasive and metastatic potential. 67LR derives from homo- or hetero-dimerization of a 37 kDa cytosolic precursor (37LRP), by fatty acid acylation. Interestingly, 37LRP is a multifunctional protein involved in the translational machinery and has also been found in the nucleus, where it is tightly associated with nuclear structures. Acting as a receptor for laminin is not the only function of this protein; indeed, 67LR also acts as a receptor for viruses, such as Sindbis virus and Dengue virus, and is involved in the internalization of the prion protein.  Here, we review the current understanding of the structure and function of this molecule, highlighting its role in cancer and infection diseases.
