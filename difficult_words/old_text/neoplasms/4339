The alteration of the p53 gene or protein seems to be the most frequent alteration in the human malignancies. It plays a significant role in the regulation of the physiological cell division. The genetic impairments caused by a series of exogenous or endogenous agents induce the activation of the p53 which results in the G1-S arrest to ensure the opportunity for repair to correct the alteration or in apoptosis when the repair is not able to cope with the mutation. Eventually, the p53 is anticarcinogenic because of its genom guarding function. The investigation of the behavior of this gene and protein is fruitful in solving problems of preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic work.
