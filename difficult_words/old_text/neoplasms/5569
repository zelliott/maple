Prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT), at the end of the conditioning phase, we found in 42 investigated children with malignant diseases subnormal lowered plasma- and blood selenium levels. Parallel to the diminished selenium status the plasma glutathione peroxidase activity (Gpx) was not reduced as it is in selenium deficiency, but markedly elevated and probably reflecting cytolytic processes. In the group of combined conditioning (fractionated total body irradiation plus chemotherapy) we found significantly more elevated plasma Gpx values in comparison to the only-chemotherapy group. The renal selenium excretion was elevated during the whole observation and could be caused by disturbed tubular function.

We conclude, that in the situation of BMT a selenium substitution in a dosage of at least 1 to 2 micrograms Se/kg/d is necessary. Patients' selenium status should be monitored by analyses of plasma- and blood selenium contents.
