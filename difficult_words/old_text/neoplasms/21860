As functional ABCB1 haplotypes were recently reported in the promoter region of the gene, we resequenced the ABCB1 distal promoter region, along with other regions (the enhancer and proximal promoter regions, and all 28 exons), in a total of 533 Japanese subjects. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis based on 92 genetic variations revealed 4 LD blocks with the same make up as previously described (Blocks -1, 1, 2 and 3), except that Block 1 was expanded to include the distal promoter region, and that a new linkage between polymorphisms -1,789G&gt;A in the distal promoter region and IVS5 + 123A&gt;G in intron 5 was identified. We re-assigned Block 1 haplotypes, and added novel haplotypes to the other 3 blocks. The reported promoter haplotypes were further classified into several types according to tagging variations within Block 1 coding or intronic regions. Our current data reconfirm the haplotype profiles of the other three blocks, add more detailed information on functionally-important haplotypes in Block 1 and 2 in the Japanese population, and identified differences in haplotype profiles between ethnic groups. Our updated analysis of ABCB1 haplotype blocks will assist pharmacogenetic and disease-association studies carried out using Asian subjects.
