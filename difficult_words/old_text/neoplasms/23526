The oxygen paradox tells us that oxygen is both necessary for aerobic life and toxic to all life forms. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) touch every biological and medical discipline, especially those involving proliferative status, supporting the idea that active oxygen may be increased in tumor cells. In fact, metabolism of oxygen and the resulting toxic byproducts can cause cancer and death. Efforts to counteract the damage caused by ROS are gaining acceptance as a basis for novel therapeutic approaches, and the field of prevention of cancer is experiencing an upsurge of interest in medically useful antioxidants. Apoptosis is an important means of regulating cell numbers in the developing cell system, but it is so important that it must be controlled. Normal cell death in homeostasis of multicellular organisms is mediated through tightly regulated apoptotic pathways that involve oxidative stress regulation. Defective signaling through these pathways can contribute to both unbalance in apoptosis and development of cancer. Finally, in this review, we discuss new knowledge about recent tools that provide powerful antioxidant strategies, and designing methods to deliver to target cells, in the prevention and treatment of cancer.
