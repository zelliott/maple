Fifteen years after two surveys among general practitioners in the Southwest of France, concerning their attitudes towards cancer patients, a new survey was made using the same questions. In the spring of 1991, 731 general practitioners in Gironde were asked by a written questionnaire sent by mail: 261 answers (36%) forming a fair sample, were analyzed. Though incidence of cancer in physician's practice is low, these patients represent an important burden. Difficulties in coping with these patients during relapse or at the end of life are mainly psychological in relation to the importance of moral burden and the time spent. These psychological difficulties have increased during the past 15 years whereas technical medical problems have decreased. According to 80% general practitioners, cancer patients know their diagnosis. This knowledge is independent of practitioner's age and the working place, and it does not alter the difficulties for practitioner.
