The first results from the population-based cancer registry for the city of Hanoi, in northern Vietnam, are presented. In men, incidence rates are moderate-low with the most common cancers being lung, stomach and liver. Cancer of the penis, reportedly very common in early case series from Vietnam, is now rarely seen. In women, incidence rates are low with the most common cancer, breast cancer, having a recorded incidence similar to that in China. Cervix cancer incidence is very low, which contrasts strongly with hospital series from the south of Vietnam, and of 30 years earlier in Hanoi. The incidence of choriocarcinoma is high, and that of nasopharynx cancer (in both sexes) moderately so; both findings are typical of southeast Asian populations. The incidence rates are coherent with the results from recent studies of Vietnamese migrants in the USA and UK.
