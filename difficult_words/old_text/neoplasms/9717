The increasing number of elderly people in the world population has led to a parallel increase in the number of older cancer patients, with over 45% of all cancers in Europe occurring in patients &gt;70 years of age. The increasing tendency to use oral chemotherapy is thus of interest in the elderly, given that both elderly patients and their physicians prefer to use less complex and toxic regimens when such treatments have equivalent efficacy to more complex regimens. However, data from studies designed to evaluate these therapies in the elderly are currently limited. Factors that must be considered before prescribing oral agents to this subset of patients include age-related physiological changes affecting clinical pharmacology, adherence, the patient's capability to self-administer medications, and safety issues concerning the older patient and his or her caregivers. The idea that elderly patients may benefit from the introduction of oral chemotherapy is very fashionable, but to date there is no proof that this approach is as effective as intravenous therapy in this age group, particularly since randomised trials are lacking. This review discusses these issues and reviews current information about the use of specific oral chemotherapeutic drugs for major neoplastic diseases in the elderly.
