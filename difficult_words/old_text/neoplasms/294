The authors report two cases of fracture of a biliary endoprosthesis inserted endoscopically to treat malignant biliary obstruction. To their knowledge, such a complication has never been reported. In both cases, the fracture was revealed by cholangitis which occurred three and eight months after insertion. Successful treatment was achieved by replacement of the biliary stent.
