The fields of radioimmunodetection and radioimmunotherapy began with an initial paradigm that a targeting molecule (eg, antibody) carrying a radioisotope had the potential of selectively imaging and delivering a therapeutic dose of radiation to tumor sites. A second paradigm was developed in which injection of the targeting molecule was separated from injection of a short-lived radioisotope-labeled ligand (so-called "pretargeting strategy"). This strategy has improved radioisotope delivery to tumors in animal models, enhanced radioimmune imaging in man, and therapeutic trials are in an early phase. We proposed a third paradigm to achieve radioisotopic localization at tumor sites by inducing tumor cells to synthesize a membrane expressed receptor with a high affinity for infused radiolabeled ligands. The use of gene transfer technology to induce expression of high affinity membrane receptors can enhance the specificity of radioligand localization, while the use of radioisotopes with the ability to deliver radiation damage across several cell diameters will compensate for less than perfect transduction efficiency. This approach was termed "Genetic Radioisotope Targeting Strategy." Using this strategy, induction of high levels of gastrin releasing peptide receptor or human somatostatin receptor subtype 2 expression and selective tumor uptake of radiolabeled peptides was achieved. The advantages of the genetic transduction approach are (1) constitutive expression of a tumor-associated antigen/receptor is not required; (2) tumor cells are altered to express a new target receptor or increased quantities of an existing receptor at levels that may significantly improve tumor targeting of radiolabeled ligands compared with normal tissues; (3) gene transfer can be achieved by intratumoral or regional injection of gene vectors; (4) it is feasible to target adenovirus vectors to receptors overexpressed on tumor cells by modifying adenoviral tropism (binding) so that the virus will be targeted specifically to the desired tumor; and (5) it is possible to coexpress the receptor gene and a therapeutic gene, such as cytosine deaminase, for molecular prodrug therapy to produce an enhanced therapeutic effect.
