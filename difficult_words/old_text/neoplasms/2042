BRMs (Biological Response Modifiers) strengthen the host defense mechanism. As a result, therapeutic effects for neoplastic and other diseases can be expected. The first meeting of JBRM (Japanese Society of BRM) was held in Tokyo in 1987. The number of general reports in this meeting was 66, and one special lecture was given. The programme consisted of the special lecture, 42 basic research papers and 23 clinical studies. The main theme of this meeting was "Interferons". The topic of the special lecture was "Treatment of AIDS-associated Kaposi's Sarcoma with Interferons," by Ronald T. Mitsuyasu. Most of general reports were concerned about therapeutic effects against neoplastic diseases and tumor cells by combined administration of BRMs. Some reports dealt with the action, the induction of BRMs and its influences on the human oncogene. Kinds of BRMs reported in this meeting were interferon (natural and recombinant alpha, beta and gamma), interleukin-2 (recombinant), tumor necrosis factor (natural and recombinant), lymphokine-activated killer, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte, OK-432, monoclonal antibody and others. In future, the discovery of new BRMs and therapeutic attempts using them are expected.
