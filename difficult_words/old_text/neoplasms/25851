Progress towards developing vaccines that can stimulate an immune response against growing tumours has involved the identification of the protein antigens associated with a given tumour type. Epitope mapping of tumour antigens for HLA class I- and class II-restricted binding motifs followed by immunization with these peptides has induced protective immunity in murine models against cancers expressing the antigen. MHC class I molecules presenting the appropriate peptides are necessary to provide the specific signals for recognition and killing by cytotoxic T cells (CTL). The principle mechanism of tumour escape is the loss, downregulation or alteration of HLA profiles that may render the target cell resistant to CTL lysis, even if the cell expresses the appropriate tumour antigen. In human tumours HLA loss may be as high as 50%, inferring that a reduction in protein levels might offer a survival advantage to the tumour cells. Alternatively, MHC loss may render tumour cells susceptible to natural killer cell-mediated lysis because they are known to act as ligands for killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs). We review the molecular features of MHC class I and class II antigens and discuss how surface MHC expression may be regulated upon cellular transformation. In addition, selective loss of MHC molecules may alter target tumour cell susceptibility to lymphocyte killing. The development of clinical immunotherapy will need to consider not only the expression of relevant CTL target MHC proteins, but also HLA inhibitory to NK and T cells.
