The first examples of arylphosphonium salts containing a dicarba-closo-dodecaborane(12) (closo-carborane) are reported; in contrast to the 1,12-carborane derivative, the 1,2- and 1,7-isomers undergo a facile deboronation reaction in polar solvents to afford the corresponding nido-carborane phosphonium zwitterions.
