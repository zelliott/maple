A major role for c-Myc in the proliferation of normal cells is attributed to its ability to promote progression through G(1) and into S phase of the cell cycle. The absolute requirement of c-Myc for cell cycle progression in human tumor cells has not been comprehensively addressed. In the present work, we used a lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vector to stably reduce c-Myc expression in a large number of human tumor cell lines and in three different types of normal human cells. In all cases, cell proliferation was severely inhibited, with normal cells ultimately undergoing G(0)/G(1) growth arrest. In contrast, tumor cells demonstrated a much more variable cell cycle response with cells from several lines accumulating in S or G(2)/M phases. Moreover, in some tumor lines, the phase of cell cycle arrest caused by inhibition of c-Myc could be altered by depleting tumor suppressor protein p53 or its transcriptional target p21(CIP/WAF). Our data suggest that, as in the case of normal cells, c-Myc is essential for sustaining proliferation of human tumor cells. However its rate-limiting role in cell cycle control is variable and is reliant upon the status of other cell cycle regulators.
