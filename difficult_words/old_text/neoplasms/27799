During the last decade, several studies have demonstrated the importance of information-seeking versus information-avoiding coping styles of cancer patients receiving educational information from their physician. During the same period of time other studies have demonstrated important differences in the communicative style of oncologists providing educational information to their patients. However, the implications of the interaction of these two areas of research have not been systematically considered. We present here a hypothetical model concerning the implications of physicians with different communicative styles interacting with patients with different coping styles.
