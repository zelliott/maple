Small animals are widely used for the identification of new therapeutic targets and the evaluation of potential anticancer therapies. To study tumors and metastasis in longitudinal studies of tumor progression, fast noninvasive and easy-to-handle imaging modalities are required. Here, techniques for the analysis of tumors and metastases by ultrasound imaging are described and the potential technical pitfalls are discussed.
