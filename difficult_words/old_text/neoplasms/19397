The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on thrombus sizes in lower extremities. The size and extent of thrombus was scored according to International Consensus Committee for venous disease classification. After the diagnosis of DVT was established and its size scored, predominant risk factors for DVT in each patient were identified (malignant disease, thrombophilia, postoperative state, hormonal therapy, heredity, limb trauma, immobilization, others and unknown risk factors). The average thrombus score was 6 (95% CI 5.47-6.53). The analysis of thrombus size indicated that the largest thrombi were found in patients with malignancy. Their average score was 8.5 (95% CI 7-10) and was significantly higher than in patients with other risk factors for deep vein thrombosis. There was no significant correlation between numbers of days from the onset of symptoms to the moment of DVT diagnosis and thrombus score (r = -0.08, p = 0.38). Age was very slightly correlated to thrombus size (r = 0.19; p = 0.046), while the gender did not have significant impact on thrombus score (p = 0.074). The conclusion of our study was that etiology of thrombosis and particularly malignant diseases has the largest impact on venous thrombus size.
