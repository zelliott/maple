The clinical characteristics and outcome of bacteraemia caused by non-glucose-fermenting gram-negative bacilli and Aeromonas spp. were examined in 115 adults with haematological malignancies or solid tumours. The most aggressive pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aeromonas spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Burkholderia cepacia, all of which caused either septic syndrome or pneumonia in more than 40% of cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was involved less often in catheter-related bacteraemia than other species. Polymicrobial bacteraemia (n=28) was more often catheter-related than monomicrobial bacteraemia and more often required catheter removal for definitive cure. The most important predictors of catheter-related bacteraemia and its outcome were polymicrobial infection, the presence of pneumonia or septic syndrome and the species involved.
