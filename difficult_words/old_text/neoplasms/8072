Thalidomide was developed in the 1950s as a sedative having only a low toxicity. However, McBride and Lenz reported in 1961 a close correlation between oral administration of thalidomide by pregnant women and a particular deformity (phocomelia) of their babies. In the 1990s, the biological activities of thalidomide were determined to include the control of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production and inhibition of angiogenesis. In 1994, Folkman et al. reported that thalidomide exhibited a strong inhibition of angiogenesis in their experiments with rabbits and that this effect had a significant relationship to phocomelia. They suggested a utility of thalidomide as a therapeutic agent for diseases that involve angiogenesis, particularly tumorous diseases. Furthermore, in 1994, Vacca et al. reported that the bone marrow of multiple myeloma (MM) patients was rich in blood vessels and that there is a causal relationship between the activity of MM and marrow angiogenesis. According to these data, thalidomide was tested in many countries as a new therapeutic agent for MM. In this review, new pharmacological availability of thalidomide is described on the basis of our experiences.
