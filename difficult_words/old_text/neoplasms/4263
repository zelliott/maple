The three human trefoil proteins pS2, human intestinal trefoil factor (hITF), and human spasmolytic polypeptide (hSP) are expressed principally in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. They are also expressed in a variety of other normal tissues and tumours. This review discusses the pattern of expression of trefoil proteins in cancer, current views on the biological functions of trefoil proteins, and the way in which the expression of trefoil proteins may influence the behaviour of cancer cells.
