Radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) and radioimmunotherapy (RIT) are recent approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. They take advantage of the antibody specificity of tumor surface antigens and of the emitted radiation from suitable radioisotopes, as a means of imaging (RIS) or therapy (RIT). Research into RIS and RIT radiolabelled agents remains an ongoing process. Principles governing the choice of radionuclides, labelling protocols, antibody suitability, and optimization of "tumor to normal tissue ratios" are the same for both RIS and RIT. The investigational stages of the labelled product, prior to clinical application, are also the same. These stages include radiochemical and radiobiological evaluation as well as determination of immunoreactivity. Furthermore, RIS may be considered as the first stage in development, before progressing on to RIT. Differences between RIS and RIT are associated with the application of each technique, that is, the type of radiation emitted by the isotope, dosage regimens, haematopoetic toxicity and the appearance of human antimurine antibody response (HAMA). RIS has found widespread clinical application, detecting a variety of tumors. However, its potential lies in patient management and in detecting metastases. On the other hand RIT is still in its infancy. It appears promising, and for the moment is used as a complementary technique to surgery and/or chemotherapy in clinical trials on cancer treatment. Finally, incorporation of these basic principles arising from past experiences, into the design of RIT trials improve responses.
