We endeavoured to describe the organization and functions of a scientific documentation center concerned only with cancer, which after a very modest start is now in a phase of expansion. We would like to avail ourselves of the services of a computer, which would require a reconversion of our system, to modify the operation of the center, thus allowing its users to benefits maximally from the intellectual potential of our team at institute gustave roussy, as well as from the most recent break-throughs in non-numerical data processing.
