Perspectives of malignant neoplasm prophylaxis based on molecular biology achievements are discussed. Gene variants critical to development of hereditary cancer syndromes, genes modulating malignant neoplasm development risk without hereditary cancer syndrome development, and genes determining tendency of individuals for different malignant neoplasm progress risk increasing lifestyle factors are examined. Molecular epidemiology by using large scale population analysis of cancerogenesis linked genetic polymorphisms prevalence allows determination of risk groups at the most earlier stages of cell transformation or even before the onset of cell malignization and development of goal-based prophylaxis measures based on polymorphism and corresponding cancer type. Epidemiologic analysis of this type allows for earlier diagnostics in risk groups, therapy efficacy increase, disability decrease. Specific therapy on molecular level may be possible in the future.
