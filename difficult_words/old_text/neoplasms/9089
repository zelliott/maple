The incidence of permanent lower urinary tract dysfunction(LUTD)after radical pelvic surgery has been estimated to range from 15% to 20%. Although this surgery is often curative, it is unfortunate that patients suffer from permanent LUTD. Urodynamic study can help in adequate management of the lower urinary tract, in order to prevent long-term upper and lower urinary tract complications. In addition to residual urine measurements, uroflowmetry is required as a screening or follow-up tool for the evaluation of LUTD. Reasonable knowledge of clean intermittent catheterization is also indispensable.
