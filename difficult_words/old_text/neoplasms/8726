Among several recently developed analytical methods, 32P-postlabeling analysis is a highly sensitive method for the detection and measurement of covalent carcinogen-DNA adducts and other DNA modifications. Since the method does not require radioactive carcinogens, it is suitable for DNA of humans exposed to environmental or occupational genotoxicants. The basic procedure entails the enzymatic incorporation of 32P-label into monomeric or dimeric hydrolysis products of DNA, followed by chromatographic mapping and autoradiography of the 32P-labeled digestion products and quantitation by scintillation spectrometry. Microgram amounts of DNA are analyzed; thus the assay is well suited for limited amounts of cells or tissue. Various versions of the assay afford different sensitivities of adduct detection. Under optimal conditions, one aromatic or bulky/hydrophobic adduct in 10(8)-10(10) nucleotides can be detected and measured (corresponding to 0.3-30 amol adduct/microgram DNA or 0.1-10 nmol adduct/mol DNA-P). The assay has been successfully applied to a variety of mutagenic (genotoxic) as well as non-mutagenic carcinogens. In humans, the 32P-postlabeling assay has been applied to DNA specimens from cigarette smokers, iron foundry workers, and coke oven workers. Estimation of total aromatic adduct levels in exposed individuals gave values of 1 adduct in 10(6)-10(8) DNA nucleotides. These values are similar to the total levels of persistent adducts in tissues of animals after exposure to initiating or carcinogenic doses of authentic aromatic genotoxicants. Among the non-mutagenic carcinogens investigated are estrogens, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), choline-devoid diet, carbon tetrachloride, and peroxisome proliferators. In addition, age-dependent DNA modifications (I-compounds) are being detected by 32P-postlabeling in animals that have not been knowingly exposed to mutagens/carcinogens. I-compound profiles and levels are dependent on species, tissue, sex, and diet. Reduced levels of I-compounds have been consistently noted in the target organ of carcinogen-exposed animals and in resulting neoplasms, suggesting that I-compound loss may play a role in carcinogenesis.
