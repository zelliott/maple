The purpose of this study was to test the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of lonidamine (L) and alpha-interferon (IFN alpha) when used together, and to observe any apparent synergistic activity in conventionally untreatable measurable metastatic cancer. Eleven patients (8 males and 3 females) were enrolled. There was one response seen as measured by conventional criteria. There is no evidence that these agents are additive at this dose schedule, nor is their apparent synergistic activity.
