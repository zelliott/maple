The highlighted article in this issue of Toxicological Sciences, written by Zhuohan Hu and Peter Wells, addresses a subject that has received increasing scrutiny the past decade and a half--interindividual variation in detoxification enzyme activity as it relates to toxicity and cancer. Hu and Wells in their simple yet elegant study report variations in glucuronidation among normal individuals and provide data that define the potential impact of these variations on covalent binding and cytotoxicity of carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene (BP) intermediates, gaining in the process important insights into individual potential to resist carcinogenesis by this and related compounds.
