Sonography has become the most important basic imaging method in pediatrics. It mainly differs from sonography in adults in having more unspecific causes for examination, other facets of application, and a wider range of applicability including newborns and infants. Sonography should precede x-ray examination, since its findings must determine the need for and the timing and type of x-ray examinations. The wide range of application justifies a distinction between general and special pediatric sonography. This distinction seems to be particularly relevant with regard to the requirements for optimal technical equipment.
