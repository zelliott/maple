Since the early 1970s, many U.S. businesses have implemented worksite health promotion programs to help contain employer health-care costs; improve employees' health status, productivity, and morale; reduce absenteeism and employee turnover; and provide a convenient setting for screening and education. Because approximately 130 million persons in the United States work, the worksite is an effective location for offering health screening and educational programs otherwise unaccessible to at-risk persons. From the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the prevalence of worksite health promotion activities increased in the United States. To characterize more recent national practices in worksite-based cancer screening programs, CDC examined data from two national probability surveys--the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotions's (ODPHP's) 1992 National Worksite Health Promotion Survey and CDC's 1995 Worksite Benchmark Survey. This report summarizes the results of the analysis, which indicate that, in contrast to previous findings about worksite health promotion in the 1980s, the prevalence of worksites offering cancer screening declined from 1992 to 1995.
