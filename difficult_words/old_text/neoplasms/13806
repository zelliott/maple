MethylGene and MGI Pharma are codeveloping MG-98, a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide which inhibits mRNA produced by the DNA methyltransferase gene, for the potential treatment of solid tumors. A phase II trial in recurrent or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck was initiated in November 2000 [390195] and a phase II trial in patients with advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma was initiated in August 2001 [419943]. In November 2001, a company representative stated that phase II data would be available in the first half of 2002 [429849]. In April 2001, MethylGene received US-06184211, entitled 'Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase'. This patent covers the administration of an agent that could help the human body to restore normally occurring mechanisms to combat or terminate the growth of cancerous tumors [407067], [407068]. The company has also been awarded US-06221849 entitiled, 'DNA methyltransferase genomic sequences and antisense oligonucleotides', and US-06066625 (WO-09940186), claiming optimized antisense oligos complementary to DNA methyltransferase sequences [427216], [427218].
