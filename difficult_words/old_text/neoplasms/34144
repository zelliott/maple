Intense research has focused on methods for overcoming the various barriers to DNA delivery while simultaneously reducing toxicity. Recently, Yuan and colleagues discovered a 'leakage route', whereby viral vectors escaped the injection site and entered the systemic circulation and contributed to the systemic toxicity in cancer gene therapy. They also demonstrated that alginate solution sealed this leak. Although their work focused on intratumoral injection of viral vectors, the findings can be extended to drug delivery in general, particularly DNA delivery.
