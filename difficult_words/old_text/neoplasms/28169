The mechanisms of formation, morphology and functions of macrophagal polykaryons are discussed. These giant multinuclear cells are formed by means of macrophagal cell fusion ("natural hybridization") and specialized on the extra- and intracellular processes of resorption of the foreign body and tissues of the proper organism. The formation of macrophagal polykaryons seems to be one of the possible manifestation of reactive histiocytosis in chronic inflammation and tumor growth. The role of macrophagal polykaryons in such disease as giant cell arteritis, giant cell granuloma and fibrohistiocytic tumors is considered in details. It is proposed that one and the same mechanism of regulations served as a basis of developing of both osteoclastic remodelling of the bone tissue (morphogenetic process) and resorption of the foreign body and tissues of the proper organism in inflammation in the process of evolution.
