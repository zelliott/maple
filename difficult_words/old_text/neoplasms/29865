An interview questionnaire was developed to assess quality of life both in objective and subjective terms in cancer patients. Standardized measures were employed and allowed for comparison with a national baseline. Three hundred thirty-nine patients who were alive without evidence of disease 3 or more years following initial treatment were interviewed. There was no difference in terms of educational level, marital status, or satisfaction with local government, family, job, friends, community, health, recreation, or activities when compared to the age-adjusted national baseline. The patients were more satisfied with region, self, and life as a whole. There was no evidence of a diminished quality of life in these patients.
