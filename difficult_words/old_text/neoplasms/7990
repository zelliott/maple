Dendritic cells (DC) are the most efficient antigen presenting cells in various in vitro systems and DC are now introduced to early clinical use. Tumor antigen loaded DC might potentially add therapeutic benefit with dendritic cell based vaccination. This review will focus on dendritic cell biology relevant to investigators who work in transitional research programs and will discuss the rationale of DC source, antigen loading and route of vaccination. An overview of published and on-going clinical trials in human malignant diseases will be provided forming the basis for a discussion of perspectives of dendritic cell vaccination in various human malignancies.
