The aliphatic polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine) are associated with the phenomena of normal and neoplastic cellular growth. Two third of cancers generally show elevated urinary excretion of polyamines. The urinary levels of polyamines are significantly higher in cancer in evolution than in cancer in remission. The variable association of polyamines with different localisations is reviewed. The potential interest of polyamines analysis in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer is discussed. The more exciting application of this test remains in the possibility of a short term appreciation of the oncostatic treatment efficiency.
