Our preliminary results show that intravascular ultrasound scanning yielded the correct diagnosis in each patient who underwent surgery. We therefore conclude that this method is a potent adjunct to diagnostic procedures in pretherapeutic tumor staging when applied directly to the questionable region of the vessels. In contrast, evaluation of suspected tumor infiltration of the portal vein by positioning the catheter in the inferior vena cava or aorta was generally impossible due to technical problems. We hope that these problems will be solved as technology progresses.
