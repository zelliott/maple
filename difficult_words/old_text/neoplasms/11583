Incidence of pulmonary metastases for a variety of neoplasms was studied in many inbred BALB/cStCrlfC3H/Nctr female mice fed 2-fluorenylacetamide. Bladder carcinomas and hepatocellular carcinomas appeared to be the only neoplasms that were dose related. Hepatocellular carcinomas metastasized to the lungs at an incidence of 4.8%, and bladder carcinomas metastasized at an incidence of 0.28%. Osteogenic sarcomas metastasized to the lungs at an incidence of 46.2%; renal adenocarcinomas, at 20%; fibrosarcomas, at 16.7%; mammary adenocarcinomas, at 9.8%; and myoepitheliomas, at 10.5%. Other malignant neoplasms, including leiomyosarcomas, granulosa cells tumors, adrenocortical carcinomas, angiosarcomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and harderian gland tumors, metastasized at an incidence of less than 5%.
