The first article in this 3-part review on clinical preventive medicine described background information, supportive evidence, and current practices in preventive medicine. The second article discussed incorporating primary preventive activities including health promotion and immunizations into primary care practice. This third and final article in the series focuses on secondary prevention, i.e., screening, and examines the evidence and recommendations for various screening tests and procedures. Screening for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, 2 areas in which national programs are in place, are discussed. Wider incorporation of currently underutilized preventive services into primary care has a great potential to improve morbidity, mortality, and the quality of life in the general population.
