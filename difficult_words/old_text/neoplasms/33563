Severe cancer pain was relieved by a simple custom-built microautoinjector. Its injecting power is derived from the decomposition and expansion of medical-grade 3.3% hydrogen peroxide. The injection speed is controlled by the addition of a microamount of medical-grade iodide which catalyzes the hydrogen peroxide. The amount of potassium iodide used is so small that decomposition and expansion speeds are nearly constant. The size of the power device is 1 cm3; it may be inserted into the injector, which then does not need a gasket any more. This means that this microinjector with the solution to be injected is only half the size of an ordinary disposable syringe. It is convenient for epidural anesthesia of untreatable cancer pain.
