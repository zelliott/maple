The low abundance proteins of the nuclear matrix (NM) were separated from the intermediate filament (IF) proteins and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Three human breast carcinoma lines had virtually identical patterns of 37 NM proteins. In contrast, cell lines derived from diverse tissues had qualitatively different NM protein patterns. Together, the five cell types examined here had a total of 205 distinguishable NM proteins with 125 of these proteins unique to a single cell type. The remaining NM proteins were shared among cell types to different degrees. Polyclonal antisera, obtained by immunization with total NM proteins as antigens, preferentially stained the nuclear interior and not the exterior IF. These observations suggest that the NM proteins, localized to the interior of the nucleus, vary in a cell-type-specific manner.
