Alpha soluble NSF attachment protein (alphaSNAP) is a ubiquitous and indispensable component of membrane fusion machinery. Deletion of alphaSNAP is embryonically lethal. Yet, there is accumulating evidence that milder alterations in expression levels of alphaSNAP may be associated with a number of specific pathological conditions, such as several neurological disorders, Type 2 diabetes and aggressive neuroendocrine tumours. Here, the authors review the evidence available for animal models and for humans, and discuss possible therapeutic approaches that may target alphaSNAP.
