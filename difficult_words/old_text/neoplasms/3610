Diagnostic laparoscopy is a powerful tool in the surgeon's armamentarium when used appropriately. There is a low complication rate and high diagnostic sensitivity. In addition to conventional operating room procedures, this technique can be applied in a variety of other settings, often without general anesthesia. Many patients can be spared invasive nontherapeutic laparotomies particularly in the area of trauma and cancer diagnosis. The surgeon must become a superior visual anatomist in order to be able to take maximum advantage of this technique.
