Data on religious belief, activity, and connections, and ratings of happiness, life satisfaction, and pain level were obtained periodically from 71 patients with advanced cancer. Religious belief showed substantial positive correlation with life satisfaction, and religious activity and connections were significantly correlated with both happiness and life satisfaction. Religious patients also reported significantly lower levels of pain, even though they were no less likely to report the presence of pain. Data from the 36 patients who have since died show no correlation between the religion variables and duration of survival. In general, the patients showed little change in religious belief over time. Religion seems to be an important source of support for many patients.
