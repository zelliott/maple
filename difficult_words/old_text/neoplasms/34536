Vascular embolizations are complex and sophisticated procedures and can be a powerful alternative or useful adjunct to surgery in many clinical situations. Hemorrhage, vascular malformations, and tumors are the main indications for embolization procedures. Establishing the correct indication for intervention as well as the proper embolic agent and the most suitable catheterization technique requires advanced knowledge in interventional radiology, and an interdisciplinary approach is a prerequisite. A broad spectrum of microcatheters and embolization materials is available for these therapies. The desired level of occlusion and the individual vascular territory determine the choice of mechanical devices, particles, or liquid substances. Sclerosing agents and thrombin are used in special situations such as varicoceles and pseudoaneurysms.
