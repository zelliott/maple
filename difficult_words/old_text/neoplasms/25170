Micronucleus (MN) assays with early pollen tetrad cells of Tradescantia (Trad-MN assays) are at present the most widely used bioassays with plants for the detection of genotoxins in the environment. So far, ∼ 160 chemicals have been tested and ∼ 100 articles that concern complex environmental mixtures were published. This article summarises the results of Trad-MN studies, which have been carried out during the last 15 years with individual compounds and investigations concerning the pollution of environmental compartments (soil, water and air). The evaluation shows that the effects of certain genotoxins such as heavy metals, radionuclides, pesticides and air pollutants can be easily detected with this test. Comparisons with results obtained in MN studies with mitotic (root tip) cells indicate that meiotic tetrad cells are in general more sensitive. Important issues for future research concern the evaluation of the suitability of wildlife Tradescantia species that are sometimes used instead of specific clones (such as #4430 for which standardised protocols have been developed) as well as the assessment of the predictive value of Trad-MN results in regard to the prediction of cancer hazards in humans and adverse effects at the ecosystem level. The fact that the genotoxic effects of certain compound such as metals, which can be detected with plant bioassays, in particular with the Trad-MN assay but not in other commonly used bioassays (e.g. in bacterial tests) makes them an essential element in the batteries for environmental monitoring.
