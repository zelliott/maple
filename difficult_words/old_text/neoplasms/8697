The organization of cancer followup, the investigations and subsequent treatment are the responsibility of only those doctors directly involved. The followup work consists of three types: diagnostic after curative treatment, therapeutic with adjuvant chemotherapy and palliative. The cooperation of hospital doctors and practitioners has proved effective. The patient's data are recorded in the accompanying documentation. The follow-up system has met with high patient compliance (94%). The drop-out rate is 6%. Twenty percent of patients with colorectal cancer who underwent curative surgery had pathologic findings. One half of them could be treated therapeutically or palliatively.
