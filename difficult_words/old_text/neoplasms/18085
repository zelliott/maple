Genetic alternations resulting in constitutive stabilization of beta-catenin and altered transcription of beta-catenin/TCF-regulated genes are found in many cancers. A recent Nature paper offers insights into the role of tankyrase in regulating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and suggests that compounds targeting tankyrase's poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARsylation) activity may hold promise for cancer therapy.
