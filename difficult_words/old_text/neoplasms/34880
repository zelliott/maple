Refeeding syndrome (RFS) is a common, yet underappreciated, constellation of electrolyte derangements that typically occurs in acutely ill, malnourished hospitalised patients who are administered glucose solutions or other forms of intravenous or enteral nutrition.

The hallmark of RFS is hypophosphataemia, but hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia are also common. Patients with various types of malignancies are at-risk for RFS, but very little exists in the oncologic literature about this disorder.

As RFS can have many adverse metabolic, cardiovascular, haematologic and neurologic complications, practicing oncologist needs to be aware of the pathophysiology, risk factors and clinical manifestations to promptly recognise this important, and potentially fatal, metabolic disorder.
