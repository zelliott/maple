To develop models to improve accessibility of performing laboratory tests on chronic oncology patients, as well as a more flexible choice of sample collection in both primary and specialized care.

Circuit analysis of cancer patients. Patient survey to study access to laboratory tests. High Resolution Consultation Development Model (MCAR) and Patient Access Analytical Model (MAAP).

The percentage of cancer patients on treatment has increased by 8.76% in the past two years. There was a 32% increased in the use of the MAAP model in the two years of its implementation, and has been the choice of 74% due to greater accessibility, with 8% of the patients having used both models to suit their needs.

The implementation of optimized and preferred care systems has shown that both models improve accessibility and flexibility of the diagnostic testing laboratory in the patients studied.
