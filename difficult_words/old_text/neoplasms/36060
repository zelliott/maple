This study describes the synthesis of magnetite/amphiphilic polymer composite nanoparticles that can be potentially used simultaneously for cancer diagnosis and therapy. The synthesis method was a one-shot process wherein magnetite nanoparticles were mixed with core-crosslinked amphiphilic polymer (CCAP) nanoparticles, prepared using a copolymer of a urethane acrylate nonionomer (UAN) and a urethane acrylate anionomer (UAA). The CCAP nanoparticles had a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic exterior with both PEG segments and carboxylic acid groups, wherein the magnetite nanoparticles were coordinated and stabilized. According to DLS data, the ratio of UAN to UAA and the ratio of magnetite to polymer are keys to controlling the size and thus, the stability of the composite nanoparticles. The magnetic measurement indicated that the composite nanoparticles had superparamagnetic properties and high saturation magnetization. The preliminary magnetic resonance imaging showed that the particles produced an enhanced image even when their concentration was as low as 80 microg/ml.
