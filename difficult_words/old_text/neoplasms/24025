Nephrotoxicity is a significant problem in children after treatment with ifosfamide. Acute changes in renal function were compared in 16 children receiving 9 g m(-2) of ifosfamide as a 72-h continuous infusion on one occasion and, on another course, divided into three 1-h infusions on consecutive days. Subclinical acute nephrotoxicity was demonstrated with both schedules, but there were no significant differences in severity.
