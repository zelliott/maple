Childhood cancer is considered one of the greatest challenges a family can face. Some families cope well with it; others do not. The presence of social support, both perceived and actual, as well as the individuals with whom parents interact, may determine how well a family copes. The purpose of this pilot study was to describe how parents of children with cancer perceive support and the types of things parents found supportive while their child was hospitalized. Parents' perceptions of support were compared with those of the health professionals involved in the care of these children. The primary way the parents perceived support was any activity that met their affective needs. Health professionals faltered when asked to define support, but most said that it meant "being available." Caring and educational activities were the two ways the professionals could offer support to the families, yet parents rarely mentioned teaching as a supportive activity. Parents and health professionals defined aspects of support similarly, but there was minimal congruity between them in listing which people were considered supportive to the parents. In conclusion, health professionals and parents have similar ideas about what support is, but at best, the professionals' predictions concerning who is supportive in a given case appear random and may be biased. This study suggests that new ways of assessing support needs for these families are needed.
