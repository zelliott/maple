Two novel protosappanins, named Caesappin A (1) and B (2), along with three known protosappanins were isolated from Caesalpinia sappan L. Caesappin A is a new type protosappanin with a seven-membered ring fusing an acetal-type section. Compound 4 was isolated from the genus Caesalpinia for the first time. The structures were elucidated on the basis of spectral analysis and the absolute configuration was determined by the ECD experiment coupled with calculated ECD spectra. Their cytotoxic activities were evaluated using MTT assay.
