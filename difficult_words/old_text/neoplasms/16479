The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists surveyed the chronic disease program directors in 1999. Forty-eight (89%) of the health agencies responded. Nearly 90 percent reported having an epidemiologist who devoted some time to cancer control activities. More than 90 percent reported the availability and use of the mortality, incidence, and risk factor data. Almost 70 percent of the respondents produced annual cancer reports, but less than half reported publishing in a state bulletin or scientific journal. These findings suggest that despite widespread access to epidemiologic expertise and cancer-related data, considerable variability persists in the use and dissemination of crucial cancer statistics.
