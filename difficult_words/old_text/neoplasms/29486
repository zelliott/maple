To provide an overview of hereditary cancer susceptibility genes and associated cancer risks.

Peer reviewed published research studies and review articles.

Identifying deleterious mutations in cancer susceptibility genes allows for clarification of cancer risk in individual family members and risk-level appropriate screening, and risk management recommendations. Evolving knowledge of the role of germline mutations provides an unprecedented opportunity to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and morality.

To provide individuals/families with accurate cancer risk management information and guidance, oncology nurses must be familiar with scientific discoveries related to cancer susceptibility genes.
