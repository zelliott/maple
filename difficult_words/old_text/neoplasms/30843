With the improved survival of children with cancer, increased attention is being focused on the health status of survivors. The ultimate objective of this research is to use the results to design and test rational intervention strategies directed toward reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with the diagnosis and successful treatment of cancer. After treatment and patient characteristics that confer a high risk for adverse sequelae are identified, intervention programs targeting primary or secondary interventions must be actively pursued. Primary interventions would include modifications to cancer treatment protocols to maintain a high degree of effectiveness but reduce the occurrence of late effects. Opportunities exist for secondary intervention research in a number of areas, including second cancers (smoking cessation/prevention, early detection, chemoprevention), cardiopulmonary dysfunction (diagnosis and treatment of comorbid disease and promotion of healthy life style practices), and reproduction/genetic risks (management, counseling, networking). It is likely that testing of intervention strategies will require collaborative studies involving a multidisciplinary team of investigators and a multi-institutional structure for access to a suitable survivor population.
