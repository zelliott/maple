A simplified method of processing of fine needle aspirates for paraffin miniblocks suitable for both morphologic and immunocytochemical evaluation is described. Aspirates were fixed in ethanol at 4 degrees C, dehydrated in acetone and xylene and embedded in paraffin (58 degrees C). All steps were carried out in a single Eppendorf centrifuge tube; the total process took less than four hours. Deparaffinized sections were stained using the alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase technique with monoclonal and conventional antibodies helpful in the differential cytologic diagnosis of alcohol-fixed aspiration biopsy specimens. Antibodies to keratin, vimentin, desmin, neurofilaments, glial fibrillary acidic protein, leukocyte-common antigen, synaptophysin and immunoglobulin kappa and lambda light chains reacted positively on the miniblock material. Since the paraffin miniblocks combine the histologic pattern of the tumor with the differentiation-specific information provided by immunocytochemistry, their use can improve the accuracy of tumor typing in aspirates.
