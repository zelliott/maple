Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (imuthiol), a nonantigenic, nontoxic and noncarcinogenic compound, evinces distinctive properties in recruitment and activation of T cells, and no direct influences on B cells or macrophages. The biological attributes of imuthiol (destruction of neoplastic cells, bacteria, fungi and parasites; a detoxifying influence against carcinogens or agents toxic for the liver) could strengthen its activity as a biological response modifier. Preliminary clinic testings show that imuthiol restores T cell activities and regulates the ratio among T cell subsets in cancer patients, without untoward side effects.
