The results of a 3-year experience with voriconasole in oncologic practice are presented. Rational schemes for the use of caspofungin and mycofungin in the treatment of oncologic inpatients and the criteria of their use in the therapy of fungal nosocomial infections were developmed. Good clinical and microbiological efficacy of caspofungin and mycofungin against Candida non-albicans was shown.
