Oral complications in patients being treated for malignancies that were not in the head and neck were studied. Age, type of therapy, and type of malignancy were factors related to the prevalence of oral complications. Mucosal ulcerations, xerostomia, and bacterial and fungal infections were the most frequently encountered oral problems. The frequency of oral complications in these patients indicates the need for an awareness and involvement of dental practitioners in their management.
