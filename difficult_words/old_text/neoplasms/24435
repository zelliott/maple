Over the last 20 years, the biology of chemokines has expanded beyond their initial role in mediating migration of specific subsets of leukocytes. Chemokines have been found to display pleiotropic effects for enhancing immunity to tumor-associated antigens, regulating angiogenesis, promoting proliferation/anti-apoptosis of tumor cells; and mediating tumor cell invasion and trafficking in an organ-specific manner that leads to metastases. Here, we review the importance of chemokines, especially CXC chemokines in regulating angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion and metastases; and demonstrate why they can be seen as important therapeutic targets for intervention in cancer.
