Circulating immune complexes were isolated by precipitation with low concentration EDTA and PEG and their components analysed by specific immunoprecipitation in a laser nephelometric system; a good correlation between this method and other classical immune complex assays could be achieved. This method is simple, reproducible and practicable in the clinical routine. Quantitative analysis showed markedly increased levels of IgM and IgA specific immune complexes in cancer patients, especially those in an advanced stage, in comparison with non-malignant control patients. The percentage of autorosette-forming cells was markedly reduced in cancer patients, especially in a progressive disease, in comparison with non-malignant control patients.
