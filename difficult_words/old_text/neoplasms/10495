The expression of tissue factor (TF) in tumors reportedly exacerbates the aggressiveness of several types of cancers. The shedding of TF-containing membrane particles is believed to influence the ability of tumors to expand and metastasize, and these microparticles may also be harmful in the onset of disseminated intravascular coagulation in specific cancers. Furthermore, the intracellular signaling that is elicited after the formation of the TF / coagulation factor VIIa complex at the cell membrane modulates the activity of adhesion molecules and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. To evaluate whether TF overexpression in tumor cells modulates its shedding and neighboring stromal cells by its catalytic or intracellular activity, TF-GFP (green fluorescent protein) and a tailless form (TFDeltaC-GFP) were stably expressed in the rat Morris hepatoma and human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell lines. Both TF proteins were efficiently produced by tumor cells and functionally active, and their clotting activity could be blocked by the active site-inhibited factor VIIa (ASIS). TF-expressing tumorigenic cells produced a soluble factor that increased the migration of arterial smooth muscle cells in vitro. This effect was abrogated by ASIS and the PAR-1 receptor antagonist ATAP-2, showing that it is dependent on the proteolytic activity of the TF ligand factor VIIa and the thrombin-activated cell membrane receptor. We propose that TF-containing microparticles that are released in the culture medium by tumor cells influence the migratory behavior of neighboring stromal cells, thus aiding the cancer cell's tumorigenic potential.
