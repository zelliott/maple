The incidence of cancer and atherosclerosis, two most common causes of death in developed countries, has been stagnating or, even, increasing. Drugs effective against such conditions are needed and, in this regard, the potential anti-atherosclerotic activity of vitamin E analogs has been studied extensively. Surprisingly, recent results indicate that these agents may also exert anti-neoplastic effects. Here we review the evidence that particular analogs of vitamin E may act as both antiatherogenic and anti-cancer agents, and discuss the possible molecular bases for these actions.
