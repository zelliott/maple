We examined the effect of OK-432 intracutaneous injection on the in vitro responses of non-adherent cells to IL-2 and OK-432, along with changes in lymphocyte subpopulations, in early cancer patients who underwent surgery. We found that 1) repeated injections of OK-432 resulted in an enhancement of LAK activity, the peak of which was seen between 7 and 10 days after the first administration, 2) this augmentation of LAK activity was not associated with changes in lymphocyte subpopulations CD8+ CD11- and CD8+ CD11+ phenotypes, and 3) the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with OK-432 did not show a definite change in specific pattern after in vitro OK-432 treatment. These findings indicate that repeated injections of OK-432 over a period of a week effectively enhanced LAK activity.
