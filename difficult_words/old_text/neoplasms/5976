Although making up only 9% of the U.S. population and concentrated in urban areas of a few states, Hispanics are found throughout the country and represent a mix of historical and cultural backgrounds. This diverse group cuts across racial and ethnic lines, with origins in various countries of Europe and North, Central, and South America. The Hispanic population has several distinguishing demographic characteristics, including its rapid growth rate, relative youth, and low educational and socioeconomic levels. However, considerable differences exist among Hispanic groups, particularly in median age, household size, education, and family income. The majority of Hispanics face barriers to health care access, including a lack of health insurance coverage, underrepresentation in health care fields, and cultural and language differences. These distinct demographic characteristics and barriers have a direct impact on the risk of cancer in Hispanics and on the development of prevention and control strategies. The purpose of this review is to examine the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of Hispanics and issues of access to health care among this population within the context of cancer prevention and control.
