Angiogenesis is crucial for tumour growth and the formation of metastases. Various classes of angiogenesis inhibitors that are each able to inhibit one of the various steps of this complex process can be distinguished. Results from clinical studies with these agents are summarised. In general, it has been shown that most angiogenesis inhibitors can be safely administered, but that tumour regressions are rare. Combining angiogenesis inhibitors with cytotoxic chemotherapy can enhance anticancer activity. Recently, some promising data with regard to clinical efficacy have been presented. While performing clinical studies with angiogenesis inhibitors, defining biological activity is crucial, but thus far no validated techniques are available. It is conceivable that in the near future various classes of angiogenesis inhibitors will be combined in an attempt to further improve antiangiogenic and anticancer activity.
