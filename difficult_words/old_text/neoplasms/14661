The classic function of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the hormonally active form of vitamin D, is the maintenance of normal levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 binds to a specific receptor protein and exerts its biologic action by a mechanism analogous to that proposed for other steroid hormones, that is, the receptor-ligand complex acts on the chromatin to induce transcription of specific genes. Intracellular receptors that bind 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with high affinity have been found in a large number of tumor cell lines examined as melanoma, osteosarcoma, and human breast and colonic carcinoma cells. The 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor in these cells has characteristics similar to the receptor in bone and intestine, the known target tissues of the hormone. In fact, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits the proliferation of melanoma, osteosarcoma, and breast carcinoma cells. More recently, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has been shown to suppress the growth and induce monocytic differentiation of murine and human myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. These results point to a previously unsuspected involvement of vitamin D in cell proliferation and differentiation and suggest that analogs of the vitamin D hormone may be of interest as possible therapeutic agents in the treatment of malignancy.
