Literature on the various manifestations of the selenium deficiency in humans and animals is presented. Mechanisms of the biological effects of selenium brought about by glutathione peroxidase are considered. Biogeochemical anomalies, parenteral nutrition, malabsorption syndromes as conditions for the development of hyposelenosis are characterized as well as their manifestations (white-muscular disease, myopathies, cardiomyopathies, Keshan disease, Kashin-Beck disease). Selenium deficiency facilitates the development of the ischemic heart disease, myocardium infarction, certain types of malignancy and so on. The attention is drawn to the link of the selenium deficiency with imbalance of other trace elements.
