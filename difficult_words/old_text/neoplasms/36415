Schistosomiasis is a curable parasitic infection that, if left untreated, can persist for 30 years even though the parasite cannot reproduce in its human host. Tissue pathology, particularly of the GI and GU tracts, is associated with the granulomatous immune response to parasite eggs. Schistosomiasis is not endemic to the United States because the specific snail intermediate hosts required for transmission are absent. Physicians in North America will see acute and chronic forms of schistosomiasis in travelers and former residents of endemic areas. Therapy with praziquantel is indicated for all species of schistosomes and all clinical manifestations of schistosomiasis.
