We conducted a questionnaire survey of 14 families who each had lost a member regarding the home care they received. Thirteen of the families surveyed had a member who had suffered from terminal cancer. This was thus a survey of "Home Care of Terminal Cancer Patients." In home care for patients with terminal cancer, one should realize they do not have much time, so to improve the balance of supply and demand, we urgently need to build a better system of cooperation with public officials to provide aggressive and prompt home care simulating welfare service.
