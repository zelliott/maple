In order to determine the most effective anticancer agents for individual human tumor, succinic dehydrogenase inhibition test (SDI-T) and adenosine triphosphate inhibition assay (ATP-A) as in vitro chemosensitivity tests were performed. Fifty tumors and 57 tumors derived from cancer patients surgically methods were examined by SDI-T and ATP-A respectively. As the results, the evaluable rate was 70% by SDI-T and 94.7% by ATP-A, respectively. With SDI-T, the positive rate against all tumors was 51.4% in mitomycin-C (MMC), 42.9% in adriamycin (ADM), 20.0% in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 54.3% in cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP). On the other hand, with ATP-A, that was 20.4% in MMC, 29.5% in ADM, 20.6% in 5-FU, 20.4% in CDDP, respectively. Retrospective and prospective clinical trials were also carried out to determine the usefulness of both assays. With SDI-T, overall predictive accuracy rate was 57.1% while with ATP-A that was 88.9%. Furthermore, the rates of sensitivity for the same tumors using SDI-T and ATP-A were compared. The rate of the same sensitive cases in both assays were 30% with MMC, 70% with 5-FU, 42.1% with ADM, 36.8% with CDDP, respectively. In conclusion, it is suggested that ATP-A was more useful than SDI-T as in vitro chemosensitivity test to determine the most adequate drug for cancer patients.
