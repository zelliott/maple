One hundred and thirty-five cancer patients admitted with low-risk neutropenic fever received a low-dose schedule of ceftazidime as infusional monotherapy over a total of 180 episodes. Ceftazidime was administered as a 1-g bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 2 g per day. In this patient population the ceftazidime was both practical and well tolerated. Sixty-eight percent of patients responded with clinical improvement and complete resolution of fever within 48 h. Overall, 95% of patients responded, although 18% subsequently required antibiotic modification for persistent fever. Only 5% of episodes were considered failures due to clinical deterioration, and over the study period there was only 1 fatality due to respiratory failure. The median duration of hospitalisation was only 4 days (2-20). In conclusion, monotherapy with low-dose infusional ceftazidime appears safe and highly effective in this low-risk population of neutropenic patients and may reduce antibiotic costs appreciably.
