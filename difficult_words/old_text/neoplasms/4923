G-rich nucleic acid oligomers can form G-quadruplexes built by G-tetrads stacked upon each other. The basic building block of the G-quadruplexes is similar, but the formation of different quadruplex structures is highly responsive to the strand stoichiometry, strand orientation, guanine glycosidic torsion angle, connecting loops, and the metal coordination. Because of its structural variations and different functions, G-quadruplex applied in biorecognition events can function as a versatile signaling component. A variety of strategies that incorporate G-quadruplex have also been reported. In this review, we mainly discuss G-quadruplex as signal transducer from the following aspects for biorecognition events: analyte-induced G-quadruplex reconfiguration and fluorescence enhancement of small ligand; analyte-induced G-quadruplex reconstruction and formation of DNAzyme; Stimulus-responsive G-quadruplex refolding and manipulation of electron transfer; Stimulus-responsive G-quadruplex and its combination with nanopore systems; Small ligand-responsive G-quadruplex stabilization for drug screening; Nanomaterial-reponsive G-quadruplex reformation; Target-triggered continuous formation of G-quadruplex by DNA nanomachine. We have comprehensively described the recent progress in our labs and others. Undoubtedly, bioanalytical technology and nanotechnology based on G-quadruplex will continue to grow, leading to develop new diagnostics, therapeutics and drug development.
