New data on blood levels of vitamin Q10 in 116 cancer patients reveal an incidence of 23.1% of patients (N=17) with breast cancer whose blood levels were below 0.5 microg/ml. The incidence of breast cancer cases with levels below 0.6 microg/ml was 38.5%. The incidence is higher (p&lt;0.05) than that for a group of ordinary people. Patients (N=15) with myeloma showed a mean blood level of 0.67 +/- 0.17 microg/ml. The incidence of a vitamin Q10 blood level below 0.7 microg/ml for these 15 cases of myeloma was 53.3%, which is higher (p&lt;0.05) than the 24.5% found for a group of ordinary people.
