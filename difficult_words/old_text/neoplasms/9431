Omics docking study for polygenic inheritance tumors has become an important strategy in oncology research. This review focuses on the conceptions and technologies of omics, and puts forward the central contents and omics docking for polygenic inheritance tumor to reveal the role of molecular changes at different stages of polygenic inheritance tumor at multidisciplinary and multilayer level. It is a new strategy to explore the mechanism of tumor carcinogenesis, and to regulate the network, key molecules, and drug target by combined biology effects.
