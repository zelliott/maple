Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) invariably leads to the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in most infected humans, yet does so rarely, if at all, in HIV-infected chimpanzees. The differences between the two species are not due to differences in cellular receptors or an inability of the chimpanzee to be infected, but rather to the lack of pan-immune activation in the infected primate. This results in reduced apoptotic death in CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes and a lower viral load. In humans the degree of chronic immune activation correlates with virus load and clinical outcome with high immune activation leading to high viral loads and the more rapid progression to AIDS and death. The type of immune perturbation seen in HIV-associated AIDS is similar to that of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) where reduced cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses occur early in the course of the disease and where humoral responses (HI) predominate. A reduced CMI response occurs in a number of chronic infectious diseases, including tuberculosis and leishmaniasis. More recently, it has become increasingly apparent that the CMI response is suppressed in virtually all malignant diseases, including melanoma and colorectal and prostate cancer. This raises the possibility that, as the malignant process develops, the cancer cells evolve to subvert the CMI response. Moreover, the reduced CMI response seen in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is completely reversed following curative surgery strongly supporting the hypothesis that CRC can suppress the systemic immune response. Wound healing, ovulation, embryo implantation, and fetal growth are all associated with suppressed CMI and neovascularization (the formation of new blood vessels) or angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels from an existing vasculature). If unresolved, wound healing results in chronic inflammation, which can give rise to the phenomenon of "scar cancers." Indeed all the chronic inflammatory conditions known to be associated with the subsequent development of malignant disease, including chronic obstructive airway disease (COPD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and asbestosis, give rise to similar proangiogenic, suppressed CMI, and HI-predominant environments. In keeping with this CMI-associated cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma tend to be antiangiogenic, whereas HI cytokines such as IL-6 tend to be proangiogenic. Furthermore, chronic immune activation leads to the synthesis and release of factors such as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 that inhibit apoptosis through suppression of p53 activity. The "Golden Triangle" of suppressed CMI, angiogenesis, and reduced apoptosis would provide the ideal environment for the serial mutations to occur that are required for the development of malignant disease. If the observed association is relevant to carcinogenesis, then treatments aimed at reducing the components of these inflammatory conditions may be useful both in the setting of chemoprevention and the therapeutic management of established disease.
