Pediatric cancer has been a priority in Florida since 1970. That year physicians established a statewide network of children's tumor programs, the Florida Association of Pediatric Tumor Programs (FAPTP), which has grown from the initial two programs to 10 in 1992 and now maintains a registry with follow-up to monitor incidence and other indicators. State-of-the-art care is provided through affiliation with the Pediatric Oncology Group. The incidence of pediatric cancer in Florida is equivalent to national rates, but the number of children followed in 1991 had grown to approximately 2,000. The number receiving care has increased an average of 13% annually since 1981. Services for these patients should be reviewed on a continuing basis to assure access to specialized programs.
