The understanding that the growth of tumors depends on the acquisition of a blood supply has led to the development of new therapies for cancer and other angiogenic diseases based on inhibition of neovascularization. This review examines the role of angiogenesis in cancer progression and describes various strategies for interfering with this process. The developmental status of angiogenesis inhibitors in human clinical trials is presented, including their proposed mechanisms of action. Standard chemotherapeutic agents and angiogenesis inhibitors are compared, noting that different end points might need to be considered in clinical trials and that drug resistance may be less of a problem with antiangiogenic therapy than with conventional chemotherapy regimens. The suggestion is made that cytotoxic chemotherapy and angiogenesis inhibitors used in combination may produce complementary therapeutic benefits in the treatment of cancer.
