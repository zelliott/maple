A hypothesis concerning the mode of formation of the components of DNA and RNA in living cells is described. This is based on the reversible hydration and dehydration of polyphosphoric acids in the cell. It is shown that formation of DNA in the cell directs reacting chemicals from the outer membrane of the cell towards the centre leading to the conclusion that all cells operate in the same manner. Cell products are therefore a function of the nature and concentration of chemicals in the source of supply. The origin of tumour cells is proposed as the formation of distorted nuclei. Suggestions are advanced as to means of correcting this situation.
