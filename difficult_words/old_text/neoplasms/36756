Advances in identification of the risk factors for cancer development in different organs imply more effective screening for early malignancies. The associated increase in the predictive value, as well as the introduction of procedures with high sensitivity and specificity, provide promise that early intervention will result in a marked decrease in the mortality and morbidity due to a wide range of major cancers. Furthermore, a variety of methods are now available to detect lesions at a sufficiently early stage for curative surgery to be attempted. However, for the full promise to be realized, it is of paramount importance that both physicians and the public at large are fully aware of the potential benefits.
