Many cancer patients of the "Service des Maladies Sanguines et Tumorales" of HÃ´pital Paul-Brousse, Villejuif, are psychologically studied by: the objective and quantified Szondi test, and in the case a depressive syndrome clinical diagnosis is confirmed, this state is quantified by a quintile questionnaire requiring 25 "yes or no" answers (determined by five grades and five stages), in case an inhibition or/and hysteric component is found, the subjects are submitted to the care of a psychoanalyst. A comparative trial of the MAOI, iproniazide, and the tetracyclic analog, mianserine, has been conducted for the search of the most frequently and rapidly active antidepressant agent among them both. The hypothesis that mianserine is less frequently and rapidly active than iproniazide was drawn from our previous experience of 20 years: thus patients presenting a score less than or equal to 12/25 were given mianserine (20 up to 30 mg/day to be possibly increased according to medical decision), while those presenting a score greater than or equal to 13/25 received iproniazide (50 up to 75 mg/day). The patients who failed with mianserine received iproniazide, while those who failed with iproniazide were supposed to receive mianserine. The registered results are the following: a) out of the 25 patients with major depressive syndromes (score greater than or equal to 13) submitted to iproniazide, 16 (61%) were in complete remission (score at 0/25) and five in partial regression (score decreased by more than half); this makes 21 responses in all, i.e. 80%, obtained between the 10th and the 30th days, which is superior to all placebo responses which have varied in the reliable literature from 13 to 70%; b) out of 18 depressive patients submitted to mianserine, only one had benefited of a complete remission and four of a partial regression at the 30th day, which makes 28% responses. Among the side effects of iproniazide, they were two colon meteorism syndromes, easily corrected by prostigmine, five hyposomnia cases corrected by dipotassium chlorazepate, four anejaculation or delay at ejaculation cases which needed eserine when the patients require their disappearance or attenuation. We did not register either hepatic or hyperthermic or hypertensive complications: this is in good agreement with the true incidences, especially that of hypertensive crisis which could be found in serious and scientifically documented articles, to be 0.3 to 0.5% for their appearance, and 1 per 100,000 for their fatal evolution. Among the side effects of mianserine, we have not registered any of the hepatic, renal and cardiac complications mentioned in the literature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
