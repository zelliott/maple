This case-control study provides individual-based data describing the impact of being a cancer patient on the odds of suicide. 5,009 suicides and 17,064 controls are compared. The data indicate that cancer patients are 50 to 100 percent more likely than nonpatients to commit suicide. This and other studies indicate that health status should be considered in future attempts to relate suicide to social environment.
