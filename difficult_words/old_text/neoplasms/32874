The metabolism of the 2-nitroimidazole hypoxic cell radiosensitizer, misonidazole, has been studied in patients receiving radiotherapy. Results are presented which show that the compound reaches adequate levels in tumour  tissue and that, in animal systems, reduction products of the nitro group may also be present. Ah h.p.l.c method is described which has been used to quantify unchanged misonidazole and its nitroimidazole metabolites.
