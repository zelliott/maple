Time-lapse cinemicrography was employed for the study of the early behaviour of normal and neoplastic rat cells seeded upon the grooved surface. Lewis rat embryo fibroblasts and two neoplastic clonal lines, fibroblastoid LW13K2 and epithelioid RsK4, were used. Although all cells were spheroids of approximately the same size, differences in their subsequent behaviour was found. LWF cells showed minimal surface motility, produced protrusions towards the side slopes of the groove only and migrated after the reliable attachment had been established, even in the non-well-spread form, directly off the groove. Some LW13K2 cells showed increased surface motility of the zeiotic type. Attachment was attempted at the side slopes of the groove only with subsequent migration from the groove. Migration of LW13K2 in comparison with normal fibroblasts was less directional as they eventually returned to the groove bottom. RsK4 cells were seen already scattered around the bottom of the groove in the non-well-spread form with zeiotic activity. Oscillation of the whole cell was observed which is suspected to cause their displacement off the groove by elastic rebounding from each other just after seeding. They completed spreading into a polygonal form within an hour and a half after seeding, even at the bottom of the groove. Colcemid treatment did not substantially alter migration of either cells off the groove. Vacuum coating of the grooved surface with carbon strengthened cell-to-substrate adhesion. Thus the diminished adhesiveness of the surface at the bottom of the groove and its particular geometrical configuration make the substrate in the direction parallel to the groove bottom less accessible to contacts with the cell surface. These factors together with different adhesiveness and organization of contractile structures of neoplastic cells appeared to be responsible for their decreased migration from the groove.
