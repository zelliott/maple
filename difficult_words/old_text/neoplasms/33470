It has become clear that bisphosphonates (BPs) have diverse antitumor effects. BPs mediate their antitumor effects directly by inactivating Ras related proteins. In addition to the direct effects, BPs expand gammadelta T cells, which exhibit major histocompatibility complex-unrestricted lytic activity and inhibit osteoclastogenesis, resulting the indirect antitumor effects. Based on these pre-clinical studies, several clinical trials which focus on the antitumor effects of BPs have already started.
