Magnetic field-responsive iron oxide-loaded hollow mesoporous silica nanocapsules that exhibit high drug loading capacity were synthesized using polymer nanospheres as sacrificial templates. Due to their magnetic field induced heating and remotely triggered drug release capabilities, these hybrid nanomaterials provide an excellent platform for the combination of hyperthermia and chemotherapy.
