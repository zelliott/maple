Oxaliplatin hypersensitivity is a well-known adverse reaction but the prevalence varies and data for frequency and clinical features have not been reported for Korea. Here we evaluates the prevalence and risk factors for hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin after chemotherapy.

Clinical information on all patients treated with oxaliplatin was retrospectively reviewed in electronic medical records between August 2009 and July 2010 in Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. Patients who experienced hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin were compared with those who did not.

A total of 393 patients received oxaliplatin, with 42 (10.7%) experiencing hypersensitivity reactions including three cases of anaphylaxis. Median cycle of the first hypersensitivity reaction was 8. Reactions correlated with lower dexamethasone doses. Other variables were not significant.

The prevalence of hypersensitivity reactions was 10.7%, symptoms being mostly mild and cutaneous. Lower dexamethasone doses could be a predictor for hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin.
