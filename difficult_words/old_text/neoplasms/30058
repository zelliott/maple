The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine if 4Gy fractions over 5 consecutive days is an effective and safe palliative radiation protocol for dogs and cats. Eighty patients (22 cats, 58 dogs) with complete follow-up information were evaluated. Overall response rate (ORR) for all patients was 67%. Median progression free survival (MPFS) was 3.3 months and median survival (MST) was 4.2 months. Primary bone tumors were the most common tumors treated. The ORR for primary bone tumors was 66.6%, the MPFS was 3.5 months, and MST was 3 months. The most common tumor treated in cats was oral squamous cell carcinoma and ORR was 54.5 %, the MPFS was 1.8 months, and MST was 3 months. Soft tissue sarcomas were the second most common tumor treated in dogs (10). ORR was 80% and the two other patients had stable disease. MPFS was 5.7 months and MST was 7.9 months. Overall rate of toxicity was 18.4% in 65 sites that were evaluated for toxicity. Acute toxicities were all grade I or II and occurred in 16.9 % of patients evaluated. All late toxicity was grade I alopecia and leukotrichia. There appears to be a comparable response rate for this palliative protocol as compared to others historically. This response was seen over a wide range of tumors. We also documented a low toxicity profile in a shorter overall treatment time, making this protocol more attractive for some clients.
