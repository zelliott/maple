The anticellular effect of human interferon-beta (IFN-beta, MR-21) was examined in vitro. IFN-beta had a wide anticellular spectrum in proliferation inhibition assay. Of 67 human cell lines including 62 tumor-originated cell lines, 51 were sensitive to IFN-beta (IC50 less than 1,000 IU/ml) while 16 including normal diploid cells were resistant (IC50 greater than or equal to 1,000 IU/ml). These anticellular effects were reversible and there was no relationship between the origins of tumor cell lines and their sensitivity to IFN-beta. IFN-beta induced not only proliferation inhibition but also cytotoxicity in several cell lines. It was suggested that the mode of anticellular effects of IFN-beta was mainly time-dependent.
