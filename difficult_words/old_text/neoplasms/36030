Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment, known as "chemobrain," has been described as a side effect of chemotherapy and is associated with cognitive changes on quality of life especially among older cancer survivors. This longitudinal feasibility study examined the relationship between physical fitness, cognitive health, and quality of life among two groups of older adults: those on chemotherapy, and those who have completed chemotherapy. To assess cognitive health, we used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and demographic information from the Healthy Brain Questionnaire. For quality of life, we used the McGill Quality of Life assessment. Physical activity was assessed using Metabolic Equivalency Tasks from the Compendium of Physical Activities classification system. t-Tests and regression analyses indicated that at Time 1 those on chemotherapy had lower cognitive health scores than those off chemotherapy. Yet at Time 2, as physical activities increased, cognitive health and quality of life improved for those on chemotherapy. However, those who had completed chemotherapy also benefited from an increase in physical activities over time. The results have implications for health care practitioners in oncology settings to better inform patients of cognitive challenges resulting from chemotherapy and the importance of participation in physical activities. Future research should compare different age groups among a larger sample.
