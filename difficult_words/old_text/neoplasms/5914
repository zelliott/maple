In recent years it has gradually become possible to have some control over the medical condition of the end-stage cancer patient. However, there are various problems involved in the continuation of home care. In order to clarify how the mutual relationship between patient and caregiver effects the continuation of home care, we conducted a study on 28 end-stage cancer patients who made the transition from our hospital to home care by means of our HOme Care Service. Using the Kaneda Assessment Score, we obtained information from patients' charts, added reasons for rehospitalizations and analyzed the data. The results showed that the group of patients who remained on home care, despite the fact that their condition was significantly poorer than that of the group who discontinued home care, showed a significantly higher proportion of "wishing to be cared for at home to the last," in the view of the caregiver, a joint commitment of the caregiver together with the family, and a suitable response to changes in the patient. As a direction for forthcoming support in this area, there is a need for sufficient assessment in order to evaluate the balance between caregiver and family. It was suggested that guidance in each case and the use of community resources will be very important.
