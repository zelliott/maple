This is the third paper in a four-part series that presents an updated protocol for selective longitudinal health maintenance of asymptomatic adults. Selected types of cancer are reviewed with reference to six generally accepted screening criteria. A recommendation is made for each condition and compared, when appropriate, with the recommendations of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination and the American Cancer Society. In the fourth paper the recommendations will be combined into a practical health maintenance flow sheet for use by primary care physicians.
