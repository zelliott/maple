Over a 3-year period 23 patients with malignant superior vena cava obstruction were referred for interventional management. They underwent repeat localized central venography and deployment of self-expanding Wallstents. All patients (age range 26-89 years) were approached by the subclavian route using 29 stents. The stent was used to exclude thrombus in the contralateral brachiocephalic vein in five patients and histologic information was available in all patients. Retrospective analysis of the clinical records was used to assess symptom-free survival and symptom recurrence. All patients reported an improvement in symptoms within 24 hr of the procedure. There was 100% technical success. Primary clinical success was achieved in 19 of 23 patients followed-up to their death with no symptom recurrence (range 1-34, mean 15 weeks). In four patients symptoms recurred but only one patient was referred for re-intervention, which was successful. Complications included single cases of early post-stent rethrombosis, distal slip on deployment, and distal slip on balloon dilatation. There were no puncture-related complications.
