We investigated the lysis of fresh human solid tumor cells by peripheral blood T lymphocytes in the presence of lectins and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Addition of certain lectins (Con A, PHA, or WGA) directly into the 4-hr 51Cr-release assay caused significant lysis of (P less than 0.001) noncultured solid tumor targets by enriched populations of granular lymphocytes (GL). Significant levels (P at least less than 0.001) of Con A- or PHA-dependent solid tumor lysis by GL-enriched lymphocytes were observed in 32 of 39 donors (82%) and 14 of 20 donors (70%), respectively. In contrast, the addition of other lectins (PNA, PWM, or LPS) or anti-CD3 mAb did not cause cytotoxicity. The levels of Con A-dependent lysis were comparable to those of interleukin 2 (IL-2)-induced lysis by Leu 11b+ natural killer (NK) cells. The presence of lectins at the effector phase, but not of recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2), was required for the lysis of solid tumor targets. Both Con A-dependent and rIL-2-induced lysis were totally inhibited by treatment of the effector cells with the lysosomotropic agent L-leucine methyl ester (LeuOMe). Effector cells responsible for Con A-dependent lysis of solid tumors expressed T3 (CD3), T8 (CD8), and Leu 7 antigens, but lacked T4 (CD4) and Leu 11 (CD16) antigens as determined by both negative and positive cell selection studies. Con A-dependent lysis was inhibited at the effector phase by anti-CD3 (OKT3 or anti-Leu 4) or anti-CD2 (OKT11) mAb. On the basis of their phenotype (Leu 7+ CD3+ CD8+ CD16-), we hypothesize that these effector cells may contain a population of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) generated in vivo against autologous modified cells that can lyse fresh solid tumor target cells under conditions where the recognition requirements for the CTL are bypassed by lectin approximation.
