This research examines how cancer and treatment sequelae combine with comorbidities to influence the physical functioning and activity participation restrictions reported by older adult (&gt; or =60), long-term survivors (5+ years) of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. The number of current comorbidities was the best predictor of functional difficulties and also a significant predictor of participation restrictions. Cancer stage at diagnosis and continuing cancer symptoms had direct effects on functional difficulties, and indirect effects through functional difficulties on participation restrictions. Clinicians working with older adult survivors need to be aware of the interplay between cancer and other health problems as they affect quality of life after cancer.
