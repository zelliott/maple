A simple method for purification of immunogenic alpha2-macroglobulin from murine serum is described. Also described is a method for creating alpha2-macroglobulin-antigen complexes using purified alpha2-macroglobulin and peptides derived from tumor cell lysates. The application of such alpha2-macroglobulin-antigen complexes for eliciting cancer immunity is discussed.
