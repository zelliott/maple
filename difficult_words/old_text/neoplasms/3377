The purpose of this study was to test an explanatory theory of decision-making in women eligible for a cancer clinical trial. The theory derived from King's framework proposed that the concepts of uncertainty, role functioning, and social support relate to emotional health (hope and mood state), which in turn relates to the treatment decision. A correlational study design was used to test the theory in a sample of 40 women. Findings provided empirical evidence of the adequacy of King's framework and supported, in part, theorized relationships among the critical factors. However, these factors did not illuminate the treatment decision.
