In this report, we describe the ability of CD40-ligand (CD40L)-activated, antigen-loaded B-cells to initiate antigen-specific anti-tumour immune responses in vivo. Mice immunized by means of intravenous administration of CD40L-activated B-cells loaded with an MHC class-I-binding peptide, and challenged with a tumour cell line expressing the same class-I epitope, showed a marked delay in tumour growth, compared to non-immunized controls or to mice receiving either freshly isolated B-cells or B-cells activated with lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-4. The ability of CD40L-activated B-cells to induce antigen-specific T-cell activation appeared to be through a combination of cross-presentation of antigen from activated B-cells to resident antigen-presenting cells and direct T-cell activation by the administered B-cells themselves. Immunization with CD40L-activated B-cells may, therefore, represent a means by which to stimulate anti-tumour CD8(+) T-cell responses in vivo.
