The National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine established a series of expert panels to develop the state of the science in research methodologies in CAM cancer research. Panelists from both conventional and CAM research draw on their expertise in their relative fields to apply their knowledge and expertise to specific topic areas within cancer CAM. The first panel is focused on cancer symptom research. The discussion and conclusions raised by this panel primarily address pain research but are applicable to other symptoms as well. This article will focus on the panel presentations that are most applicable to CAM pain research in both cancer and noncareer pain populations, identifying the major challenges and conclusions offered by the panelists.
