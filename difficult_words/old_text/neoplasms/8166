The completion of whole-genome sequencing of various model organisms and the recent explosion of new technologies in the field of Functional Genomics and Proteomics is poised to revolutionize the way scientists identify and characterize gene function. One of the most significant advances in recent years has been the application of RNA interference (RNAi) as a means of assaying gene function. In the post-genomic era, advances in the field of cancer biology will rely upon the rapid identification and characterization of genes that regulate cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Significant efforts are being directed towards cancer therapy and devising efficient means of selectively delivering drugs to cancerous cells. In this review, we discuss the promise of integrating genome-wide RNAi screens with proteomic approaches and small-molecule chemical genetic screens, towards improving our ability to understand and treat cancer.
