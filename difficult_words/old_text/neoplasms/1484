The acquisition of genomic instability is a crucial step in the development of human cancer. Genomic instability has multiple causes of which chromosomal instability (CIN) and microsatellite instability (MIN) have received the most attention. Whereas the connection between a MIN phenotype and cancer is now proven, the argument that CIN causes cancer remains circumstantial. Nonetheless, the ubiquity of aneuploidy in human cancers, particularly solid tumors, suggests a fundamental link between errors in chromosome segregation and tumorigenesis. Current research in the field is focused on elucidating the molecular basis of CIN, including the possible roles of defects in the spindle checkpoint and other regulators of mitosis.
