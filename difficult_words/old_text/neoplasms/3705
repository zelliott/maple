DNA is the molecular target for many of the drugs that are used in cancer therapeutics, and is viewed as a non-specific target of cytotoxic agents. Although this is true for traditional chemotherapeutics, other agents that were discovered more recently have shown enhanced efficacy. Furthermore, a new generation of agents that target DNA-associated processes are anticipated to be far more specific and effective. How have these agents evolved, and what are their molecular targets?
