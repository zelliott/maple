We presented a new method of catheter implantation by puncturing the left axillary artery directly under ultrasound guidance. This method was easy and non-invasive comparing with previous methods. Fifteen patients with advanced cancers were treated with infusion chemotherapy using this method and no severe complication was observed. Therefore, it was considered that our new procedure was beneficial for the management of patients with advanced cancers.
