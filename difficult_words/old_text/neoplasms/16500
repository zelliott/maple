To determine the risk factors for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection in colonized patients with cancer, we conducted a case-control study. According to multivariate analysis, the only significant factors were neutropenia (&lt; 500 cells/mm3) for more than 1 week and the use of oral vancomycin. Therefore, colonized neutropenic patients with cancer who have previously used oral vancomycin are most prone to VRE infection.
