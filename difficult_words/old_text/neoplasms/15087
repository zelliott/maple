The present op-ed article reports on a thesis study which examines the emergence of ethics committees in health care institutions. These committees have developed rapidly over the past few years in order to address ethical issues related to the management and care of patients. However, the question is raised of whether the ethics committees established in hospitals are an appropriate and effective response to the demands of the law (bill L. 6111-1), which states that institutions should implement ethical policies but does not provide any guidance on what should be done in practice.
