Gastrins, including amidated gastrin (Gamide) and glycine-extended gastrin (Ggly), accelerate the growth of gastrointestinal cancer cells by stimulation of proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. Gamide and Ggly activate different G proteins of the Rho family of small GTPases. For example, Gamide signals Rac/Cdc42 to activate p21-activated kinase 1 while Ggly signals Rho to activate Rho-activated kinase. p21-activated kinase 1 and Rho-activated kinase induce changes in phosphorylation or expression, respectively, of proteins of the Bcl-2 family, which then affect the caspase cascade with consequent inhibition of apoptosis. In addition, interaction of p21-activated kinase 1 with beta-catenin results in phosphorylation of beta-catenin, which enhances its translocation in to the nucleus, activation of TCF4-dependent transcription, and proliferation and migration. The central role of the beta-catenin pathway in carcinogenesis suggests that specific inhibitors of p21-activated kinase 1 may in the future provide novel therapies for gastrointestinal malignancies.
