Administrating Epi-ADR (Epiadriamycin) to the patients for whom ADR was cardiologically contraindicated did not cause significant complications. No complications occurred in the patients treated with Epiadriamycin, after they had completed a full course of maximal dose of ADR. The trial was conducted in close cooperation with a cardiological intensive care unit which is an essential arrangement in such clinical situation, until the optimal therapeutical method of administrating Epi-ADR is defined with special attention devoted to its critical dose.
