Topical treatment with tacrolimus is more effective than the placebo and the low potency corticosteroids in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) in both adults and children while it has a similar potency as some topical corticosteroids of medium potency. Since it was put on the market, more evidence has been accumulating to make our previous statements and it has been demonstrated to have greater effectivity than topical pimecrolimus and oral cyclosporine. It is a safe drug and its side effects are of little importance. Specifically no side effects have been demonstrated due to its systemic absorption nor has there been any increase in skin infections. The most frequent side effect is burning sensation or increased pruritus in the area where the product is applied. It is more frequent if the lesions treated are very acute and is generally transitory, not causing the treatment to be discontinued. Furthermore, with the current information, it cannot be associated to an increase of any type of neoplasms.
