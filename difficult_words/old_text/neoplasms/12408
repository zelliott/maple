To determine whether caregivers believe that interviews about end-of-life care are distressing and to identify patient and respondent characteristics associated with an increased risk of distress, distress was assessed in four studies that used family interviews. The setting was four Medicare certified hospice organizations, the University of Pennsylvania Memory Disorders Clinic, and two nursing homes, and participants included 296 family members of seriously ill or recently deceased patients. For three of the studies, respondents described their distress on a 5-point scale. Distress was reported as either present or absent in the fourth study. Sixty-four respondents (22%) reported experiencing distress. Intensity of distress was higher for younger respondents (Spearman rho -0.16; P=0.013), younger patients (Spearman rho -0.28; P &lt; 0.001), and family members of patients with cancer (mean 0.55 vs. 0.24; Rank sum test P &lt; 0.001). In a multivariable model, after adjusting for study population, younger patient age and cancer diagnosis were independently associated with the severity of distress. Sensitive questions about death and dying are unlikely to cause distress for family members. Although the likelihood of distress is low overall, investigators recruiting from these populations may improve the research by incorporating methods to assess and manage distress.
