In ten hospitalised patients with cellulitis complicating lymphoedema encountered over a 3-year period (1996-1998), the underlying diseases were carcinoma of the cervix (n = 4), uterus (n = 1), vagina (n = 1), breast (n=2) and nasopharynx (n= 1), and retroperitoneal squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1). Three of the ten patients had positive blood cultures, compared to none of the 20 age-matched, sex-matched controls hospitalised for cellulitis without lymphoedema. The mean duration of fever, tachycardia and cellulitis was significantly longer in patients with lymphoedema than in those without (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.05, and P&lt;0.005 respectively). Early treatment initiated by patients themselves may help stop bacterial replication in the initial stages and minimise further damage to the lymphatic system.
