Gadd45a-null mice generated by gene targeting exhibited several of the phenotypes characteristic of p53-deficient mice, including genomic instability, increased radiation carcinogenesis and a low frequency of exencephaly. Genomic instability was exemplified by aneuploidy, chromosome aberrations, gene amplification and centrosome amplification, and was accompanied by abnormalities in mitosis, cytokinesis and growth control. Unequal segregation of chromosomes due to multiple spindle poles during mitosis occurred in several Gadd45a -/- cell lineages and may contribute to the aneuploidy. Our results indicate that Gadd45a is one component of the p53 pathway that contributes to the maintenance of genomic stability.
