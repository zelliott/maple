During oncogenic transformation, microRNA levels of the translation-regulatory factor let-7 correlate inversely with expression of the HMGA2 oncoprotein. In a recent issue of Cell, Yu et al. (2007) now provide evidence that the let-7/HMGA2 linkage could be a signature of cancer stem cells in vivo, with broader implications for stem cell research.
