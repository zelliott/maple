Uptake studies of the potential endoradiotherapeutic agent, 6-125I-iodo-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinol bis(diammonium phosphate) have been carried out in vitro on a wide range of normal and malignant human cells. In general, for a standardized dose of 0.1 microCi/ml, the uptake of the compound into normal cells was 0.0015-0.135 pCi/cell. Uptake into malignant cells was significantly higher than normal cells; uptakes of 0.89-11.3 pCi/cell were noted for melanoma, teratoma of testis, osteosarcoma and adenocarcinoma of colon and pancreas. Comparative uptake ratios for melanoma: Chang liver cells and testicular teratoma:normal testis were 29 23, respectively. Larger uptake ratios are usually observed with higher doses.
