Tumor targeting of plasmid DNA was achieved through the conjugation of dextran derivatives with chelate residues based on metal coordination. Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), spermidine (Sd), and spermine (Sm) were chemically introduced to the hydroxyl groups of dextran to obtain dextran-DTPA, dextran-Sd and dextran-Sm derivatives. Conjugation of the dextran derivative by Zn(2+) coordination decreased the apparent size of the plasmid DNA, depending on the derivative type. The negative zeta potential of plasmid DNA became almost 0 mV after Zn(2+)-coordinated conjugation with dextran-Sm. When the dextran derivative-plasmid DNA conjugates with Zn(2+) coordination were intravenously injected subcutaneously into mice bearing Meth-AR-1 fibrosarcoma, the dextran-Sm-plasmid DNA conjugate significantly enhanced the level of gene expression in the tumor, in contrast to the conjugate of other dextran derivatives and free plasmid DNA. The enhanced gene expression produced by the Zn(2+)-coordinated dextran-Sm-plasmid DNA conjugate was specific to the tumor, whereas a simple mixture of dextran-Sm and plasmid DNA was not effective. The level of gene expression depended on the percentage of chelate residues introduced, the mixing weight ratio of the plasmid DNA/Sm residue used for conjugate preparation, and the plasmid DNA dose. A fluorescent microscopic study revealed that localization of plasmid DNA in the tumor tissue was observed only after injection of the dextran-Sm-plasmid DNA conjugate with Zn(2+) coordination. In addition, the gene expression induced by the conjugate lasted for more than 10 days after the injection. We conclude that Zn(2+)-coordinated dextran-Sm conjugation is a promising way to enable plasmid DNA to target the tumor in gene expression as well as to prolong the duration of gene expression.
