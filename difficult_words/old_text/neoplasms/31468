Since cancer is incurable in many patients, palliation of symptoms and quality-of-life issues are important aspects of therapy. Uracil and tegafur (UFT) plus calcium folinate are the components of the oral agent known as Orzel, which offers activity comparable to intravenously administered 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combined with calcium folinate. Paclitaxel (Taxol), administered intravenously on a weekly schedule, offers high dose intensity and high response rates with limited hematologic toxicity. It is the aim of this phase I study to define the dose-limiting toxicity, possible antitumor activity, and appropriate phase II study dose for the combination of UFT plus calcium folinate administered orally for 4 weeks plus weekly doses of paclitaxel. The daily dose will be fixed at UFT 300 mg/m2 plus calcium folinate 90 mg, both divided into three doses per day; paclitaxel will be escalated in each cohort of patients in 10-mg/m2 steps, starting with 50 mg/m2 weekly. This protocol will take the success of protracted 5-FU infusion--here achieved orally with UFT plus calcium folinate--in combination with paclitaxel one step further by using paclitaxel in a dose-dense, less toxic weekly schedule. It may be anticipated that an active outpatient therapy for a variety of solid tumors will result.
