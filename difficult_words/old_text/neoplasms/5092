We describe 14 consecutive children who received computed tomography-guided percutaneous lung biopsy (CT-PLB) under general anesthesia over an 18-month period at our institution. Pulmonary hemorrhage (occurring in 36%) and pneumothorax (29%) were the two most common complications; the overall complication rate was 64%. When complications did occur, immediate airway management was facilitated by the presence of an endotracheal tube (ETT). We conclude as follows: (i) CT-PLB in our series is associated with a high risk of both overall and severe complications; (ii) risk of complications is increased by both patient and procedure-related factors; (iii) airway management with ETT may be preferable should a complication arise; (iv) severe complications may necessitate ICU admission, which should be available before proceeding.
