From August 1989 through September 1991 we performed percutaneous nephrostomy under ultrasonic guidance in 26 kidneys of 25 patients. We also indwelled double pigtail ureteral stents by endoscopy in 14 kidneys of 13 patients. No patients died because of renal failure. The survival was dependent on progression of primary disease and performance status. Neither significant nor life-threatening complications were encountered. The difference in the improvement of renal function between nephrostomy group and stent group was not statistically significant. Although the indwelling ureteral stent method requires no external drainage bag, this method has certain drawback such as occasional obstruction of stent. Especially in poor risk patients, percutaneous nephrostomy technique seems to be better than placement of double pigtail ureteral stent in the treatment of postrenal failure secondary to malignancies.
