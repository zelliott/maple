Efficient labeling of monoclonal antibodies depends on a number of key factors, mostly related to the characteristics of the radionuclide itself and to the manner of its incorporation into the protein. Such factors include the physical half-life, the photon or particle energy of the radionuclide and its selective deposition of energy in tissues, the method of labeling used (covalent binding or chelation), and the effect that the chemical changes inherent in the labeling process may have on the properties of the protein or of its fragments. The major biological factor in determining the radionuclide of choice for labeling is the projected use of the labeled antibody. When the intended use is diagnostic, then what is required is high-photon density for achieving the high resolution needed for imaging, whereas therapeutic use requires radionuclides with high energy deposition at the target sites, i.e. beta or alpha emitters. A further consideration is to be given to the mode of administration of the radiolabeled monoclonal antibody: determination of the radiopharmacokinetic parameters of compartmental models of biodistribution of the labeled monoclonal antibody and/or its fragments may also assist in selecting which radionuclide may be best to use for radiolabeling a given monoclonal antibody intended for either tumor diagnosis, prognosis and/or therapy.
