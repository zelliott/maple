The aim of this paper was to determine the sociodemographic and cancer characteristics of patients with cancer at a tertiary care centre.

For the study, 80 newly-diagnosed cancer patients were selected and interviewed using structured questionnaires that included sociodemographic and cancer characteristic profiles. At the end of the study period of two years, the survivorship status of the patients was determined.

Gender, occupational status, type of cancer and stage of cancer were found to be significantly associated with the survival status among the study group of cancer patients. Results of logistic regression analysis showed that deceased patients were significantly more likely to be pensioners rather than employed, aged 60-69 years rather than 40-49 years, to have all other types of cancer rather than breast cancer, and to be in Stage 3 or 4 of the disease rather than in Stage 1 of the disease.

There is a greater necessity for psychosocial research in order to achieve optimal health for patients with cancer, and in turn, to improve the survival of cancer patients.
