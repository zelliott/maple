The purpose of this study was to test the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the CQOLC in Turkey.

The 35-item English version of the CQOLC was translated into Turkish following the standard translation methodology. The questionnaire was administered to 237 caregivers of patients with cancer. Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses (CFA and EFA) were carried out using principal component analysis with varimax rotation and Kaiser Normalization to test its construct validity. We used Cronbach's alpha to examine the CQOLC's reliability (internal consistency).

The CFA did not confirm the original factor model. The EFA yielded a 25-item measure with a four-factor solution with different labels for three of the four original scales (shown in parentheses): Psychological Distress (Burden), Disruption in Daily Life (Disruptiveness), Caregiving Responsibility (Positive Adaptation), and Financial Concerns (Financial Concerns). Cronbach's alpha for the total scale was 0.88 and subscale alpha coefficients ranged from 0.73 to 0.83.

The results indicate some differences in the factor structures of the CQOLC scale between Turkish and American samples but provided preliminary support for the Turkish version of the CQOLC as a reliable and valid measure of the quality of life of Turkish cancer caregivers.
