The use of genetically engineered cancer-prone mice as relevant surrogates for patients during the development of pertinent clinical applications is an unproven expectation that awaits direct demonstration. Despite the generally disappointing findings using tumor xenografts and certain early transgenic cancer models to predict therapeutic efficacy in patients, the dramatic progress of mouse models in recent years engenders optimism that the newest generation of mouse models will provide a higher standard of predictive utility in the process of drug development.
