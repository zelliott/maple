The technology that is used for the production and delivery of therapeutic proton beams is reviewed. Increased interest in this treatment modality has inspired a new generation of technology development and research into methods that will make proton treatment facilities more widely available (less expensive) and more efficient. Proton beam therapy has been in use for more than 40 years; it remains a treatment modality of interest because it provides a highly conformal dose distribution to a wide variety of disease sites and the potential for improving clinical outcomes. Recent advances in beam scanning technology may represent the ultimate in external beam radiotherapy dose conformality and treatment delivery efficiency. We describe how this new technology can be integrated into a proton therapy facility.
