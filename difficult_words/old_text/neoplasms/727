This article discusses plant virus nanoparticles as a weapon in the war on cancer. The successes and failures of numerous nanoparticle strategies are discussed as a background to consideration of the plant virus nanoparticle approach. To have therapeutic benefit, the advantages of the targeted nanoparticle must outweigh the problems of colloidal stability, uptake by the reticuloendothelial system as well as the requirement for clearance from the body. Biodegradable nanoparticles are considered to have the most promise to address these complex phenomena. After justifying the choice of biodegradable particles, the article focuses on comparison of micelles, liposomes, polymers and modified plant viruses. The structural uniformity, cargo capacity, responsive behavior and ease of manufacturing of plant virus nanoparticles are unique properties that suggest they have a wider role to play in targeted therapy. The loading of chemotherapeutic cargo is discussed, with specific reference to the advantage of reversible transitions of the capsid of Red clover necrotic mosaic virus. These features will be contrasted and compared with other biodegradable 'smart bombs' that target cancer cells.
