A decrease in the level of substances, active in the test under study is not revealed in patients with different forms of leukemias. The tumour elimination normalizes the thymic endocrine function, while multiagent chemotherapy increases the insufficiency. The data obtained suggest the immunotherapy for malignant neoplasms with thymic hormones.
