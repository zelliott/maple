Secondary cystathioninuria was found in two of 46 children suffering from tumors, leukemia, liver disease, inherited metabolic disorders, cystic fibrosis and celiac disease. Of these two patients, one had congenital biliary atresia and the other cytomegalovirus infection. Seven further children had only moderately elevated excretion of cystathionine. It is suggested that secondary cystathioninuria is uncommon in the disease investigated.
