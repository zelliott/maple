Neoplastic diseases are now among the most commonly seen conditions. Orthodox, non-surgical approaches, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have variable results, but many adverse affects that limit their use. These are sometimes the direct cause of death. More patients are choosing alternative treatments, mainly the homeopathic and herbal-nutrition approach. Homeopathy does not have highly effective remedies for cancer in its literature, and has been limited to palliating the adverse effects of chemo/radiotherapy. Research into substances that can produce neoplastic diseases (carcinogens), may lead to them being used to treat the cancer they cause, according to the principle of similarity. I have used ultra-low doses (1 x 10(-10) to 10(-12) molar) of chemical carcinogens for 3-24 months, which have been given to cancer patients, usually in conjunction with conventional treatment. Using this procedure, complete remission or life extension has been achieved for some cancer cases. Three clinical cases are presented: a man with undifferentiated lung cancer; a child with an astrocytoma and a woman with leiomyosarcoma.
