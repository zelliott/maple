We developed a discharge planning (DSP) procedure as a method to assess the family and cancer patient situation when making the shift to home care, and we herewith report its significance. DSP is intended to sustain the patient's quality of life (QOL) and improve it; for a smooth transition to treatment at home, the family and patient situation must be assessed from various perspectives. The prospective illness conditions, needed medical treatment and care should be appropriately planned, with due recognition of the roles to be played and the requisite pooling of professional information in order to handle emergencies and the like when such arise. In the present study, in order to clarify issues dealing with DSP effectiveness, we compared 34 patients on home care, 17 before DSP and 17 thereafter. The results indicated that following the introduction of DSP, the home care increased for patients with gastroenterological problems such as pain, general debilitation, poor appetite, constipation, diarrhea and the like and those impulsiveness, vomiting and mental symptoms overlapping. With the proper assessment at the time of the transition to home care, this care could be continued. Moreover, with patient satisfaction, there was the need for assessment over the course in order to evaluate treatment and care. In the days to come, there is the need to improve this approach with a scoring system in the evaluation.
