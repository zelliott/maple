Mesoporous nanoparticles for drug delivery would benefit significantly from further improvements in targeting efficiency and endosomal release. We present a system based on colloidal mesoporous silica nanoparticles with targeting-ligands and a red-light photosensitizer. This nanoparticle system provides spatial and temporal control of the release of drugs into the cytosol of cancer cells. Furthermore, the system presents a general platform since it can be loaded with different cargos and adapted for targeting of multiple cell types.
