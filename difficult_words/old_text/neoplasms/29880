Dacarbazine (DTIC) was used for isolated perfusion of extremities in dogs and man. In the animal experiment perfusions with DTIC at dosages up to 100 mg per kg of extremity weight were well tolerated. The concentration of DTIC in the perfusate ranged from 70 to 400 micrograms/ml without evidence for formation of metabolites. Electron microscopy, performed 14 days later, revealed a decrease of glycogen in striated muscle cells. Vascular damage was not observed. Five patients with advanced malignant melanoma or soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities were treated by isolation perfusion with 75 to 133 mg DTIC per kg of extremity at 40 degrees C for 60 minutes. A tumor regression of at least 30% was observed.
