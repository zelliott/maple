Between 5% and 10% of cancer patients develop malignant wounds. Cancer wounds can occur as a clinical entity, especially over the breast, with the development of painful, spreading cancer invasions of the skin. Marjolin's ulcers develop in open wounds after a long period, and form rare malignancies arising from previously traumatised, chronically inflamed, or scarred skin. Marjolin's ulcer is associated with malignant transformation of chronic ulcers, sinus tracts, and burn scars. Squamous cell carcinoma may be linked to a wide variety of medical and surgical clinical situations, such as chronic ulcers, sinuses, chronic osteomyelitis, radiotherapy, burn scars, chronic pressure ulcers, as well as cystostomy sites, and Fournier's gangrene scars. Melanomas, lymphomas, and other cancers can also be observed. Basal cell carcinoma is more frequently observed in ulcers associated with venous insufficiency. According to some reports, the ulcer should have existed for at least 3 years to evoke a diagnosis of degenerescence as opposed ulcerated tumour. Epidermoid carcinomas represent between 0.21% and 0.34% of cancers that develop over leg ulcers, but large series are still lacking. The current lack of epidemiological data could be rectified by more frequent evocation of the diagnosis and a policy of systematic biopsy of chronically open wounds.
