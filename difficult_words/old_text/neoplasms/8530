Immunochemical investigations of ribosomes should correlate with basic knowledge of the function, structure and activity of organelles in the cell processes. Our paper presents data of immunochemical methods used to determine the structure, function and differences of ribosomes. We present the usefulness of immunochemical methods to test human ribosomes, diagnosis and therapy of many diseases.
