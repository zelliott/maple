To describe diseases, prognosis, and clinical outcomes associated with leukocytosis and neutrophilia in dogs.

Retrospective study.

118 dogs with leukocytosis and neutrophilia.

Medical records from 1996 to 1998 were examined for dogs with WBC &gt; or = 50,000 cells/microliter and neutrophilia &gt; or = 50%. Signalment, absolute and differential WBC counts, body temperature, clinical or pathologic diagnosis, duration and cost of hospitalization, and survival time were reviewed.

Mean age was 7.7 years, WBC count was 65,795 cells/microliter, and absolute neutrophil count was 53,798 cells/microliter. Mean duration of hospitalization was 7.4 days and cost of hospitalization was $2,028.00. Forty (34%) dogs were febrile, and 73 (62%) dogs died. Overall median survival time was 17 days. Dogs with neoplasia or fever were more likely to die than dogs that were hospitalized or had systemic or local infections.

Leukocytosis and neutrophilia were associated with high mortality rate and have prognostic value. Given the mean duration and cost of hospitalization, frank discussion with an owner at first recognition of leukocytosis and neutrophilia may be warranted.
