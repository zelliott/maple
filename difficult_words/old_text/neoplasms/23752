The prevalence of hypouricaemia in a hospital population was studied. Hypouricaemia in females, defined as less than 0.14 mmol l-1 was found in 4.8% of all urate requests. Similarly, the prevalence in males, defined as less than 0.20 mmol l-1 was 6.5%. The largest group displaying hypouricaemia was intensive care patients. Oncology patients, particularly those with haematological malignancies also exhibited hypouricaemia. Another patient group in which hypouricaemia was prevalent were those with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin.
