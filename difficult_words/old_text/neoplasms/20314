Relatively low co-existence of malignant neoplasms and chronic cardiovascular disease was documented in this work the emphasis being put on the conditions running with myocardial hypertrophy. The percentage of malignancy in the total autopsy material of 5821 men and 6849 women was 27.8 and 23.0 resp., and in the subgroup with heart weight 300-400 g, 36.8 and 31.0 resp. This percentage was significantly lower in separated subgroups of: a. arterial hypertension, 6.6 and 10.2, b. cardio-pulmonary syndrome, 23.0 and 18.5, c. healed myocardial infarct accompanied by myocardial hypertrophy, 13.3 and 11.7, d. acquired valvar deformity, 15.3 and 10.1. The subgroup of heart weight 150-250 g showed 57.2% and 46.6% of cases with malignancy while that of cardiac weight over 600 g-7.4% and 5.7%. In the subgroup of normal right-(2-3 mm) and left-ventricular (10-12 mm) wall thickness corresponding percentage equalled 29.4 and 30.1, in the subgroup of right-ventricular wall thickness over 6 mm--14.4 and 8.8, and in that of left-ventricular wall thickness over 18 mm--12.5 and 9.4. Scanty available information suggests some antimitotic activity of catecholamines believed to condition that of chalones. Catecholamines are also attributed with the stimulation of myocardial hypertrophy. The correlation of our findings with assumptions mentioned above seem to justify a hypothesis, or only a possibility, that compensatory mechanisms active in the cardiovascular diseases create an unfavourable background for the development of neoplasm.
