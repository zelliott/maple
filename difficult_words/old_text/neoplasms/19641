Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the most extensively studied binding sites with considerable biological significance. Activation of tyrosine kinase, localised in the intracellular domain of this receptor, initiates the next steps in the intracellular signal transduction pathway. Recently, many compounds that block the particular stages of signal transducting pathways of this receptor have been appeared. Some of them are currently applied to clinical research. The other went through the research phase and were registered for medical treatment. The aim of this paper was to show the mechanism of blocking of the EGFR by these compounds as a potential way of curative cancer therapy.
