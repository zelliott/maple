An oligomeric chimeric protein DB-2 was constructed, to design drugs with antitumor activity and to develop highly sensitive immunospecific tests for the diagnostics of a wide variety of malignant epithelial cells in humans. DB-2 contains an immunodominant site of tetanus toxin and a fragment of the locus of the human tumor-associated antigen MUC1 with a variable number of tandem repeats. A pentameric superhelical fragment of the human cartilage oligomeric matrix protein was used as an oligomerization matrix. The expression of the protein in Escherichia coli cells was studied, a method for its purification was developed, and its main biochemical properties were determined.
