Preclinical studies with murine tumor models have demonstrated that autologous tumor cell vaccines engineered to secrete certain cytokines in a paracrine fashion elicit systemic immune responses capable of eliminating small amounts of established tumor. These results have engendered much interest in developing this strategy for gene therapy of human cancer. The major limitation to creating genetically modified autologous human tumor vaccines is efficient gene transfer into primary tumor explants, since the majority of human tumors fail to proliferate in long-term culture. Using the retroviral vector MFG in conjunction with short-term culture techniques, we have achieved, in the absence of selection, a mean transduction efficiency of 60% in primary renal, ovarian, and pancreatic tumor explants, and we have developed an autologous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor secreting tumor vaccine for clinical trials.
