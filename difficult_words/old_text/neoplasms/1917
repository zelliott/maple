Immunocompetence of bay mussels, Mytilus edulis, with hemic neoplasia was investigated with an in vitro yeast phagocytosis assay and by in vivo clearance from the blood of injected Cytophaga sp. bacteria. The yeast phagocytosis assay was conducted with hemocytes maintained in 90% plasma. Neoplastic hemocytes, characterized by enlarged nuclei and scant cytoplasm, failed to phagocytose yeast cells. In contrast, greater than 90% of hemocytes from unaffected animals and morphologically normal hemocytes from mussels with the disease phagocytosed yeast. Substitution of normal plasma with that from a mussel with advanced disease (essentially 100% neoplastic hemocytes) did not affect the phagocytic capability of normal hemocytes. Conversely, normal plasma did not enhance the phagocytic capabilities of neoplastic cells. Mussels with advanced disease showed reduced bacterial clearance; control or lightly affected mussels (less than 11% neoplastic hemocytes) cleared greater than 90% of injected bacteria in 4 hr, while mussels with advanced disease cleared 44-83%. These experiments indicate that mussels with advanced hemic neoplasia have compromised defense systems. This may account for the reported mortality in mussels and other bivalve molluscs with hemic neoplasia.
