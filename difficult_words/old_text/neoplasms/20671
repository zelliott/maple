Alkylating agents represent a highly cytotoxic class of chemotherapeutic compounds that are extremely effective anti-tumor agents. Unfortunately, alkylating agents damage both malignant and non-malignant tissues. Bone marrow is especially sensitive to damage by alkylating agent chemotherapy, and is a dose-limiting tissue when treating cancer patients. One strategy to overcome bone marrow sensitivity to alkylating agent exposure involves gene transfer of the DNA repair protein O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (O(6)MeG DNA MTase) into bone marrow cells. O(6)MeG DNA MTase is of particular interest because it functions to protect against the mutagenic, clastogenic and cytotoxic effects of many chemotherapeutic alkylating agents. By increasing the O(6)MeG DNA MTase repair capacity of bone marrow cells, it is hoped that this tissue will become alkylation resistant, thereby increasing the therapeutic window for the selective destruction of malignant tissue. In this review, the field of O(6)MeG DNA MTase gene transfer into bone marrow cells will be summarized with an emphasis placed on strategies used for suppressing the deleterious side effects of chemotherapeutic alkylating agent treatment.
