The plant derived indoloquinoline alkaloid cryptolepine was investigated for its cytotoxic properties in 12 human tumour cell lines and in primary cultures of tumour cells from patients. The fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay was used to assess cytotoxicity and DNA micro-array analysis to evaluate gene expression. Cryptolepine mean IC(50) in the cell line panel was 0.9 microM compared with 1.0 and 2.8 microM in haematological and solid tumour malignancies, respectively. Among patient solid tumour samples, those from breast cancer were the most sensitive and essentially as sensitive as haematological malignancies. Cryptolepine activity showed highest correlations to topoisomerase II and microtubule targeting drugs. In the cell lines cryptolepine activity was essentially unaffected by established mechanisms of drug resistance. A number of genes were identified as associated with cryptolepine activity. In conclusion, cryptolepine shows interesting in vitro cytotoxic properties and its further evaluation as an anti-cancer drug seems warranted.
