Two scientific areas have recently emerged that can revolutionize cancer chemotherapy. First, an understanding of the different cellular signaling pathways implicated in the development and progression of cancer resulting in poor prognosis and drug resistance, have identified potential drug targets. Inhibitors of signal transduction pathways are currently in the clinics. Secondly, nanotechnology has emerged as an exciting multidisciplinary field promising to provide breakthrough solutions to the problems of optimizing the efficacy or therapeutic index of anticancer agents. The promise of nanotechnology lies in the ability to engineer customizable nanoscale constructs that can be loaded with one or more payloads such as chemotherapeutics, targeting units, imaging and diagnostic agents. This review addresses the potential integration of these two approaches to engineer nanoparticles that can target various signal transduction pathways in cancer.
