The use of an interim protective prosthesis during cancer chemotherapy allows immediate patient comfort and function by protecting ulcerated mucosa and providing a platform against which to masticate. Chemotherapeutically induced lesions can be exacerbated by trauma from the remaining natural dentition during mastication and parafunctional habits. The interim prosthesis protects ulcerated tissue from further injury, and healing is promoted. The greater the integrity of the oral tissues, the more resistant they become to microbial invasion, subsequent microbial colonization, and infection during periods of granulocytopenia. By the use of a conservative technique, the patients's quality of life is improved during cancer treatment, and definitive prosthodontic treatment is deferred until therapy can be better tolerated by the patient.
