The author surveys the way leading to the electronic theory of cancer and analyses the role of methylglyoxal and glyoxalases. Based on the comparison of experimental data with the theory it can be concluded that (i) data being at disposal are not convincing enough either to verify or to confute the theory; (ii) compounds having function to influence the glyoxalase system can, however, be considered as tumour-selective anticancer agents.
