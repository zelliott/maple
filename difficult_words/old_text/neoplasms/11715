The possible contribution of occupational and environmental exposures to cancer has been known for many years and is now a highly mature field of study. By the 1950s, a substantial list of agents of processes had been identified as associated with cancer of one organ or another. In the last several decades a number of additions have been made to the list. No doubt more will be found in the future. The last decade, especially, has brought increased public attention to cancer in the workplace. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 has been a significant contributor to the current increase in attention given to cancer occurrences arising from occupational exposures. These have led to increasingly stringent regulations and control requirements. The nature of the chemical and physical factors in occupational cancer will be noted and the estimates of the contribution of occupational factors to total cancer occurrence will be considered. In addition to the workplace exposures, other ways in which cancer may be associated with technology will be described. Included among these are, community air pollution, water contaminants, dietary additives, and hair dyes.
