As our ward is a general surgical ward, we formerly had difficulties providing appropriate care for patients with terminal cancer. To solve the problem, we have formed a nursing study group in order to provide home care that would meet the wishes of such patients and their families. Our specific approach was as follows: 1) preparation of a form on which patient information is collected; 2) a support system for home care (such as pain control and home parenteral nutrition; and 3) a solid collaboration system between ward nurses and visiting nurses. Such a program enables us to understand the wishes of patients and families and to provide various support where needed. The project helps to lessen the anxiety and the burden that patients and families feel in home care, and improve the quality of life (QOL).
