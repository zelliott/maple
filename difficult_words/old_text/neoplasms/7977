HLA-Cw belongs to classic HLA-I gene, HLA-Cw molecules have high polymorphism like HLA-A and B molecules. They distribute extensively on the surfaces of karyote, not only presenting endogenetic antigen to CD8+ T cells to induce specific killing effect, but also participating in immunologic reaction as the ligands of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR). Thus it has been valued for their relations to diseases and the functions in transplantation immunity, anti virus and anti-tumor immunity.
