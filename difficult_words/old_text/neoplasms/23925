Some aspects of modern ecology should be included in any graduate teaching program on preventive oncology and medicine. In the study of environmental carcinogenesis, the influence of carcinogenic agents on natural ecosystems and living organisms, integral ecological monitoring, naturally occurring carcinogens, and evaluation of complex risk assessment of the environment deserve particular attention. It is also important to integrate biochemical and molecular markers into epidemiology studies in order to correctly evaluate and prevent the cancer risk to humans that results from environmental factors.
