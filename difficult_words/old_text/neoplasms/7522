This paper presents an overview of studies of therapy of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in which chemotherapy was combined with other modalities. The rationale for using chemotherapy with surgery is discussed, but ststematic studies of this combination of modalities have not been reported. Systemic chemotherapy plus radiation therapy has been studied using hydrozyurea, t-fluorouracil (5-FU), and methotrexate (MTX). Uncontrolled studies with hydroxyurea report favorable results, but a well-controlled study gave negative results. Controlled studies with 5-FU have given favorable results in certain tumor stages and sites of origin. MTX plus radiation in a small series produced slightly better survival than radiation alone. Intra-arterial chemotherapy plus radiation therapy has been the subject of exploratory studies but no firm conclusions can be drawn from these studies. Chemotherapy plus immunotherapy has been explored and merits further study. Based on the studies reported to date one can suggest the need for large-scale randomized control studies of long-term chemotherapy combined with other modalities.
