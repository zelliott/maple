This paper aims to evaluate the anti-tumour properties of elatol, a compound (sesquiterpene) isolated from algae Laurencia microcladia.

In-vitro and in-vivo anti-tumour properties of elatol were investigated using: MTT assays to assess the cytotoxic effects; flow cytometry analysis to examine the cell cycle and apoptosis; Western blot analysis for determination of the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis proteins; and study of in-vivo tumour growth in mice (C57Bl6 mice bearing B16F10 cells).

Elatol exhibited a cytotoxic effect, at least in part, by inducing cell cycle arrest in the G(1) and the sub-G(1) phases, leading cells to apoptosis. Western blot analysis demonstrated that elatol reduced the expression of cyclin-D1, cyclin-E, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)2 and cdk4. A decrease in bcl-xl and an increase in bak, caspase-9 and p53 expression was also observed. In the in-vivo experiment, treatment with elatol was able to reduce tumour growth in C57Bl6 mice.

Elatol promotes a delay in the cell cycle, probably in the G(1)/S transition, activating the apoptotic process and this could be responsible, at least in part, for the in-vivo effects observed. Taken together, the in-vitro and in-vivo experiments suggested that elatol has anti-tumour properties. Further studies should be conducted to clarify the mechanism of action.
