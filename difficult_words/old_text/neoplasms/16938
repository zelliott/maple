Baxter infusor was evaluated for the degree of its safeness, and effectiveness, to use in a chemotherapy. The study covered a total of 36 cases, each receiving an average 11 days of care under this therapy. In seventeen of those cases, the patient had received outpatient care, or had spent day and night at their homes. In nine of the total 36 cases, the infusor had been set for use by the patients or by their family. Results were evaluated with a focus on three factors: the patients' quality of life, the infusor's ease of use and its comparability to conventional systems. As to quality of life, those patients generally appreciated the infusor as an improvement to conventional systems with 10 of them citing "an ability to live with their family", 16 citing "freedom to move around", and 35 citing "satisfying functional performance", as reasons for their favorable acceptance. 97% of the patients had found the infusor easy to use, and all had found it simpler and easier to use than the conventional system. Their overall rating for the infusor was "good" to "excellent" in 97% of the cases. And 33 out of the 36 patients thought the infusor safe and effective if used at the homes.
