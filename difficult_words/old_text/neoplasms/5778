In this paper causes of pain and factors influencing sensitivity to pain in tumour patients are described. Changes and requests of outpatient therapy with non-opiates versus opiates are further analyzed. Results of pharmacological studies and clinical experiences show that most physicians have unjustified prejudice against prescription, effectiveness and side-effects of opiates. Some typical faults in outpatient therapy are a consequence of this kind of prejudice. An effective outpatient therapy using a phased plan in treatment with drugs could enable most tumour patients to become free of pain.
