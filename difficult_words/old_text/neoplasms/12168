Evidence has accumulated from laboratory-based animal experiments and population-based human epidemiological studies that lifestyle factors that affect energy balance, such as caloric intake, nutritional status, and exercise, act in concert with genetic susceptibility to influence cancer development and progression. The use of animal models with specific genetic alterations, in combination with lifestyle modifications that alter overall energy balance, has contributed to a greater understanding of the mechanistic changes occurring during carcinogenesis and to the identification of points of intervention. Studies in our laboratory focusing on the role of energy balance and genetic susceptibility in mice deficient in one (+/-) or both (-/-) alleles of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and mice with a mutant APC allele (APC(Min)) showed that calorie restriction decreases tumor burden, increases tumor latency, and decreases serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and leptin levels. Data from our studies, combined with results from other animal and human studies, have established a role for IGF-1 in carcinogenesis. Studies using genetic models of cancer that have been interbred with mice with abnormal levels of IGF-1 will enable the examination of combined effects of energy balance and genetic alterations on the cancer process. Models that integrate lifestyle and genetic effects in a single system provide a physiologically intact system in which combination interventions and therapies for cancer prevention can be tested and validated, thus building a strong preclinical foundation that will inform the development of clinical trials and add perspective to epidemiological studies.
