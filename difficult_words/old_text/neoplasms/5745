The orientation of the medical activity toward preventive strategies knows currently an important development. This movement shows various logic, which are: on one hand a rational step, a strategic choice in favour of prevention, and on the other hand a choice by elimination, when the other forms of intervention establish insufficient efficiency. Prevention had to follow the path of validity to acquire pertinence. The gold-standard is randomised blinded trials and it is this kind of procedure that has been proposed in the BCPT (Breast cancer prevention trial). By comparison with a classic therapeutic trial the main differences of prevention trial lay in: criteria of inclusion, analyses of impact larger than the simple efficiency (quality of life), on the focus on the risk (especially genetic) and the legal context. One of the main points is the question of risks induced by an intervention on healthy persons. In this context, even the passage of an uncertainty to a "certainty" concerning induced risks can not always suffice to close the controversy. Physicians cannot in this case, refer to norms and to models since this type of intervention is new.
