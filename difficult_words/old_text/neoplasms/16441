Iron is a crucial element for many central metabolic pathways of the body. Lack of iron leads to growth arrest and anaemia while increased accumulation of this metal, as it occurs in highly frequent inherited diseases such as hereditary haemochromatosis and thalassaemia, is associated with toxic radical formation and progressive tissue damage. As shown by several groups, iron also modulates immune effector mechanisms, such as cytokine activities (IFN-gamma effector pathways towards macrophages), nitric oxide (NO) formation or immune cell proliferation, and thus host immune surveillance. Therefore, gaining control over iron homeostasis is one of the central battlefields in deciding the fate of an infection with intracellular pathogens or a malignant disease. Thus, the reticulo-endothelial system has evoked sophisticated strategies to control iron metabolism in general and especially the handling of the metal within immune cells.
