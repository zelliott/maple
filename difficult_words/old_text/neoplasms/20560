Since the 70's Polish epidemiological studies from give evidence to male mortality, predominantly in the working age. The results of the analysis of overall mortality in the population of Poznań in the years 1990-1999 were in the line of overall results from Poland. Throughout the period under study we noted male overmortality in Poznań, which would start in the age group 15-19 (with the exception of 1996) and would continue up to the age 85-89. The aim of the study was to assess the phenomenon of overmortality from neoplasms in the population of Poznań. In the study secondary sources of information were used such as death certificates of permanent residents of Poznań in the years 1991-2000. Male overmortality was given as a percentage and was calculated as a ratio of female mortality rate to male mortality rate. The increase in the number of deaths from malignancies in Poznań in the 90's applied to both sexes but overall male mortality for this cause was higher than for females. The analysis of the mortality for particular group of tumors as well as selected tumors showed that overmortality is not specific to male population. The increase in female deaths from bowel cancer was reflected in the female overmortality in four out of ten years study. Periodic overmortality in the population was also detected for other neoplasms of the alimentary tract e.g. liver and rectum.
