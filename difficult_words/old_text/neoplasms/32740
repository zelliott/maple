Risk indicators for asbestos-related diseases (cancers of the lung, larynx, and alimentary tract; mesothelioma; and asbestosis) and methods of early detection are reviewed and evaluated. The best medical means of reducing mortality from these diseases is to recognize particularly susceptible persons during a preemployment examination and to recommend that they not be hired for jobs involving asbestos exposure. Workers necessarily exposed to asbestos should be enrolled in a medical screening program and urged not to smoke.
