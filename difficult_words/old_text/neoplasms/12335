Rising serum tumor markers may be associated with negative imaging in the presence of cancer. CT and (18)F-FDG PET may yield incongruent results in the assessment of tumor recurrence. The present study evaluates the incremental role of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the diagnosis and management of cancer patients with increasing levels of tumor markers as the sole indicator of potential recurrence after initial successful treatment.

Thirty-six cancer patients with increasing levels of tumor markers during follow-up and negative CT underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT, which showed 111 sites of increased tracer uptake. PET/CT was compared with PET results on a site-based analysis for characterization of (18)F-FDG foci and on a patient-based analysis for diagnosis of recurrence. The clinical impact of PET/CT on further patient management was evaluated.

Thirty patients (83%) had recurrence in 85 malignant sites (77%). For the site-based analysis, PET had a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 96%, 50%, 85%, 85%, and 82%, respectively, as compared with the performance indices of PET/CT of 100%, 89%, 97%, 97%, and 100%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the specificity (P &lt; 0.05) and accuracy (P &lt; 0.001) of PET and PET/CT for precise characterization of suspected lesions. For the patient-based analysis, PET had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 93%, 50%, and 86%, respectively, as compared with PET/CT with values of 93%, 67%, and 89%, respectively (P = not significant). PET/CT was the single modality that directed further management and treatment planning in 12 patients (33%).

The results of this study indicate that PET/CT may improve the accuracy of occult cancer detection and further lead to management changes in patients with increasing levels of tumor markers as the sole suspicion of recurrent malignancy.
