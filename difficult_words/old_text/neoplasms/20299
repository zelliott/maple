The effect of gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) on the induction of interleukin-2 (IL-2) activated killer cell activity was studied: (I) in peripheral blood lymphocytes (LAK cells) from cancer patients and healthy donors, (II) in lymphocytes infiltrating solid tumors (TIL) from melanoma and breast cancer patients, and (III) in pleural effusion associated lymphocytes (EAL) from patients with lung adenocarcinoma. The coculture of LAK, TIL and pleural effusion mononuclear cells (MNC) with several doses of IFN-gamma (10, 50, 250, and 1250 U/ml) and a low dose of IL-2 (10 U/ml) for 5 days resulted in a synergistic effect on the cytotoxicity of these cells against several tumor cell lines. Furthermore there was a potentiation in the proliferation of MNC after a 5-day culture. The induction of lymphocyte cytotoxicity by a combination of IFN-gamma with low doses of IL-2 may be helpful in designing more effective cancer immunotherapeutic protocols with LAK, TIL or EAL.
