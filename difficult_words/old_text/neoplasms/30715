In man IGFBP-2 is by concentration the second most important IGF binding protein in serum, the most abundant carrier protein in milk and CSF. In serum its levels are age dependent. There is no good evidence, to date, for a regulation of its production or degradation by insulin. IGF-I treatment increases serum IGFBP-2 concentration. IGFBP-2 is at least partially metabolized by the kidney, since it accumulates in serum of patients with renal failure and normalizes after renal transplantation. Individuals with neoplastic diseases very often present with elevated serum levels.
