ADP-ribosylation of human serum proteins was studied in various groups of disorders. In most of these groups, the extent of ADP-ribosylation did not show a divergence from the group of normal controls. Neoplastic diseases revealed, however, a unique group, with more than fivefold increases in ADP-ribosylation levels over the other groups. Blood samples with high levels of ADP-ribosylation revealed, in general, increased serum NAD glycohydrolase activities and low levels of serum NAD.
