The carcinogenic potential of the nonsteroidal triphenylethylene antiestrogen toremifene (Fareston) was evaluated in a standard 104-week rat dietary carcinogenicity study. The doses were 0, 0.12, 1.2, 5.0 and 12 mg/kg/day and the number of animals 50/sex/dose group. The body weight gain and food consumption were monitored once weekly (study weeks 1-16) or once every four weeks thereafter (study weeks 17-104). Blood samples were taken at weeks 34, 52 and 104 and the plasma concentrations of toremifene, as well as the two main metabolites (deaminohydroxy)toremifene and N-demethyltoremifene, were measured. All doses of toremifene reduced food intake and body weight gain. Toremifene caused a significant reduction in mortality, which was mainly due to reduced incidences of pituitary tumors. This was evident in all dose groups. Drug-related decrease of mammary tumors in females (at all doses) and testicular tumors in male rats (doses &gt; or = 1.2 mg/kg/day) were also evident. The incidence of the preneoplastic foci of basophilic hepatocytes were significantly decreased in treated female groups. Toremifene induced no preneoplastic or neoplastic lesions. Based on histopathology, no obvious toxicity could be observed. Drug-related changes were observed in the genital organs, thyroid, spleen, mammary gland, adrenal, kidney, stomach and lung. These changes were due to hormonal disturbances or as a result of reduced food consumption or reduced incidences of pituitary, mammary or testicular tumors. This study indicates that toremifene is an efficient antiestrogen in long-term treatment, is well tolerated and has no tumorigenic potential in rats.
