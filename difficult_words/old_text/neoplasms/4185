Infectious complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in children with malignancy. Empirical antimicrobial therapy in the management of fever of unknown origin should be tailored to local bacteriological data and antibiotic sensitivity patterns. Five-hundred-and-fifty-nine cases of culture-proven septicaemia occurring in pediatric cancer patients between 1990 and 1994 were retrospectively analysed and compared with a similar study done in our centre between 1976 and 1979. A wide spectrum of organisms was isolated. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common and consistent bacteria isolated during the 5 year period. More than 70 per cent of the staphylococci were sensitive to methicillin and universally sensitive to vancomycin. However, a worrying trend of ceftazidime-resistance amongst gram-negative organisms was found. In these situations, the use of imipenem is recommended as resistance to this antimicrobial agent was exceedingly rare.
