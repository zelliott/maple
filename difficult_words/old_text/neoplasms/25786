High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with stem cell rescue is increasingly being used as a salvage or consolidation therapy for patients with a variety of malignant diseases. The authors give an overview of the current role of HDCT in lympho-hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors.

The use of allogenic or autologous hematopoietic stem cells allows an increase of the dose of chemotherapeutic drugs by a factor of between 4- and 30-fold compared to conventional chemotherapy protocols. In recent years mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) have largely replaced the use of autologous bone marrow due to more rapid hematopoietic reconstitution and are increasingly used in the allogenic setting. This article reviews the data of high-dose chemotherapy in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute leukemias, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphatic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, germ cell cancer, and lung cancer. Current clinical trials further evaluating the role of HDCT are described.

Data on results of HDCT are available for a variety of malignancies showing the feasibility and efficacy of the procedure with tolerable toxicity. Although numerous clinical trials of HDCT have been performed, only few randomized trials have demonstrated that such strategies are statistically significantly better than conventional forms of therapy.

HDCT has been shown to be useful in the treatment of certain patients with lymphomas, leukemias, myeloma, breast cancer, and testicular cancer. Most of these findings still have to be confirmed by randomized clinical trials. Therefore, HDCT should only be given in controlled studies and at suitable centers.
