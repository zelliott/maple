The relationship between flow cytometry measurements (DNA ploidy, S-phase index) of solid tumors and survival is reviewed. Breast, ovarian, colorectal, pulmonary, urinary bladder, renal, thyroid, and endometrial cervical carcinoma and melanoma are discussed. Correlations between tumor stage or grade and flow cytometry-derived data are considered. Tetraploidy, S-phase indexes, and data derived from paraffin-embedded material have been the basis for seemingly controversial interpretations. Related methods are covered in detail and comparative aspects of flow cytometry and cytophotometry are reviewed.
