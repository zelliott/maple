Arterial infusion chemotherapy (AIC) is an attempt to provide a suitable route for anticarcinogens which will increase chemotherapeutic efficacy while diminishing side effects. It was tested around 1950, and progress in vascular surgery and arterial imaging resulted in favorable results. In the Seventies, AIC was conjoined with embolization techniques, resulting in the new chemoembolization approach. With the Eighties, the Society for Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy Research was established. It has since figured largely in pursuing the role of intraarterial chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer.
