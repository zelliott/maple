The relationship between cancer and venothromboembolic events is a complex, multifactorial process which is still not fully understood and therefore the use of current generic guidelines may be inadequate. Current management of cancer-related VTE may be suboptimal because of the lack of cancer-specific studies into the role of primary prophylaxis in both ambulant and non-ambulant cancer patients. Further research into developing cancer-specific risk assessment tools and the choice, dose and duration of prophylaxis is required. The management of confirmed symptomatic VTE in cancer patients is outlined but certain controversies remain. Areas for further research include the management of asymptomatic unsuspected VTE events, recurrent VTE events on treatment and the role of IVC filters and other treatment options are required. This paper attempts to cover some of the recent developments and areas of uncertainty surrounding the management of cancer-related VTE.
