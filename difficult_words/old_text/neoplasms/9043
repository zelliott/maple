It is commonly believed that antibodies are too large (âˆ¼150 kDa) to access the intracellular compartment. Therefore, therapeutic antibodies have been traditionally used to target cell surface receptors or soluble proteins in the circulation, leaving a large intracellular treasure of potential cancer-specific targets untapped. This review offers new perspectives on our recently proposed concept that antibodies can be used to target intracellular tumor antigens for anti-cancer therapy. We propose to vastly expand the repertoire of potential targets for cancer immunotherapy since many excellent cancer targets are inside cells.
