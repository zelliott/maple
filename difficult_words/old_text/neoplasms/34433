The roles of diet and nutrition as etiologic factors in cancer incidence is discussed. Diet and nutrition have recently been recognized as causative agents in other chronic diseases. Epidemiologic evidence supportive of the hypothesis that different diets rather than other environmental contaminants are important in the causation of certain forms of cancer is reviewed, including studies on several migrant populations and ethnic groups. Specific dietary components have been correlated with certain forms of cancer, such as bowel cancer and fat consumption, and a theory of the mechanism is set forth. The animal studies discussed strongly confirm the results of epidemiologic studies in man. Additionally, nutrition's important role in cancer therapy and rehabilitation is described. A variety of intervention techniques are available to maintain the nutrition status of the cancer patient. Finally, the research priorities and the Diet, Nutrition and Cancer Program (DNCP) of the National Cancer Institute are explained.
