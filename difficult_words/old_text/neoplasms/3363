The development of a vaccine for cancer has been difficult compared to the effective vaccines of infectious diseases. Most tumor antigens are not entirely foreign and are expressed on normal tissues, thus, making it difficult to induce strong immune responses against self antigens. A peptide mimic, however, may have the potential to generate greater immune responses than those induced to self peptides. In this review we discuss applications of peptide mimics for cancer immunotherapy which may ultimately prove useful in humans.
