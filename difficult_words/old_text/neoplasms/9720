Carcinogenesis involves a disruption in adhesion molecule expression and tissue architecture, and tumour invasion requires adhesion-dependent migration into surrounding tissues. Therefore, a variety of peptide and antibody-based reagents that block integrins, cadherins, immunoglobulin superfamily and selectin adhesion molecules have been developed to treat cancers. Therapeutics directed at adhesion molecules can block interactions between tumour cells, endothelial cells and immune cells to prevent tumour cell invasiveness and metastasis. Blocking the adhesion molecules that facilitate the invasion of tumours by endothelial cells and immune cells can prevent tumour-associated angiogenesis and the recruitment of immune-mediated growth factors which are required for tumour growth and spread. In addition, targeted therapies using anticancer agents attached to antibodies or peptides directed as tumour-specific adhesion molecules are being developed.
