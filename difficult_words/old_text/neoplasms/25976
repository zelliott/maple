Design features of intraoperative probes are presented. A brief discussion of the sentinel node concept and relevant radiopharmaceuticals is given. The importance of the injection technique and the necessity of imaging in radiotracer techniques for sentinel node detection are explained. Probe calibration, procedural precautions, intraoperative techniques, and radiation dosimetry relevant to the successful use of intraoperative probes are discussed. Intraoperative use of gamma probes requires a team effort involving surgery and nuclear medicine personnel and requires that team members understand the fundamentals of probe use. After reading this paper, the nuclear medicine technologist will be able to: (a) describe present day and future potential use of intraoperative probes; (b) define the sentinel lymph node (SLN) concept; (c) state the radiopharmaceuticals and injection techniques used for SLN evaluation; (d) name several SLN detection procedures; and (e) discuss the design features and care of currently available probes.
