This paper describes methods of assessment and pharmacologic management for chronic or persistent pain in children. This report will be a clinical one, derived from the experiences of a pediatric oncologist (P.M.Z.) and a pediatric pain consultant (L.K.Z.). Case reports will illustrate clinical assessment and management strategies.
