Gene therapy has various applications. Many technical obstacles in gene delivery need to be overcome. The safe delivery and expression of a gene to its destination are essential for clinical use. A greater understanding of the genetic basis of cancer and tumor immunology is necessary before the goal of cancer gene therapy can be fully realized.
