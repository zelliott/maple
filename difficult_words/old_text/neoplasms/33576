This paper summarizes Dutch epidemiological findings on the impact of a low selenium (Se) status on mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. Se status parameters of Dutch subjects are compared to those from Finland and the USA, and the concept of a threshold effect for Se on disease risk is discussed. Case-control analyses of prospective data suggest that low serum Se (below 105 micrograms/l) is not clearly associated with an excess risk of CVD death (relative risk RR = 1.6, 90% confidence interval Cl = 0.9-2.9). Se cancer findings indicate a possible gender difference in risk (in males RR = 2.7, 90% Cl = 1.2-6.2; in females RR = 1.5, 90% Cl = 0.5-4.5). Larger studies, monitoring a combination of Se status parameters are recommended.
