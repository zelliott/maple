Local radiotherapy of a tumor is frequently applied in combination with chemotherapy or surgical measures. Possibly occurring toxicity must therefore be considered within the overall context. The radiosensitivity of the various organs is dependent on the sensitivity of the respective stem or mature end cells, and shows considerable differences within the individual cell systems. Apart from the application of prophylactic procedures, some radiation sequelae can be ameliorated by initiating specific measures (e.g. cosmetic products, drug treatment).
