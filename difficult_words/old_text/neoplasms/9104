TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anticancer agent because it shows apoptosis-inducing activity in transformed, but not in normal, cells. As with most anticancer agents, however, its clinical use is restricted by either inherent or acquired resistance by cancer cells. We demonstrate here that small-molecule SMAC mimetics that antagonize the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) potently sensitize previously resistant human cancer cell lines, but not normal cells, to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and that they do so in a caspase-8-dependent manner. We further show that the compounds have no cytotoxicity as single agents. Also, we demonstrate that several IAP family members likely participate in the modulation of cellular sensitivity to TRAIL. Finally, we note that the compounds that sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL are the most efficacious in binding to X-linked IAP, and in inducing cellular-IAP (cIAP)-1 and cIAP-2 degradation. Our studies thus describe valuable compounds that allow elucidation of the signaling events occurring in TRAIL resistance, and demonstrate that these agents act as potent TRAIL-sensitizing agents in a variety of cancer cell lines.
