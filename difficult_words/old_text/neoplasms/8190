Higher eukaryotic genomes contain both housekeeping genes and genes of which the expression is restricted to a defined time and space. It is well established that a correlation exists between structural organization of the genome and gene expression control. The functional mechanisms underlying this correlation are still poorly understood. Here I describe several observations that are the basis of present concepts of genome organization and nuclear architecture related to functionality. Regarding the relationship between positioning and disturbed cell functionality, I describe observations showing that the proximity of selected gene loci is statistically correlated with their propensity for oncogenic translocations as well as observations of patterns occurring in neurodegenerative disorders where unstable repeats are translated into an expanded polyglutamine tract. Such observations underscore the importance to understand how genetic perturbations lead to the global reorganization of nuclear architecture, chromatin structure and widespread changes in gene expression.
