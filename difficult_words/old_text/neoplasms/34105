To highlight selected research directed to new drug and device technologies to manage mucositis in cancer patients and to illustrate potential impact of successful therapies.

Published research articles and abstracts, clinical experience.

Advances in molecular modeling of mucosal injury in cancer patients have created new opportunities for therapy. Research is analyzing the impact of single-agent interventions; varying degrees of efficacy are being reported. Once optimal dosing strategies for single-agent management are defined, the opportunity for multi-agent therapies will emerge.

The oncology nurse plays a pivotal role in assessing and managing mucositis in cancer patients.
