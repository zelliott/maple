Critical steps for cancer cell growth, migration, invasion, and metastasis are the interactions of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules with cells, the disconnection of intercellular adhesion, and the degradation of ECM. The latter is mediated mainly by metalloproteinases (MMPs), the expression and activation of which is related to various tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs). The aberrant RTK activity is associated with the development and progress of various human cancers. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are small molecules which compete with ATP for binding to the kinase domain of the RTKs and have been used for the treatment of solid tumors. In this review, the recent advances of the effects of TKIs on MMPs expressed by solid tumors are presented.
