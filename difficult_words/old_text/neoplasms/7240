A large collection of cultured human tumor cell lines was characterized for the phenotypes of 16 polymorphic enzyme loci: ACP1, ADA, AK1, ESD, FUCA, GLO1, GOT2, G6PD, ME2, PEPA, PEPB, PEPC, PEPD, PGD, PGM1, and PGM3 primarily to detect and monitor against cell line contamination. Among 100 highly characterized cell lines, 59 lines from different patients and 6 pairs of lines (each pair from the same patient's tumor) had unique phenotype combinations and were therefore presumed to be authentic, uncontaminated cell lines. Besides these 71 lines, the remaining 29 lines consisted of several small groups of two to three lines, each group having a different combination and being among the more frequent in the normal population. The 29 lines, therefore, were not suspected to be contaminants. Among unusual findings were the ME2 1 plus 2 phenotype determined for two bladder tumor lines, a G6PD A phenotype found in a line of Caucasian origin determined not to be a HeLa contaminant, and asymmetrical heterozygous phenotypes in several lines. Except for kidney tumor lines, there was no correlation of adenosine deaminase tissue isoenzymes between tumor lines and normal tissues of origin. For several enzymes significant deviations were found in proportions of the phenotypes observed in Caucasian cell lines from expected proportions on the basis of normal population data, indicating possible natural selection among these lines in tissue culture or among the patients of origin.
