Febrile neutropenia post-chemotherapy continues to impose a burden of morbidity and mortality on patients and families affected by childhood cancer, whereas these unplanned hospital admissions increase the financial cost of treating paediatric malignancies. There are currently no published national guidelines. This study comprises the first audit of current therapeutic practice in Australasia.

Information was sought prospectively from the 12 paediatric oncology tertiary referral centres in Australia and New Zealand regarding treatment of febrile neutropenia episodes commencing between 11 March and 10 May 2002.

Data were returned on 127 episodes by nine centres. The median length of stay was 6 days and 18 different antibiotic regimens were implemented as first-line therapy. The median neutrophil count at the beginning and end of the febrile neutropenic episode was 0.0 x 10(9)/L (range 0.0 to 2.3 x 10(9)/L) and 0.7 x 10(9)/L (range 0.0 to 25.4 x 10(9)/L), respectively. Thirty per cent of episodes had positive blood cultures. Of these, 81% occurred in patients with tunnelled central venous catheters. The initial antimicrobial combination was changed in 61% of episodes. Outpatient antibiotics were used in 21% episodes after initial intravenous antimicrobial therapy.

The current practice in Australasia is consistent with international guidelines, although changes are made more frequently to first-line therapy than in previous published studies. The central venous catheters are associated with a much higher risk of bacteraemia and consideration should be given to increased use of implanted port systems.
