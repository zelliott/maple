Children have the right to be given the opportunity to become responsible adults. But this right is not assured for children with cancer. They carry a stigma that is the basis for discrimination in education, in the armed services, in employment opportunities, and in the opportunity to receive fair treatment from health and life insurance companies. In this article, examples of discriminatory practices are reviewed, along with the steps being taken to alleviate the situation. The author emphasizes that the responsibility for correcting discrimination belongs to all groups in society--the government, families of children with cancer, and other private citizens--and suggests means by which citizens can end discrimination against cancer survivors.
