This study describes the development of neoplasms and the suppression of bone marrow stem cells following chronic administration of cytosine-arabinoside (ara-C) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Ara-C was administered i.p. either at daily dosages of 5 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg or at pulse doses of three times 500 mg/kg within 1 week followed by a time interval of 11 weeks. The total doses of the higher daily dose and of the pulse dose were chosen to be equally high. No significant carcinogenic activity of ara-C could be assessed following either of these dose schedules. With regard to general toxicity, as expressed by body weight gain and long-term bone marrow toxicity, high pulse doses of ara-C were better or at least equally tolerated as were the equivalent daily low doses.
