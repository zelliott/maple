Time-sensitive medical care is essential for pediatric patients undergoing treatment for a hematologic or oncologic condition. Such patients commonly experience acute symptoms related to routine childhood illness and/or their underlying disease or therapy. An Urgent Care Bay (UCB) staffed by a designated nurse and medical provider was established within Texas Children's Cancer Center Outpatient Clinic to provide time-sensitive, same-day diagnostic and therapeutic medical care during clinic hours for patients with acute, non-life-threatening symptoms. The number of patients seen in UCB, chief complaint, underlying diagnosis, and disposition was reviewed. To establish timeliness of care, the authors reviewed the time of referral to the UCB provider or nurse, time of arrival to UCB, time evaluated by providers, and time of initiation of treatment. The addition of an UCB to Texas Children's Cancer Center Outpatient Clinic has shown to allow for rapid assessment and initiation of treatment while avoiding unnecessary emergency room care.
