With the survival rates for childhood cancer growing, studies point to both the challenges and possible opportunities for personal growth that children with cancer may experience throughout their life journey. Examined in this review, research on the spirituality of childhood cancer survivors has provided insight into their overall spiritual journeys, their strategies to promote well-being, and the dynamics of hope and meaning within their lives. In an area that is in the early stages of research, the qualitative and exploratory research of the spirituality of childhood cancer survivors also contributes to the generation of future hypotheses. Finally, future research in this area should provide us with an enhanced understanding of spiritual paradigms that will assist us in making provisions for optimal support of children and their families.
