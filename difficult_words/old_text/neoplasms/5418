In order to determine the relationship between mutations, tissue accumulations, and serum levels of p53 in occupational cancers, we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing of exons 5-9 of the p53 gene, immunohistochemical analysis for tissue identification of mutant p53 protein, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum levels of mutant p53 protein to examine for such alteration in a cohort of individuals with workplace exposure to asbestos or silica, and resultant lung cancers or mesotheliomas. DNA analysis detected mutations in 5 of 18 (28%) tumors, and tissue accumulations of protein were detected in 7 of 20 (35%) tumors; the agreement between mutational and immunohistochemical analyses was significant (kappa = 0.62, P = 0.002). Serum elevations of protein were detected in 4 of 11 (36%) cases with available serum samples; the agreement between tissue alterations and serum elevations was also significant (kappa = 0.71, P = 0.017). In addition, based on the analysis of banked samples, serum results tended to be consistent over time prior to the diagnosis of disease (positive predictive value = 0.67, negative predictive value = 0.83). These results suggest that serum levels of p53 are reasonably accurate in reflecting tissue alterations in p53 at the gene and/ or protein level and may be early biomarkers of disease risk.
