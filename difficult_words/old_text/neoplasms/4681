Exposure to ionising radiation results in mutagenesis and cell death, and the clinical manifestations depend on the dose and the involved body area. Reducing carcinogenesis in patients treated with radiotherapy, exposed to diagnostic radiation or who are in certain professional groups is mandatory. The prevention or treatment of early and late radiotherapy effects would improve quality of life and increase cancer curability by intensifying therapies. Experimental and clinical data have given rise to new concepts and a large pool of chemical and molecular agents that could be effective in the protection and treatment of radiation damage. To date, amifostine is the only drug recommended as an effective radioprotectant. This review identifies five distinct types of radiation damage (I, cellular depletion; II, reactive gene activation; III, tissue disorganisation; IV, stochastic effects; V, bystander effects) and classifies the radioprotective agents into five relevant categories (A, protectants against all types of radiation effects; B, death pathway modulators; C, blockers of inflammation, chemotaxis and autocrine/paracrine pathways; D, antimutagenic keepers of genomic integrity; E, agents that block bystander effects). The necessity of establishing and funding central committees that guide systematic clinical research into evaluating the novel agents revealed in the era of molecular medicine is stressed.
