The alpha lipoic acid (ALA) may control and limit the production of free radicals, influencing the development of pathologies such cancer or central sensitization diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms are still not elucidated.

The objective of the present review is to contrast the antioxidant properties of ALA in the prevention and development of pathologies related to the oxidative stress.

In this work, more than 100 articles published during the last 20 years that relate ALA consumption and pathologies related to the oxidative stress have been analysed. The articles have been obtained from different specialized databases (PubMed central, Web of science, Elsevier Journal, Science Direct) and included experiments in animals, cells, and humans. Domains evaluated included ALA, central sensitization diseases, free radicals, and ALA.

Results from in vitro and laboratory animals experiments demonstrate that ALA controls the cell apoptosis of different type of cancers through out the increase of reactive oxygen species, and decrease of cell growth. Moreover, results demonstrated that ALA presents an antioxidant capacity and the ability to regenerate other antioxidants, which is essential to treat the central sensitization diseases.

The ALA plays a significant role as antioxidant and prooxidant in cancer and central sensitization diseases, although more extensive studies are required to determine the clinical significance in humans.
