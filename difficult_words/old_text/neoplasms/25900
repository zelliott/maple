A new radio-frequency (RF) inductive hyperthermia device using an inductive aperture-type applicator (IATA) is proposed. This paper reports the evaluation of the heating characteristics of the IATA using a computer simulation and clinical thermal parameters obtained during treatment of superficial and subsurface-seated tumours. The configuration of the IATA is a one-turn square column-like coil whose bottom plate is set to face the heating target. The IATA has advantages over RF capacitive-type heating, such as: generating less heat in the subcutaneous fat layer; less convergency of electric line of force at the edge of the applicator; and no physical contact with the target lesion. The induced magnetic fields and electrical currents within the heating substance are simulated using computer-assisted design software for electro-magnetic analysis. A total of 40 superficial and subsurface tumours are treated with the IATA. Invasive thermometry is performed continuously for 110 sessions using multi-sensor probes of an optical thermometer. Thermal parameters (Tmax, Tmin, Tave) are assessed based on the tumour size and depth. The treated tumours are categorised into three groups according to tumour depth: group 1 (&lt; 3 cm, n = 28), group 2 (3-5 cm, n = 35) and group 3 (&gt; 5 cm, n = 47). The computer simulation shows that induced electrical currents run without convergency, parallel to the surface of the heating material. All thermal parameters of group 3 are significantly higher than those of group 1 and 2 (p &lt; 0.05), indicating that the larger lesions tend to abtain a higher temperature distribution. In conclusion, RF inductive hyperthermia using the IATA results in effective temperature distributions in superficial and subsurface tumours, with large tumours being most effectively heated.
