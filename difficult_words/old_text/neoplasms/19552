Currently, 1 per cent isosulfan blue dye and technetium-99-labeled sulfur colloid (SC) are used in lymphatic mapping (LM). Several reports have suggested that the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during LM is high. We report our experience with LM for solid neoplasms in order to determine the incidence and risk factors for development of ADRs. Seven hundred fifty-three patients (90% women, mean age 57) underwent LM with blue dye alone or in combination with SC from 1998 to 2004. The most common malignancy was breast cancer (83%). One hundred ten patients (14%) had injection of both mapping agents. Most patients (87%) underwent intraparenchymal injection of LM agent. Eight patients (1.1%) had an ADR during LM; none had prior exposure to LM. Of these, 7 had limited reactions (mostly blue hives) that quickly resolved. One patient (0.1%) developed anaphylaxis. The ADR incidence in patients with a sulfa allergy was not significantly different than that in patients without a sulfa allergy (3.4 vs 1%, P = 0.12). No risk factors for development of ADR were identified. Overall, the incidence of ADR during LM is low. Patients with sulfa allergies and prior exposure to LM did not demonstrate an increased incidence of ADR. Anaphylaxis, though rare, can occur during LM.
