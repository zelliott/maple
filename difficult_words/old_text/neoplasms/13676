To observe the efficacy and side effects of carboplatin solution in comparison with carboplatin powder.

A multicenter, open randomized controlled trial was carried out. A total of 121 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer (BC) were randomized into carboplatin injection group (study group) and carboplatin powder group (control group), treated with CE, CIE and CAF protocol, respectively. The same drugs and dosage were used in the two groups.

The response rate of the study group and the control group was 94% and 67% in SCLC (P &gt; 0.05), 12% and 22% in NSCLC (P &gt; 0.05) and 71.4% and 67% in BC (P &gt; 0.05), respectively. The major side effects were myelosuppression and gastrointestinal reactions, the frequency and intensity of which were statistically not different in the 2 groups of patients.

Carboplatin solution is as effective as carboplatin powder for the treatment of cancer.
