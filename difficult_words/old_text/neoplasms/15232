Aspergillus terreus, an opportunistic pathogen, was found to be associated with cancerous tissue of the horn core in a weak and old debilitated cow. The organism was isolated in pure and luxurient growth from a surgically operated specimen of the horn core, and was also demonstrated in the fresh mounts and PAS stained sections of the infected tissues. The isolate showed resistance to nystatin (100 micrograms) when tested by paper disk diffusion technique. This appears to be the first report on the occurrence of A. terreus in bovine squamous cell carcinoma of the horn core.
