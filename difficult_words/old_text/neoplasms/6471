Antibodies to intermediate filament proteins react in a tissue-specific manner and can be used to characterize tumor cells present in thin-needle aspirates from solid tumors, from palpable lymph nodes and cells present in samples from peritoneal and pleural effusions. From our studies so far the following conclusions can be drawn: Polyclonal antisera to cytokeratins can identify carcinoma metastases in thin-needle aspirates from palpable lymph nodes and distinguish them from malignant lymphomas and nonmalignant lesions such as chronic lymphadenitis, which show only vimentin-positive cells. Monoclonal antibodies to specific cytokeratin polypeptides are able to distinguish between different types of epithelial tumor metastases, i.e. metastases from adenocarcinomas and metastases from squamous cell carcinomas. Cells present in peritoneal and pleural effusions can be partly characterized using intermediate filament antisera. We have found that metastatic adenocarcinoma cells from breast, ovary, endometrium, cervix, colon and stomach, as well as squamous cell carcinomas and malignant mesothelioma stain specifically with antibodies to cytokeratin while mesenchymally derived tumors such as malignant lymphomas, malignant melanomas, and fibrosarcomas, are positive for vimentin only. Metastatic tumor cells of epithelial origin present in aspirates from human serous body cavity fluids may coexpress vimentin next to their original cytokeratin intermediate filaments. Benign mesothelial cells present in body cavity fluids frequently coexpress cytokeratins and vimentin. Tumor cells present in thin-needle aspirates from solid tumors such as pleomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland can be identified as such because of their typical patterns of intermediate filament (co-)expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
