How farmers protect themselves against pesticide exposure has important public health consequences. To obtain insights into pesticide self-protection, this study obtained data on chemically resistant glove and other protective equipment use as they relate to the type of farming practice, demographic characteristics of farmers and their farming operations, farmers' preventive health beliefs and behaviors, and factors related to their health care. Data were obtained by telephone interviews conducted in six rural Minnesota counties. Survey respondents totaled 1, 327 (87% response rate), with 502 reporting pesticide use. Ninety-five percent of the latter respondents believed in the effectiveness of protective equipment and 88 percent believed that pesticide exposures are harmful. Fifty-six percent of the subjects wore chemically resistant gloves and 22 percent wore other protective clothing 75 percent of the time or more when using pesticides. Glove use and certification to use restricted pesticides was less frequent for women. The use of protective equipment in this group of Minnesota farmers was weakly related to being certified to apply restricted pesticides, believing in the effectiveness of protective clothing, believing that smoking causes serious health problems, using crop insecticides, and distance to a health care facility.
