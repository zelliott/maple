Legislation governing patients' rights and health care quality (March 2002) provided for the creation of healthcare networks intended to improve the management of patients with complex and/or chronic diseases. As defined in the Cancer Plan, activated in March 2003, an oncological healthcare network covers a particular French region, with the aim of offering patients equal access to the best available care and accompaniment, based on caregiver coordination, shared multidisciplinary tools, and communication. ONCOLOR, the regional cancer network launched in the Lorraine region in 1993, complies with these objectives. Nevertheless, its future development depends on continued dynamism, durable financial support, and regular evaluation of the benefits for patients and caregivers. The key words are professionalism and consensus.
