In addition to aberrant transformed cells, tumors are tissues that contain host components, including stromal cells, vascular cells (ECs) and their precursors, and immune cells. All these constituents interact with each other at the cellular and molecular levels, resulting in the production of an intricate and heterogeneous complex of cells and matrix defined as the tumor microenvironment. Several pathways involved in these interactions have been investigated both in pathological and physiological scenarios, and diverse molecules are currently targets of chemotherapeutic and preventive drugs. Many phytochemicals and their derivatives show the ability to inhibit tumor progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis, exerting effects on the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we will outline the principal players and mechanisms involved in the tumor microenvironment network and we will discuss some interesting compounds aimed at interrupting these interactions and blocking tumor insurgence and progression. The considerations provided will be crucial for the design of new preventive approaches to the reduction in cancer risk that need to be applied to large populations composed of apparently healthy individuals.
