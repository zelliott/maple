Specific and sensitive detection of DNA-modifying enzymes represents a cornerstone in modern medical diagnostics. Many of the currently prevalent methods are not preferred in the clinics because they rely heavily on pre-amplification or post-separation steps. This editorial highlights the potential of adopting DNA-based nanosensors for the assessment of the activities of DNA-modifying enzymes, with emphasis on the topoisomerase and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase families. By underlining the existing challenges, we expect that the DNA-nanosensors may soon be promoted to clinical diagnostics via enzyme detection.
