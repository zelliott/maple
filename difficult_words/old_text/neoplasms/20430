Recombinant human eythropoietin (rh-epo) is a well established treatment for many kinds of anemia including the anemia of cancer with or without myelosuppressive chemotherapy. This review considers the effects of rh-epo in humans, tumour-bearing and healthy experimental animals treated with cisplatin with or without rh-epo, and proposes that the ability of rh-epo to improve the quality of life in cancer patients may also be due to interference with the prostaglandin pathways.
