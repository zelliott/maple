The improvement of tumor control rates and improved survival times of radiotherapy patients result in an increasing importance of radiation side effects in normal tissues.

Possibilities for the modulation of normal tissue reaction by stimulation of tissue regeneration, or by interference with general pathogenetic pathways which are not specific for radiation damage, are illustrated by a number of examples.

Increasing knowledge about the pathogenesis of normal tissue radiation responses are expected to significantly improve the efficacy of prophylactic means and possibilities for conservative management of side effects of radiation therapy. Novel approaches may be developed if the so-called "humoral radiation pathology" is taken into consideration in addition to the cellular effects of radiation.
