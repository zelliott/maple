A small amount of allo-lymphocytes were transfused to tumor bearing hosts to introduce tumor antigen. We found the lymphocyte transfusion significantly effective for the treatment of cancer, of animals and of human as well. We also found that by using a small amount of anti-cancer agents together, this treatment was effective for peritonitis/pleuritis carcinomatosa. Furthermore, we took the ascites and/or the pleural fluid from those peritonitis/pleuritis carcinomatosa patients at their remission stage, and fractionate the fraction V by the alcohol fractionation method from the supernatant of the fluid, and transfuse it back to the patient for the purpose of improving hypoproteinemia, and we found the fraction effective for the cure of the cancer. We designated this fraction the bio-reproducing protein (BRP). The clinical test treatments using the BRP were performed for terminal stage cancer of digestive system, respiratory system, mammary, and others with the efficacy of 76 percent. The detail analysis of the characteristics and the working mechanism of the BRP is in progress.
