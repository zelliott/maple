Vorinostat (V) at levels &gt;2.5 µM enhances chemotherapy in vitro. Yet the approved oral dose of 400 mg inconsistently achieves this level in patients. We developed an intermittent oral pulse-dose schedule of V to increase serum levels. We combined V with the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol (F) which increases V-induced apoptosis.

One week before combination treatment, V alone was given daily for 3d (cycle -1). Then V was given on d1-3 and d8-10, and F on d2 and d9, every 21-d. Due to neutropenia, this was modified to V on d1-3 and d15-17, and F on d2 and d16, every 28-d. Bolus and split-dose F schedules were studied.

34 patients were treated. On the 21-d schedule, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was V 600 mg/d and F 60 mg/m(2) bolus. On the 28-d schedule, the MTD was V 800 mg/d and F 30 mg/m(2) over 30 min and 30 mg/m(2) over 4 h. V C(max) at the 800 mg dose was 4.8 µM (± 2.8). V C(max) ≥ 2.5 µM was achieved in 86% of patients at the MTD. F increased the C(max) of V by 27% (95% CI 11%-43%). F C(max) of ≥ 2 µM was achieved in 90% of patients. 8 patients had stable disease for on average 5.5 m (range 1.6-13.2 m).

Intermittent high dose oral V in combination with F is feasible and achieves target serum levels &gt;2.5 µM. V concentrations higher than previously reported with oral dosing were achieved.
