This paper reviews recent anti-emetic developments, with particular reference to the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. These drugs are at least as effective as conventional regimens for controlling acute nausea and vomiting in patients receiving highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and abdominal radiotherapy. They have less side effects than do alternative drugs. Improved control of acute nausea and vomiting by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists seems to reduce anticipatory symptoms in subsequent cycles. Dexamethasone enhances activity of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Improved control of acute nausea and vomiting by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may remove one obstacle to offering palliative chemotherapy.
