Liposomal drug delivery systems markedly alter the biodistribution of their associated drugs by delaying drug clearance, retarding drug metabolism, decreasing the volume of distribution, and shifting the distribution in favour of diseased tissues with increased capillary permeability. This increases the therapeutic indices of the associated drugs, by increasing the drug concentration in solid tumours and regions of infection, and reducing the drug concentration in normal tissues. Three liposomal formulations have been approved for clinical use.
