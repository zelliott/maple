The highly conserved RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), are a class of small single stranded noncoding RNAs that function through translational repression of specific target mRNAs. miRNAs exhibit a wide range of involvement regulating gene expressions. miRNA expression dysregulated in cancer cells and damaged tissues from different diseases implicates a functional role of miRNAs in the disease development. More recently miRNAs have been detected in cell-free serum, and these circulating miRNAs can distinguish diseased individuals from healthy controls. The noninvasive nature of circulating miRNA collection and their sensitivity and specificity in diseases has encouraged a pursuit of miRNA biomarker research. As a result, approximately 100 circulating miRNAs have been identified as biomarkers for different diseases, and the number is growing. Here we review recently reported circulating miRNA biomarkers and discuss their values and challenges for the disease biomarkers.
