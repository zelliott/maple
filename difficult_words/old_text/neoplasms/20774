We used the Swedish Family-Cancer Database to analyze the spectrum of cancers diagnosed in husbands of women with in situ or invasive cervical cancer, and we compared these to second carcinogenic events in women presenting with these cancers. Our hypothesis was increased cancer susceptibility from human papilloma virus (HPV). When the wives had in situ or invasive cervical cancer, the standard incidence ratios (SIRs) for anal cancer in husbands were 1.75 (95% CI = 1.05-2.62) and 1.92 (95% CI = 0.69-3.76). Anal cancer was also increased as a second primary cancer in women. Other common cancers were related to tobacco smoking. The results indicate that HPV infection is associated with anal cancer in both men and women.
