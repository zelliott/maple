The article summarizes the present status of interferon (IFN) research from therapeutical point of view. This includes its understanding as an antiviral agent and a cell regulator of hormonal- and/or cytokine-type. The IFN seems to represent a part of a balanced multisystem of unsharp contoures. In addition to the analysis of published therapeutical trials, the conclusion is made that without a deeper insight in the functioning of this system, it is difficult to create a rational base for IFN therapy of viral, oncological and/or autoimmune diseases of man.
