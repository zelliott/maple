Blood vessels are critical to normal mammalian development, tissue repair, and growth and treatment of cancer. Mouse research models enable mechanistic studies of blood vessels. We detail how to perfuse mice with fluorescent tomato lectin or the lipophilic fluorophore DiI. We provide details on how to image fluorescently labeled blood vessels.
