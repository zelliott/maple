1. Fifteen patients received 1.5 g m-2 of ifosfamide intravenously over 0.5 h every day for 5 days. Twenty-one courses of treatment were studied. Plasma was assayed for ifosfamide by gas liquid chromatography and plasma alkylating activity was measured using the nitrobenzylpyridine (NBP) reaction. 2. A pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a significant decrease in the median (range) elimination half-life of ifosfamide from 7.2 (2.8-14.2) h on day 1 to 4.6 (2.3-7.7) h on day 5 (P less than 0.001, Wilcoxon's test) with a concomitant significant increase in the median (range) clearance from 66 (31-148) ml min-1 on day 1 to 115 (52-381) ml min-1 on day 5 (P less than 0.001). There was no significant change in the volume of distribution on day 5 compared with day 1. 3. There was a highly significant 223% increase in the median (range) plasma nitrobenzylpyridine alkylating activity area under the curve on day 1 from 16 (0.6-105) nmol nor nitrogen mustard equivalents ml-1 h to 52 (13-238) nmol nor nitrogen mustard equivalents ml-1 h on day 5. 4. During five courses of treatment (in five patients in the group) 24 h urine samples were collected on days 1 and 5. The median (range) renal clearance of ifosfamide on day 1 was 6.8 (1.3-16.2) ml min-1 compared with 5.7 (1.3-15.3) ml min-1 on day 5. This difference was not significant. The median (range) metabolic clearance of ifosfamide in these five patients on day 1 was 78.6 (39.9-141.2) ml min-1 and 132.6 (54.6-149.5) ml min-1 on day 5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
