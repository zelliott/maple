The World Health Organization document Cancer Pain Relief and Palliative Care in Children (WHO, 1998) advocates the global application of the principles of pain management and palliative care for children with cancer. The principles of pain management include the application of the WHO analgesic ladder, appropriate opioid dose escalation, the use of adjuvant analgesics, and the use of non-pharmacological methods of pain control. These principles of pain management should be incorporated into the treatment protocols of all children with cancer, acknowledging that treatment options may be limited for some children.
