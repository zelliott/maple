Selenium is effective in reducing cancer incidence in animal models, and epidemiologic data, as well as supplementation trials, have indicated that selenium is likely to be effective in humans. The mechanism by which selenium prevents cancer remains unknown. The mammalian genome encodes 25 selenoprotein genes, each containing one or more molecules of selenium in the form of the amino acid selenocysteine, translationally inserted into the growing peptide in response to the UGA codon. There is evidence that several of these proteins may be involved with the mechanism by which selenium provides its anticancer effects. Data are reviewed indicating that genetic variants of the cytosolic glutathione peroxidase are associated with increased cancer risk, and that loss of one of the copies of this same gene may be involved with malignant progression. Similarly, allelic differences in the gene for a second selenoprotein, Sep15, may be relevant to the protection provided by selenium, and allelic loss at this locus have been reported as well. These data, along with the differential expression patterns reported for other selenoproteins in tumor vs. normal tissues, support the role of selenoproteins in the chemoprotection by selenium.
