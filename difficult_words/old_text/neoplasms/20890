Genetic immunization refers to treatment strategies where gene transfer methods are used to generate immune responses against cancer. Our growing knowledge of the mechanisms regulating the initiation and maintenance of cytotoxic immune responses has provided the rationale for the design of several genetic immunization strategies. Tumor cells have been gene-modified to express immune stimulatory genes and are then administered as tumor vaccines, in an attempt to overcome tumor cell ignorance by the immune system. With the description of well-characterized tumor antigens, multiple strategies have been proposed mainly aimed at optimal tumor antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APC). Among APC, the dendritic cells have been recognized as the most powerful cells in this class, and have become the target for introducing tumor antigen genes to initiate antitumor immune responses. The detailed knowledge of how the immune system can be activated to specifically recognize tumor antigens, and the mechanisms involved in the control of this immune response, provide the basis for modern genetic immunization strategies for cancer treatment.
