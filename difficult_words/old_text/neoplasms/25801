To document how people living in rural areas use of intend to use complementary therapies and to determine demographic factors related to the use of these therapies.

Descriptive, cross-sectional survey.

Three cancer treatment clinics and one support group located in the rural Midwest.

53 people with cancer, predominantly Caucasian, ages 42-91.

Nurses distributed the previously tested investigator-developed Complementary Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS). Clients who wished to participate completed the survey and mailed it to the primary researcher.

Use of complementary therapies, client ratings of effectiveness, and demographic variables.

87% of the clients were using at least one complementary therapy. Prayer, humor, and support group attendance were the most popular. Women, younger clients, support group members, and those who lived closer to town had significantly higher scores on the CTRS.

More rural people with cancer reported using complementary therapies than could have been predicted from the available literature. However, most literature focuses on alternative cancer treatment as opposed to use of complementary therapies were easily available and inexpensive and have no known side effects. More research is needed on the effectiveness of these therapies.

Workshops or research projects involving complementary therapies should include those therapies that people with cancer frequently use. Younger clients and women may be most interested in participating, and projects should be scheduled to avoid frequent trips into town.
