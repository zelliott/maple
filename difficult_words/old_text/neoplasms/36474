A crossover clinical trial was carried out to compare the effectiveness and safety of granisetron alone (40 micrograms/kg) with that from a combination of granisetron plus methylprednisolone (MPL, 10 mg/kg) for control of emesis and vomiting induced by anticancer drugs in children with cancer. Complete control of emesis and vomiting were achieved in 95% (19/20 cases) of patients receiving the combination compared to 85% (17/20 cases) of patients receiving granisetron alone. There were no clinical toxicities or side effects in either treatment group. These data indicated that the combination of granisetron plus MPL was superior for control of emesis and vomiting in children receiving cytostatic anticancer drugs.
