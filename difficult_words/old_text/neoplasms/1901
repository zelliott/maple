Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assays were performed on effusion fluid and plasma samples of 55 patients; 38 with malignant and 17 with benign disease. Sensitivity of plasma CEA was 60.5 per cent while specificity was 76.5 per cent. Sensitivity of effusion fluid CEA was 52.63 per cent but specificity was 100 per cent. Sensitivity of the cytological examination of the fluid was 60.5 per cent and no false positive diagnosis was made. Detection rate of malignancy increased to 81.6 per cent (31 of 38) when cytology and effusion fluid CEA were used in adjunction for diagnosis, with 100 per cent specificity.
