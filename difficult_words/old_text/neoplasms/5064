The graphic processing unit (GPU) based TomoTherapy convolution/superposition(C/S) dose engine (GPU dose engine) achieves a dramatic performance improvement over the traditional CPU-cluster based TomoTherapy dose engine (CPU dose engine). Besides the architecture difference between the GPU and CPU, there are several algorithm changes from the CPU dose engine to the GPU dose engine. These changes made the GPU dose slightly different from the CPU-cluster dose. In order for the commercial release of the GPU dose engine, its accuracy has to be validated.

Thirty eight TomoTherapy phantom plans and 19 patient plans were calculated with both dose engines to evaluate the equivalency between the two dose engines. Gamma indices (Γ) were used for the equivalency evaluation. The GPU dose was further verified with the absolute point dose measurement with ion chamber and film measurements for phantom plans. Monte Carlo calculation was used as a reference for both dose engines in the accuracy evaluation in heterogeneous phantom and actual patients.

The GPU dose engine showed excellent agreement with the current CPU dose engine. The majority of cases had over 99.99% of voxels with Γ(1%, 1 mm) &lt; 1. The worst case observed in the phantom had 0.22% voxels violating the criterion. In patient cases, the worst percentage of voxels violating the criterion was 0.57%. For absolute point dose verification, all cases agreed with measurement to within ±3% with average error magnitude within 1%. All cases passed the acceptance criterion that more than 95% of the pixels have Γ(3%, 3 mm) &lt; 1 in film measurement, and the average passing pixel percentage is 98.5%-99%. The GPU dose engine also showed similar degree of accuracy in heterogeneous media as the current TomoTherapy dose engine.

It is verified and validated that the ultrafast TomoTherapy GPU dose engine can safely replace the existing TomoTherapy cluster based dose engine without degradation in dose accuracy.
