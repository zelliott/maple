Data from the Cytology Service of the Anti-Cancer Foundation of the University of Adelaide were submitted to computer analysis to compare the prevalence of carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma of the cervic in users and nonusers of oral contraceptives.  Results of cervical smears from 26,286 oral contraceptive users and 23,512 nonusers were compared (38.8% of the total computer record chosen for detailed study because age, parity, contraceptive use, cytology and/or histopathology were known).  When age and parity were examined, it was found that younger women (age 24-34) tend to use oral contraceptives, especially those of parity 2 plus.  The only relationships found between carcinoma in situ and oral contraceptive use were in women age 30 or less who had 2 or more children and used oral contraceptives and in women aged 41 or more who had 2 or more children and did not use oral contraceptives;  both groups had an increased prevalence of the disease.  The prevalence of invasive carcinoma was increased in women over the age of 31 who did not use oral contraceptives.  This was highly significant in women over the age of 40.  Further study will be required to identify the factors at work.  In the meantime it is recommended that oral contraceptives only be prescribed after cytological examinations have been made.
