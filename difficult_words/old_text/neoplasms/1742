The genetic modification of T lymphocytes is an important methodology for investigating T-cell biology and bears great promise as a possible strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Several genetic approaches under evaluation aim to facilitate and increase the recognition of tumor antigens, enhance antitumor activities, and counteract the multiple mechanisms responsible for tumor immune evasion in vivo. T cells can also be engineered in an attempt to control their homing, to increase the safety of adoptive T-cell therapies, and express markers that can be tracked by noninvasive imaging technologies.
