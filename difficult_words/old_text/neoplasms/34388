In the experiments (605 animals) and clinically (145 patients with malignant neoplasms) the authors have studied the possibility to use superhigh-frequency electromagnetic hyperthermia (42 degrees), associated with ionizing radiation in the complex treatment of tumors. The superhigh-frequency electromagnetic hyperthermia is really one of the ways to enhance the radiosensitivity of a neoplastic tissue. Ionizing radiation and SHF-hyperthermia used simultaneously provide for the directed and prompt disactivation of tumor cells.
