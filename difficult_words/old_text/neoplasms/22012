The aim of this study was to assess regional survival differences among childhood cancer patients in Europe. For this exercise, the Automated Childhood Cancer Information System (ACCIS) database was utilised. Survival data from 54 population-based cancer registries on 49,651 childhood cancer patients aged 0-14 years and diagnosed in 1988-1997 were analysed using life-table method. Overall, the 5-year survival was 72% among all patients, varying from 62% to 77% between the five geographical regions. The East region generally had lower survival rates than the rest of Europe. The geographical differences indicate the need for more co-ordination, systematisation and standardisation in diagnosis, referral and the treatment of childhood cancers in Europe. Increase of resources is necessary to improve the lower survival in the East region. Continuing data collection on a European level will facilitate monitoring of population-based survival of childhood cancer patients.
