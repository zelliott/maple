Quantitative analysis of urinary cyclic AMP in phospho-calcic pathology. The authors describe a method measuring amounts of cyclic AMP. Normal daily elimination in urine was measured in a group of normal subjects. Elimination was found to be raised in two-thirds of the patients with primary hyperparathryroidism, normal in those with idiopathic hypercalcaemia and neoplastic hypercalcaemia, and subnormal in patients with hypoparathyroidism. The urinary excretion of cyclic AMP after perfusion of parathyroid hormone was very low in cases of pseudo-hypoparathyroidism compared with that in surgical hypoparathroid controls. The results are compared with data from the literature. The theoretical and diagnostic value of these quantitative analyses is discussed.
