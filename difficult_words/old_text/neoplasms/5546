AIDS-related cancer research may also lead to advances in cancer treatment in HIV-negative people. Significant findings in the treatment of AIDS-related cancers were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. Researchers at the Center for AIDS Research at the University of California, San Diego, found that granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF/Neupogen) was well-tolerated when administered to patients with AIDS. G-CSF could be administered to enhance the immune system rather than having patients undergo bone marrow transplantation. Vinorelbine (Navelbine), a chemotherapeutic agent, could be effective for the treatment of HIV-positive patients with previously-treated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), according to Dr. Domenico Erranto of the Centro Di Riferimento Oncologia, Italy. The effects of commonly-used medications, particularly immunosupressive chemotherapy agents, on HIV viral replication are unknown. Preliminary findings from the AIDS Malignancy Program at the Illinois Masonic Cancer Center in Chicago suggest that standard chemotherapeutic agents do not significantly affect HIV activity when used in combination with anti-HIV drug therapies.
