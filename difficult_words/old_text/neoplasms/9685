Radiolabelled peptides have shown to be an important class of radiopharmaceuticals for imaging and therapy of malignancies expressing receptors of regulatory peptides. These peptides have high affinity and specificity for their receptors. The majority of these receptors are present at different levels in different tissues and tumours. This review focuses on the application of regulatory peptides radiolabelled with (67/68)Ga, (90)Y, (111)In or (177)Lu. Due attention is given to the current status of research, limitations and future perspectives of the application of these radiolabelled peptides for imaging and radiotherapy. It also covers elements of the basic science and preclinical and clinical aspects in general, however, mostly based on somatostatin receptor-mediated imaging and therapy. New analogues, chelators, radionuclides and combinations thereof are discussed.
