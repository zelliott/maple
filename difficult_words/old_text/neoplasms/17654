The objectives of this paper were 1) to identify occupations with potentially high cancer risk by combining the results of 12 major occupational disease surveillance studies, 2) to develop a quantitative methodology for accomplishing the first objective, and 3) to make recommendations concerning priorities for occupational cancer research and control on the basis of the results of this analysis in conjunction with other available epidemiologic, industrial hygiene, toxicologic, and employment data. It was suggested that the first priority be the investigation and control of occupational exposure to asbestos, particularly in the automobile repair and construction industries. Of the 34 occupational groups found to be at high risk for lung cancer in this analysis, 18 have potential asbestos exposure. The second priority was suggested to be research into the consistent lung-cancer excess found among motor vehicle drivers. This excess may be due to occupational exposure to diesel and gasoline engine exhaust, to cigarette smoking, or to both of these factors.
