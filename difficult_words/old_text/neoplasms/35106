Differential diagnosis of round and spindle cell type tumors in childhood is difficult. Diagnosis can be facilitated by additional immunohistochemical analysis (case 1) or detection of characteristic histological patterns (case 2). Rapid growth is not an exclusive feature of malignant tumors, but can also be observed in benign tumors and tumor-like conditions of young patients (case 3).
