The recent completion of the human genome sequence provided the basis and the tools to better understand the cellular biological complexity in both healthy and disease conditions, such as human cancer. In recent years, the improvement in biological and molecular knowledge enabled us to identify new targets and innovative drugs, allowing the beginning of new therapeutic strategies based on the so called "target oriented therapies".
