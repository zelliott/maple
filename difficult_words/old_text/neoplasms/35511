Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) are signalling messengers that control many cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, the cell cycle and DNA repair. It is becoming apparent that the deregulation of ubiquitin pathways results in the development of human diseases, including many types of tumours. Here we summarize the common principles and specific features of ubiquitin and Ubls in the regulation of cancer-relevant pathways, and discuss new strategies to target ubiquitin signalling in drug discovery.
