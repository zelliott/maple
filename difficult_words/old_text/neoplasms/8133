The immuno-cell therapy of cancer in Japan is in the phase of transition from therapeutic research to a more generalized option for all patients. A short history of cancer immunotherapy in Japan and its present status are summarized. In 1999, the first private clinic with a cell processing facility and specializing in immuno-cell therapy was established. Since then, the number of such clinics has increased. As a result, the number of patients who undergone the therapy has markedly increased. A summary of the clinical results of the therapy in 1401 patients treated in two leading clinics is also presented.
