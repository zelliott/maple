Chili peppers are the major source of nature capsaicinoids, which consist of capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin, homodihydrocapsaicin, and homocapsaicin, etc. Capsaicinoids are found to exert multiple pharmacological and physiological effects including the activities of analgesia, anticancer, anti-inflammation, antioxidant and anti-obesity. Therefore, capsaicinoids may have the potential value in clinic for pain relief, cancer prevention and weight loss. In addition, capsaicinoids also display the benefits on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system. It has been shown that capsaicinoids are potential agonists of capsaicin receptor or transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1). They could exert the effects not only through the receptor-dependent pathway but also through the receptor-independent one. CH-19 Sweet peppers are the source of nature capsinoids, which share similar structure with capsaicinoids and consist of capsiate, dihydrocapsiate, and nordihydrocapsiate, etc, Comparing with capsaicinoids, capsinoids are less pungent and easily broken down in the normal aqueous conditions. So far, it has been found that capsinoids possess the biological properties of antitumor, antioxidant and anti-obesity. Since capsinoids are less toxic than capsaicinoids, therefore, capsinoids may have the advantages over capsaicinoids in clinical applications such as cancer prevention and weight loss.
