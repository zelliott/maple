The past several years have seen a tremendous advance in the understanding of the basic mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. A large number of studies have not only linked epigenetics with cell cycle regulation but also partially unravelled how epigenetics may regulate gene expression. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the latest findings and current ideas on epigenetics with a focus on emphasizing the emerging influence epigenetics has on the onset and progression of cancer.
