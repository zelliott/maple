Quality-of-life (QoL) assessment is crucial for the evaluation of a palliative care outcome. This article investigates the applicability of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) on a German sample of terminally ill cancer patients receiving palliative care in different settings. Patients were randomly selected in 10 palliative homecare services and one palliative care unit in a general hospital and 'evaluated' among the consecutively 'registered' patients. The random sample of patients (n-121) was representative of the general patient population cared for by the palliative care services in Germany. The EORTC QLQ-C30 was administered to the terminally ill cancer patients on their first day in hospital or upon their first contact with the specialized palliative homecare team. The clinical variable assessed was the Karnofsky performance status. The questionnaire was well accepted in the present patient population. In addition, the questionnaire was found to be useful in detecting the effectiveness of palliative treatment over a period of time. This study shows that QoL measures can be used to assess the outcome in palliative care.
