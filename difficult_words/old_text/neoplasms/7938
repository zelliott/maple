Following the well-known European CCRs of Manchester and Turin, 2 regional CCRs have been recently created in France: in Nancy (1983) and Marseille (1984); both are population based CCRs, covering respectively 535,200 and 809,200 children (0-14 yrs). All malignant neoplasms are included, as well as brain tumours (whatever grading) and borderline malignancies. Data are collected from medical and administrative sources. Registration is active and every source is recontacted annually. The registries contact all physicians who might include children among their patients (private and hospital practice), and laboratories of pathology-cytology. The University Hospital Centers and Anti-Cancer Centers in adjacent regions, and in Paris are contacted. Death certificates for children dying of a malignant neoplasm are also sent to the registry. Data collected are as follows: name, age, sex, address, date and method of diagnosis, histological type, anatomical site, stage, treatment and sources of information. We added the data of a general cancer registry, created in Strasbourg in 1975 and covering 205,900 children. reliability of the methodology is attested by the similarity of the results obtained in other European, US and Australian CCRs. In conclusion, this type of registry is needed to organize multicentric epidemiological studies about the role of etiological factors, the survival, and the long term sequelae.
