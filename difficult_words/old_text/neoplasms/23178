The synthesis of some new 4-chloro-pyrimidine-5-carbonitriles (3b-d), 4-substituted-amino-pyrimidine-5-carbonitriles (4a-g), trioxo and dioxo-thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine-6-carbonitriles (5a-c and 6a-h) have been described. The obtained compounds were evaluated for their in-vitro antitumor activity. A single dose (10 ÂµM) of the test compounds was used in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 60 cell lines panel assay. Compounds 3c and 4f showed high inhibitory activity against leukemia, whereas, compounds 3b and 4d, g displayed moderate activity. On the other hand, all compounds were screened for their in-vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities. Compounds 3d and 4b exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Compound 4e showed two folds inhibitory activity against Entrobacter aerogener compared with the reference drug Tobramycin.
