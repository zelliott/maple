To improve the quality of digital nuclear medicine images, we have developed a new implementation of the Wiener restoration filter. The Wiener filter uses as its optimality criterion the minimization of the mean-square error between the undistorted image of the object and the filtered image. In order to form this filter, the object and noise power spectrums are needed. The noise power spectrum for the count-dependent Poisson noise of nuclear medicine images is shown to have a constant average magnitude equal to the total count in the image. The object power spectrum is taken to be the image power spectrum minus the total count, except in the noise dominated region of the image power spectrum where a least-squares-fitted exponential is used. Processing time is kept to a clinically acceptable time frame through use of an array processor. Pronounced noise suppression and detail enhancement are noted with use of this filter with clinical images.
