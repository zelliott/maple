The urine levels of immunosuppressive acidic protein (IAP) were measured in patients with and without cancer, using passive hemagglutination inhibition test and 24-h urine samples. In 23 control healthy adults, the urine levels of IAP were 0.13-1.3 mg/day. If an elevation of IAP levels were found in 46 (48%) of 96 cancer patients. Elevated urine IAP levels were found in 6 (18%) of 34 patients with non-cancerous gastrointestinal tract diseases.
