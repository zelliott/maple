Cell-Cell-and cell-extracellular matrix interactions are important in the process of tumor cell invasion and metastasis. These interactions are mediated by adhesion molecules e.g. CD44, integrins, E-cadherin and N-CAM. The role of adhesion molecules along metastatic cascade as well as their importance in tumor differentiation and progression are discussed herein.
