Distress associated with cancer often presents with symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective psychological treatments. Complementary therapies, especially aromatherapy massage (AM), are also popular and alleviate anxiety. No studies have directly compared these two treatments.

The aim of this study is to (1) test the feasibility of recruitment into a randomised controlled trial of AM versus CBT in patients with cancer; (2) test and modify the intervention; (3) determine whether changes in outcomes were consistent with published data.

Patients at all stages of cancer, recruited from oncology outpatient clinics and screening eight or more for anxiety and/or depression on the HADS, were randomised to Treatment as Usual (TAU) plus up to eight sessions weekly of either AM or CBT, offered within 3 months. The POMS was collected at baseline and 3 and 6 months post baseline.

Of those suitable, over 60% (39/63) participated (AM, n = 20; CBT, n = 19) and over 90% (36/39) were followed up. Both packages were well received. The preference was for AM, with more sessions were taken up; (Mean number sessions AM = 7.2 (SD 2.0) and CBT = 5.4 (SD 3.1); P&lt;0.05). Significant improvements in POMS (Total Mood, depression and anxiety scores) occurred with both interventions. Between-group comparison showed a non-significant trend towards greater improvement in depression with CBT.

Recruitment was feasible; the interventions acceptable and engagement with treatment was high. Improvements with both interventions were observed. The beneficial effects on depression with CBT appeared to be sustained.
