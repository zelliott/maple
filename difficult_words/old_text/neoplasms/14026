The application of hyperthermia in tumor therapy is expanded to a high degree. As affecting point in biological tissue the following is discussed: Cytotoxic effect with temperatures of 43 degrees C with alterations on cell membrane and in intermediate metabolism, injury of microcirculation, where--because of a pathological vascularisation--tumor tissue is affected in a stronger way than the better adapted vessel net of normal tissue. The radiosensitizing effect between 40 and 42 degrees C is of interest for radiologist. Degree and duration of temperature and the interval between irradiation and thermal application modify the amplifying thermal factor. As adjuvant therapeutic modality the hyperthermia can decrease the hypoxic radioresistant part of cells and is an additional palliative therapeutic measure. Indications within a curative radiotherapy are elaborated at present globally.
