The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that there are differences in the distribution of negative thoughts among major depressive disorders (MDD), depressive disorders among cancer patients, and IFN-alpha-induced depression.

Twenty-three patients affected by MDD, 25 cancer patients affected by depressive disorders (20 MDD), and 19 patients affected by IFN-alpha-induced depression satisfying MDD criteria were evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the 13-item Beck Depression Inventory.

Sense of guilt was higher among MDD patients (56.5%) and was lower among cancer patients (4%) (P&lt;.0001). Sense of failure, dissatisfaction, and self-dislike were higher among MDD patients than among IFN-alpha patients (P&lt;.0001).

In our study, patients affected by MDD present a different pattern of symptoms in comparison with patients affected by IFN-alpha-induced depression and depressive disorders. In particular, core depressive thoughts were less frequent in the last two conditions.
