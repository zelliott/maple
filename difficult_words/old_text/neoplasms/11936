The absorption, blood levels, distribution, excretion, and biotransformation of styrene in man and experimental animals are briefly reviewed. The acute toxicity of styrene appears to be unrelated to its biotransformation. Reports of organ toxicity upon chronic exposure to styrene are rare; however, since the chief intermediate in styrene metabolism is an epoxide, hepatotoxicity due to covalent binding at the site of formation appears to be a possibility.
