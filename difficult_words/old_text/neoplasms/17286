Chemotherapy-induced emesis (CIE) both in the form of nausea and vomiting is one of the adverse effects most feared by patients who receive treatment, and one of the factors that most affect their quality of life and limit their functional capacity for everyday activities. Chemotherapy-induced emesis can result from many factors, depending on the treatment and the patients themselves. The best treatment for CIE is prevention, based on the use of drugs aimed at inhibiting the signal of certain neurotransmitters involved in the process. Antiemetic prophylaxis for chemotherapy of high-emetogenous potential lasting 1 day includes a combination of anti-5-HT3, neurokinin-1 inhibitors and dexamethasone. Antiemetic prophylaxis for chemotherapy of moderate-emetogenous potential lasting 1 day includes a combination of palonosetron and dexamethasone. Prophylaxis is not recommended for chemotherapy with minimal emetogenous potential. In the case of unforeseen or refractory emesis the use of olanzapine, metoclopramide or phenothiazine should be considered.
