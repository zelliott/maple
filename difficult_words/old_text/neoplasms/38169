Anorexia-cachexia syndrome is a very common symptom observed in individuals affected by chronic inflammatory diseases. The present study was designed to address the possible involvement of the inducible microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) in the hypopaghia observed during these pathological states. To this end, we used a model of cancer-induced anorexia and we report here that despite the absence of up-regulation of the mPGES-1 enzyme within the brain during anorexia-cachexia syndrome, mPGES-1 knock-out mice exhibit resistance to tumor-induced anorexia and maintain their body mass.
