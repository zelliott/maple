Molecular epidemiological studies assess individual chemical exposures and genetic susceptibility in order to identify cancer risk. Such studies incorporate the development, application, and validation of biomarkers of cancer risk in order to enhance cancer risk assessments, focus cancer prevention strategies, and elucidate mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Current studies of molecular epidemiology are based upon an understanding of the complex, multistage process of carcinogenesis and interindividual variations in response to carcinogenic exposures. Quantitative methods to measure human exposures to carcinogens continue to improve and have been successfully applied to a number of epidemiological studies. Genetic predispositions to cancer, both inherited and acquired, have been and continue to be identified. The combined approach of associating genetic polymorphisms with carcinogen-DNA adduct measurements, in order to assess cancer risk, is showing considerable promise. It is hoped that, in the future, molecular epidemiologists will be able to develop a risk profile for an individual that includes assessment of multiple biomarkers. The field has the near-term potential to have a significant impact on regulatory quantitative risk assessments, which may aid in the determination of allowable exposures. Molecular epidemiological data may also aid in the identification of individuals who will most benefit by cancer prevention strategies.
