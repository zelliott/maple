The introduction of hybridoma technology has rapidly expanded the role of immunohistochemical analysis in identification of anaplastic malignancy. High affinity antibodies now allow the detection of a wide range of tissue specific antigens so that anaplastic tumours can be accurately classified without the need for costly and often unrewarding, time-consuming ancillary investigations such as electron microscopy, cell culture and chromosomal studies. This review examines the application of a selected panel of commercially available antibodies of proven specificity for the diagnosis of anaplastic round cell tumours. Details of specific examples are provided to illustrate the role of such tissue specific antibodies as diagnostic probes and the approach to anaplastic tumours in various sites is discussed.
