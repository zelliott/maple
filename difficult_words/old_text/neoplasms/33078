The Basic Act for Anti-Cancer Measures was enacted in June 2006. Behind this act were the activities of patients who protested the state of cancer treatment in Japan, in which patients were cut off without appropriate chemotherapy or palliative care after being told "there is nothing more we can do to treat you" These patients called for hospitals to carry out cancer treatment at world standards, requested early approval of drugs, demanded the training of specialists able to provide expert chemotherapy, and proposed ways for the provision of accurate cancer-related information. Their message won sympathy in society, and led to the current reforms in cancer treatment. Issues remain, however, such as the creation of a system for use of drugs outside their indication. A physician approach and medical system is also needed so that each patient can receive support with respect for his or her values when a cure cannot be expected.
