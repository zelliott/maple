The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) may vary among children before undergoing hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT). This study examined the HRQOL of children scheduled for HPCT, the effects of diagnosis and age on HRQOL, and the convergent validity of one generic and two disease-specific measures of HRQOL.

The sample consisted of 111 children (mean age = 10.4 years) diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 22%), other leukemias (26%), neuroblastoma (19%), other solid tumors (18%), and hematologic disorders (15%). Convergence validity was tested with 67 children (mean age = 10.3 years) who had an equivalent distribution of diagnoses except for neuroblastoma (12%). The Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ), a generic measure, and the Pediatric Oncology Quality of Life Scale (POQOL) and the Play Performance Scale (PPS), disease-specific measures, were completed by one parent prior to HPCT.

Compared to the norms for healthy children, the CHQ Physical summary scores for every diagnostic subgroup and the CHQ Psychosocial summary scores for ALL were poorer. Compared to the cancer norms for Total POQOL and PPS scores, scores for ALL and neuroblastoma were the poorest. These measures also revealed that adolescents' HRQOL was perceived to be worse than children's. Total POQOL scores showed strong convergent validity with CHQ Physical and Psychosocial scores and moderate convergent validity with the PPS scores.

Based on parental reports, children treated for ALL and neuroblastoma appear to be at the greatest risk for poor HRQOL before undergoing HPCT, and adolescents seem to be more compromised than younger children, based on parental reports. The POQOL measure seems to be the best predictor of HRQOL. These results have clinical implications for the care of children undergoing HPCT.
