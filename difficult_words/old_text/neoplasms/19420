As the frequency of chemotherapy was increasing at an out-patient clinic, chemotherapy centers for an outpatient clinic have been established. When chemotherapy was carried out for 25 patients in a day at an outpatient clinic, the mean time was 27.6 minutes from ordering the drugs to the drugs' arrival. When the line was crowded, the drug arrival time was more than one hour, and at least 90 minutes was necessary to begin the chemotherapy. As the number of patients increases, it is necessary to have the effective use of a chemotherapy room and the patients have to be divided according to the duration of time required for chemotherapy. It appears that a continuation of infusion chemotherapy will be frequently carried out and the chemotherapy with an IVH port and a portable pump system will be popular in the future. It is necessary to make the system which supports a continuous infusion like this.
