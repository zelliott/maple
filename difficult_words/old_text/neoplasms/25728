The Ah receptor (Ahr) gene occupies a central role in the metabolic pathways involved in the detoxification of important environmental carcinogens. The structures of the rodent and human genes have been elucidated, and the molecular details of the receptor function, including its interaction with other proteins such as Arnt and hsp90, have been thoroughly investigated. The Ahr gene is polymorphic in mice and in humans. In mice, good correlations have been found between structural polymorphisms in the gene and functional variants in various genetic strains. In humans, work on polymorphisms and their possible role in gene function as well as cancer susceptibility is just beginning.
