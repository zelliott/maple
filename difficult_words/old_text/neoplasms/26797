Biotin was conjugated on poloxamer to prepare biotin-poloxamer (BP) conjugate micelles for chemotherapeutics. Epirubicin (EPI) was encapsulated in BP micelles. The EPI-loaded BP micelles were characterized in terms of size, ζ-potential, morphology, drug loading, drug encapsulation and drug release. Marrow leukemic HL-60 cells were used for evaluating the in vitro cytotoxicity of EPI-loaded BP micelles. Nude mice were axillainoculated subcutaneously HL-60 cells to establish tumour model for investigating the inhibition effects of EPI-loaded BP micelles. From the results, the sizes of these nanoparticles were about 100 nm. Fluorescence microscope observation supported the enhanced cellular uptake of the micelles. The order of the inhibition on tumour volume growth was: EPI-loaded BP micelles &gt;EPI-loaded MATP micelles &gt;EPI-loaded poloxamer micelles &gt;EPI. BP micelles showed significant antitumour activity and low toxicity, compared with the non-targeted micelles. With the advantage of EPR effect and tumour-targeting potential, BP conjugate micelles might be developed as a new system for chemotherapeutics.
