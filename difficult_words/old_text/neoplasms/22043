We previously showed that naive CD4+ Th cells acquire peptide-MHC class I (pMHC I) and costimulatory molecules from OVA-pulsed dendritic cells (DC(OVA)), and act as Th-APCs in stimulation of CD8+ CTL responses. In this study, we further demonstrated that naive CD8+ cytotoxic T (Tc) cells also acquire pMHC I and costimulatory CD54 and CD80 molecules by DC(OVA) stimulation, and act as Tc-APC. These Tc-APC can play both negative and positive modulations in antitumor immune responses by eliminating DC(OVA) and neighboring Tc-APC, and stimulating OVA-specific CD8+ central memory T responses and antitumor immunity. Interestingly, the stimulatory effect of Tc-APC is mediated via its IL-2 secretion and acquired CD80 costimulation, and is specifically targeted to OVA-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo via its acquired pMHC I complexes. These principles could be applied to not only antitumor immunity, but also other immune disorders (e.g., autoimmunity).
