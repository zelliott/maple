Eight novel toxoflavin glycosides, which are potential prodrugs in antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT), were synthesized. The structures of all toxoflavin glycosides were characterized by (13)C NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and MS. Their enzymatic hydrolysis activities were tested against beta-glucosidase (EC.3.2.1.21).
