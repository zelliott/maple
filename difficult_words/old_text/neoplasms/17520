It appears that metronidazole causes an increase in tumor core temperature above that achieved with RFHT alone, by an as yet undetermined mechanism. Furthermore, radiofrequency hyperthermia, in combination with chemotherapy, can produce objective evidence of tumor repression in 30 to 50 per cent of the patients with metastatic cancer. These results justify proceeding to a randomized prospective trial of RFHT and chemotherapy in specific human neoplasms. Such a study is currently being undertaken at this center.
