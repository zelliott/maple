The objective of this investigation was aimed to explore the cancer targeting potential of folate conjugated dendrimer (polypropylene imine, PPI) under strategic influence of folate receptor up-regulators (all trans Retinoic acid, ATRA and Dexamethasone, DEXA). The folate conjugated dendrimer nanoconjugate (FPPI) was synthesized and characterized by FTIR, and (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. The cell line studies investigations were performed on MCF-7 cells. ATRA and DEXA caused 2.17 and 1.65 folds selective up-regulation of folate receptor respectively, when compared with untreated control, after 48 h of pretreatment. ATRA caused 50.47±2.11% more up regulation of folate receptor, than DEXA treated cell. Both up regulators showed a lag phase of 12 h in up-regulating the folate receptors. After 48 h, the IC50 values of naked docetaxel (DTX) and DTX loaded dendrimer (PPI-DTX) were found to be 678.93±11.99 nM and 663.51±15.23 nM, respectively, while DTX loaded folate-anchored dendrimer (FPPI-DTX) showed a selectively lowered IC50 value of 468.56±20.86 nM. FPPI-DTX further showed a significant reduction in IC50 value in ATRA and DEXA pretreated cells, wherein IC50 values of 184.21 nM and 290.40±14.05 nM, respectively were observed. The study also concludes ATRA to be a superior receptor up-regulator as well as promoter of folate based targeting compared to DEXA.
