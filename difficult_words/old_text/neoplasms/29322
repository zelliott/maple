The Mental Health Assessment and Dynamic Referral for Oncology (MHADRO) is a program that conducts a computerized assessment of physical, psychological, and social functioning related to oncology treatment, prints personalized summary reports for both the patient and the provider, and for those who provide consent, faxes a referral and assessment summary report to a matched mental health treatment provider (i.e., dynamic referral). The functionality, feasibility, and end user satisfaction of the MHADRO were tested in a comprehensive care center. Of the 101 participants enrolled, 61 (60%) exhibited elevated distress on at least one of the mental health indices, and, of these, 12 (20%) chose a dynamic referral for mental health services. Patients and health care providers exhibited high levels of satisfaction with the program. The MHADRO has potential for assisting in meeting the psychosocial needs faced by individuals with cancer and should be tested further for its facilitation of mental health treatment initiation.
