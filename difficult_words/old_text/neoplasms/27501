The authors examined the relationship and the population attributable fraction (PAF) between smoking habit and death from all causes, including cancer and lung cancer.

The baseline data were collected in the National Cardiovascular Survey in 1980 carried out for all household members aged 30 years or older in 300 districts, which were randomly selected throughout Japan. The number of participants in the survey was 10,546. The vital status was ascertained in 1999, and he calculated the adjusted relative risk of mortality and the PAF of mortality attributable to stopping smoking.

A total of 9,629 subjects were available for the final analyses. There were 165,190 person-years of follow-up, and 2,011 deaths from all causes, including 579 deaths from cancer and 106 deaths from lung cancer. After adjustment for age and other cancer risk factors, smoking habit was associated with mortality from all causes, cancer and lung cancer. These associations had positive trends. The PAF (%) from all causes was 9.0 (male), 1.6 (female). The PAF (%) from cancer was 29.5 (male), 2.7 (female) and that from lung cancer was 42.9 (male), 7.1 (female).
