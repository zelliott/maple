Tumor microenvironment substantially influences the process of tumorigenesis. In many solid tumors, imbalance between the demand of rapidly proliferating cancer cells and the capabilities of the vascular system generates areas with insufficient oxygen supply. In response to tumor hypoxia, cancer cells modulate their gene expression pattern to match the requirements of the altered microenvironment. One of the most significant adaptations to this milieu is the shift towards anaerobic glycolysis to keep up the energy demands. This oncogenic metabolism is often maintained also in aerobic cells. Lactic acid, its metabolic end-product, accumulates hand-in-hand with carbon dioxide, leading to acidification of the extracellular environment. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is the most widely expressed gene in response to hypoxia. Its crucial role in intracellular pH maintenance represents the means by which cancer cells adapt to the toxic conditions of the extracellular milieu. Furthermore, the activity of CA IX stimulates the migratory pathways of cancer cells and is connected with the increase of the aggressive/invasive phenotype of tumors. CA IX expression in many types of tumors indicates its relevance as a general marker of tumor hypoxia. Moreover, its expression is closely related to prognosis of the clinical outcome in several tumor types. All above mentioned facts support the strong position of CA IX as a potential drug therapy target. Here, we summarize the state-of-the-art knowledge on its regulation and role in cancer development.
