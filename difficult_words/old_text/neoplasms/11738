To study the toxicity and efficacy of simultaneous cisplatin chemotherapy and radiation therapy, 13 patients with metastatic solid tumors were treated with cisplatin on a weekly, outpatient basis during palliative radiation therapy. The dose of cisplatin ranged from 20 to 50 mg/m2 weekly, with most patients receiving 40 mg/m2. Radiation therapy was administered in a variety of dose-fraction schedules. Toxic effects were moderate and consisted of emesis (12 patients), transient elevation off BUN (three patients), myelosuppression (three patients), and radiation reactions (two patients). Twelve of 13 irradiated lesions (91%) responded with at least a 50% reduction in biperpendicular diameter. Four of the six patients with metastatic melanoma had complete regression of treated lesions; another melanoma patient had a partial response. Responses were also seen in patients with mesothelioma, bladder cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and oat cell lung cancer. Only one responding patient has had disease progression in the treated field after 2+ to 7+ months of followup; two other patients have died of disseminated disease. Weekly cisplatin administration during radiotherapy deserves further evaluation, especially in the primary management of unresectable tumors that are responsive to cisplatin alone.
