Many experimental data concerning radioprotection and radiosensitization by drugs may become useful guidelines for the treatment of generalized malignancies by TBI/HBI. Moreover, automyelotransfusion as a powerful radioprotective measure, together with a selective individual lead shielding system of sensitive tissues and organs can lead to the realization of a physical and biological modulation of the dose, as a basis for a useful therapeutic ratio between disseminated tumors and healthy tissues.
