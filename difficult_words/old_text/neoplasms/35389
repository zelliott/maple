As part of a quality improvement exercise at the Perth Radiation Oncology Centre, a survey was undertaken to ascertain the current level of patient satisfaction with the information they were receiving from their treating radiation oncologist. In addition, the effect of radiation on patients' anxiety levels was investigated. Two questionnaires were given to patients having radical radiotherapy for malignancy. The first questionnaire consisted of the Information Satisfaction Questionnaire and the State Trait Anxiety Index. It was given to patients before the commencement of their course of radiotherapy. The second questionnaire consisted of the State Trait Anxiety Index and was given at the completion of their radiotherapy. A total of 120 patients completed both the questionnaires. The majority of patients were satisfied/very satisfied with the explanation of their illness and radiation toxicities. Fewer patients were satisfied with the explanation of lifestyle (e.g. diet, exercise, smoking) and practical issues such as parking and treatment costs. The patients showed a statistically significant reduction in both their State and Trait Anxiety scores following radiotherapy. Following this study, we have developed new information booklets addressing lifestyle and practical issues, which were not being adequately addressed as shown in this study. Our next study will assess the effect of these new information booklets.
