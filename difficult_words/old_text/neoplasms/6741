Advances made can be divided into five main categories. Firstly, the problem of geographic miss which has been reduced by delivering effective radiation doses with greater precision. This has been accomplished with more sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic equipment, immobilization techniques and computerized treatment planning. Second is the recognition of the interplay of radiation and chemotherapy on normal tissue tolerance and local tumor control. This interaction has necessitated reduction in both dose and volume of irradiation. Third is the use of wide field irradiation as a systemic treatment. Fourthly, the utilization of cooperative group trials to define the role of irradiation. Finally, with the improvement in survival has come the recognition of late effects of irradiation in the growing child and the means of reducing such effects. The current role of radiation therapy in childhood malignancies is summarized, controversies are identified, and future prospects explored.
