In preparation for the design of phase II studies in lung cancer, low-dose carboplatin, fixed at a target area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 4.0 or 4.5 mg x min/mL, has been combined with escalating doses of paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) in a series of studies to establish the maximum tolerated dose of the combination. In patients who had received prior chemotherapy, the maximum tolerated paclitaxel dose was 135 mg/m2 (carboplatin target AUC 4.0); the dose-limiting toxicity was febrile neutropenia. Without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in chemotherapy-naive patients (carboplatin target AUC 4.5), and with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in chemotherapy-pretreated patients, the current paclitaxel dose is 290 mg/m2. The maximum tolerated dose has not been defined. In a study in which paclitaxel was given by 1-hour infusion with carboplatin (target AUC 4.5), a 205 mg/m2 dose was poorly tolerated. No evidence of pharmacokinetic interactions between paclitaxel and carboplatin was found. Twenty-one evaluable patients with lung cancer have been treated to date. There have been two partial responses, one minor response, and 10 patients with stable disease at paclitaxel doses of 100 to 270 mg/m2.
