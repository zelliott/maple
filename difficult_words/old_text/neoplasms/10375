The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway plays a key role in different physiological processes such as development, cellular proliferation, extracellular matrix synthesis, angiogenesis or immune responses and its deregulation may result in tumor development. The TGF-beta coreceptors endoglin and betaglycan are emerging as modulators of the TGF-beta response with important roles in cancer. Endoglin is highly expressed in the tumor-associated vascular endothelium with prognostic significance in selected neoplasias and with potential to be a prime vascular target for antiangiogenic cancer therapy. On the other hand, the expression of endoglin and betaglycan in tumor cells themselves appears to play an important role in the progression of cancer, influencing cell proliferation, motility, invasiveness and tumorigenicity. In addition, experiments in vitro and in vivo in which endoglin or betaglycan expression is modulated have provided evidence that they act as tumor suppressors. The purpose of this review was to highlight the potential of membrane and soluble forms of the endoglin and betaglycan proteins as molecular targets in cancer diagnosis and therapy.
