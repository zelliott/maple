The aim was to explore what expectations patients have concerning the recovery period after completed curative cancer treatment and the degree to which these expectations were realized slightly more than 1 year later. A purposeful sample of 16 patients was selected from a larger study and those patients were interviewed 16 months after treatment completion. The interviews were analysed using the phenomenographic method. Patients' expectation for their recovery period was generally to become well, but they often lacked plans for how to recover. If the recovery period was perceived as 'smooth' expectations were always met. However, if the period was perceived as 'tough' expectations were often unfulfilled, but most of these patients were satisfied with their current life anyway owing to positive changes and it was only a small proportion of the patients that still felt unwell. Even though most of the patients had managed to adjust well to the situation slightly more than 1 year after completed treatment, several patients had not been aware of how tough recovery could be and requested further support from the healthcare system.
