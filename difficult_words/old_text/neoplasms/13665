Patients receiving high-dose preparation for stem cell transplantation are at risk for organ dysfunction (OD). Signs of early OD include hypoxia, mental status changes, and liver dysfunction. These early signs have not been correlated with potential cytokine mediators. We compared plasma concentrations of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 in OD patients and controls. Cytokines were measured before preparation, 5 days before OD, day of OD, and 5 days after OD. TNF-alpha and IL-10 were not measurable prior to preparation. IL-10 was more likely to be measurable in OD patients than in controls 5 days prior to onset of OD (P = 0.039), on the day of OD (P = 0.023), and 5 days later (P &lt; 0.0001). TNF-alpha was more likely to be measurable only on the day of OD (P = 0.0035). IL-6 was significantly elevated in OD patients at all time points. Patients who had measurable IL-6 on admission were 5.1 times more likely to develop OD (95% CI = 1.4-17.9; P = 0.011). Five days prior to OD for each 100 pg/ml increase in IL-6, patients were 2.75 times more likely to develop OD (95% CI = 1.3-5.8; P = 0.0087). The early elevation of IL-6 in patients who develop OD may help identify a high risk group where preventive therapies can be evaluated.
