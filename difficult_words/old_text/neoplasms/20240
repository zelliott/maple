We analyzed the effects of radiotherapy on 226 sites of metastatic bone tumors from 1981 to 1984, and on 157 sites of bone metastases of prostate cancer from 1970 to 1988. The radiation effect on pain relief was recognized in about 90% of cases within the dose of 20Gy to 30Gy, and there were not many differences in these effects according to the original tumors or histological types. In prostate cancer, the sites which needed re-irradiation were not recognized within 6 months after irradiation, and only 12 out of 80 sites (15%) that could be observed after more than 6 months needed re-irradiation due to recurring pain. As more than 60% of the patients with prostate cancer who needed irradiation to control bone metastases died within a year, to get pain relief by irradiation immediately and safely was thought to be very useful from the viewpoint of useful life. One patient was irradiated on 16 sites and 2 of these 16 sites received 4 treatments of irradiation and the shortest interval was 10 months and the longest one was 18 months.
