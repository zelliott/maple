Photodynamic therapy (PDT) in cancer treatment uses photosensitizers to generate singlet oxygen followed by photoirradiation. The efficacy of PDT is greatly determined by the dosimetry of activation light and the photosensitizer (PS), modulating the photodynamic reaction at depth in diseased tissue. Development of nano-formulated photosensitizer has emerged as a promising field because of the biocompatibility and the accessibility for multi-functionalization of nanoparticles. In this review, we summarize the contemporary progress in use of inorganic nanoparticles for improvement of PDT in cancer therapeutics.
