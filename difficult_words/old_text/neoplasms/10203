To cross-link the McAb 1A2E1 to BNHS reagents and apply this biotinylated McAb to detect AIB1 antigen of target cells.

The McAb 1A2E1 was mixed with BNHS reagents to generate Biotin-1A2E1. The competitive inhibition ELISA and immunocytochemical method were applied to detect the biologic activity of antibody.

The antibody kept high biological activities (with a titer of 1 : 3200) and sensitivities in detecting the AIB1 protein of breast cancer cell.

The method of preparing biotinylated McAb is successful, and the prepared biotinylated McAb can be applied to detect target cells which express AIB1 antigen. This McAb provide useful tool for tumor auxiliary diagnosis.
