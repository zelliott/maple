In this third article in the series, the management of patients with symptoms arising as a consequence of metastatic disease involving peripheral nerves, the spinal cord and the brain are discussed. In particular, pain, spinal cord compression and symptoms due to either raised intracranial pressure or specific neurological deficits may substantially impair the quality of life in patients with advanced cancer. Pain control, using both medical and surgical treatments, are discussed. The principles underlying the diagnosis and treatment of metastases to the vertebral column and spinal cord, as well as intracranial deposits, are outlined.
