Improvements in cancer therapy have resulted in an expanding population of early-onset cancer survivors. In contrast to childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, there is still a lack of data concerning late morbidities among young adult (YA) cancer survivors. Thus, our aim was to investigate cardiac and vascular morbidity among early-onset cancer survivors with a special interest in YA cancer survivors. In a population-based setting, we explored the risk of cardiovascular disease in early-onset cancer survivors compared to healthy siblings. Patients diagnosed with cancer below 35 years of age since 1975 were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry, and 5-year survivors were included in our study (N = 13,860). Information on cardiovascular morbidity was collected from the national hospital discharge registry. Compared to siblings, cancer survivors aged 0-19 and 20-34 at diagnosis had significantly elevated hazard ratios (HRs) for the studied outcomes: HR 13.5 (95% CI 8.9-20.4) and 3.6 (95% CI 2.8-4.6) for cardiomyopathy/cardiac insufficiency; HR 3.4 (95% CI 2.3-5.1) and 1.7 (95% CI 1.4-2.0) for atherosclerosis/brain vascular thrombosis; HR 3.3 (95% CI 1.7-6.5) and 1.8 (95% CI 1.5-2.1) for myocardial infarction/cardiac ischemia and HR 1.7 (95% CI 1.2-2.6) and 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.7) for cardiac arrhythmia. In both groups, depending on the outcome, the HR for adverse events was highest among lymphoma, brain tumor, leukemia and testicular malignancy survivors. Our results regarding late effects of childhood cancer survivors confirmed previous findings. Additionally, our study provides novel information concerning the YA cancer survivor population. Hence, our data may help in planning the risk-based long-term follow-up of early-onset cancer survivors.
