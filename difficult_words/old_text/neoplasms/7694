Ambulatory cancer care rather than prolonged hospital care is becoming increasingly more common. The total care of patients requires both psychological and medical support to meet the varied problems of cancer. A coordinated home care program is presented utilizing a team of health care professionals who, using video instructions, teach family, friends and patients ways to improve their health through nutrition, exercise and body care. Psychological aspects of cancer are reviewed, and suggestions on how to improve coping skills are presented. Through planning, understanding, a caring medical team and a supportive family, successful ambulatory care can be provided to the cancer patient thereby helping him/her to live with cancer.
