This review will provide physicians and oncologists with an overview of side effects related to targeted agents that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in the treatment of solid tumors. Such targeted agents can be divided into monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors and serine/threonine kinase inhibitors. Molecular targeted therapies are generally well tolerated, but inhibitory effects on the biological function of the targets in healthy tissue can result in specific treatment-related side effects, particularly with multitargeted agents. We offer some guidance on how to manage adverse events in cancer patients based on the range of options currently available.
