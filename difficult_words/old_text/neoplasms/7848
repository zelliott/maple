A hypothesis is presented relating the origin of somatic mutation in neoplasia to intrinsic rates of mitotic error. This implies that the environmental agents which are significant in clinical neoplasia are promoters and mitogenic. The tumorigenic mutations may involve genes which are important in cellular differentiation and senescence of dividing cells.
