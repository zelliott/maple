Hypercalcemia is a common cause of morbidity in cancer patients. The mechanism of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia includes increased bone resorption and decreased renal calcium clearance which also occur in primary hyperparathyroidism. Norethisterone can inhibit bone resorption and has recently been shown to be effective treatment for mild hyperparathyroidism in post menopausal women. We report the successful use for the first time of norethisterone (5 mg daily) in a case of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia after other standard agents failed.
