Surgical interventions during or immediately following cytostatic therapy carry an increased risk of complications such as healing disturbances, septic complications or organ insufficiencies. These complications can also be expected if chemotherapy follows the surgical treatment. As the possible complications depend on the class of substances used as well as the time of application these risks can be taken into consideration in multimodal treatment plans. In cases of emergency surgical interventions during chemotherapy or because of tumor based complications there is of course minimal influence to be exerted on the complication rate except through very diligent anastomosis sutures and wound closure.
