We have previously reported on the isolation and chromosomal mapping of a novel human gene (SEL1L), which shows sequence similarity to sel-1, an extragenic suppressor of C. elegans. sel-1 functions as a negative regulator of lin-12 activity, the latter being implicated in the control of diverse cellular differentiation events. In the present study we compare the expression patterns of SEL1L and TAN-1, the human ortholog of lin-12 in normal and neoplastic cells. We found that, whereas both genes are expressed in fetal tissues at similar levels, they are differentially expressed in normal adult and neoplastic cells. In normal adult cells SEL1L is generally present at very low levels; only in the cells of the pancreas does it show maximum expression. By contrast, SEL1L is generally well represented in most neoplastic cells but not in those of pancreatic and gastric carcinomas, where transcription is either downregulated or completely repressed. TAN-1 on the other hand is well represented in almost all normal and neoplastic cells, with very few exceptions. Our observations suggest that SEL1L is presumably implicated in pancreatic and gastric carcinogenesis and that, along with TAN-1, it is very important for normal cell function. Alterations in the expression of SEL1L may be used as a prognostic marker for gastric and pancreatic cancers.
