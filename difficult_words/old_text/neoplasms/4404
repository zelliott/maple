Architecture, like health care, is a service profession. It serves not only a functional purpose by providing designs for shelter, but also incorporates social purpose. It allows people to conduct business, congregate for amusement, express their faith, and educate themselves. It is also a collaborative art, creating an environment that influences its users by their interactions with it and how they use it.
