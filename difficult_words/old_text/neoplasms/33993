It is estimated that in excess of one million positron emission tomography (PET) scans are performed each year and PET can now truly be regarded as a routine imaging procedure in clinical management. Many potential pitfalls and artifacts have previously been described with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging, but more continue to become apparent as worldwide experience increases. In addition, the advent of combined PET/CT scanners in clinical imaging practice has brought their own specific pitfalls and artifacts. It is essential that we learn these potential pitfalls so that patients can be optimally prepared for their scans and that accurate interpretation can be made.
