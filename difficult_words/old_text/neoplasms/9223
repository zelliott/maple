Immune escape is the final phase of cancer immunoediting process wherein cancer modulates our immune system to escape from being destroyed by it. Many cellular and molecular events govern the cancer's evasion of host immune response. The tumor undergoes continuous remodeling at the genetic, epigenetic and metabolic level to acquire resistance to apoptosis. At the same time, it effectively modifies all the components of the host's immunome so as to escape from its antitumor effects. Moreover, it induces accumulation of suppressive cells like Treg and myeloid derived suppressor cells and factors which also enable it to elude the immune system. Recent research in this area helps in defining the role of newer players like miRNAs and exosomes in immune escape. The immunotherapeutic approaches developed to target the escape phase appear quite promising; however, the quest for a perfect therapeutic agent that can achieve maximum cure with minimal toxicity continues.
