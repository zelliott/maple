The identification and characterization of many tumor antigens and the parallel explosion of knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of antigen recognition by the immune system have given renewed hopes that immunogenetherapy could be a promising modality to treat certain tumors. Many different novel strategies have been developed to derive genetically modified tumor cells and use them as cellular vaccines to induce useful antitumor immunity in a variety of animal tumor models. This review discusses induction of tumor immunity by injecting tumor cells that are genetically engineered to secrete various cytokines and to express major histocompatibility complex molecules and/or costimulatory molecules. While there has been a great success in inducing excellent antitumor immunity in a variety of tumor models, there are some difficulties and limitations in the application of these gene-modified tumor cells for the treatment of preexisting tumors. A number of improvements and modifications are already underway to overcome some of these problems.
