The use of the immune system for the treatment of cancer is still debated. Recent advances in antigen presentation and recognition mechanisms, and the characterization of tumor-specific antigens generating a T cell response are crucial steps for the stimulation of research in this direction. These advances should allow the development of selective immunotherapy, either passive (infusion of lymphocytes with specific recognition of autologous tumor) or active (vaccination), and the evaluation of this new approach in cancer treatment strategies.
