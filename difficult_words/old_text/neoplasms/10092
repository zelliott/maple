Paradigm shifting advances in cancer can occur after discovering the key oncogenic drivers of the malignant process, understanding their detailed molecular mechanisms, and exploiting this transdisciplinary knowledge therapeutically. A variety of human malignancies have anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations, amplifications, or oncogenic mutations, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, non-small cell lung cancer, and neuroblastoma. This finding has focused intense interest in inhibiting ALK signaling as an effective molecular therapy against diseases with ALK-driven pathways. Recent progress in the elucidation of the major canonical signaling pathways postulated to be activated by NPM-ALK signaling has provided insight into which pathways may present a rational therapeutic approach. The identification of the downstream effector pathways controlled by ALK should pave the way for the rational design of ALK-inhibition therapies for the treatment of a subset of human cancers that harbor ALK aberrations.
