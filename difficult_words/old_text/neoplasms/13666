Human recombinant interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), administered by intravenous drop infusion, at doses of 10-20 ng/kg daily over 5 days, to a group of 67 patients suffering from malignant tumors and with grade II-IV toxic leukopenia, caused an increase in the leukocyte count to the normal value, within, on average, 8 +/- 1 days. The leukostimulatory effect of IL-1beta, administered subcutaneously at an average dose of 4.6 +/- 0.3 ng/kg (n = 16), appeared to be almost equal to that found for intravenous drop infusion at a dose of 10-20 ng/kg (n = 67). In patients receiving subcutaneous IL-1beta injections, the peripheral blood total leukocyte and granulocyte counts achieved normal values within 9 days. The side effects of IL-1beta at a dose of 0.1-20.0 ng/kg were well tolerated.
