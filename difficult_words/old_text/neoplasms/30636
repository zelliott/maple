Stomatitis occurs in approximately 40% of the patients receiving systemic administration of chemotherapy and cancer treatments such as radiation to the head and neck. The presence of stomatitis affects the course of treatment and a patient's quality of life. An oncology nursing unit developed a quality assessment and improvement indicator addressing stomatitis. Oral cavity screening, dental consultations, oral care techniques, and patient teaching were included in the nursing interventions, which resulted in a marked reduction of new cases of stomatitis.
