To explain the concept of cancer chemoprevention, describe chemoprevention trials, and discuss the agents currently under study to lower the incidence of oral premalignancy and head and neck, lung, breast, prostate, and colon cancers.

Published journal articles, books, bulletins, monographs, protocols, and professional experience.

Chemoprevention is a promising approach to cancer control, and several key agents have been identified that may be able to block carcinogenesis. Phase III chemoprevention trials are being conducted to identify the role of agents (e.g., retinoids, tamoxifen, finasteride, aspirin) in cancer prevention.

Knowledge of the genetic and hormonal changes that occur during carcinogenesis continues to increase. Agents are being identified that block the development of cancer by arresting carcinogenesis. As more agents are identified and investigated, their importance in chemoprevention is increasing.

The goal of nursing care for participants in prevention trials is to promote compliance with the study protocol while supporting optimum quality of life. Through proactive education of participants, family members, and the public and skillful management of side effects, nurses can play an integral part in the success of prevention trials.
