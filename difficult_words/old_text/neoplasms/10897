As a viral gene delivery vector, the recombinant JC virus-like particles (VLPs) can be easily generated in large quantities and at low cost. Exogenous genes of interest can be packaged by the VLP without the involvement of viral genetic material and then delivered into any tissue susceptible to JC virus (JCV) to allow gene transduction. Therefore, it should be possible in the future to develop a gene delivery vector using the human JC VLPs that will allow gene therapy.

Development of a gene delivery vector using the polyomavirus VLPs is reviewed in this article. The advantages and disadvantages of using JC VLP for gene delivery are discussed.

Human JC VLPs are readily produced and can be engineered with ease; they allow specific targeting without the presence of any viral genetic material. For therapeutic purposes, gene(s) of interest or other compounds can be packaged into the VLP and delivered to JCV-susceptible cells at high efficiency.
