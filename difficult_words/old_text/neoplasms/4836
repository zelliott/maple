The Sudan, the largest and most diverse country in Africa, is experiencing a growing cancer problem, but little is presently known on tumor patterns, cancer epidemiology and ethnic or environmental cancer risk factors. We review here the current status of knowledge, summarizing data from local and international publications as well as primary information from the only two cancer hospitals of the country, both located in Central Sudan (Khartoum and Wad Medani). We provide frequencies reported for cancers detected in adults and children, and summarize studies on specific cancer types, as well as information on risk factors that most likely impact on tumor patterns.
