This study aims at investigating how scientific production in Oncology Nursing has approached fatigue, associating such production with the defining characteristics set forth by NANDA; and identifying those Nursing interventions performed for its prevention and/or treatment in those publications, correlating them with those interventions mentioned by NIC. It is a reflection on the theme of "fatigue" in the area of Oncology Nursing, which used the narrative bibliographical review as its method. The LILACS and MEDLINE bases were used for data access. Similarities were found between the defining characteristics for the NANDA diagnosis of "fatigue" and the description of fatigue found in the researched articles. In light of the NANDA Diagnosis Taxonomy's lack of validation in oncology care environments, there is a need for studies that articulate the validated characteristics with the evidenced ones. Intervention strategies in the case of fatigue may be educational and pharmacological or not. There is, however, a need for research in order to develop an evidence-based clinical practice.
