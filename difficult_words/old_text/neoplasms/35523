Potassium channels (KCh) are the most diverse and ubiquitous class of ion channels. KCh control membrane potential and contribute to nerve and cardiac action potentials and neurotransmitter release. KCh are also involved in insulin release, differentiation, activation, proliferation, apoptosis, and several other physiological functions. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of the KCh role during the cell growth. Their potential use as pharmacological targets in cancer therapies is also discussed.

We searched PubMed (up to 2005) and identified relevant articles. Reprints were mainly obtained by on line subscription. Additional sources were identified through cross-referencing and obtained from Library services.

KCh are responsible for some neurological and cardiovascular diseases and for a new medical discipline, channelopathies. Their role in congenital deafness, multiple sclerosis, episodic ataxia, LQT syndrome and diabetes has been proven. Furthermore, a large body of information suggests that KCh play a role in the cell cycle progression, and it is now accepted that cells require KCh to proliferate. Thus, KCh expression has been studied in a number of tumours and cancer cells.

Cancer is far from being considered a channelopathy. However, it seems appropriate to take into account the involvement of KCh in cancer progression and pathology when developing new strategies for cancer therapy.
