Post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by double-stranded RNA represents an evolutionarily conserved cellular mechanism. Small dsRNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), are part of the main regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in cells. The possibilities of harnessing this intrinsic natural mechanism of gene silencing for therapeutic applications was opened up by the discovery by Tom Tuschl's team a few years ago that chemically synthesized small 21-mers of double-stranded RNA (small interfering RNA, siRNA) could inhibit gene expression without induction of cellular antiviral-like responses, siRNAs are especially of interest for cancer therapeutics because they allow specific inhibition of mutated oncogenes and other genes that aid and abet the growth of cancer cells. However, recent insights make it clear that siRNA faces some major hurdles before it can be used as a drug. Some of these problems are similar to those associated with classic antisense approaches, such as lack of delivery to specific tissues (other than the liver) or tumors, while other problems are more specific for siRNA, such as stability of the RNA molecules in circulation, off-target effects, interference with the endogenous miRNA machinery, and immune responses toward dsRNA. Chemical modifications of siRNA may help prevent these unwanted side effects. Initial studies show that minimal modifications with locked nucleic acids (LNA) help to reduce most of the unwanted side effects. In this chapter we will explore the limitations and possibilities of LNA-modified siRNA that may be used in future therapeutic applications.
