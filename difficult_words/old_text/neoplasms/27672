Ninety-eight patients (48 male, 50 female; age median, 56 years; range, 25-85 years) with solid tumors (21 breast cancers, 6 sarcomas, 2 colorectal cancers, 1 pancreatic carcinoma, 1 hypernephroma, and 1 lung cancer) and hematologic neoplasms (24 multiple myelomas, 32 lymphomas, and 10 myeloproliferative syndromes) were recruited into the study. The patients received at least three cycles of chemotherapy with alkylating substances, anthracyclines, antimetabolites, and vinca alkaloids, with or without corticosteroids. A total of 325 cycles of chemotherapy were administered. The symptoms were evaluated by means of a score system on the basis of which heartburn, sensation of repletion, nausea, and cramps were assessed by incidence and degree of severity. Before initiation of concomitant therapy with sucralfate, 47 patients (48%) had symptoms during chemotherapy (heartburn, sensation of repletion, nausea, cramps). After initiation of therapy with sucralfate these symptoms improved in 42 patients (89%); in 6 patients there was a transitory increase in heartburn and nausea. All other patients remained without symptoms in spite of chemotherapy. The evaluation of the patient population as a whole showed a significant decrease of chemotherapy-induced heartburn (p less than 0.01) and nausea (p less than 0.01) during sucralfate therapy. This was tolerated extremely well; side effects were not observed. To summarize, this prospective clinical study shows that sucralfate is an effective and suitable therapeutic principle in long-term therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal complaints.
