Previous studies have observed high prevalences of high blood pressure (HBP), high blood cholesterol (HBC), obesity, and sedentary lifestyle among Spanish diabetic adults. These cardiovascular risk factors and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors occur more often in subjects with diabetes than in the general population. The aim of this study was to examine the trends in cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle behaviors among Spanish adults with diabetes over the decade 1993-2003.

We used individualized data drawn from the 1993 (N=20,880) and 2003 (N=21,650) Spanish National Health Surveys. Subjects were classified as diabetes sufferers if they answered affirmatively to either or both of the following questions: "Has your doctor told you that you are currently suffering from diabetes?" and/or, "Have you taken any medication to treat diabetes in the last two weeks?" Cardiovascular risk factors analyzed included self-reported HBP and HBC. Lifestyle behaviors included obesity (body mass index&>or=30), smoking status, and physical activity. We estimated and compared the prevalences and analyzed the time trends using logistic regression models.

In both years studied, the prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyle was significantly higher among persons with than among those without diabetes, and current smoking was less frequent. The proportions of diabetes patients with HBP and obesity increased significantly from 39.5% and 20.1% in 1993 to 46.7% and 29.8% in 2003, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.32 (95% CI 1.07-1.62) for HBP and 1.88 (95% CI 1.44-2.46) for obesity.

The overall prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors among diabetes patients has shown no improvement in the decade 1993-2003, and there have been significant setbacks, in particular the rise in obesity and HBP.
