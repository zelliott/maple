To review literature evaluating whether television (TV) viewing reduction is a promising behavioral target for obesity treatment programs for adults.

Studies examining associations between TV viewing and obesity in adults were reviewed, as well as relevant pediatric literature. Interventions to reduce TV viewing among children were examined to inform adult interventions.

Adult TV viewing has been consistently associated with greater obesity risk in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Strategies to alter TV viewing have been demonstrated effective among children but have not been tested in adults.

Evaluation of the efficacy of targeting TV viewing among adults on weight outcomes is warranted.
