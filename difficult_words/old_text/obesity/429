The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between liver transaminase levels and metabolic syndrome (MS) features in obese children and adolescents. A total of 132 children and adolescents (73 males and 59 females) aged 8 - 16, participated in the study. All were studied at the department of Paediatrics, University Hospital of Zaragoza (Spain). Inclusion criteria were the existence of obesity as defined by body mass index (BMI) according to Cole cut-off values (when BMI was higher than the age and sex specific equivalent to 30 kg/m2). The definition of metabolic syndrome was according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Weight (kg), height (cm), waist circumference (cm), blood pressure and BMI were measured. Laboratory determinations after overnight fasting included: transaminases (ALT, AST, GGT), fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides and HDL-C. The MS was found in 21.6% of the obese children and adolescents and the prevalence was higher in males (25.9%) than in females (15.9%). Serum transaminases (ALT, AST and GGT) mean concentrations were higher in males than in females, and decreased during pubertal development. The obese children and adolescents with the MS did not show higher transaminases concentrations when compared with those without the MS. Some MS manifestations (mainly waist circumference) showed a correlation with ALT, although all transaminases values were normal according to adult references. Liver transaminases, a surrogate marker of NAFLD, did not show an early and consistent manifestation of abnormalities in the obese children and adolescents studied. In order to define the presence of the disease, it would be necessary to obtain aminotransferase reference standards for children and adolescents, considering pubertal stage and gender.
