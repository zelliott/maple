This study was designed to investigate the point prevalence and pattern of obesity in the Jamaican adult population.

A two-stage-stratified random sampling design was used, and individuals aged 15 years and over were interviewed. In addition, anthropometric measurements were performed. The data were analysed using the SPSS statistical software version 8. Non-response was documented and factored into the final analysis of the survey data.

A total of 2105 individuals responded to the all island survey, with 69% being females. Truncal obesity and gynoid obesity showed similar prevalence data. Both were affected by increasing age, being female, level of education attained and smoking status.

Jamaica has a point prevalence of obesity, truncal 36.2% and gynoid 34.1%, in the 15 and over age group.
