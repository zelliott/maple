Resistin, the peptide specifically secreted from adipocytes, is a hormone antagonistic to insulin action and, thus, may serve as a link between human obesity due to adiposity and insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes. To test this hypothesis, we studied the gene expression of resistin in adipocytes isolated from rats fed with a fructose diet which induced insulin resistance. Compared to the control rats (C) on a normal chow diet, the fructose-fed rats (F) developed hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia and hypertension, a profile reminiscent of the syndrome X of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The F rats had significantly elevated plasma free fatty acids (FFA), enlarged epididymal fat pads, and increased adipocyte size compared with the C rats. We examined the glucose transport and the relative quantity of resistin mRNA produced in the adipocytes of these two groups of rats. Compared to the C rats, the F rats had a clearly reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport. The gene expression of resistin and other adipocyte peptides was measured on the mRNA by semiquantitative RT-PCR; the validity of this technique was established in advance with a rat-fasting and then refeeding experiment. The F rats showed a decreased expression of the resistin gene, whereas gene expression of leptin and angiotensinogen in contrast increased. Free fatty acids were found to suppress the expression of resistin gene in normal rat adipocytes. These results demonstrate that an insulin-resistant instance in the fructose diet rat model exists with the decreased gene expression of resistin.
