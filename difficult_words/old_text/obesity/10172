Strokes are one of the most common causes of mortality and long term severe disability. Risk factors for stroke include: age, gender, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and many others.

To evaluate obesity and hypertension in patients affected by acute ischemic stroke.

We compared the anthropometric variables between type II diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients. We evaluated a total of 60 patients, divided into two groups: 34 non-diabetic patients and a group of 26 type II diabetic subjects.

The predominance of obesity, as well as hypertension, was very high among the studied groups, presenting no differences among the waist-hip ratio (WHR) values of the study group compared to the ones of the control group.

The predominance of obesity was very high among the studied groups and there was prevalence the android type obesity. There was no significative difference in the anthropometric evaluation by the measurement of WHR and the waist in the groups.
