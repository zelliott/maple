We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of obesity on influenza disease severity. Individuals with obesity were more likely to have lower pulmonary disease manifestations [OR=1·97 (95% CI 1·05, 3·69), P=0·03] and to be admitted to an inpatient ward [OR=2·93 (95% CI 1·50, 5·71), P=0·002] when compared with non-obese individuals. Among admitted individuals, persons with obesity were more likely to require a lengthy hospital stay [OR=3·86 (95% CI 1·03, 14·42), P=0·045]. Five of the six deaths in study subjects occurred in persons with obesity.
