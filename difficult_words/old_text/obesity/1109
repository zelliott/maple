To assess topiramate's efficacy and tolerability in a group of obese binge eaters with no neuropsychiatric comorbidity.

We consecutively selected 8 obese patients with binge eating disorder (BED) and no medical or psychiatric comorbidity from individuals seeking treatment for obesity. Treatment with topiramate at 150 mg daily was administered over a 16-week period. To assess outcome, we employed the days with binge episodes per week (DBE), the Binge Eating Scale (BES), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and body weight evaluation.

Of the 6 patients who completed the trial, all showed reduced binge eating. Four patients presented a total remission, and 2 had a marked reduction in binge eating frequency. The mean DBE decreased significantly from 4.3 to 1.1 (P = 0.03), as did the BES scores, which fell from 31.8 to 15.3 (P = 0.04). Moreover, there was a statistically significant weight loss (mean 4.1 kg, P = 0.04). The most frequent side effects were paresthesias, fatigue, and somnolence.

Topiramate may be an effective and well-tolerated agent in the treatment of BED in obese patients.
