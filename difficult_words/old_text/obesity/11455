Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is a gastrointestinal hormone that is released during a meal and facilitates the disposal of both glucose and fat. Because of the insulinotropic action of GIP, this hormone has been considered as a potential therapy of type 2 diabetes, where insulin secretion is inadequate. However, a recent study using GIP receptor knockout mice suggests that inhibition of GIP signalling might be a new target for anti-obesity drugs.
