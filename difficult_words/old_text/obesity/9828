The aim of this study was to assess the effect of sibutramine on mineral status and selected biochemical parameters in obese women. The study was conducted on 24 patients who received 15 mg daily doses of sibutramine for 12 weeks, and on 20 patients who received placebo. At the baseline, after the sixth and twelfth weeks of treatment, body weight and blood pressure were measured, the BMI was calculated, and samples of blood and of first morning urine were collected. Serum lipid profiles, glucose levels, and nitric oxide levels were determined. The iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) present in the serum and urine samples were assessed. The erythrocyte hemolysate of the patients was use to assay the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). No changes were observed in BMI, blood pressure, or nitric oxide during the study. After 12 weeks of treatment, a decrease was observed in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and ferritin levels. GSH-Px and SOD activity increased after 12 weeks of sibutramine treatment. The Mg and Cu increases was observed in serum after the sixth and twelfth weeks of treatment. It was found that the Zn level decreased in serum after the twelfth week. The elimination of Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, and Cu in urine also declined in the twelfth week. No differences were found in the women taking the placebo. In conclusion, we found that sibutramine had a positive effect on lipid and glucose status in obese women. However, the drug disturbed the balance of minerals, especially Zn and Mg, in the subjects.
