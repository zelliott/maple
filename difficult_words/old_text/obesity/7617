To examine the association between prolonged bottle use and the risk of obesity at 5.5 years of age.

Data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort were analyzed for 6750 US children born in 2001. The outcome was obesity (body mass index â‰¥ 95 th percentile) at 5.5 years, and the exposure was parental report of the child using a bottle at 24 months.

The prevalence of obesity at 5.5 years was 17.6%, and 22.3% of children were using a bottle at 24 months. The prevalence of obesity at 5.5 years was 22.9% (95% CI, 19.4% to 26.4%) in children who at 24 months were using a bottle and was 16.1% (95% CI, 14.9% to 17.3%) in children who were not. Prolonged bottle use was associated with an increased risk of obesity at 5.5 years (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.68) after controlling for potential confounding variables (sociodemographic characteristics, maternal obesity, maternal smoking, breastfeeding, age of introduction of solid foods, screen-viewing time, and the child's weight status at birth and at 9 months of age).

Prolonged bottle use was associated with obesity at 5.5 years of age. Avoiding this behavior may help prevent early childhood obesity.
