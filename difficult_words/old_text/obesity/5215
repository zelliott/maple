Two experiments were conducted to test whether the intrameal eating patterns of obese and normal-weight human subjects are different. The first experiment was conducted in a laboratory under the pretense of a taste test. Eating was observed and data were compiled for seven parameters related to eating. The second experiment was conducted under field-study conditions with the subjects unaware of their participation. Few statistically significant differences in eating behavior were observed between obese and normal-weight subjects. These results are in contrast to the majority of previous work.
