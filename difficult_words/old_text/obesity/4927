Polygenic mouse models for obesity-induced type 2 diabetes (T2D) more accurately reflect the most common manifestations of the human disease. Two inbred mouse strains (NON/Lt and NZO/HlLt) separately contributed T2D susceptibility- conferring quantitative trait loci to F1 males. Although chronic administration of rosiglitazone (Rosi) in diet (50 mg/kg) effectively suppressed F1 diabetes, hepatosteatosis was an undesired side effect. Three recombinant congenic strains (designated RCS1, -2, and -10) developed on the NON/Lt background carry variable numbers of these quantitative trait loci that elicit differential weight gain and male glucose intolerance syndromes of variable severity. We previously showed that RCS1 and -2 mice responded to chronic Rosi therapy without severe steatosis, whereas RCS10 males were moderately sensitive. In contrast, another recombinant congenic strain, RCS8, responded to Rosi therapy with the extreme hepatosteatosis observed in the F1. Longitudinal changes in multiple plasma analytes, including insulin, the adipokines leptin, resistin, and adiponectin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) allowed profiling of the differential Rosi responses in steatosis-exacerbated F1 and RCS8 males vs. the resistant RCS1 and RCS2 or moderately sensitive RCS10. Of these biomarkers, PAI-1 most effectively predicted adverse drug responses. Unexpectedly, mean resistin concentrations were higher in Rosi-treated RCS8 and RCS10. In summary, longitudinal profiling of multiple plasma analytes identified PAI-1 as a useful biomarker to monitor for differential pharmacogenetic responses to Rosi in these new mouse models of T2D.
