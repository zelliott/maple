A group of oligomenorrhoeic women without obesity or hirsuties was investigated with high-resolution ultrasound, laparoscopy and biochemical parameters. In this series, polycystic ovaries (PCO), as defined by ultrasound and laparoscopy, are a common cause of oligomenorrhoea in women without the classic symptoms, and were strongly associated with an elevated free androgen index (FAI). Despite an elevated FAI, these women were not hirsute, It would seem reasonable to include a FAI in the investigation of the oligomenorrhoeic woman, along with the more 'standard' tests, such as thyroid function and a prolactin level.
