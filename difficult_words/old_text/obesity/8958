Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most frequent cause of menstrual disorders in teenage girls. Little information is available about the effects of metformin in adolescent girls with PCOS and its dose and its efficacy in regulating menstrual cyclicity and hyperandrogenic symptoms. We evaluated the effects of metformin treatment on ovulatory function, hirsutism, acne, hormonal patterns and body weight in adolescent girls with PCOS.

Eighteen girls, ranging in age from 15 to 18 years, were enrolled in the study. Clinical diagnosis of PCOS was based on the consensus criteria for PCOS accepted in May 2003 at Rotterdam. All subjects received 1700 mg/day metformin as tablets continuously for 6 months. They were then followed up for 6 months.

Two patients complained of side effects for&>2 weeks and interrupted treatment; they were not evaluated. All the others showed an improvement in menstrual cyclicity. Menstrual periods were ovulatory, with progesterone levels up to 6 ng/ml in luteal phase and a significant reduction in testosterone, androstenedione and free testosterone. BMI was restored within normal limits in all girls between 21 and 24 kg/m(2). Six months after the end of metformin treatment, menstrual cycles continued to be regular and ovulatory with normal BMI. Side effects were slight.

The present results confirm the positive effects of metformin on menstrual periods and show that the drug can be administered to young women to improve ovulation and hyperandrogenic symptoms such as hirsutism, acne and weight gain.
