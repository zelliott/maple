A study on the treatment of obese adolescents with the use of sibutramine in private practice is presented. Patients consisted of 24 boys and 43 girls with obesity (body mass index [BMI&>85th percentile sex-specific BMI for age and sex) ranging from 12 to 18 years of age. Patients were given sibutramine 10 mg per day for 6 months. With the last observation carried forward adjustment, after 6 months of treatment, patients' average weight changed from 91.6+/-19.7 kg to 81.9+/-19.0 kg (P&<001), that is, 89.5+/-7.3% of initial weight. The most frequently reported adverse events included increased blood pressure and pulse rate (n=7), constipation (n=8), dry mouth (n=4), and constipation and dry mouth (n=3). Sibutramine may be considered effective for the treatment of obese adolescents, with a level of safety similar to that observed in adult patients.
