The effect of progressive, diabetes-associated adiposity on reproductive tract structure and function was examined in 4- to 16-week-old C57BL/KsJ, control (+/?) and diabetic (db/db) mice. Uterine and ovarian tissues were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy for ultrastructural changes associated with increased intracellular lipid accumulation. In addition, the same tissues were analyzed for changes in activity of tissue lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipoprotein-associated triacylglycerols and supports the cellular uptake and storage of free fatty acids. Between 8 and 16 weeks of age, intracellular lipid deposits increased dramatically in the ovarian granulosa, thecal and stromal cell populations, as well as in the uterine epithelium, of diabetic mice compared to controls. By 16 weeks of age, the lipid deposits essentially occupied the entire cytoplasmic area of both the ovarian and uterine cell types in diabetics. The basal lamina underlying the uterine epithelium was expanded in the diabetics relative to controls, and the hyperglycemic condition induced an observable increase in endometrial intercellular space that was occupied by a hyaline type of ground substance of unknown composition and origin. In association with these structural changes, both ovarian and uterine lipase activities were greatly increased in the db/db mice compared with controls. These data suggest that the structural adiposity and functional decline in reproductive tract condition of the db/db mutants are related to the enhanced cellular lipid deposition observed in this species. These changes in structural and metabolic parameters are related to the reproductive incompetence characteristic of this murine model.
