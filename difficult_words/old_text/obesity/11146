in postmenopausal women, the excess of fat has been associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of overweight, obesity, diabetes and hypertension in patients with endometrial cancer.

we collected demographic, clinical, laboratory and histopathological information from the electronic records of patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer in the period from January 2009 to July 2011. Subsequently descriptive analysis of the information was done.

a total of 274 records. The average age of patients was 54 years. The 50.4 % were postmenopausal. At the time of diagnosis, 112 cases (48.6 %) were in clinical stage I. Of all patients, 104 (37.9 %) had diabetes mellitus, 122 (44.5 %) hypertension, 194 (72.6 %) were overweight or obese, and 24 cases were registered with the metabolic syndrome.

in regards to this diagnosis the results show a higher incidence of overweight and obesity compared with other countries. It is necessary to conduct further studies to assess the relationship of excess fat as a risk factor for endometrial cancer.
