We investigated the link between a reduction in waist circumference and metabolic syndrome.

105 obese Japanese men were enrolled in this study with a 1-year follow-up. Anthropometric and body composition parameters, i.e. height, body weight, body fat percentage, waist circumference and hip circumference, blood pressure, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol and blood sugar, were evaluated. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed using criteria developed in Japan.

After a 1-year follow-up, the parameters of metabolic syndrome were significantly improved. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was significantly reduced in subjects with at least 3 cm of waist circumference reduction (Group R). However, in subjects without such reduction (Group C), the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was similar to baseline levels. The prevalence of abdominal obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia was also significantly reduced in Group R. In addition, there were remarkable differences of delta triglyceride (delta represents positive changes in parameters) and delta HDL cholesterol between Group R and Group C.

At least 3 cm of waist circumference reduction may be beneficial for improving metabolic syndrome in obese Japanese men.
