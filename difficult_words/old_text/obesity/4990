This study aims to investigate the role of changes in leptin and beta endorphin (BE) levels in weight loss following electroacupuncture (EA) application in obesity treatment. EA was applied to 20 females who were 41.45 +/- 4.71 years old and had a body mass index of 36.00 +/- 2.66; and a diet program was applied to 20 females who were 42.30 +/- 4.35 years old and had a body mass index of 34.90 +/- 3.21. There was a 4.5% weight reduction in the patients with EA application, whereas patients on diet restriction had a 3.1% weight reduction. A decrease of loss of body weight was observed in the EA group (p &<0.000) when compared against the diet restricted group. A decrease of serum leptin levels (p &<0.000) and an increase in the serum BE (p &<0.05) levels were observed in the EA group compared to the diet restricted group. In this study, reduced serum leptin levels paralleling to weight loss were observed in the EA group. Furthermore, it is thought that in the EA applied group, increasing serum BE level probably enhanced the lipolitic activity which may have caused weight loss in obese people by mobilizing energy stores. It may be considered that the EA application with diet restriction in obesity treatment is more effective than the diet restriction alone.
