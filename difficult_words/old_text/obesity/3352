The pathogenetic effectiveness of the risk factor overweight is essentially modified by the distribution of the fatty depot. The form of obesity, the primary obesity, which above all is to be found in men is connected with a relatively high risk for the appearance and progression of several chronic diseases which at present determine morbidity. An only two-hour sports activity per week has a great influence on the size and the distribution of the lipopexia. Sporting persons have less body fat than inactive ones. In particular in sporting males the deposition of fat in the abdominal region is much limited.
