To determine the prevalence and distribution of dyslipidemia among urban children from Buenos Aires (BA) versus Koya Indian from San Antonio de los Cobres (SAC).

Anthropometric measures, blood pressure, Tanner stages, glucose, lipids and insulin were measured. Dyslipidemia was defined by the NCEP (the National Cholesterol Education Program standards) and AHA (American Heart Association) criteria.

The mean ages were 10.6 ± 3.0 of SAC and 9.5 ± 2.0 years of BA children. Of the 603 BA children, 97 (16.1%) were overweight (OW) and 82 (13.6%) obese (OB), and of 330 SAC, 15 (4.5%) were OW and 12 (3.6%) OB (p &<0.01). Twenty six percent SAC vs 2.5% BA children ate ≥ 5 servings/day of fruits and vegetables (p &<0.001), 30% SAC vs 59% BA children watched TV ≥ 2 h/day(p &<0.001), and 8.2% SAC vs 13.1% BA children skipped breakfast (p &<0.001). In separate linear regression models, we found that SAC children had a 1.8 mmol/L (p &<0.001) higher hemoglobin level, a 0.56 mmol/L higher triglyceride level (p&<.001), a 0.15 mmol/L higher total cholesterol level (p=0.001), a 0.19 mmol/L higher LDL-C level (p &<0.001), and a 0.33 mmol/L lower HDL-C level (p &<0.001) than BA children adjusted for confounding factors.

Koya children have a higher risk for dyslipidemia in comparison with BA children, even after controlling for lifestyle behaviors, obesity, age, and sex , suggesting that dyslipidemia could be related to their genetic backgrounds.
