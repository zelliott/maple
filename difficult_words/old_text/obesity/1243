We investigated the possible relationship between islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) and the hyperinsulinemia and/or hyperglycemia that is seen in the desert-adapted gerbil Psammomys obesus, when the animal is transferred from a low-energy (LE) diet to a high-energy (HE) diet. The effects of vanadyl sulfate and transition from a HE to a LE diet on the diabetic state of the Psammomys were also studied. Psammomys maintained on a LE diet, showing normoinsulinemia and normoglycemia (group A), were used as controls. IAPP and insulin immunoreactivity in the islets of Langerhans was studied using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique and plasma levels of the two hormones were determined by radioimmunoassays. The islet immunoreactivity of both IAPP and insulin was significantly weaker in the hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic Psammomys (group C) compared to group A. Transfer to a LE diet resulted in complete recovery of the IAPP- and insulin-staining pattern to that seen in group A [group A--Rec (nutrition)]. The plasma IAPP levels of the group C animals were not significantly higher than in group A, while after vanadyl sulfate treatment the IAPP levels and IAPP/insulin ratios remained significantly higher [group A--Rec (vanadyl)]. At the same time the circulating levels of glucose and insulin were restored to normal. Conclusively, islet IAPP and insulin immunoreactivity disappeared and reappeared in parallel in Psammomys transferred to a HE diet and back to a LE diet. Furthermore, vanadyl sulfate treatment of the hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic animals normalized circulating glucose and insulin levels, but not IAPP levels, possibly due to a negative feedback effect of IAPP on insulin release.
