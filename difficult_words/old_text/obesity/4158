Obesity is a major health crisis, and diabetes is one of its most serious sequelae. Obesity is associated with a state of chronic systemic inflammation that is a primary etiologic factor in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. This inflammatory state is based in adipose tissue and mediated in large part by tissue macrophages and their cytokine and adipokine products. Recent research has identified specific molecular mediators of the link between inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity. Study of these mediators and the specific mechanisms underlying inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity holds the promise for novel pharmacotherapy for obesity-related metabolic disease.
