The present study examined factors associated with adherence to a strength training (ST) intervention in a randomized controlled intervention trial testing whether twice-weekly strength training over 2 years could prevent age-associated increases in body fat in 80 overweight to mildly obese women, aged 25-44 years. Two sets of focus groups (FGs) were conducted with 25 women of color and 24 Caucasian participants, representing 60% of intervention participants. Fifty-five percent of FG participants had low adherence (defined as &<or = 80% adherence to twice-weekly gym-based strength training). Demographic data indicated that marital status and childcare responsibilities affected adherence. Participants' perceptions of experiences in the ST intervention did not correspond to adherence levels or vary by race/ethnicity. Major impediments to adherence included competing obligations and related scheduling difficulties; life transitions; and declining or insufficient social motivators.
