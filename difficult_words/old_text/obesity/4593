Sternal dehiscence is a serious and potentially devastating complication after median sternotomy, especially in diabetic obese patients. The optimal technique for sternal closure is unclear in these patients.

The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the incidence of sternal dehiscence after prophylactic sternal weave and figure-of-eight suturing in diabetic obese patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patients were randomly assigned to group A (figure-of-eight closure; n=75) or group B (sternal weave closure; n=75).

There were 8 cases of sternal dehiscence documented: 7 in group A and 1 in group B. In group A, 5 patients had noninfectious sternal dehiscence and 2 patients underwent reoperation because of sternal dehiscence with mediastinitis. Also, 1 of the noninfected patients had deep-seated pain with a feeling of bony crepitus and needed reoperation. The other 4 patients in group A and 1 patient with noninfectious sternal dehiscence in group B were given chest binder support. Pain and bony crepitus decreased in the follow-up period of 1 year. Sternal dehiscence rates were 9.3% in group A and 1.3% in group B. Sternal dehiscence was significantly lower in group B (p&<.05).

Prophylactic sternal weave closure of median sternotomy reduces morbidity from sternal dehiscence in diabetic obese patients undergoing CABG.
