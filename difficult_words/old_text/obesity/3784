Stroke survivors are at significant risk for recurrent stroke and cardiovascular disease. Inadequately managed modifiable risk factors increase the threat of recurrent stroke, development of new comorbidities, and double the risk of premature mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in stroke survivors who completed a research screening evaluation for entry into exercise rehabilitation studies. The sample collected between January 2001 and June 2005 evaluated 364 community-dwelling men and women aged 34 to 88 years living in Baltimore, Maryland.

Each participant's risk profile was evaluated from data obtained during a medical history and physical examination and from laboratory analysis of a fasting blood sample. Current practice guidelines were used to define risk categories.

Ninety-nine percent of participants had at least one suboptimally controlled risk factor. Ninety-one percent had two or more concurrent risk factors inadequately treated. Eighty percent of the participants had prehypertension or hypertension, 67% were overweight or obese, 60% had suboptimal low-density lipoprotein, 45% had impaired fasting glucose, 34% had low high-density lipoprotein, and 14% were current smokers, while reportedly receiving routine medical care.

These findings confirm that cardiovascular risk factors remain inadequately managed in stroke survivors, increasing the chance for repeat stroke and cardiovascular event. Systematic assessment of this vulnerable population is imperative at every healthcare encounter.
