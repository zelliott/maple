To investigate the effect of high-fat diet on expressions of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Y1, Y2, Y5 receptors and the mechanism relative to the susceptibility of obesity.

Thirty-six female SD rats were randomly divided into high-fat diet group (HF, n=27) and chow food group (CF, n=9), and given either HF or CF diet for 13 weeks. Then the HF diet group was subdivided into dietary induced obesi-ty (DIO) and dietary induced obesity resistant (DIO-R) rat according to the final body weight. Body weight, caloric intake, energy efficiency, visceral fat pads were measured and compared. The levels of plasma and hypothalamic NPY were determined by Radioimmunoassay. Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to measure the gene expression of NPY and its receptors in hypothalamus.

Body weight, caloric intake, energy efficiency and visceral fat pads in DIO rats were higher significantly than those in CF or DIO-R rats (p&<.01). No difference in plasma NPY level was detected among the three groups (&>0.05); the hypothalamic NPY level was significantly higher in DIO group than in CF or DIO-R group (p&<.01). Gene expression levels of NPY and Y1, Y2, Y5 receptors were higher significantly in DIO group than in CF or DIO-R group (p&<.01), while no significant difference was found between DIO-R and CF rats (&>0.05), except that Y2 receptor was lower in DIO-R rats (p&<.01).

SD rat fed with a HF diet showed different susceptibility to obesity, and up-regulated hypothalamic NPY and Y1, Y2, Y5 receptor gene expressions were closely associated with being predisposed to obesity and overeating of DIO rats.
