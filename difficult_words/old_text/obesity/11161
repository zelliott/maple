A search for inhibitors of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) from Walsura cochinchinensis yielded 10 new limonoids, cochinchinoids A-J (1-10), and two new triterpenoids, 3-epimesendanin S (11) and cochinchinoid K (12). Their structures were assigned on the basis of spectroscopic data, with the absolute configurations of 1 and 12 being established by X-ray diffraction analysis. Of these compounds, cochinchinoid K (12) displayed inhibitory activity against mouse 11β-HSD1 with an IC50 value of 0.82 μM.
