GH secretion and the response to GH secretagogues are significantly diminished in obese individuals. Previous studies have shown that L-692,429 (L), a nonpeptide mimetic of GH-releasing peptide, selectively stimulates GH release in normal young men and in the elderly, who also have diminished GH secretion. A paired, two-site study examined the effects of L on GH release in 12 healthy obese (part A; mean +/- SD: age, 26.1 +/- 3.3 yr; body mass index, 35.0 +/- 3.1 kg/m2) and 10 nonobese (part B; age, 22.2 +/- 2.3 yr; body mass index, &<or = 27.0) young men. In part A, placebo, low dose L (0.2 mg/kg), or high dose L (0.75 mg/kg) was administered iv over 15 min on 3 separate occasions after an overnight fast. Samples for GH, PRL, and cortisol determinations were obtained every 15 min. GH release (mean +/- SE) was significantly increased by both doses of L compared to the effect of placebo: 12.6 +/- 1.8 micrograms/L (low dose), 18.5 +/- 2.7 micrograms/L (high dose), and 0.84 +/- 0.1 microgram/L (placebo), respectively (P &<0.05). In a subset of 6 obese men, in samples collected every 5 min, the GH response to both doses of L was significantly greater than that to 1 microgram/kg GHRH. To compare the response to low dose L in the obese and to determine the effects of feeding on this response, 0.2 mg/kg L was administered as described in part A to nonobese young men after an overnight fast (fasted) or a standardized breakfast (fed; part B). Low dose L was an effective GH secretagogue in nonobese young men; however, this effect was attenuated with feeding [43.6 +/- 7.9 (fasted) vs. 17.7 +/- 4.8 (fed) micrograms/L]. Of note, the response to low dose L in fasted obese individuals was similar to that in fed nonobese individuals. The administration of L was well tolerated in both groups. We conclude that L is an effective GH secretagogue in obese and nonobese young men and may have therapeutic benefits when administered to relative (obese or elderly) or absolute GH-deficient individuals.
