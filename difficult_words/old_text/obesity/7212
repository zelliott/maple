The increasing prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in numerous populations throughout the world is currently of major concern, and presents a huge global health problem. The link between low birth weight and the subsequent development of obesity, disrupted glucose homeostasis and hypertension is now well established, and there is extensive evidence supporting these associations in both epidemiological and experimental studies. Alterations in the secretion of, and responses to, the circulating hormones insulin and leptin are likely candidates in terms of disease development. The aim of current research is to define how the central and peripheral pathways in which these signals exert their effects may be disrupted following poor early growth, and how this disruption contributes to the development of metabolic disease. The present review aims to outline the existing evidence whereby alterations in early growth may programme an individual to be at increased risk of the metabolic syndrome. The development of central appetite and expenditure circuits and of peripheral metabolic tissues, are likely to play a key role in the long-term regulation of energy balance.
