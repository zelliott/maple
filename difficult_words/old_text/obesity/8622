Children with neuromuscular disorders have special health needs that place them at risk of nutritional problems. These needs may have detrimental effects on their development, immune and respiratory system. Identified nutrition-related problems are malnutrition, obesity, food intolerance, food allergies, drug-nutrient interactions, constipation and reflux. In order to improve the nutritional status of these patients, a nutritional assessment is recommended which should include anthropometric measurements and laboratory tests.
