Several reported cases point out significant alterations in the psychologic profile of obese subjects and the utility of a psychotherapeutic support to the dietetic or pharmacological therapy. Each patient underwent a psychodiagnostic interview and the following rating-scales were applied: QPF (Psychophysiological Test); STAI X-1 and X-2 (State and Trait Anxiety Inventory); Hamilton-D (Depression); ZUNG (Self-administered Depression Test); TSR (Reaction Schemes Test). We observed an increase in the answer of the blocked projection (in the 40% of subjects), of negation (26.6%), of guilt (13.3%), a decrease in the projection answer (33.3%), high scores of QPF (21%). The STAI, the Hamilton, and the Zung were altered in the 10% of the examined subjects. Our data emphasize the importance of an individual psychotherapeutic support in a subgroup of obese subjects.
