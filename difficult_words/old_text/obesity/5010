Endothelial dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia (PE). This study aimed to determine if maternal characteristics, such as age, parity, BMI, smoking status and obstetric history, which affect the risk of developing pre-eclampsia, influenced endothelial function in myometrial arteries taken during an uncomplicated pregnancy.

As part of ongoing studies investigating endothelial function in normal and compromised pregnancies, myometrial vessels were isolated from biopsies taken at elective Caesarean section. A cohort of 119 women was identified and information regarding past pregnancy outcomes and medical history was obtained. Wire myography was used to compare endothelial-dependent relaxation in response to bradykinin between different patient groups.

Maternal age, parity and a history of miscarriage did not affect endothelial-dependent relaxation of myometrial small arteries. Attenuated endothelial-dependent relaxation was seen in vessels taken from women with elevated BMI and enhanced relaxation was seen in women who had smoked during pregnancy. Vessels isolated from women with a history of past pregnancy complications did not show any significant difference in endothelial-dependent relaxation compared to women with uncomplicated histories.

Maternal factors may influence endothelial function in the absence of pregnancy complications. Endothelial-dependent relaxation of myometrial arteries, isolated from multiparous women with an uncomplicated index pregnancy, is comparable between women with and without a history of pregnancy complications.
