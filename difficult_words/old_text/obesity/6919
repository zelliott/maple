Thirty-five patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) underwent palatopharyngoplasty (PPP) after an objective evaluation. They were all monitored polygraphically after surgery. The group's postsurgical results were positive, with significant improvement in the apnea-hypopnea index (A + H index) and oxygen desaturation. However, patients with hypopharyngeal or mandibular problems or massive obesity had poor postsurgical results. As no subject has been followed for longer than two years, the long-term prognosis for this surgical approach is unknown.
