The experience with endometrial adenocarcinoma in postmennpausal women in a private hospital is reviewed for the time period from 1960 to 1973. By dividing the investigation into time periods from 1960 to 1966 and from 1967 to 1973 a real increase in the incidence of this lesion in the latter is demonstrated. The data suggest that the increase may be due in part to the increased use of exogenous estrogen in postmenopausal women. A treatment regimen to circumvent this increase is offered.
