In the United States, as in many other countries, liposuction is the most commonly performed cosmetic surgical procedure. Advances in technology have enabled surgeons to improve the safety and efficacy of the procedure. One such technological advance is laser-assisted liposuction. This minimally invasive technique employs laser energy in direct contact with adipose tissue to induce lipolysis and, at the same time, coagulate tiny blood vessels and stimulate dermal and subdermal neocollagenesis. These features of laser lipolysis permit a fast, comfortable postoperative recovery, a rapid return to activities of daily living, and excellent skin redraping as a result of laser-induced skin tightening.
