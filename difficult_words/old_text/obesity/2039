Cardiovascular disease risk factor comparisons were made on study populations from communities in two different countries with similar ongoing intervention programs. Baseline survey data from the intervention and comparison communities of the Pawtucket Heart Health Program in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and from the intervention Region of Bremen-North/West of the German Cardiovascular Prevention Study were compared with respect to these cardiovascular disease risk factors: smoking, overweight, physical inactivity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. The relationship between these variables and social class was also examined in an attempt to partially explain some of the cross cultural differences in risk factors and predicted CHD and CVD mortality. Results indicated statistically significant differences in amount of cigarettes smoked, exercise frequency, diet, body mass index, total cholesterol, HDL, and blood pressure. These risk factors were generally higher in the German population than in the American population as were the predicted CHD and CVD mortality. For the study populations of both countries, however, the lower the social class, the more prevalent the smoking, excess weight, and lack of physical activity.
