Obesity is a growing problem causing significant morbidity and mortality. The efficacy of conventional therapies is limited. Numerous alternative therapies are advocated for weight loss, including dietary modifications, hypnotherapy, and acupuncture. Many herbal medications and dietary supplements such as conjugated linoleic acids, chitosan, Garcinia cambogia, and Citrus aurantium, are also being used. Most have been tested in very limited trials. None have been evaluated to the extent they can be definitively recommended, nor have they been studied to ascertain the extent of potential hazards. Given the scope of the problem, and the potential risk to a vulnerable population, further research should be conducted to define the efficacy of these treatments, particularly for the elderly.
