No studies have been reported in children that assess correlates of body-composition changes in response to a physical training intervention.

The hypothesis studied was that variation in diet and physical activity would explain a significant portion of the interindividual variation in the response of body composition to physical training.

The participants were 71 obese children aged 7-11 y (22 boys, 49 girls; 31 whites, 40 blacks). Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, physical activity by a 7-d recall interview, and diet by two, 2-d recalls. The children underwent 4 mo of physical training.

The mean attendance was 4 d/wk, the mean (+/-SD) heart rate for the 40-min sessions was 157 +/- 7 beats/min, and the mean energy expenditure was 946 +/- 201 kJ/session. On average, the percentage body fat decreased significantly in the total group, and total mass, fat-free soft tissue, bone mineral content, and bone mineral density increased, but there was a good deal of individual variability. Multiple regression models indicated that in general, more frequent attendance, being a boy, lower energy intake, and more vigorous activity were associated with healthier body-composition changes with physical training. Ethnicity was not retained as a correlate of the change of any component of body composition.

In obese children, age, vigorous activity, diet, and baseline percentage body fat together accounted for 25% of the variance in the change in percentage body fat with physical training.
