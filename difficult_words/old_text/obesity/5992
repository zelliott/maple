Obesity is associated with increased risk of erectile dysfunction (ED); however, the underlying causes of ED in obese individuals remain poorly defined. The aim of this review is to discuss the evidence available on the relationship between obesity and ED. A search of published studies in PubMed from 1970 through 2009 was conducted, and relevant articles were evaluated and discussed. Visceral obesity is a public health threat, and is associated with increased risk of diabetes, vascular disease, endothelial dysfunction, and ED. Plasma testosterone levels are reduced in obesity, further contributing to an increased risk of vascular pathology in obesity. The recognition of the relationship between obesity, reduced testosterone levels, and ED has paved the way for new approaches to manage and treat obese, hypogonadal patients with ED. Obesity profoundly and adversely impacts overall health and, in particular, vascular health, by increasing proinflammatory factors, altering endothelial function and the androgen endocrine milieu, thus increasing the risk of ED.
