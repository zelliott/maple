To determine whether the dramatic reduction in expression and functional activity of the beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) and beta1AR subtypes originally observed in adipose tissue of the C57BL/6J Lep(ob)/Lep(ob) ('obese') mouse are general features of all models of obesity, and whether obesity-related differences in betaAR subtype expression occur between adipose depots.

Survey of adipose tissue betaAR expression from four mouse models of congenital obesity: the 'obese' mouse (C57BL/6J Lep(ob)/Lep(ob)), the 'diabetic' mouse (C57BL/KsJ LepRdb/LepRdb), the 'tubby' mouse (C57BL/6J tub/tub) and the 'fat' mouse (C57BL/KsJ Cpe(fat)/Cpe(fat)), and in a model of high-fat diet-induced obesity in C57BL/6J mice.

Expression of the betaAR subtypes was measured by Northern blot hybridization in white and brown adipose depots.

In the severely obese Lep(ob) and LepRdb mice, mRNA concentrations of beta3AR and beta1AR in white adipose tissue (WAT) were decreased by&> 99% and by&> 70%, respectively. More modest effects on beta3AR expression were observed in brown adipose tissue (BAT, decreased by 20 - 30%). In less severe forms of obesity, as found in the tubby and carboxypeptidase (Cpe)fat mice, and in diet-induced obese B6 mice, beta3AR expression was decreased in WAT by up to 90%, with more modest decreases in interscapular BAT (IBAT). Changes in beta1AR mRNA concentrations were more variable. Beta2AR mRNA levels did not differ in most cases, with the exception that there was a 3-5-fold increase in BAT for both Lep(ob) and LepRdb mice.

Impaired expression of adipocyte betaAR subtypes is a general feature of both genetic and dietary obesity in mice. The degree of obesity is correlated with the extent of loss of beta3AR and beta1AR expression in WAT. The distinct endocrine abnormalities associated with these obesity models may be responsible for the degree of impaired adipocyte betaAR expression.
