This article reviews the published literature on the relationship between combined OCs (oral contraceptives) administration and metabolic and cerebro- and cardiovascular effects.  All retrospective studies show an increase in the risk of thromboembolic accidents, while only a few of the prospective studies do.  A study of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) states that the risk of myocardial infarction is multiplied by 5.22 in OCs users, and that smoking, but not age, greatly increases the risk.  All studies document an increase in risk of cerebrovascular effects; high arterial pressure and smoking increase the risk, but obesity does not.  Synthetic estrogens increase triglyceride levels according to dosage, but progesterone does not.  Estrogen increases cholesterol level, estroprogestational agents increase it slightly, while progesterone does not cause any increase.  Synthetic estrogens tend to increase low density lipoprotein cholesterol and derivates of progesterone do not; high density lipoprotein levels are increased by estrogens but decreased by progesterone.  Age, smoking and diabetes increase the risk.  Recent studies of the RCGP eliminate the responsibility of estroprogestins in causing diabetes, while other authors think the opposite.  In general, the literature does not agree on the metabolic side effects of combined OC use, and conclusions are often opposite between retrospective and prospective studies.  There still are not any epidemiological studies on the metabolic side effects of the mini-pill.
