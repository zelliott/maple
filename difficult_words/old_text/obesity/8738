To investigate gender differences in circulating leptin levels and adipose tissue production of leptin.

Thirty-two men and 63 women with a large interindividual variation in body mass index (BMI), but otherwise healthy, were investigated after an overnight fast. Body fat (bioimpedance), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue secretion of leptin in vitro and serum leptin were determined.

Although there was no gender difference in mean BMI or fat cell size, mean percentage body fat was 49 in women and 36 in men (P &<0.001). At each level of BMI, serum leptin levels were about two times higher in women than in men (P &<0.001). Adipose tissue secretion rate of leptin in men was two-thirds of that in women (P &<0.05). The gender differences in body fat content, serum leptin and leptin secretion were observed in obese (BMI&> 27 kg m-2) as well as non-obese subjects. Serum leptin levels (P &<0.001) and leptin secretion rate (P &<0.01) correlated positively with body fat content in either sex. However, the gender differences in serum leptin (P &<0.001) and leptin secretion rate (P &<0.01) remained statistically significantly different even when the values were adjusted for body fat.

The gender difference in circulating leptin concentrations can be due to at least two different mechanisms. A higher proportion of adipose tissue and increased production rate of leptin per unit mass of adipose tissue might explain why women have higher circulating leptin levels than men.
