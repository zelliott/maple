A search was made for predictors of sudden cardiac death (SCD) among 197 men, age 40 to 79, who had multiphasic health checkups and experienced SCD 2 days to 5 1/2 years later (mean 18.1 months). Two age-sex-race-matched control groups, one matched and one unmatched for standard coronary risk factors, have been compared to the cases. In this ambulatory population, SCD occurred largely in persons with prior diagnosed heart disease. Standard coronary risk factors were confirmed as predictors of SCD. Predictors among other laboratory and quantitative tests include chylous serum, uric acid, hemoglobin, leukocyte count, pulse rate, diminished lung volumes, and hearing loss. Some of these had predictive value independent of standard risk factors. Pain tolerance was not related to SCD or to death in, versus out of hospital. Most of these predictors were not related to terminal symptom duration; this suggests a relationship more to the underlying atherosclerotic process than to the terminal fatal mechanism.
