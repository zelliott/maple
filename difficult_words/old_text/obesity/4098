Obesity and its related disorders are growing epidemic across the world. Research on links between the bipolar spectrum and obesity has proliferated in the last few years. As some forms of abnormal temperament are considered as subtypes of the soft bipolar spectrum, we aimed to evaluate abnormal temperaments in morbidly obese patients.

Using a short version of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego, we investigated abnormal depressive, cyclothymic, hyperthymic, irritable or anxious temperament in 213 patients with morbid obesity compared to a control group of 90 patients admitted prior to organ transplantation. Additionally, the Beck-Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Self-Report Manic Inventory (SRMI) were applied to assess current mood status.

The obese group showed statistically significantly more psychiatric comorbidities compared to the control group. Abnormal temperaments were significantly more often observed in patients with morbid obesity rather than in controls. Cyclothymic, irritable and anxious temperaments showed specificity to obesity. Obese patients had significantly higher scores on the BDI, while no difference for SRMI scores was found among the whole groups. All temperaments were positively correlated with BDI and SRMI in the obese group.

The control group was not matched for demographic characteristics.

Our results need replication but indicate an affective overlap in the form of abnormal temperament and depressive symptoms in obese patients, whereas mood swings should be evaluated and early mood stabilization considered for patients with significant weight gain to prevent obesity or to reduce already existing overweight. Studies of mood stabilizers and prospective observations would shed further insight on this complex interface of a major clinical and public health issue.
