Both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity are a major public health problem in Mexico and around the world for increased incidence. In T2DM, insulin secretion, insulin action or both are altered. Also, in T2DM as well as in obesity a low grade chronic inflammation has been associated. In both conditions there is an important increase of visceral adipose tissue, which induces to an up-regulation of synthesis in proinflammatory molecules. This process involves different subsets of the immune system. The macrophages and monocytes are the best studied, but recently has been reported the involvement of other type of cells; such as neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils, dendritic cells, NKs, NKT. Also, some T cells subsets, such as Th1, Th2, T regulatory, Th17 and B cells seems to be involved in the low grade chronic inflammation. This review focuses on recent evidences of the role of innate and adaptative immune system cells in the pathology of T2DM and obesity. We concluded with the general proposal of a theoretical model, how the immune cells may participate in inflammation of fat tissue, insulin resistance and T2DM.
