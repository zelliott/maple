Binge eating disorder (BED) is a new eating disorder that describes the eating disturbance of a large number of individuals who suffer from recurrent binge eating but who do not regularly engage in the compensatory behaviors to avoid weight gain seen in bulimia nervosa. This multisite study of BED involved 1,785 subjects drawn from 18 weight control programs, 942 subjects from five nonpatient community samples, and 75 patients with bulimia nervosa. Approximately 29% of subjects in weight control programs met the criteria for BED. In the nonpatient community samples BED was more common than purging bulimia nervosa. The validity of BED was supported by its strong association with (1) impairment in work and social functioning, (2) overconcern with body/shape and weight, (3) general psychopathology, (4) significant amount of time in adult life on diets, (5) a history of depression, alcohol/drug abuse, and treatment for emotional problems.
