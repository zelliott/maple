We analysed the data of 395 nondiabetic obese (BMI 25-42.2, impaired glucose tolerance, IGT, 257 and normal glucose tolerance, NGT, 138) and 482 nonobese subjects (BMI 15.9-24.9, IGT 170 and NGT 312). The blood pressure, plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride and total cholesterol in obese were higher than that in nonobese, while HDL-c level was lower after controlling for age and sex (P &<0.001). This difference remained to be significant even after the adjustment of age, sex, insulin and 2-hours plasma glucose. Therefore, it was suggested that obesity was easy of access to coronary heart disease risk factors independent of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.
