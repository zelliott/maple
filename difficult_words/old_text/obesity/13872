To examine genetic loci linked to a long-term burden and trend of obesity traits, such as body mass index (BMI), from childhood to adulthood.

: Longitudinal study using serial measurements of BMI from childhood.

A total of 782 unselected white siblings (representing 521 full and 39 half sib-pairs) from 342 families enrolled in the Bogalusa Heart Study.

A total of 357 microsatellite markers with an average spacing of 9.0 cM spanning the 22 autosomal chromosomes were typed. A quadratic growth curve was developed using a random effects model based on serial measurements of BMI from childhood to adulthood. The serial changes in BMI were measured in terms of long-term burden (area under the curve (AUC) divided by follow-up years) and the long-term trend (incremental AUC, calculated as total AUC-baseline AUC).

Heritability estimates of long-term measures were 0.78 for total AUC and 0.43 for incremental AUC. In a variance-component-based multipoint linkage analysis with SOLAR, linkage to the long-term measures of BMI was observed on chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 12, 13 and 18. For total AUC, LOD scores were 3.0 at 110 cM on chromosome 12, 2.9 at 26 cM and 2.4 at 52 cM on chromosome 7, and 2.2 at 126 cM on chromosome 5. For incremental AUC, LOD scores were 2.9 at 26 cM, 2.1 at 97 cM and 2.3 at 110 cM on chromosome 12, 2.2 at 69 cM on chromosome 7, 2.2 at 91 cM and 2.5 at 150 cM on chromosome 1, 2.0 at 119 cM on chromosome 5, 2.0 at 54 cM on chromosome 13 and 2.0 at 7 cM on chromosome 18. Several important obesity-related candidate genes are located in the regions or near the markers showing positive linkage.

Linkage evidence found in this study indicates that regions on these chromosomes might harbor genetic loci that affect the propensity to develop obesity from childhood.
