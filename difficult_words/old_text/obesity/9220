Unlike normal weight individuals, individuals with extreme obesity do not show a decrease in arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO₂) from rest to peak exercise. This indicates that breathing is compromised. The objective of this study was to determine if prior high intensity exercise lowers PaCO₂ in comparison with a first bout, normalized for the same metabolic rate.

Oxygen consumption during incremental, ramped exercise was matched to constant workload exercise (75% of peak power). Both protocols were to volitional exhaustion 39 ± 8 min apart. Eleven obese subjects (BMI = 47 ± 8 kg/m², aerobic capacity = 2.3 ± 0.6 L/min) were evaluated. Forty paired samples were obtained at the same metabolic rate between the two protocols.

The mean absolute difference and 95% CI were large for arterial oxygen pressure (PaO₂) = 9 (6, 11) mmHg and alveolar to arterial oxygen pressure difference (AaDO2) = 7 (5, 8) mmHg. The mean absolute difference for arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (%SaO₂) = 0.5 (0.4, 0.7) %; PaCO2 = 4 (3, 4) mmHg; physiological dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) = 0.04 (0.03, 0.05); and alveolar ventilation (VA) = 3 (2, 4) L/min. The recovery period after the first bout of exercise reduced the PaCO₂ by 3 mmHg when matched for similar metabolic rates. Constant workload exercise predicted VA, %SaO2, V(D)/V(T), and PaCO₂, but not PaO₂ or AaDO₂ during incremental exercise at similar metabolic rates.

Given a sufficient chemical stimulus, obese subjects will attempt to breathe more, although this does not mean more VA, which removes CO₂.
