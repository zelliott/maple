Binding of insulin and insulin secretion were studied in isolated pancreatic islets of homozygous obese fa/fa rats, their lean littermates (Fa/?) and Wistar rats. Despite normoglycemia fa/fa rats exhibit hyperinsulinemia. Glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic islets in vitro was increased by more than 50% in fa/fa rats compared with islets of lean littermates and normal Wistar rats when calculated per microgram islet protein. Exogenous insulin inhibited glucose (16.7 mM)-induced insulin secretion in islets of either of these rats, and maximum inhibition was rather the same (secretion was reduced by 62.3-65.6%). However, the EC50 (half-maximal effective concentration) for inhibition was increased in fa/fa rats being 1.4 +/- 0.1 nM compared with 0.6 +/- 0.2 and 0.5 +/- 0.2 nM in lean littermates and Wistar rats, respectively (P less than 0.05 vs. fa/fa rats). Islets of fa/fa rats found 24% less [125I]insulin (P less than 0.01) than islets of lean littermates and of Wistar rats. Scatchard analysis of data of displacement of [125I]insulin binding by native insulin showed 2 binding sites; a decrease in the number of high affinity insulin binding sites (Bmax) from 4.2 +/- 1.3 and 4.7 +/- 1.6 fmol/mg protein to 2.6 +/- 0.7 fmol/mg protein was calculated when islets of lean littermates and normal Wistar rats were compared to islets of fa/fa rats. The Kd of the high affinity binding site was not changed (0.77 +/- 0.06, 0.78 +/- 0.11 and 0.61 +/- 0.14 nM, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
