Obesity is a public health problem and it is necessary to identify if non-symptomatic obese women must be submitted to endometrial evaluation.

To determine the prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in non-symptomatic overweight or obese women.

A cross-sectional study was carried out in 193 women submitted to an endometrial biopsy using a Pipelle de Cornier. The findings were classified as normal, hyperplasia or cancer, and the results were compared to body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)). For the purpose of statistical analysis, women were divided into two groups: women of reproductive age and postmenopausal women, and according to BMI as overweight or obese.

The prevalence of endometrial cancer and hyperplasia was 1.0% and 5.8% in women of reproductive age and 3.0% and 12.1% in postmenopausal women, respectively. According to logistic regression, being in the postmenopause increased the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer to 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36-3.90), while being postmenopausal and severely obese increased the odds ratio (OR) to 1.58 (95%CI: 0.30-8.23) and being postmenopausal and morbidly obese increased the OR to 2.72 (95%CI: 0.65-11.5). No increase in risk was found in women of reproductive age who were either overweight or obese.

Our results show that non-symptomatic, severe or morbidly obese postmenopausal women have a high risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia or cancer; however, no such risk was found for women of reproductive age.
