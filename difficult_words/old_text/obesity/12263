Gastric fundus compliance allows stomach volume increase in response to food intake. Absence of this postprandial relaxation alters hormonal signals and induces early satiety and weight loss. This study demonstrates the effect of gastric fundus invagination on the growth rate of juvenile pigs. After institutional animal care and use committee approval, 15 juvenile pigs were divided into two groups. In the first group, six pigs were anesthetized, weighed, and submitted to laparotomy, stomach manipulation, and short gastric vessel ligation. This is the control group and is referred to as "Sham". In the second group, gastric fundus invagination was added by using a circular stapler. This is the procedure group and is designated as "GFI". Postoperatively, body weight and food intake were measured for 5 weeks. Pigs were euthanized and the stomachs examined. Growth patterns were compared. Three animals were excluded from the analysis. At the end of the 5-week study period, six GFI pigs had intact anastomosis with an invaginated fundus. The mean percent growth rate for the GFI group (54.2 ± 2.8 %) was significantly less than the Sham group (77.7 ± 4.9 %). Gastric fundus invagination significantly decreases the growth rate in juvenile pigs.
