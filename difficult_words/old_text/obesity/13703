Bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine (L2-L4) and hip (at femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and greater trochanter sites) were determined by dual-photon absorptiometry (DPA), and of the radius by single-photon absorptiometry (SPA) in healthy postmenopausal women aged 40-70 years. The relationships of BMC and BMD to years since menopause were examined separately in 97 women who were above 115% of ideal body weight (IBW) and in 128 women below. The heavier women had significantly greater mean BMC and BMD at each site than did the normal-weight women. In the normal-weight women, there was a significant negative correlation between BMD and years since menopause at each measurement site except the greater trochanter. In the obese women, BMD decreased with increasing years since menopause at the radius site only and BMC declined with increasing years after menopause at the hip (femoral neck and Ward's triangle region) as well as the radius. Thus, body size is a significant determinant of BMD in this population. The pattern of loss of BMD from Ward's triangle and femoral neck regions of hip are similar to that of the spine. The BMC and BMD findings in the hip suggest that remodeling occurs at this weight-bearing site which has a favorable effect on bone strength.
