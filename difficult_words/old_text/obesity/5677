Acupuncture and moxibustion is one of the important therapies in TCM for treating obese. The authors have treated 41 simple obese patients complicated with hypertension by acupuncture and moxibustion which obtained good results. In the treating group, a total effective rate was 87.8% (36 cases). For the purpose of understanding regulatory effect of acupuncture and moxibustion, the authors have observed the obesity indices, the lipid indices (TC, TG, VLDL-C, TC/HDL-C, HDL-C, LDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C and AI), the physiological indices (saliva secretion, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature) and the energy metabolism indices (BMR) in the simple obese complicated with hypertension before and after the acupuncture and moxibustion. The results showed that the therapeutic effect of acupuncture and moxibustion could have good results. At the same time, there were the benign regulatory effect of acupuncture and moxibustion in the overeating, the blood pressure, the vegetative nervous indexes, the lipid level and the energy metabolism.
