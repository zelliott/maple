Obesity during adolescence is considered a strong predictor of adult obesity, and obesity and overweight have been increasing among Brazilian adults. To gauge the relative frequency of overweight among adolescents in Brazil, we compared the distributions of body mass index (kg/m2) and stature in national population based samples of the U.S. and Brazil. U.S. adolescents were on average about 10 cm taller than Brazilians, although growth spurts occurred at the same age for both populations. Brazilian adolescents were leaner than their U.S. counterparts. This difference was reduced among girls in the postpubertal period. At age 17 years, U.S. boys were about 10 kg heavier than Brazilian boys, but the difference among girls was only 2 kg. In families above the poverty level in the more developed South region, body mass index distribution for boys was closer to that of the U.S., and older girls tended to have higher body mass index than U.S. girls. Within Brazil, body mass index varied by ethnicity with Mulattos, but not Blacks, of both sexes having lower body mass index than Whites of the same age. Urban adolescents had higher body mass index than those living in rural areas. In general, the patterns seen among Brazilian adults were found among children. Among girls, in particular, overweight has become an identifiable problem during adolescence.
