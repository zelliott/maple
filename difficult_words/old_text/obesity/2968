Rapidly induced systemic alkalinization due to either sodium-lactate or sodium-bicarbonate infusion in prolonged-fasted subjects with steady-state ketoacidosis was associated with a decrease in urine pH. This decrease in urine pH from 5.50 to 5.20 was the result of a significant decrease in urinary ammonium excretion from 8.40 to 6.35 mEg/hr and was not accompanied by an increase in net acid excretion (11.3 vs. 10.6 mEg/hr). The decreased ammonium excretion is attributed to the raised pH of the proximal tubular fluid resulting in a less favorable pH gradient for gaseous ammonia entry. This would decrease gaseous ammonia generated in the loop of Henle for collecting duct buffering of secreted hydrogen ions.
