To determine whether maternal obesity is associated with dysfunctional labor patterns.

In a case-control design we compared the graphic labor patterns of a group of 105 very obese subjects [body mass index (BMI)&>35 kg/m(2)] with those of 113 lean controls (BMI&<6 kg/m(2)). All entered spontaneous labor at term. Cases with birth weights&>4 kg, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and prior cesarean delivery were excluded.

The obese group had a significantly higher frequency of arrest of dilatation (17.6 vs. 5.2%; P=0.005).

Maternal obesity is associated with active phase labor dysfunction, specifically arrest of dilatation.
