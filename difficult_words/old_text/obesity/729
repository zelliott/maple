Recent studies have shown that C-reactive proteins have a pathogenetic role in atherothrombosis and concentrations of these substances could be used as a marker for future vascular events. The objective of this study was to determine gender differences in highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in individuals with atherothrombotic risk factors and apparently healthy ones. We have presently matched 469 females and 469 males having the same age and body mass index (BMI). Of these, 210 men and 210 women had no atherothrombotic risk factors. In this group the hs-CRP concentrations were 1.6+/-3.4 mg l(-1) in women and 1.0+/-2.7 mg l(-1) in men (p&<.0005). These values were 2.1+/-3.4 mg l(-1) and 1.5+/-2.8 mg l(-1), respectively, in the entire cohort (p&<.0005), which included also individuals with atherothrombotic risk factors. We conclude that significant gender differences exist in hs-CRP concentrations despite perfect matching for age and BMI. These differences should be reflected in guidelines that suggest hs-CRP cut-off points for the stratification of vascular risk.
