The effects of a 10 session group programme designed to discourage dieting behaviour and reduce preoccupation with body weight, food and eating were assessed in 87 women (mean age 40 years and mean body mass index 31.9) who attended three different agencies in Adelaide, South Australia. The subjects were selected on the basis of eating preoccupation and not body weight. Measurements of various psychological parameters and body weight were made at entry to the programme, at the completion of the programme and at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after its completion. Eighty women completed the groups and data were obtained from 56 of them at 2 years. At the completion of the group programme and at 2 years there were significant improvements (P less than 0.01) in the psychological parameters self-esteem, depression, self-image, eating attitude, body image and assertion. At two years after the completion of the group, there was a significant (P less than 0.005) mean weight loss of 3.1 kg when compared to baseline. We conclude that this programme confers long-term beneficial effects on psychological function and body weight.
