During recent years, evidence supporting the vital role of physical activity in the prevention and treatment of diabetes has been accumulating. Physical activity is recognized to produce multiple general and diabetes-specific health benefits. Yet despite the multitude of benefits, many people are physically inactive. As the prevalence of overweight and obesity, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes has continued to rise at an alarming rate, physical inactivity has become an urgent public health concern. The purpose of this article is to review the physical activity/exercise research in diabetes and summarize the current exercise recommendations. This information can be used by clinicians to make safe and effective recommendations for integrating physical activity/exercise into self-management plans for individuals with diabetes or at risk for its development.
