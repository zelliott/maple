There is growing concern about increasing rates of obesity in young people, and increasing ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) at a younger age. There are only a few studies performed to study the risk factors in STEMI among young populations.

Retrospective chart reviews on all first event STEMI patients between December 2005 and July 2007 were performed. A young population was defined as: men &<5 years of age and women &<5 years of age.

Among 206 patients with STEMI, 36 were young. In young patients with STEMI, 78 % were obese compared with 35 % obese, non-young (p&<.001). Also, among young patients with STEMI, family history of coronary heart disease (CHD) was positive in 39 %, compared with 19 % in non-young patients (p=0.009). This significance for obesity and family history persisted after adjusting for other risk factors using logistic regression (OR 2.96 to 17.75, 95 % CI, p&<.0001 and OR 1.36 to 7.47, 95 % CI, p=0.008, respectively).

Obesity and family history of CHD were major risk factors with a higher prevalence in young patients with STEMI than non-young patients.
