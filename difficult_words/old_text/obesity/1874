Lithium's impact on glucose metabolism was compared with that of insulin in isolated rat soleus muscle. Lithium chloride (20 mmol/l) induced a 4.8-fold more pronounced increment over basal glycogen synthase activity than insulin (10 nmol/l) (nmol UDP-glucose into glycogen in synthase activity assay.g-1.min-1: lithium, +22.1 +/- 1.8 vs. insulin, +4.6 +/- 3.9; P &<0.01). In parallel, lithium was less efficient than insulin in stimulating glucose transport (counts per minute 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose.mg-1.h-1: lithium, +211 +/- 19 vs. insulin, +311 +/- 57; P &<0.05) and lactate release (mumol.g-1.h-1: lithium, +1.0 +/- 0.5 vs. insulin, +3.9 +/- 0.5; P &<0.01), and similar increments were induced in glycogen synthesis (mumol glucose into glycogen.g-1.h-1: lithium, +3.32 +/- 0.43 vs. insulin, +3.46 +/- 0.47; not significant). Full additivity of glycogenic effects and divergent dependency on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation provided further evidence for different mechanisms of action. In muscle from insulin-resistant obese Zucker rats (fa/fa), failure of lithium to reverse deficits in glucose metabolism suggested a primary deficit in muscle glucose uptake rather than glycogen synthesis. Hence lithium distinctly stimulates glycogen synthase activity in skeletal muscle and may therefore be regarded as a candidate for the treatment of disorders associated with primary deficits in the glycogenic pathway.
