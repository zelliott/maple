The aim of this study was to estimate the coexistence of risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) in hyperlipidemic patients. Studies were performed in 1002 (601 women, 401 men) subjects who referred to our outpatient clinic among 12 months. Hypercholesterolemia was the predominant lipid disorder found in 66% of patients, mixed hyperlipidemia in 31.8%, and hypertriglyceridemia only in 2.2%. Overweight and obesity remain a major health burden among our patients: BMI&> or = 25 was observed in 66%. Hypertension was recognized in 37.5% of subjects, and diabetes mellitus in 11.2%, 17% were long-term smokers. Familial aggregation of hyperlipidemia was observed in 15.7% of subjects, and more than 44% had a positive family history of cardiovascular disease. Low HDL cholesterol levels (&<35 mg/dl) were seen frequently in men (24.7%) and rare in women (7%). Lp(a) excess &> or = 30 mg/dl) was observed in 12% of patients. Myocardial infarction (MI) had already 11.7% subjects (7% women, 18.7% men). In these patients CHD risk factors were observed more frequently. The higher apo B and Lp(a) levels and lower HDL cholesterol levels were recognized in the patients who suffered from MI. More than 83% of our hyperlipidemic patients had coexistence CHD risk factors. The multiple coexisting risk factors cause the high risk for CHD and they require intensive correction.
