A qualitative research design (grounded theory) was used to analyse the experiences of dieters attending a weight loss programme. Two hundred hours of observations at a nationally known weight reduction centre, a review of selected documents from the organization and multiple in-depth interviews with 13 informants were the data sources for this study. Data generation took place over a 21-month period. A substantive theory of restructuring identified three stages in the process of losing weight. These stages and key elements of the weight loss process are presented.
