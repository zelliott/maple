To evaluate lifestyle and dietary intake factors influencing the accumulation of abdominal fat in a Mediterranean population.

A cross-sectional study was carried-out in Spain (Asturias, Granada, Murcia, Navarra and Guipuzkoa) among 23,228 women and 14,332 men aged 29-69 years, participants of a large European prospective cohort (EPIC). Information on usual food intake and other non-dietary factors were collected by interviews. Height, weight, waist circumference and hip circumference were taken by previously trained interviewers.

In a multiple-linear regression analysis sports activities and educational level were negatively associated with abdominal obesity, while body mass index, age, tobacco and alcohol consumption, saturated fat intake and increased prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and myocardial infarction were positively associated. All dietary and non-dietary variables accounted for 22 and 27% of variance in the waist/hip ratio and 74 and 66% of variance in the waist circumference, in women and men respectively.

Body mass index and age are the most important factors influencing the accumulation of abdominal fat. Dietary factors and other lifestyle factors seem to play a minor role in increasing abdominal obesity.
