Obesity is defined as the accumulation of excess adipose tissue resulting from various metabolic disorders. Adipocyte dysfunction is strongly associated with the development of obesity and insulin resistance. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a group of metabolic risk factors in one person. Abdominal obesity and adipocyte dysfunction play an important role in the development of this syndrome. Anthocyanins are used as a food coloring, and they are widely distributed in human diets including berries, suggesting that large amounts of anthocyanins are ingested from plant-based foods. This study shows that anthocyanins have a significant potency of antiobesity and ameliorate adipocyte function in in vitro and in vivo systems and also that they have important implications for preventing metabolic syndrome.
