A neighborhood environment allows defining typical features for physically active or inactive lifestyle. An accelerated pace of life and higher availability of an unhealthy lifestyle increase obesity rates. An analysis of body composition can be used as a predictor for assessment of current somatic conditions. The aim of the study was to determine the dependence of selected body composition parameters on neighborhood walkability in 167 women aged 20-60 years attending weight-loss programme called STOB-courses. A multifrequency bioimpedance analysis InBody 720 was used to determine the body composition of respondents. Further, ANEWS questionnaire was used to determine the level of neighborhood walkability. We divided the sample into two age groups (&<0 years;&>40 years) and into partial subgroups according to the neighborhood "level of walkability" (lower and higher level). Based on the assessment of body composition, it can be assumed more walkable neighborhood opportunities positively affect body composition. Body composition in older women is positively influenced if they lived in high walkable areas. In younger women we found only one indicator of body composition (body fat mass) influenced by neighborhood walkability. The relationship between health indicators of body composition and residential infrastructure might be useful in strategies aimed at maintaining and developing a healthy lifestyle within the community.
