Energy balance in animals is a metabolic state that exists when total body energy expenditure equals dietary energy intake. Energy expenditure, or thermogenesis, can be subcategorized into groups of obligatory and facultative metabolic processes. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), through the activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), is responsible for nonshivering thermogenesis, a major component of facultative thermogenesis in newborn humans and in small mammals. UCP1, found in the mitochondrial inner membrane in BAT, uncouples energy substrate oxidation from mitochondrial ATP production and hence results in the loss of potential energy as heat. Mice that do not express UCP1 (UCP1 knockouts) are markedly cold sensitive. The recent identification of four new homologs to UCP1 expressed in BAT, muscle, white adipose tissue, brain, and other tissues has been met by tremendous scientific interest. The hypothesis that the novel UCPs may regulate thermogenesis and/or fatty acid metabolism guides investigations worldwide. Despite several hundred publications on the new UCPs, there are a number of significant controversies, and only a limited understanding of their physiological and biochemical properties has emerged. The discovery of UCP orthologs in fish, birds, insects, and even plants suggests the widespread importance of their metabolic functions. Answers to fundamental questions regarding the metabolic functions of the new UCPs are thus pending and more research is needed to elucidate their physiological functions. In this review, we discuss recent findings from mammalian studies in an effort to identify potential patterns of function for the UCPs.
