We retrospectively evaluated the lateral pedicle technique for reduction mammaplasty. One hundred and one women were reviewed, using a questionnaire. Fifty-nine of these women were tested 5-7 years postoperatively. All patients were operated on using a large, thick lateral pedicle. There were 10 major complications. Adipose women with larger breasts (hypertrophy or gigantomastia) had no more complications than the smaller reductions. In those who had larger resections, only those with a combination of risk factors developed complications (old age, heavy smoking, and obesity). There were other reasons for complications in those who had smaller reductions. Twenty-four patients were relieved of pain and 83 reported improvement in their work and social life after operation. There were 47 women who were very satisfied and 33 who were satisfied with the results (total 80/101).
