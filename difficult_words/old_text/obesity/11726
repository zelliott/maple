Orexins (hypocretins) are lateral hypothalamic neuropeptides implicated in regulating feeding and the sleep-wake cycle. To study their possible relevance to obesity and diabetes, we measured hypothalamic prepro-orexin mRNA levels in obese, normoglycemic Zucker fatty (fa/fa) and in hyperglycemic, non-obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Hypothalamic prepro-orexin mRNA concentrations in Zucker fatty rats were 31% lower than those in lean controls (0. 69+/-0.06 vs. 1.00+/-0.10 arbitrary units, P&<.05), but did not differ between ZDF diabetic rats and non-diabetic controls. Treatment of ZDF diabetic rats with rosiglitazone (1 or 3 mg/kg body weight daily for 13 weeks) normalized plasma glucose and significantly reduced plasma insulin, while leptin levels were 67% higher than in untreated ZDF rats (20.2+/-0.5 vs. 12.1+/-2.5, P&<. 001). Rosiglitazone treatment markedly enhanced weight gain compared with untreated ZDF rats (final weight 732+/-13 g vs. 409+/-13 g, P&<. 001) even though they were restricted to the same food intake. Rosiglitazone-treated ZDF rats had significantly lower hypothalamic prepro-orexin mRNA levels (0.68+/-0.07 arbitrary units) than both non-diabetic lean controls (1.00+/-0.10, P=0.02) and untreated diabetics (1.03+/-0.14, P=0.03). Our data suggest that prepro-orexin gene expression may be suppressed by substantial weight gain. Obesity-related signals that might mediate this effect have not been identified, but plasma leptin, insulin and glucose are not obviously involved.
