To report the feasibility of a novel robotic technique for intracorporeal construction of a double Yang-Monti ileal conduit with bladder augmentation in an adult patient.

The Yang-Monti procedure can be considered as an alternative to Mitrofanoff appendicovesicostomy when the appendix is not available or in obese patients. To date, the robotic approach has not been described. We have described all the steps of our surgery, performed on a 35-year-old obese patient with post-traumatic paraplegia and a neurogenic bladder. We focused on the technical tips and highlighted all the differences with the standard open technique.

Our technique provided satisfactory results. No intraoperative complications occurred. The operative time was 250 minutes, and the intraoperative blood loss was 200 mL. The clinical course was uneventful.

We have shown that robotic intracorporeal realization of a double Yang-Monti ileal conduit with bladder augmentation is feasible, extending the potential indications of robot-assisted surgery. The evaluation of more cases is advised.
