Recent studies have disclosed a close relationship between maternal obesity, fetal metabolism and pre- and postnatal development. The lipid metabolism in preimplantation embryos is a possible target of metabolic programming.

31 genes of beta-oxidation and fatty acid and cholesterol uptake, synthesis and regulation were analyzed in day 3.5 blastocysts from NZO (obese) and C57Bl/6 (normal weight) mice by RT-PCR and semiquantitative PCR.

The most obvious difference between both strains was the lack of the RXR gamma transcript in NZO blastocysts. In adult NZO mice, RXR gamma is detectable in most tissues. In a semiquantitative analysis, a higher transcription rate of fatty acid transport protein 4 (p = 0.004) and a reduced transcript number of fatty acid synthase (p = 0.049) was found in NZO blastocysts. Cholesterol synthesis regulation was modified in NZO blastocysts, as indicated by the ratio of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2 / insulin-induced gene 1 (Insig 1) (p = 0.001).

In mouse blastocysts enzymes and signal molecules of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism resemble those expressed postnatally. Distinct differences in transcription rates of genes between blastocysts from obese and non-obese mothers indicate that preimplantation embryo development is an early target for metabolic programming.
