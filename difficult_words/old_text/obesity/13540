Adult subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) may show several conditions that are associated with an activation of innate immunity such as obesity, deficient GH secretion or hypogonadism. Our aim was to study whether obese adult PWS subjects show an additional low-grade systemic inflammation (LGSI) in relation to obese adult non-PWS subjects and lean healthy control subjects before and after a standardized liquid meal.

Seven obese adult PWS subjects, 7 matched obese non-PWS subjects and 7 lean healthy control subjects were studied for 6 h from the administration of a standard liquid meal.

Compared to non-PWS, PWS subjects showed higher plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.030), complement component C3 (p=0.018), interleukin(IL)-18 (p=0.048), and IL-6 (p=0.041) that persisted post-prandially elevated for CRP (p&<.0001), C3 (p=0.015), and IL-18 (p=0.003). Tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-alpha did not differ between the 3 groups. These results were independent from IGF-I levels, homeostasis model assessment index, and body mass index (BMI). In male subjects with PWS, testosterone levels correlated to IL-18 (r=-0,646, p=0.041).

Compared to matched non-PWS subjects, the obese PWS subjects in this study showed an additional LGSI that persisted postprandially and was independent from BMI, insulin resistance, and deficient GH secretion. However, in PWS males, high IL-18 levels were related to low testosterone concentrations.
