This study assessed the prevalence of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors in 119 adolescent smokers, compared to an age-matched sample of non-smokers. Participants were assessed for body mass index (BMI), relative body fat, systolic/diastolic/mean arterial blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, aerobic fitness, family (parents or siblings) smoking habits and history of cardiovascular disease. The results showed that BMI and relative body fat were significantly increased, while aerobic fitness was significantly decreased in smokers. Male smokers further demonstrated increased diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure. Smokers also showed increased prevalence for family smoking habits and cardiovascular disease history. Prevalence rates for all other cardiovascular disease risk factors were increased in smokers, but the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. It is concluded that the studied adolescent smokers demonstrated a higher risk for developing cardiovascular disease later in life, compared to their non-smoking counterparts.
