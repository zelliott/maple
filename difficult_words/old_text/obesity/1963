A 42-year-old white man with morbid obesity and hypertriglyceridemia was noted to have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) at the time of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for presumed gallstone pancreatitis. His postoperative course was complicated by a 50-kg weight loss and continued right upper quadrant pain. Repeat liver biopsy revealed NASH with accompanying micronodular cirrhosis. Due to progressive fatigue, he underwent an orthotopic liver transplantation complicated by a 36-kg weight gain. Sixteen months posttransplantation, a liver biopsy revealed the recurrence of NASH. Screening for defects in fatty acid oxidation proved negative.
