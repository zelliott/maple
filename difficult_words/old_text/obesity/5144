A behaviorally oriented correspondence course was completed by 517 subjects. All subjects received the behavioral course but were sorted into four groups: (a) behavioral instruction only, (b) recommend soup for lunch, (c) recommend soup for any meal or snack, and (d) recommend yogurt for meals or snacks. Subjects lost an average of 3.8 kg. in 10 weeks. There was a marked association between rate of eating and total caloric consumption for the meal. Eating soup as part of lunch or dinner led to both decreased consumption of kilo-calories and a slower rate of eating.
