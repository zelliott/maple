Young female obese (cp/cp) and lean littermates (?/+) of the recently developed congenic strain, SHR/NIH-corpulent (SHR/N-cp), were fed for 6.5 months isocaloric diets containing 54 percent carbohydrate as either sucrose or starch. Glycemic, lipidemic and renal parameters were determined after 1, 3 and 6 months. Systolic blood pressure and plasma corticosterone levels were determined after 3 months. After 6.5 months rats were killed for histological examination. Obese rats were hyperglycemic following an oral glucose challenge (1 hour response greater than 11.1 mmol/l) (200 mg/dl), hyperinsulinemic, hypertriglyceridemic, and developed proteinuria and mild hypertension. Feeding sucrose, as compared to starch, further increased serum glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels and urinary protein excretion in obese rats and serum triglyceride levels in lean rats. An amelioration of glucose intolerance was observed in sucrose-fed obese rats by 6 months. In contrast to serum insulin levels, serum triglyceride levels increased with age in obese rats. Obese rats exhibited hypertrophy of the kidney and adrenal cortex with abnormal histology. The study demonstrates that obese female SHR/N-cp rats exhibit some of the metabolic and histopathological changes associated with NIDDM in humans and that feeding sucrose, as the source of dietary carbohydrate, further magnifies the expression of diabetes in this model.
