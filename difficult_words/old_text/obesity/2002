We investigated the therapeutic effect of marked body weight reduction on the predominantly obstructive sleep apnea syndrome by the application of an out-patient, behaviour therapy based body weight reduction program (Optifast-program) in 5 of our obese apnea patients. Mean body weight reduction was 32.7 +/- 15.8 kg after 6 months. The mean apnea-index of 34.5 +/- 23.1/h prior to the weight reduction dropped to 7.8 +/- 6.1/h after therapy. The mean apnea-hypopnea-index could be reduced from 45.7 +/- 25.9/h to 14.0 +/- 11.4/h. The best therapeutic effect on the sleep related respiratory parameters, was seen in patients who reached their normal weight. Our results shows that even severe, predominantly obstructive sleep apnea syndromes could be treated successfully with a marked body weight reduction.
