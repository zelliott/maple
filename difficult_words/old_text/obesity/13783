Macro-electrophoretic applications of the cellular neurotoxin ibotenic acid into the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) resulted in hyperphagia and obesity in male rats. Histological examination showed a reduction in the number of neuronal VMH cell bodies with glial proliferation without evidence of non-specific damage. This supports the hypothesis that hyperphagia and obesity after VMH lesions are related to destruction of neurons intrinsic to the VMH.
