To evaluate leptin levels in a sample of obese women with PCOS and compare the results with obese and non-obese control, to be ultimately correlated with BMI, and insulin sensitivity.

Leptin and insulin assays by immuno-radiometric method, glucose assay by enzymatic colorimetric method.

Leptin levels were significantly different between obese and non-obese subjects, and were significantly different between insulin resistant and non-insulin resistant obese PCOS, but were not significantly different between obese non-insulin resistant PCOS, and obese controls.

Body mass index and insulin resistance are the two main factors governing serum leptin levels.
