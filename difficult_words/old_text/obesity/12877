It seemed important to us to investigate sexuality during the post-menopausal and senile period to evaluate whether changes in sexual behaviour are related with endocrine-functional alterations brought on by menopause, or whether social-economic and environmental factors represent the principal cause. Thus 1,500 questionnaires were distributed to women aged from 50 to 87. Of the 1,500 questionnaires distributed, only 713 (47.53%) were returned completely filled-in. All women had been classified for age, civil status and life environment. Our statistic analysis does not seem to have singled out those factors that influence sexual activity in women of advanced age but shows only how age, indifferently from civil status and life environment, represents the most important factor. At the same age other factors, probably attached to psychological features and way of life and thus difficult to define and even less qualifiable, may be of influence, explaining a further percentage of control of those answers not explainable by age.
