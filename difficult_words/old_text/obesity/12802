There are several types of obesity, and the metabolic conditions associated with these phenotypes are also heterogeneous. Obesity of the male (android) type shows a dominant visceral and upper thoracic distribution of adipose tissue, whereas in the feminine (gynecoid) type adipose tissue is found predominantly in the lower part of the body (hips and thighs). Android obesity is clearly a cardiovascular risk factor, more so than gynecoid obesity. Hereditary factors contribute significantly to the occurrence of this pathology in families, although environmental factors play a role in its development. Android obesity is associated with metabolic anomalies which also characterize the syndrome X: resistance to insulin, arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia. The predisposition of individuals with android obesity to become diabetic rests in part on genetic and in part on environmental factors. Hyperinsulinemia and a high flux of free fatty acids act at the level of liver and endocrine pancreas to increase resistance to insulin and to decrease insulin secretion, two determining factors for type II diabetes. Other functional anomalies have been involved to explain android obesity such as dysregulation of adrenocortical and sexual steroids or a global derangement of stress mechanisms. No significant proof, however, seems to support either one of these hypotheses.
