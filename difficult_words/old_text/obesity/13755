The results of gastric banding for obesity were studied in 72 patients. The tension of the band around the stomach was successively decreased because of vomiting. The change resulted in less problems with vomiting and fewer reoperations, but also less weight loss. Statistically significant correlation was found between the Broca index before gastric banding and a year later. The superobese patients (greater than 100% overweight) had significant residual obesity when they reached stable body weight after about a year. Some metabolic changes were found postoperatively, e.g. improved results of liver function tests, reduced serum triglycerides, commonly sideropenia and occasionally hypokalemia.
