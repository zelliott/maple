This study explores the anti-obesity properties of a Sasa quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese C57BL/6 mice and mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. SQE administration with HFD for 70 d significantly decreased the body weight gain, adipose tissue weight, and serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in comparison with the HFD group. SQE administration also reduced the serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase, and the accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver, suggesting a protective effect against HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. SQE administration restored the HFD-induced decreases with phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in epididymal adipose tissue. SQE also induced AMPK phosphorylation in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results suggest that SQE exerted an anti-obesity effect on HFD-induced obese mice by activating AMPK in adipose tissue and reducing lipid droplet accumulation in the liver.
