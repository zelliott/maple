Methods are described for examining the ability of rats and human subjects to regulate the quantities of carbohydrate consumed when given a choice among two or more foods of varying composition. The ability does exist in both species, is independent of the sweetness of the test carbohydrate, and may be disturbed in obese or non-obese people alleging to be "carbohydrate cravers".
