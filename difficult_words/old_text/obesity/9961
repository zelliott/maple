The paper reports the results of a study on changes in the subcutaneous fat layer and the relations between the latter and BIA in a sample population of 105 normal weight and obese children of both sexes (57 males and 48 females), aged between 5 and 14. The correlation coefficients calculated show that BI is inversely correlated to all the subcutaneous fat layers examined; the closes correlations were found in cutaneous folds on the thigh and calf in males and on the forearm and calf in females. The correct use of impedance measurement in children must take into account the difference between the sexes and those linked to the degree of excess weight, as well as changes in the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer related to age.
