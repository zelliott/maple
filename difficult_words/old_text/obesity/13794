Sibutramine is a selective serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor approved for the long-term management of obesity. Its primary mechanism of action is increased satiety, although some evidence also suggests increased energy expenditure could play a role in sibutramine-induced weight loss. It has established general efficacy in long-term trials, with clinically-approved doses of 10 and 15 mg. Sibutramine has also been studied in a number of unique populations, including obese controlled hypertensives, diabetics and ethnic minorities, further establishing its effectiveness. However, it does have a consistent effect of increasing blood pressure and pulse. Thus, blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored in patients using sibutramine and it may not be applicable in obese patients with significant cardiovascular disease.
