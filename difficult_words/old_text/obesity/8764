To assess the effects of prescribing a low-energy diet to pregnant women who are either overweight, or who exhibited high weight gain earlier in gestation, on subsequent weight gain, pre-eclampsia, and the outcome of pregnancy.

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register was searched and researchers in the field were contacted.

All acceptably controlled comparisons of protein/energy restriction prescribed to pregnant women who meet one or both of the criteria listed above.

Data were extracted by the author from published reports, and supplemented by additional information from trialists contacted by the author.

Three studies involving 266 women were involved. Energy/protein restriction leads to a significant reduction in weekly maternal weight gain and in birth weight but has no clear effect on either pregnancy-induced hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Other outcomes, including fetal/infant mortality and other measures of maternal morbidity (eg Caesarean section) or long-term nutritional status, have not been reported.

Protein/energy restriction of pregnant women who are overweight or exhibit high weight gain is unlikely to be beneficial and may be harmful to the developing fetus.
