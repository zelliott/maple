Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by accumulation of visceral fat associated with the clustering of metabolic and pathophysiological cardiovascular risk factors: impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Although the definition of MetS is different among countries, visceral obesity is an indispensable component of MetS. A growing body of evidence suggests that increased oxidative stress to adipocytes is central to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in MetS. Increased oxidative stress to adipocytes causes dysregulated expression of inflammation-related adipocytokines in MetS, which contributes to obesity-associated vasculopathy and cardiovascular risk primarily through endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of present review is to unravel the mechanistic link between oxidative stress and cardiovascular risk in MetS, focusing on insulin resistance, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. Then, therapeutic opportunities translated from the bench to bedside will be provided to develop novel strategies to cardiovascular risk factors in MetS.
