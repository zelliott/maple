In Tunisia a growing extension of chronic diseases has resulted from the environmental and behavioral changes such as the adoption of new dietary habits, sedentarity habitat, stress of urbanization and work conditions. To illustrate this trend, we undertook a household epidemiologic survey of a representative sample of the adult urban population of Soussa (n = 957) to assess the main cardiovascular risk factors except the lipid profile distribution. This study showed a high prevalence of hypertension &> 160/95 mm Hg): 18.8% with an adjusted rate of 15.6%. History of diabetes 10.2%, obesity (BMI&> 30) 27.7% significantly higher in women (34.4%), android obesity 36%, smoking habits 21.5% significantly higher in men (61.4%). With this risk factor profile, Tunisia has to implement a national strategy of primary prevention and heart health promotion in addition to the efforts recently made in secondary prevention of some chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes.
