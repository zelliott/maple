Ad libitum access to food by use of a platter service is a new method for studying spontaneous food intake in obese human subjects. The effect of diethylpropion on energy intake was evaluated by the platter-service method in 2 overweight adult male subjects hospitalized on a metabolic unit for 41 days. This double-blind experiment was divided into 12 consecutive 3-day study periods during each of which the subjects received either 25 mg diethylpropion or a matching placebo before each meal. In this design protocol the 12 study periods provided 6 consecutive drug-placebo trials for each subject. To encourage ad libitum ingestion, food was served "family style" from large platters and pitchers at meals, and snacks were always available. Subjects were not aware that their intake was being monitored. On diethylpropion administration both subjects had an average decrease in energy intake of 11% and 15% (p less than 0.005). The platter service model, which provides a near-natural eating situation under systematic control, appears to be a useful and sensitive method for assessing effects of anorectic drugs on spontaneous food intake.
