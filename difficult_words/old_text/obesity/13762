To elucidate the relationship between endometrial carcinoma and the constitution, HLA antigen typing (A-locus, 13; B-locus, 20; C-locus, 6; DR-locus, 9) was investigated in 74 patients with endometrial carcinoma. A significant increase in two HLA antigens, Cw7 and DRw8, was demonstrated, but there was no intimate correlation between Cw7 or DRw8 and the three complications commonly associated with endometrial carcinoma--diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertensive disease. On the basis of these results, a new classification of endometrial carcinoma was proposed as follows: type A is positive Cw7 or DRw8 group; type B is negative for Cw7 and DRw8 and positive for the complications mentioned; type C is negative for Cw7 and DRw8, negative for the complications mentioned, and positive for DR 5; type D is a non-A, non-B, and non-C type.
