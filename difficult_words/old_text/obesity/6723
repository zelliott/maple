Vildagliptin is an oral inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4, an enzyme mainly responsible for inactivating incretins, and one of the widely used drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, effects of vildagliptin on retinal injury in diabetes remain unclear. We examined here whether oral administration of vildagliptin inhibited gene expression of inflammatory and thrombogenic parameters in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats (OLETF rats), an animal model of obese type 2 diabetes.

OLETF rats at 22 weeks of age were given vehicle or 3 mg/kg of vildagliptin for another 10 weeks. Gene expression was analyzed in quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

Vildagliptin significantly inhibited the increase in body weight and decreased average fasting blood glucose in the OLETF rats. Compared with 22-week-old OLETF rats, gene expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and pigment epithelium-derived factor were significantly increased in the retinas of OLETF rats at 32 weeks of age, all of which were inhibited by treatment with vildagliptin.

The present study demonstrated for the first time that vildagliptin inhibited inflammatory and thrombogenic reactions in the retinas of obese type 2 diabetic rats. Vildagliptin may play a protective role against diabetic retinopathy.
