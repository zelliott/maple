To compare the levels of the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and blood fat of the patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) before and after surgery, meanwhile to analyze the influence on blood glucose and blood fat after the changes of body mass index (BMI), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and lowest oxygen saturation (LSpO2).

Thirty-one patients with severe OSAHS were performed Z-palatoplasty (ZPP) or ZPP combined with genioglossus advancement with hyoid suspension (GAHM). Cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and FBG were detected before and after surgery.

Preoperative HDL was negatively related to BMI and AHI, but not LSpO2. After surgery the BMI, AHI, LSpO2, HDL and FBG were all improved. The change of HDL had correlation with the changes of BMI and AHI, and there was linear correlation with HDL and BMI (r= -0.36).

The surgery of ZPP and ZPP combined with GAHM can improve the AHI, LSpO2, BMI, the FBG and blood fat of the patients with OSAHS. Lose weight and rectifying sleep disordered breathing were important to improve glycolipid metabolism disorder of the patients with OSAHS.
