Epidemiological studies report a positive relationship between serum cystatin C and cardiovascular outcomes in adults. Here, we tested the relevance of cystatin C as a biomarker for early vascular alterations in severely obese children.

Two hundred nineteen obese (140 girls; age = 11.7 ± 2.7 years, BMI Z-score = 4.7 ± 1.2 SD) and 262 non-obese children (129 girls; age = 11.6 ± 0.6 years, body mass index [BMI] Z-score = 0.1 ± 1.0 SD). Serum cystatin C was measured by immunonephelometry. Intima media thickness (IMT), incremental elastic modulus, and flow-mediated and glyceryl-trinitrate-mediated dilations were determined at the common carotid artery and the brachial artery in obese children.

Obese children had significantly higher serum cystatin C than normal weight controls (0.86 ± 0.01 vs. 0.80 ± 0.01, P &<0.0001). In obese children, serum cystatin C correlates positively with BMI and the homeostasis model assessment index and negatively with the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and adiponectin. A positive relationship was found between serum cystatin C and carotid IMT (r = 0.23, P = 0.0005), which remained significant in multivariate models adjusted for BMI (P = 0.01) and adiponectin with a trend towards significance (P = 0.05).

This study positions cystatin C and adiponectin as covariables associated with arterial wall thickness in obese children. Although the underlying pathophysiology linking cystatin C to early vascular disease remains to be deciphered, cystatin C may represent a novel adipose tissue-derived biomarker implicated in obesity-related comorbidities early in life.
