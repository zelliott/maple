A retrospective survey was carried out in a group of 39 previously obese and hypertensive subjects to evaluate: the rate of blood pressure reductions achieved by dietary treatment, the smallest weight reduction accompanied by a significant decrease in blood pressure, and the mean weight reduction associated with normalization of pressure. Significant decrease in weight, systolic and diastolic pressures were observed after 15 days of treatment in 21 patients who had never assumed antihypertensive drugs and 9 who were on medication. Blood pressure normalization was achieved in 19 of the former with a weight reduction of 7.63 +/- 4.29% kg and in 7 of the latter after losing 8.63 +/- 2.20% kg; in 3 patients the medication was reduced and in 1 was withdrawn. In 4 patients weight but not pressure had decreased and in 5 neither did. Reduction, often normalization, of blood pressure can be obtained through relatively minor weight loss in most obese hypertensive patients.
