The microbial flora in the bypassed biliopancreatic intestinal segment was studied after obesity surgery. This procedure causes less diarrhea than jejunoileal bypass and appears to avoid extraintestinal complications. This report concerns type and quantity of bacteria colonizing the biliopancreatic segment and changes occurring after oral metronidazole treatment. Twelve specimens were aspirated in 10 patients via catheter inserted percutaneously during surgery. The specimens were plated immediately on selective and nonselective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Essentially equal numbers of aerobes and anaerobes were recovered from the biliopancreatic segment with average counts of 10(4) cfu/mL and median counts of 10(5) cfu/mL. Four patients had counts of 10(7) cfu/mL. The most common aerobes were E. coli, Klebsiella, Gram-positive cocci, and Candida; among anaerobes, Clostridium and the Bacteroides fragilis group were most common. In three patients treated with metronidazole because of diarrhea, anaerobes were eliminated and diarrhea cleared.
