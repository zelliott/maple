Previous investigations have demonstrated an association between impaired insulin sensitivity and elevated erythrocyte sodium-lithium countertransport (Na(+)-Li+ CT) activity. It has been speculated that insulin resistance and endogenous hyperinsulinemia are causally related to the development of elevated Na(+)-Li+ CT activity. To test this hypothesis, we measured insulin sensitivity (euglycemic insulin clamp technique) and Na(+)-Li+ CT activity in eight obese women before (weight = 102 +/- 5 kg) and after (weight = 88 +/- 5 kg; P &<.001) a 10 week weight reduction program. Maximal velocity of Na(+)-Li+ CT activity did not change (0.50 +/- 0.09 v 0.49 +/- 0.10 mmol/L red blood cells/h; P = NS) despite the significant improvement in insulin sensitivity (73 +/- 12 vs 110 +/- 7 mg/m2/min; P &<.0025) and reduction in fasting insulin levels (17 +/- 2 v 10 +/- 2 microU/mL; P &<.05) that accompanied weight loss. These results suggest that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are not linked pathophysiologically to the development of elevated Na(+)-Li+ CT activity.
