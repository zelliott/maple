To investigate the role of desnutrin in adipose tissue triacylglycerol (TAG) and fatty acid metabolism.

We generated transgenic mice overexpressing desnutrin (also called adipose triglyceride lipase [ATGL]) in adipocytes (aP2-desnutrin) and also performed adenoviral-mediated overexpression of desnutrin in 3T3-L1CARDelta1 adipocytes.

aP2-desnutrin mice were leaner with decreased adipose tissue TAG content and smaller adipocyte size. Overexpression of desnutrin increased lipolysis but did not result in increased serum nonesterified fatty acid levels or ectopic TAG storage. We found increased cycling between diacylglycerol (DAG) and TAG and increased fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes from these mice, as well as improved insulin sensitivity.

We show that by increasing lipolysis, desnutrin overexpression causes reduced adipocyte TAG content and attenuation of diet-induced obesity. Desnutrin-mediated lipolysis promotes fatty acid oxidation and re-esterification within adipocytes.
