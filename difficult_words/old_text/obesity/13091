Macrophage-mediated renal injury has been implicated in progressive forms of glomerulonephritis; however, a role for macrophages in type 2 diabetic nephropathy, the major cause of end-stage renal failure, has not been established. Therefore, we examined whether macrophages may promote the progression of type 2 diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice.

The incidence of renal injury was examined in db/db mice with varying blood sugar and lipid levels at 8 months of age. The association of renal injury with the accumulation of kidney macrophages was analyzed in normal db/+ and diabetic db/db mice at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months of age.

In db/db mice, albuminuria and increased plasma creatinine correlated with elevated blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels but not with obesity or hyperlipidemia. Progressive diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice was associated with increased kidney macrophages. Macrophage accumulation and macrophage activation in db/db mice correlated with hyperglycemia, HbA1c levels, albuminuria, elevated plasma creatinine, glomerular and tubular damage, renal fibrosis, and kidney expression of macrophage chemokines [monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), osteopontin, migration inhibitory factor (MIF), monocyte-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)]. The accrual and activation of glomerular macrophages also correlated with increased glomerular IgG and C3 deposition, which was itself dependent on hyperglycemia.

Kidney macrophage accumulation is associated with the progression of type 2 diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice. Macrophage accumulation and activation in diabetic db/db kidneys is associated with prolonged hyperglycemia, glomerular immune complex deposition, and increased kidney chemokine production, and raises the possibility of specific therapies for targeting macrophage-mediated injury in diabetic nephropathy.
