This study evaluated the possibility that intestinal bypass surgery alters energy balance and regulation of body weight. In two sets of experiments, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent bypass or sham bypass surgery. In experiment 1, half of each group was overfed and half was underfed. Bypass reduced net calorie intake (intake - fecal loss) at 2 wk but not at 6 wk. Body weights were maintained at a much lower level in the bypass rats, yet apparent energy expenditure was greater. In experiment 2, bypass rats were compared with sham bypass and sham bypass who were food restricted for paired-weight-loss to bypass (PWL sham). Net calorie intake and body weights of bypass and sham bypass followed a similar pattern as in experiment 1. At similar levels of body weight postoperatively, bypass rats required more calories per kilogram than did the PWL shams, suggesting that bypass resets downward the level at which body weight is regulated. Calorie requirements correlated with food intake better than with absolute body weight. Further studies to determine the mechanism of altered energy expenditure may provide methods for weight loss without extensive surgery.
