Renal vein thrombosis caused the nephrotic syndrome in a patient with morbid obesity. Pulmonary embolism occurred initially, but not after anticoagulants were administered. Surviving for three years, the patient died of profound uremia and hyperosmolar coma. At autopsy, membranous glomerular changes were found. Conclusive exclusion of renal vein thrombosis in the morbidly obese patient with nephrotic syndrome appears advisable.
