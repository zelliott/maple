In order to assess overweight in urban schoolchildren (298 boys and 298 girls) aged 9-16 years in Dalian, China, their body height, weight, skinfolds at triceps, biceps, subscapular and suprailiac, and body circumferences of mid-upper arm, waist and hip were measured. The results showed that the prevalence of overweight, based on the United States Centers for Disease Control 2000 reference values using body mass index (BMI), was 22.9% in boys and 10.4% in girls, which was higher than that of indicated in Chinese national surveys of recent decades. More boys were overweight than girls due to excessive increase in body fat, although the prevalence of overweight in girls prevalence increased from 13 years. Discussion here focuses on the effects of behavioral patterns on overweight in Dalian schoolchildren, paying attention to gender difference.
