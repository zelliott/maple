Many possibilities are discussed to influence abnormal eating behavior by methods of behavior modification by learning principles. Amongst the usually employed procedures of operant conditioning, of self-control, of aversive stimuli and behavior modification by contract as new methods are used: learning by models and self-determination (giving marks as in school) of eating behavior. The proceedings are illustrated by 5 own cases (children between 9 and 13 years old). Success for longer periods was only obtained in 3 cases where a self-control program was practised.
