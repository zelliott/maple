Adipose tissue and muscle lipoprotein lipase and postheparin hepatic and lipoprotein lipase activities have been measured in a group of 21 Pima Indian males over a wide range of body weight to determine the relationship between obesity and these lipase activities. There was a significant positive correlation between adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase and obesity; muscle and postheparin lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase were not related to degree of obesity. Fasting insulin levels were not related to any of the measurements of lipase activity. There were racial differences in adipose and postheparin lipoprotein lipase activities; both were significantly lower in the Pimas as compared with a group of weight-matched Caucasian males. Lipase activities were remeasured in eight subjects after a period of weight reduction including several weeks of stabilization at the reduced weights. After the period of weight reduction adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase declined in all subjects. Hepatic lipase also declined in all but two patients. Muscle and postheparin lipolytic activities were not affected by weight loss. The data indicate that (a) there are racial differences in adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase; and (b) the elevated adipose lipoprotein lipase associated with obesity, like many other biochemical variables in the obese state, returns toward normal after weight reduction.
