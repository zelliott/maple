The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of polyphenol-rich adzuki bean extract on lipid metabolism, triglyceride accumulation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in vivo and in vitro.

For the in vivo study, rats were divided into four groups: group C was fed a control diet, group A was fed the control diet with 1% adzuki bean extract, group CF was fed a high fat diet, and group AF was fed a high fat diet with 1% adzuki bean extract. For the in vitro study, the ability of adzuki bean extract to suppress triglyceride incorporation, glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase activity and inflammatory response was investigated in cultured human adipocytes. Data from the animal study showed that adzuki bean extract improved lipid metabolism in both the normal and high-fat diet groups. Adzuki bean extract treatment in the high-fat group resulted in significant reductions in total hepatic lipid accumulation and lipid secretion into the feces. Incubation of adipocytes with adzuki bean extract significantly decreased triglyceride accumulation, glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase activity and inflammatory responses without affecting cell viability.

The results of this study demonstrate that adzuki bean extract has high potential to serve as a natural anti-obesity agent.
