We aimed at observing the association of a common genetic variant near the INSIG2 gene (rs7655505) with body mass index (BMI) related obesity in a population-based association study in Uyghur population. We observed a significant association of rs7566605 polymorphism with BMI related obesity in Uyghurs with an odds ratio of 1.47 (95% CI 1.11-1.95, P=0.006) under a dominant model (CC+GC versus GG). The mean BMI of rs7566605 CC+GC was 0.59kg/m(2) higher than for GG genotype (P=0.024), regardless of sex and age.
