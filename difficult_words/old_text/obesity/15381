Circulating non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) have been causally associated with impairment of glucose metabolism, although their effect on the entero-insular axis, either in obesity or health, is unknown.

Glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36 amide) (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) responses to 100 g of carbohydrate in 400 mL water were evaluated during simultaneous modulation of circulating non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). A total of 10,000 units of heparin (to increase serum NEFAs) and 500 mg of acipimox (2 h before oral carbohydrate ingestion to reduce serum NEFAs) were administered to seven obese [mean +/- SEM: age 40 +/- 3.7 years; body mass index (BMI) 38.9 +/- 2.1 kg m-2] and seven lean (age 39.6 +/- 3.6 years; BMI 22.4 +/- 0.4 kg m-2) women.

Higher fasting levels and post-heparin total integrated NEFAs (P &<0.05) and glycerol (P &<0.05) responses were seen in the obese than in the lean group. Incremental integrated GLP-1 responses to oral carbohydrate post-heparin in lean (P &<0.01) and obese (P &<0.05) subjects were significantly lower than after acipimox. Total integrated GIP (P &<0.05) and glucose (P &<0.01) responses were higher post heparin than after acipimox in obese subjects only.

The inverse relationship in GIP and GLP-1 responses in the obese group after modulation of NEFAs indicates that reciprocal changes between these two hormones may exist to ensure constancy of B-cell stimulation. Our results suggest that in obese subjects compensatory secretion of GIP was incomplete and could not prevent impairment in glucose tolerance after heparin-induced rise in NEFAs. These results may be important in understanding the role of the insulinotropic hormones in carbohydrate metabolism characterized by high NEFA levels such as obesity and diabetes mellitus.
