A model for assessing the economic benefits of nutrition counseling services to ambulatory populations is discussed in the context of atherosclerosis. Possible methods for detecting and quantifying the impact of nutrition intervention on atherosclerosis-related risk factors are reviewed. Clinical records in a hospital-sponsored health center were explored to see what problems might be involved in using retrospective data for evaluation. Early impressions of risk-factor improvement after nutrition intervention should encourage the needed rigorous studies to document and quantify this probable effect.
