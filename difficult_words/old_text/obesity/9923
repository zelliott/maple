Anthropometric measurements descriptive of obesity, body fat distribution and body build were made in 186 males undergoing diagnostic coronary arteriography. Using stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, two indices of body fat distribution were independently associated with coronary disease, while the widely used indices of obesity, namely body mass index and percentage body fat, were not. A significant association with disease was found for the ratio of waist to thigh circumferences (waist/thigh ratio), which emerged in the first step of the multivariate model (p &<0.005). The ratio of waist to hip circumferences (waist/hip ratio), a widely used index of body fat distribution, was found to have a negative association with disease (p &<0.05). This study suggests that use of body fat distribution indices may assist in the assessment of the risk factor profile of cardiac patients.
