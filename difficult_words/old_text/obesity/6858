We reviewed emerging evidence linking serum levels and adipose tissue expression of leptin and adiponectin in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Previous data obtained by our group from a sample of overweight/obese PCOS women and a control sample of normal weight controls, both stratified by BMI, were reanalyzed. Circulating levels of leptin and adiponectin were determined by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Adipose tissue total RNA was reserve-transcripted into complementary DNA samples, which were used as templates for quantitative real-time PCR amplification. Positive correlations were found between serum and mRNA levels for both leptin (r = 0.321; P = 0.005) and adiponectin (r = 0.266; P = 0.024). Determination of leptin and adiponectin serum levels could serve as an indirect method to assess adipocyte production, since leptin and adiponectin are predominantly produced by subcutaneous adipocytes in women.
