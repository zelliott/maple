To observe the therapeutic effects of Yiqi Sanju Formula (YQSJF), a compound Chinese herbal medicine, on central obese men at high risk of metabolic syndrome (MS).

Compared with 30 healthy male volunteers, 45 central obese men were separated randomly into two groups and received the interventions with YQSJF and placebo respectively for 10 weeks. Baseline characteristics, insulin resistance, inflammation cytokines and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) were evaluated before and after treatment.

The score of homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the levels of C reactive protein (CRP), free fatty acid (FFA) and PAI-1 in obese men were higher than those in the control group, while t-PA was lower. After treatment, compared with placebo group, body mass index, waist, and waist-to-hip ratio were decreased significantly in subjects who received YQSJF (P&<.01). The score of HOMA-IR and the levels of CRP, FFA and PAI-1 were decreased significantly, and the level of t-PA was increased significantly (P&<.01).

YQSJF can reduce obesity and insulin resistance in central obese men at high risk of MS and improve inflammation and fibrinolysis, which indicates that it can reduce the risk of atherosclerosis.
