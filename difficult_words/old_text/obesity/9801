Post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is central to many biological functions. Aberrant gene expression patterns underlie many metabolic diseases that represent major public health concerns and formidable therapeutic challenges. Several studies have established a number of post-transcriptional regulators implicated in metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. In addition, emerging knowledge of metabolically active and insulin-sensitive organs, such as the pancreas, liver, muscle and adipose compartment, is rapidly expanding the panel of potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Here, we review our current understanding of miRNAs and RBPs that affect glucose and lipid homeostasis, and their roles in normal physiology and metabolic disorders, especially type 2 diabetes and obesity.
