The anthropometric standards used for estimating the prevalence of overweight among Hispanic groups are generally developed in other populations. Our purpose was to identify appropriate anthropometric indicators and cutoff points for Hispanic women. Data from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey HHANES (1982-1984) included 1,784 Mexican American, 479 Cuban American, and 750 Puerto Rico women aged 25 to 74 years. The body mass indexes examined were weight/standing height1.5, weight/standing height2, weight/sitting height1.5, and weight/sitting height2. Appropriateness was based on correlation of the index with triceps and subscapular skinfold measurements and lack of association with standing or sitting height. The most appropriate indicator was weight/standing height2. To estimate overweight, the 85th percentiles for weight/standing height2 were obtained from the 20- to 29-year-olds in HHANES and the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II). For 10-year age intervals, the differences in proportions of women above those cutoff points were compared with a modified t test. The mean estimated prevalences of overweight were significantly higher with the NHANES II standard compared with the HHANES cutoff points (P &<.05) for Mexican American women (43% vs 29%) and Puerto Rican women (40% vs 28%). They were slightly lower for the Cuban American women (36% vs 39%). Cutoff points are relative, not absolute, standards that must have biologic meaning. Before our results are used for assessing populations, the cutoff points should be tested for predictive validity with chronic disease rates.
