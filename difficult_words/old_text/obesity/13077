To determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among hypertensive patients using the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III in a primary care health center in Kuwait.

A population of 250 Kuwaiti hypertensive patients (129 males and 121 females) over the age of 40 were screened for metabolic syndrome by determining body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, levels of fasting plasma glucose and fasting plasma lipids (serum triglycerides, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). The study was carried out in the Mishref Family Practice Health Center, Kuwait, from January to July 2001.

The total number of patients who met the criteria for metabolic syndrome was 85 (34%), 55% of them were males and 45% females. Prevalence of the syndrome was 28.2% among 40- to 55-year-olds and 41.9% in those above the age of 55 years. Among the 250 hypertensive patients, type II diabetes mellitus was found in 52.8% (54% males and 46% females), impaired fasting glucose in 8% (70% males and 30% females), high plasma triglycerides in 44.8% (53% males and 47% females) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in 63.2% (54% males and 46% females). Obesity measured as BMI = 30 kg/m(2) was noted in 46% (43% males and 57% females) and increased waist circumference in 58% (44% males and 56% females).

The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is high among hypertensives attending primary health care centers in Kuwait.
