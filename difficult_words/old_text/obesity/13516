Cardiovascular diseases are associated with risks factors such as obesity and dyslipaemia, which if present during infancy could continue throughout adult life.

To investigate the prevalence of overweight and study lipid profiles. To relate body mass index (BMI) with the studied parameters.

Descriptive and observational study of 1,043 children and adolescents, stratified into three age groups. Taking into account their BMI, they were classified as within normal weight, overweight and obese. Total cholesterol (T-chol), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-chol) and triglycerides (TG) were determined and LDL-chol and non HDL-chol were calculated.

BMI: Among the total population, the percentage overweight was 13.9 % and obesity was 5.4 %, with a higher prevalence between 10 and 14 years and also between 5 and 9 years. BMI means were correlated with age in females and males, being higher for females at all ages. Lipid profile (classified according National Cholesterol Education Program): values of cholesterol in potential risk situations were found in 30 % of the population, 16 % for triglycerides, 28 % for LDL-cholesterol and 17 % for non-HDL cholesterol, the risk values being 3 %, 2 %, 4 % and 3 % respectively. Significant differences were observed in lipid values in the total population, overweight and obesity.

A high prevalence of overweight was observed, as well as a correlation between body mass index and dyslipaemia. This emphasises the need for prevention of overweight and dyslipaemias from an early age.
