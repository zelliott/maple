Obesity is a major public health problem worldwide. Little is known about the prevalence and impact of headache disorders in obese patients. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of primary headaches in obese patients and controls.

Seventy-four consecutive obese patients from the obesity surgery service were studied, and compared to controls with body mass index less than 25.

Fifty-six patients (75%) had a headache diagnosis, 49 migraine (66%), 7 tension-type headache (9%), 36 (48%) had incapacitating headaches.

Primary headaches are more common and incapacitating in obese patients than controls, migraine is the most important diagnosis in this population. Headaches should be properly diagnosed and treated in obese patients.
