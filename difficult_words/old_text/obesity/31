A study of 379 males selected at random from a population of 40- to 59-years-old male residents of the Lenin district in Nalchik and 320 rural Kabardino-Balkarian male residents of the same age demonstrated that the prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) among 40- to 59-years-old males in Nalchik (10.0%) as determined by epidemiologic ECG assessment criteria was similar to that of Moscow (9.6%) and significantly higher than that of rural Kabardino-Balkaria (6.2%, p less than 0.01). A higher prevalence of CHD in male residents of Nalchik is associated with a higher incidence of major CHD risk factors (arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, excessive body weight) as compared to rural Kabardino-Balkarian population.
