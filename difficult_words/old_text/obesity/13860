This study compares how income is related to obesity vs two obesity-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors-diabetes and hypertension-in adults from Jamaica.

A cross-sectional population-based survey was used. In total, 847 men and 1249 women aged 25-74 y were randomly recruited from a periurban area in 1993-1998.

Trained interviewers measured anthropometry and blood pressure, obtained fasting blood and collected self-reported data on income and disease history.

Income was strongly and positively associated with obesity in men. In women, obesity levels were high even among the very poor, and the income gradient was more moderate. Although obesity-and particularly central fatness-was strongly associated with diabetes and hypertension prevalence, income was not significantly related to these disorders.

Future research in developing countries should independently explore associations between income and obesity vs obesity-related disorders, and identify factors that explain any disparities.
