Epigastric hernia, apparently minor injury, neglected can reach impressive sizes, with major un-esthetic effect. In an unfavorable clinically context (morbid obesity, chronic respiratory failure, ground cancer, diabetes, heart failure) complications occur (incarceration, strangulation) with a complex picture. We present three clinical observations, including a low occlusion by fixed transverse colon necrosis in a strangulated epigastric hernia with pyo-stercoral phlegmon.
