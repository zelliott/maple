It is widely held that obesity may be due to alterations in the total caloric intake, the distribution of nutrient intake and the number of meals; widely spaced out meals of large proportions may be associated with metabolic dysfunctions. An observational study was performed in a random sample (80 males and 183 females) of moderately obese adults (IMC&> 30 and &<40) attending the dietary unit of our hospital to evaluate spontaneous breakfast eating habits (understood as caloric contribution&> 10% of daily caloric intake) in relation to: working activity, region of origin, possible influence on daily intake of energy and nutrients and on common clinical and anthropometric variables (arterial pressure, glycemia, cholesterolemia, triglyceridemia, IMC, WHR). Following the subdivision of patients into breakfast eaters (SC = 26 males, 52 females) and non-breakfast eaters (NC = 54 males and 131 females), no significant differences emerged between sexes with regard to region of origin, working activity, IMC, WHR, total kcal, distribution of nutrients, glycemia, cholesterolemia, triglyceridemia, arterial pressure. The only significant difference between SC and NC concerns alcohol consumption which was inversely correlated to breakfast eating in both males and females (males: r = -0.225, p &<0.05; females: r = -0.157, p &<0.05). No significant differences appear between wine consumers (SE = 29) and abstemious males (NE = 51), except for daily caloric consumption (kcal/die), triglycerides and arterial pressure, which were higher in SE (p &<0.05, p &<0.01, p &<0.05 respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
