The postoperative period after small intestine bypass operations could be subdivided into five. Analysis of the rate of weight loss during the period of constant weight loss (period II) in 80 subjects gave a mean rate of 0.011 weight-index units (Broca) per week (range 0.023-0.003) or 0.79 kg per week (range 1.81-0.22). After both end-to-end and end-to-side jejuno-ileostomy the rate of weight loss during period II was correlated to initial body weight. After end-to-end jejuno-ileostomy the rate of weight loss was also correlated to the length of the distal eleum in function, either as absolute value or as a fraction of the total small intestinal length. The absence of these correlations after end-to-side jejuno-ileostomy might be due to a more variable reflux in to the bline loop after this operation. It is suggested that a small intestinal bypass operation should not be performed as a standardized procedure with predetermined segments of the small intestine in function, but rather as an operation designed for each patient.
