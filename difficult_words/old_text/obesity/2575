The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs), and their control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at primary care settings from the North Catalonia Diabetes Study (NCDS).

In this multicentre cross-sectional descriptive study, data were collected from a random sample of 307 patients with T2DM. The prevalence of CVD, CVRF, metabolic syndrome (MS), coronary heart disease (CHD) risk at 10 years (Framingham Point Scores), and CVRF control was evaluated. MS and lipid profiles were established according to Adult Treatment Panel III criteria.

CVD prevalence was 22.0% (CHD: 18.9% and peripheral ischemia: 4.5%) and more frequent in men. The prevalence of selected CVRF was: hypertension: 74.5%; dyslipidemia: 77.7%; smoking: 14.9%; obesity 44.9%, and familial CVD: 38.4%. Three or more CVRFs, including T2DM, were observed in 91.3%. MS prevalence was 68.7%. Framingham score was 10.0%, higher in men than in women. CVD prevalence was related to: age, number of CVRFs, duration of diabetes, familial history of CVD, waist circumference, hypertension, lipid profile, kidney disease, and Framingham score, but not to MS by itself. Correct lipid profiles and blood pressure were only observed in 18.9% and 24.0%, respectively, whereas platelet aggregation inhibitors were only recorded in 16.1% of the patient cohort. MS presence was not an independent risk factor of CVD in our study.

The high prevalence of CVD and an inadequate control of CVRF, which were apparent in the NCDS population, would suggest that advanced practice nurses should consider incorporating specific cardiovascular assessment in their routine care of persons with T2DM.
