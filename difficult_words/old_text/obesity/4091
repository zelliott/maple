It included a random sample of 1046 boys and girls aged 12 years attending both public and private schools. The sample size was calculated using a 95% confidence interval level; a statistical significance of 5%; and an odds ratio of 1.55. The sample selection was carried out in two stages: first, schools were selected by simple sampling, and then children were chosen using a proportionality coefficient. Data were collected through clinical examinations and interviews, after examiner calibration. Dental trauma was classified according to ANDREASEN; ANDREASEN criteria. Obesity was considered according to National Center of Health Statistics - NCHS (USA) procedures for the assessment of nutritional status.
