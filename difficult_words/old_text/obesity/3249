We examined the influence of genetic variation of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter G8 on apolipoprotein B (apoB) kinetics in overweight/obese men.

Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apoB kinetics were determined in 47 men (body mass index 32+/-3 kg/m2) using stable isotope and multicompartmental modeling to estimate production rate (PR), fractional catabolic rate (FCR), and VLDL to LDL-apoB conversion. Relative to the wild-type (400TT), subjects carrying the ABCG8 400K allele had significantly decreased plasma concentrations of triglycerides, sitosterol, and campesterol, lower PR of VLDL-apoB, and higher VLDL to LDL-apoB conversion (P&<.05). The PR and FCR of LDL-apoB were also significantly higher with 400K allele (P&<.05). No association was found with ABCG8 D19H. Compared with APOE2 or APOE3, APOE4 carriers had significantly higher plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations and lower LDL-apoB FCR. During multiple regression analysis including age, homeostasis model assessment score, plasma concentrations of sitosterol, and lathosterol, ABCG8 and apoE genotypes were independent determinants of VLDL-apoB PR and LDL-apoB FCR, respectively (P&<.05).

Variation in the ABC transporter G8 appears to independently influence the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins in overweight/obese subjects. This may have therapeutic implications for the management of dyslipidemia in these subjects.
