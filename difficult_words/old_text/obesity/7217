This issue of the American Psychologist (April 2007) includes two reviews of the literature on the effects of behavioral programs to reduce body weight. One review (T. Mann et al., 2007) concentrates on dietary interventions and finds little evidence that diets are of benefit. The second review (L. H. Powell, J. E. Calvin III, & J. E. Calvin Jr., 2007) concentrates on multicomponent interventions and reports some significant achievements of behavioral interventions. Although the reviews come to different conclusions about the value of supporting weight loss interventions, there appears to be agreement that diet alone results in little or no long-term benefit. Evidence-based multicomponent behavioral interventions or interventions that combine behavioral with medical or surgical treatments may offer better chances of long-term weight control. Evidence-based studies are needed to inform policy on provider reimbursement for weight loss programs.
