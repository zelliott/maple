Childhood obesity is a common health problem facing U.S. children with an increasing prevalence particularly in certain populations. Recognizing obesity in children is a clinical determination with specific measures that can indicate potential future associated health problems, but parental perception of overweight and/or obesity is influenced by other conditions. This primer offers a brief synopsis of parental influence in the etiology of early childhood obesity beginning with parameters of obesity and how it is operationalized through measurement. The importance of parental perceptions of their children relative to obesity and eating are discussed, and how parents influence the development of childhood eating behaviors or physical activity are considered.
