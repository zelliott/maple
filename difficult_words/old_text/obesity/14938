The present study investigates consumer responses to New York City's 2008 calorie labeling regulation in 2 lower-income neighborhoods of New York City.

Focus groups were conducted, and 34 fast-food consumers participated. Group summaries and descriptive and analytic depictions of group responses and interactions were developed based on a thorough examination of the notes and tapes.

Findings included that there is support for the regulation, as well as skepticism regarding the potency of calorie posting as a behavior change tool. In addition, there were strong beliefs about both parental responsibility for children's eating habits as well as the role of poverty, hunger, and lack of education in food selection.

Calorie labeling is one avenue for educating consumers about nutrition; however, given competing factors in food choice decisions as well as the realities of hunger and poverty, more proactive measures are needed.
