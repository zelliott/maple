24-h urinary C-peptide excretion was studied in 119 women with gestational diabetes before and after treatment with diet or diet and insulin. The 24-h urinary C-peptide excretion in normal-weight gestational diabetic women at diagnosis was also compared to that of a healthy reference group. There was a wide variation in urinary C-peptide values which tended to be higher in normal-weight women with gestational diabetes at diagnosis compared to the reference group, but it did not reach statistical significance. Post partum gestational diabetic women had significantly higher urinary C-peptide excretion (p less than 0.002) than the reference group, indicating insulin resistance in women with gestational diabetes at this time. In 29 overweight women with gestational diabetes 24-h urinary C-peptide excretion did not significantly differ from that in normal-weight women with gestational diabetes. In 32 women with a more marked deviation in glucose tolerance (area greater than or equal to 46 mmol/l) 24-h urinary C-peptide values were significantly (p less than 0.05) higher than in 58 women with gestational diabetes with an area between 42 and 45.9 mmol/l. Both treatment alternatives, diet and diet plus insulin, significantly reduced postprandial blood glucose values (p less than 0.05) and urinary C-peptide excretion was significantly decreased (p less than 0.05).
