Using three-dimensional (3D) scanning data along with other existing subject's medical profiles to search for better anthropometric markers in association with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM).

In this cross-sectional study with 6007 subjects undergoing health examination in a period of 3 years, the authors adopted data from 3D scanning with hundreds of body measures and conducted factor analysis to search for practical indicators better associated with type 2 DM. A multiple logistic regression model was used to analyze strength of association between indicators and presence of type 2 DM.

The trunk component derived from factor analysis was positively associated with type 2 DM, regardless of obesity status. However, lower limbs component was found to be negatively associated with type 2 DM in the same stratifications. Waist was thus found as the strongest indicator among practical measures of trunk component. The strength of association between thigh and type 2 DM was found to be the highest among practical measures of lower limbs component. A marker from taking the ratio of waist to thigh (WTR) was derived from the approach which was found to be the best indicator for association with type 2 DM while comparing to body-mass index, waist circumference, or waist-hip ratio.

This study offers a low-cost, noninvasive practical marker that is better associated with the presence of type 2 DM. WTR, with further study, may be used in clinical practice, epidemiological study, and preventive medicine in the future.
