Leptin is likely to be involved in the homeostasis of body weight. Insulin is suggested to regulate both short-term and long-term circulating leptin levels. The present study aims to assess the relation between insulin and leptin levels in obese humans.

Some 53 obese subjects (body mass index 35.1 +/- 3.9 kg m-2 (mean +/- SD)) were prescribed a hypocaloric diet and randomized to either a placebo or the intestinal lipase inhibitor orlistat for 2 years. Serum leptin and insulin levels were determined repeatedly during these 2 years (5 times in the fasting condition and twice after an oral glucose load).

Leptin concentrations appeared to be regulated at a specific level for each individual throughout the weight-loss period. The BMI explained 39.7% of the total variance in leptin levels, the body-fat distribution 17.2%, individual characteristics 30.3%; and the fasting serum insulin concentration 1.0%. After a mean weight loss of 7.7 +/- 4.9 kg, the time-integrated insulin response to an oral glucose load was significantly lower but the leptin response remained unchanged.

The BMI is the main determinant of the circulating leptin concentration in obese humans. Individual characteristics seem to determine the leptin level, given the BMI. In a short-term observational study in obese humans, changes of insulin levels do not appear to be correlated to changes in leptin levels.
