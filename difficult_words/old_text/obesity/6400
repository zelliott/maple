To study cardiovascular function at rest and during exercise by spectral analysis of heart rhythm in patients with spinal osteochondrosis and cardialgia, in patients with excessive body weight, and with cardial type neurocirculatory dystonia (NCD).

A total of 223 patients were examined. Spinal osteochondrosis with cardialgia was diagnosed in 80, excessive body weight in 78, and cardial type NCD in 65. Heart rhythm wave structure was evaluated using VKK-12 Ergometer complex before and after bicycle ergometry.

Submaximal exercise did not induce changes in the heart rhythm wave structure of normal subjects. In cardial type NCD the intensity of first order slow waves increased during the recovery period, while in patients with spinal osteochondrosis and cardialgia and in those with excessive body weight, heart rhythm centralization index increased.
