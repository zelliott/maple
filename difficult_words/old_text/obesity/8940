To describe racial/ethnic differences by gender in body mass index (BMI), to examine the relationship between existence of current morbidity and BMI, and to assess racial/ethnic disparities in attitudes and perceptions toward obesity.

Cross-sectional random-digit telephone survey of a representative sample of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults aged&> or =18 years in 2005 (N = 1,000, 62% response rate and 82% cooperation rate).

The prevalence of overweight or obesity in 2005 among U.S. adults was 63%. Racial disparities in obesity were observed among women, not among men. The mean BMI of non-Hispanic black women was 29.8, significantly (P &<0.01) higher than that of non-Hispanic white women (26.7). Eighteen percent of the respondents reported having serious morbidities, with 8.5% reporting diabetes. A dose-response relationship was observed between BMI groups and existence of morbid conditions. Twenty-seven percent of obese respondents (BMI&> or = 30) and 55% of extremely obese respondents (BMI&> or = 40) reported such conditions. Race (blacks versus whites) was not a significant predictor for any of the six different attitudes and perceptions toward obesity in fully adjusted logistic models.

There is no evidence of plateau or decrease in the prevalence of overweight or obesity and diabetes among U.S. adults. Racial disparities between blacks and whites persist among women. A modification of attitudes and perceptions might not have significant effects on people's behavior that can influence the prevalence of overweight and obesity.
