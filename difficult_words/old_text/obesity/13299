To assess the postprandial glucose-lowering effect of the human amylin analog pramlintide when given with insulin lispro in subjects with type 2 diabetes, with an emphasis on the optimal dose timing relative to meals.

In this randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, five-way crossover study, 19 subjects with type 2 diabetes using insulin lispro underwent five consecutive mixed-meal tests. In randomized order, subjects received subcutaneous injections of placebo at -15 min or 120-microg pramlintide at -15, 0, +15, or +30 min relative to the standardized breakfast after an overnight fast. Insulin lispro was injected at 0 min at doses that were adjusted appropriately for both the content of the standardized meal and the anticipated effects of pramlintide. Plasma glucose concentrations were measured before and during the 4-h postmeal period.

When injected at 0 min, pramlintide reduced the postprandial glucose excursion by 81% compared to insulin lispro + placebo (incremental AUC(0-4 h) (mean +/- SE) 2.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 10.4 +/- 2.2 mmol/h/L, P&<.05). When pramlintide was injected at -15, +15, and +30 min, the postprandial incremental glucose AUC(0-4 h) was also significantly reduced (P&<.05), but to a lesser extent (42 to 73%). Pramlintide treatment was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported.

Administration of pramlintide either at or just prior to a meal caused a greater reduction in postprandial glucose than either administration of placebo or postmeal pramlintide injections in subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with a rapid-acting insulin analog, insulin lispro.
