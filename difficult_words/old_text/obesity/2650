Normal standing body height, body weight, and body mass index were measured in 256 patients with severe lumbar disk herniation who underwent surgery and compared with those of matched controls with mild lumbar disk herniation who showed improvement of symptoms after conservative treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired sample t test and analysis of covariance test. Body weight and body mass index were significantly higher in women with severe lumbar disk herniation than in those with mild lumbar disk herniation (p=0.01 and p=0.01, respectively), but not in men. Standing body height showed no significant difference between patients with severe and mild lumbar disk herniations in both sex groups. Differences in body weight and body mass index may be key factors distinguishing the development of severe lumbar disk herniation from that of mild lumbar disk herniation in women.
