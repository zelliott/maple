There is emerging evidence that exercise by itself exerts clinically beneficial effects in both lean and obese subjects, even in the absence of effects on weight.1 Recent results have brought an increasing understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise at the level of metabolism and changes in gene expression. There is a significant dose-response to the effect of exercise, and the current guidelines regarding exercise amount may need to be revised upwards. Furthermore, this treatment option should not be overlooked.
