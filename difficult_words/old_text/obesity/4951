This study was designed to investigate a new dietary fiber, alpha-cyclodextrin, marketed under the trade name FBCx (Wacker Biochem, Adrian, MI), for beneficial effects on weight reduction and the improvement of certain blood parameters in rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups and fed ad libitum for a period of 6 weeks: (1) a normal low-fat diet (LF; 4% fat wt/wt); (2) an LF diet with FBCx added; (3) a high-fat diet (HF, 40% fat wt/wt); and (4) an HF diet with FBCx. The FBCx was added at the rate of 10% (wt/wt) of the fat in the diet. Body weight and food intake were recorded 3 times per week. Plasma constituent levels and liver and fecal lipid contents, as well as body composition were determined at sacrifice. Adding FBCx to the diet significantly reduced weight gain in rats fed with an HF diet relative to rats fed with the HF control diet (P &<.05). FBCx also elicited a reduction in plasma triglyceride levels of 30%, total cholesterol of 9%, and increased the fat content of the feces in the rats fed with the HF diet with FBCx. In addition, the serum leptin levels were normalized, and the calculated insulin sensitivity was improved. No adverse effects were observed in the rats consuming FBCx. It would appear that FBCx might be effective in reducing body weight gain and improving metabolic syndrome.
