We tested the effects of acute perturbations of elevated fatty acids (FA) on insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes. Twenty-one type 2 diabetes subjects with hypertriglyceridemia (triacylglycerol&>2.2 mmol/l) and 10 age-matched nondiabetic subjects participated. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was monitored during hyperglycemic clamps for 120 min. An infusion of Intralipid and heparin was added during minutes 60-120. In one of two tests, the subjects ingested 250 mg of Acipimox 60 min before the hyperglycemic clamp. A third test (also with Acipimox) was performed in 17 of the diabetic subjects after 3 days of a low-fat diet. Acipimox lowered FA levels and enhanced insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic and diabetic subjects alike. Acipimox administration failed to affect insulin secretion rates in nondiabetic subjects and in the group of diabetic subjects as a whole. However, in the diabetic subjects, Acipimox increased integrated insulin secretion rates during minutes 60-120 in the 50% having the lowest levels of hemoglobin A(1c) (379 +/- 34 vs. 326 +/- 30 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1) without Acipimox, P &<0.05). A 3-day dietary intervention diminished energy from fat from 39 to 23% without affecting FA levels and without improving the insulin response during clamps. Elevated FA levels may tonically inhibit stimulated insulin secretion in a subset of type 2 diabetic subjects.
