To investigate the effect of a parent-directed weight reduction program on childhood obesity, a prospective 12-month follow-up study was performed at an outpatient clinic in a district general hospital. Sixty obese children, who, together with their parents received a free of charge weight reduction program, were compared with 52 obese controls who refused the program. The program included knowledge of childhood obesity and ways to decrease calories and increase physical activity; emphasized family participation and behavior modification; and stressed parent direction and self-responsibility. Complete outcome information relating to weight and height changes and a compliance questionnaire was available for 70.5% of these children after 1 year. Twenty three (48.9%) of the 47 children in the treatment group showed a decrease in the percentage they were overweight, compared to only six (18.8%) of the 32 control children. The mean changes in percentage overweight showed a decrease of 2.3% for the treatment children and an increase of 3.1% for the control children. Of the 23 children who were more successful during therapy, two had normal weight, 5 were overweight and 16 remained obese. Child height was not changed after weight reduction in those children in the treatment group who were more successful. The degree of compliance was significantly correlated to the change in percentage overweight. A decrease in percentage overweight was not significantly predicted by sex, age, or severity of obesity of the children, nor by whether the children were excessive eaters or partook in insufficient physical activity prior to the treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
