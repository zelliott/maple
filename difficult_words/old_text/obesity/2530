Inhibition of DGAT-1 is increasingly seen as an attractive mechanism with the potential for treatment of obesity and other elements of the metabolic syndrome. We report here a bicyclooctaneacetic acid derivative in the pyrimidinooxazine structural class of DGAT-1 inhibitors that has good potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic characteristics across a variety of species. This compound is an effective inhibitor of DGAT-1 in both intestinal and adipose tissue, which results in a reduction in body weight or body weight gain following oral administration in both mouse and rat models of dietary-induced obesity.
