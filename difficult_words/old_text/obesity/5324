Hyperglycemia, a frequent complication in critically ill patients, has been shown to have a negative influence on morbidity and mortality. Many factors contribute to hyperglycemia, including the stress response, diabetes, obesity, advanced age, corticosteroids, sepsis, pancreatitis, and the use of nutrition support. Application of intensive insulin therapy, when compared with conventional glycemic control measures, seems to improve outcomes in the critically ill patient. Therefore, effective insulin therapy along with appropriate nutrition support prescriptions provide a means for the critical care nurse and other health care team members to lower complications and enhance recovery in the ICU setting.
