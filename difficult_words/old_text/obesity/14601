We aimed to ascertain the prevalence of obesity in individuals with a mood disorder (MD) (that is, bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder), compared with the general population. We further aimed to examine the likelihood of an association between obesity and MD, while controlling for the influence of sociodemographic variables.

The analysis was based on data from Statistics Canada's Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health and Well-Being (CCHS 1.2), conducted in 2002. The sample (n = 36 984;&> or = aged 15 years) was drawn from the Canadian household-dwelling population. The CCHS used diagnostic criteria outlined in the DSM-IV to screen respondents.

Individuals with a lifetime history of MD were more likely to be obese (body mass index [BMI]&> 30) than were individuals without lifetime MD (19%, compared with 15%, respectively; P &<0.001). In sex-specific multivariate analysis, lifetime MD was associated with elevated odds of obesity in female respondents (95%CI, 1.03 to 1.46, odds ratio 1.22), but not in male respondents. Antipsychotic pharmacotherapy was also associated with obesity.

This is the first Canadian epidemiologic investigation to specifically evaluate anthropometric indices and associated factors in people with MDs. The results herein supplement substantial clinical evidence documenting the association between MDs and stress-sensitive somatic disorders (for example, obesity). These data also underscore the metabolic consequences of some psychotropic agents.
