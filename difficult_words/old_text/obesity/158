The Diet and Coronary Heart Disease Study Project, known as the Anti-Coronary Club, was established by the New York City Department of Health, Bureau of Nutrition in June 1957. The major goals were: 1) to develop an acceptable experimental diet capable of reducing serum cholesterol in ambulatory middle-aged men; and 2) to test the hypothesis that a reduction in serum cholesterol is associated with a modified diet and a reduced incidence of coronary heart disease development. The Prudent Diet was developed to provide a way of eating consistent with the American dietary pattern, avoiding an excess of empty calories, saturated fat, and food cholesterol. It provides a favorable balance of nutrients, limits total fat content and makes possible a more desirable ratio of PUFA to saturated fats. Based on the data, it seems reasonable to attribute the lower coronary heart disease incidence rates in the active experimental group of both age categories studied (40 to 49 and 50 to 59) directly to the reduction in serum cholesterol levels, with weight reduction as a beneficial accomplishment. Dietary intervention with the Prudent Diet was instrumental in achieving the lower coronary heart disease incidence rates that demonstrated the efficacy of the Prudent Diet as a sensible diet.
