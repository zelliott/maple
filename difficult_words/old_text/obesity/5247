The achillean reflexogram has been recorded according to Gilson's photo-electric technique among two male populations during routine cardio-vascular screening. The first population concerns 706 men aged 21 to 55 and the second one 4 437 subjects aged 46 to 52. The frequency of bilateral areflexy increases with age (from 3% before 30 to 6% after 40); it is significantly associated with the presence of angina pectoris. However, no relation is observed with diabetes or clinical suspicion of myocardial infarction. Whereas fat body mass is positively associated with the reflex duration the latter is reduced with heart rate, systolic blooc pressure and number of blood erythrocytes and leucocytes increased. These results and the interest of systematic reflexogram recording during health check up are discussed.
