Seventy obese subjects, after receiving an 8-week group therapy program of behavior modification, showed that they had lost weight from fat tissue. There were significant decreases of per cent body fat, biceps, subscapular and iliac skinfold thickness while maintaining arm muscle area. There were significant decreases of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the program. The acceptability profiles of heart rate, liver and renal function test, fasting blood sugar, uric acid, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, minerals, electrolytes, hematological and lipid profiles were within normal limits before and after the treatment. The obese subjects rated the behavior modification program as more effective and indicated helpfulness of concepts, information and techniques of the program.
