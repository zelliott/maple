Maintenance of appropriate stores of metabolic fuels depends on carefully matching caloric intake to caloric expenditure. Achieving such 'energy balance' is a product of complex interactions of peripheral hormones with effector systems in the central nervous system (CNS) that regulate food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin is a hormone that is made in the adipocytes, circulates in the blood and interacts with receptors in the CNS. These receptors can be found in two different types of systems. One effector system is termed 'anabolic' and is activated by low levels of leptin during negative energy balance. This system (exemplified by the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y system) increases food intake and decreases energy expenditure to facilitate the regaining of lost energy stores. The other effector system is termed 'catabolic' and is activated by high levels of leptin during positive energy balance. This system (exemplified by the hypothalamic melanocortin and corticotrophin-releasing hormone systems) decreases food intake and increases energy expenditure to facilitate the loss of excess energy stores. Further understanding of these systems is necessary to develop adequate treatments for disorders of energy balance, such as obesity and wasting.
