The effects of actiponin was investigated, a heat-processed Gynostemma pentaphyllum extract, on body weight, fat loss, and metabolic markers of Korean participants in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Obese participants (BMI ≥ 25 kg m(-2) and WHR ≥ 0.90 for male or WHR ≥ 0.85 for female) who had not been diagnosed with any disease and met the inclusion criteria were recruited for this study. The 80 subjects were randomly divided into actiponin (n = 40, 450 mg day(-1) ) and placebo (n = 40) groups. Outcomes included measurement of efficacy (abdominal fat distribution, anthropometric parameters, and blood lipid profiles) and safety (adverse events, laboratory test results, electrocardiogram data, and vital signs).

During 12-week of actiponin supplementation, total abdominal fat area, body weight, body fat mass, percent body fat, and BMI were significantly decreased (P = 0.044, P &<0.05, P &<0.0001, P &<0.0001, and P &<0.05, respectively) in the actiponin group compared to the placebo group. No clinically significant changes in any safety parameter were observed.

Our study revealed that actiponin is a potent antiobesity reagent that does not produce any significant adverse effects. These results suggest that actiponin supplementation may be effective for treating obese individuals.
