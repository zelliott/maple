Obesity is epidemic in the modern world. It is becoming increasingly clear that obesity is a major cause of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and renal disease, as well as a host of other comorbidities. There are at present no generally effective long-term medical therapies for obesity. Surgical therapy for morbid obesity is not only effective in producing long-term weight loss but is also effective in ameliorating or resolving several of the most significant complications of obesity, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, degenerative joint disease, venous stasis, pseudotumor cerebri, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, urinary incontinence, fertility problems, and others. The degree of benefit and the rates of morbidity and mortality of the various surgical procedures vary according to the procedure.
