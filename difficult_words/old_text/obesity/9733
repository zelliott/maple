Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signaling modulates sweet-taste sensitivity in the mouse. Because circumvallate papillae (CVPs) express both GLP-1 and its receptor, a local regulation has been suggested. However, whether dietary lipids are involved in this regulation, as shown in the gut, is unknown. By using a combination of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and behavioral approaches, the present data i) confirm the role of GLP-1 signaling in the attraction for sucrose, ii) demonstrate that minute quantities of long-chain FAs (LCFAs) reinforce the attraction for sucrose in a GLP-1 receptor-dependent manner, iii) suggest an involvement of the LCFA receptor GPR120 expressed in taste buds in this system, and iv) support the existence of a regulation by GLP-1 of the lipid sensing mediated by lingual CD36. Therefore, oro-sensory detection of LCFAs may affect sweet and fatty taste responsiveness by controlling the secretion of lingual GLP-1. This regulatory loop, probably triggered by the LCFA-GPR120 interaction, might contribute to the high palatability of foods rich both in fat and sugar.
