To assess body weight composition in postmenopausal women and determine correlations with metabolic and hormonal parameters.

Medical records of 574 postmenopausal Caucasian Spanish women first time attending a menopause clinic were retrospectively reviewed. Retrieved information included general demographic data, type of menopause, time since menopause onset and baseline hormonal and metabolic parameters. A body mass index (BMI) value of&>28.8 kg/m(2) was used to define obesity. The metabolic syndrome (METS) was diagnosed with three or more criteria: fasting glycemia ≥ 100 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) &<0 mg/dL, triglycerides (TG) ≥ 150 mg/dL, blood pressure ≥ 130/85 mmHg and obesity (as defined above).

Mean age of the whole cohort was 49.9 ± 6.1 years, with 66% having a natural menopause. A 38.9% and 23.1% of all women were obese or had the METS, respectively. Obese women were older, had a higher parity, smoked less, had more time since menopause onset and a higher rate of surgical menopause as compared to non-obese ones (p = 0.001). BMI values positively correlated with age, time since menopause, parity, and glucose, TG and systolic blood pressure levels; displaying an inverse correlation with HDL-C and SHBG levels. SHBG levels inversely correlated with glucose, TG, HDL-C and systolic blood pressure levels.

In this Spanish postmenopausal population BMI significantly increased with age, time since menopause and parity displaying significant correlations with hormonal and metabolic parameters.
