Obesity affects cardiovascular risk and also quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study was to test weight loss and impact on QoL after sibutramine treatment in obese subjects.

Double-blind randomized trial on 309 outpatients (51 males, 258 females; age 41.8 +/- 10.9 years, BMI 35.0 +/- 3.1 kg/m(2)) randomized to sibutramine (n = 154) or to placebo (n = 155) treatment. A combination of sibutramine 10 mg or matching placebo and a balanced hypocaloric diet was given for 6 months with monthly evaluations. The main outcome measures were weight loss, the impact of weight on QoL, BMI, and waist circumference.

The mean weight reduction was 8.2 kg in the sibutramine group and 3.9 in the placebo group at 6 months (p &<0.01). 40% of the sibutramine subjects and 14% of the control subjects lost&> or =10% of their body weight (p &<0.01). The improvement in the impact of weight on QoL was statistically significant only in the sibutramine group at 6 months (mean -12.5 vs. -4.5 points; p &<0.01). In the sibutramine group the reduction in BMI (-3.1 vs. -1.4 kg/m(2)) and waist circumference (7.7 vs. 3.5 cm) was significantly greater (p &<0.001). The incidence of adverse events was low and similar to the placebo.

This study confirmed that sibutramine significantly enhances the effect of diet on weight loss, BMI and waist circumference reduction, and showed a significant improvement of QoL.
