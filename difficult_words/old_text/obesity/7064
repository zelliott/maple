To observe the relationship between abdominal obesity and left ventricular weight/function.

A total of 495 patients [265 males, mean age (55 +/- 12) years] with hypertension (139), diabetes (65), metabolic syndrome (285), diabetes complicated with hypertension (11) were enrolled in this study. Visceral adipose area (VA), the subcutaneous adipose (SA), the total abdominal adipose (TA) were measured by computerized tomography (CT) and left ventricular weight and function were obtained by echocardiography. Patients were divided into three groups according to the VA (I. VA&<5 cm(2), n=173, II. V&>75 and &<110 cm(2), n=153, III. VA&>or= 110 cm(2), n=169).

Left ventricular mass (LVM) and LVM index (LVMI) increased and LVEF and E/A decreased in proportion to increasing VA. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) rate was significantly higher in group II and III compared to group I and LVEF was significantly reduced in group III compared to group I and II. There are significant correlation between LVMI and VA, SA, TA as well as between LVEF and VA after adjusting gender, age and blood pressure. Logistic regression analysis showed that VA is an independent predictor for LVH.

The abdominal adipose accumulation is closely related to the left ventricular weight and function.
