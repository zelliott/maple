The influence of moderate obesity on the liver was assessed in 4613 male company employees including 534 moderately obese subjects (30-50 percent overweight). Serum levels of transaminases and gammaglutamyl transferase activities were significantly higher in moderately obese male non-drinkers than in non-obese non-drinkers. Twenty-four percent of male non-drinkers with moderate obesity had abnormal levels of sGPT and 47 percent of moderately obese male non-drinkers had significant hepatic steatosis as assessed by computed tomography. Although most previous studies on this subject were concerned with morbid obesity accompanying only those of more than 50 percent overweight or those who required surgery, the results of this study clearly indicate that moderately obese subjects also have frequent liver dysfunction.
