Nutrition management is an integral part of overall diabetic treatment that includes insulin, physical activity, emotional support and guidance. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a dietary approach in line with the recommended dietary allowances in terms of protein, total and saturated fat, carbohydrates as well as fibre and polyunsaturated fatty acid. A correct dietary approach may help to prevent and to reduce to a minimum any risk of hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia and important long-term complications such as obesity, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension, and at the same time normal growth development.
