Body size estimation (BSE) and locus of control (LOC) were studied in 18 obese adolescent boys undergoing weight reduction. The subjects attended a seven-week summer camp which offered both increased activity and a 1200 kcal (5023 kJ)/d diet, resulting in an average weight loss of 29.2 +/- 6.3 lb (13.3 +/- 2.9 kg) and a decrease in body fat from 39.0 percent +/- 0.6 percent to 27.5 percent +/- 4.3 percent. Fatness was correlated with poor physical performance [1.5 mile (2.4 km) runs]. Weight reduction and decreased body fat resulted in an improved running time. BSE was assessed using self photographs distorted by an anamorphic lens. While subjects could correctly estimate their body size prior to weight reduction, after weight reduction they significantly underestimated body size. This finding contrasts with adults with juvenile-onset obesity who overestimate body size after weight reduction. LOC (measured by Nowicki-Strickland LOC Inventory) changed in the direction of internality after weight reduction. The use of exercise with the weight loss program may thus improve feelings of control and prevent overestimation of body size.
