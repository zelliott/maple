The authors studied the effect of prolonged (7 months) keeping of the animals on the diet with an excess amount of fat (50% of butter) on some characteristics of lipid metabolism and activity of phospholipases A1 and A2, as well as on the activity of a number of lysosomal hydrolases in adipocytes, the liver, kidneys and spleen of rats. Selective activation of lysosomal phospholipases A was demonstrated, being the most marked in adipocytes and the liver. It is assumed that the growth of phospholipase activity is a specific adaptive response of the body, aimed at the enhancement of degradation of lipids, particularly phospholipids, under the conditions of excess fat supply with food. Alternatively, it may be suggested that the enhancement of intralysosomal degradation of cell membrane structures is a consequence of their fat degeneration.
