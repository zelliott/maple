The effect of 50 mg. of sustained release phenformin capsules administered twice daily was compared with a placebo as an aid to weight reduction in obese non-diabetic patients. Phenformin and placebo were administered alternately in two three-month periods.Weight loss on a 1,200-calorie diet was greater in the first three months than in the second three months regardless of treatment. There was no difference in weight loss between the phenformin and placebo groups in either the first or second three-month period. Serum cholesterol levels tended to fall in association with weight loss, but not apparently in relation to the size of the weight loss or to the treatment.
