Association of obesity with metabolic and cardiovascular complications depends on the adipose tissue distribution. The role of intraabdominal, i.e. visceral, adipose tissue in pathogenesis of insulin resistance is still not elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between insulin resistance and contribution of visceral and subcutaneous fat in a group of women with a wide range of body weight.

62 women (age 21-66 years) among which 32 were non-obese and 30 obese (BMI&> 30 kg/m2) were examined. The amount of visceral and subcutaneous fat was evaluated using computerized tomography, total body fat evaluated using bioimpedance, and the degree of insulin resistance was evaluated using glucose disposal (M) during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Obese women had lower insulin sensitivity than non-obese (5.88 +/- 2.17 vs 3.32 +/- 1.44 mg/min/kg, p &<.001) and higher absolute amount of visceral fat. However, the relative amount of visceral fat (related to total body fat or subcutaneous fat) was not different between the two groups. In the entire study group, the magnitude of insulin sensitivity did correlate with absolute amount of total and visceral fat, but no correlation with relative amount of visceral fat was found.

The results suggest that the absolute amount of fat, either total or visceral, is a stronger predictor of the degree of insulin resistance than the relative contribution of visceral fat.
