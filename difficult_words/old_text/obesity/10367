The single nucleotide polymorphism at position 276 in the adiponectin gene (APM1/ACDC +276 &>T) and left ventricular mass (LVM) have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. We sought to evaluate whether +276 &>T variants in the adiponectin gene are correlated with LVM in uncomplicated obese subjects. APM1/ACDC +276 &>T single nucleotide polymorphism, echocardiographic indexed LVM (LVM/body surface area and LVM/height(2.7)), insulin sensitivity by euglycemic clamp, and plasma adiponectin levels were analyzed in 62 obese subjects without complications (51 women and 11 men; mean age, 34.2 +/- 10.2 years; BMI, 38.6 +/- 9.1 kg/m2). Forty lean subjects formed the control group for LVM evaluation. We found 23 (37%) uncomplicated obese subjects with the APM1/ACDC +276 G/G genotype, 25 (40%) with the G/T genotype, and 14 (23%) with the T/T genotype. G/G uncomplicated obese subjects showed significant higher LVM/body surface area and LVM/height(2.7) (within the normal range in the majority of them) than uncomplicated obese subjects carrying the G/T and T/T genotypes (p &<0.01 and p &<0.05, respectively). This study showed that LVM is significantly higher in uncomplicated obese subjects carrying the G/G genotype at position 276 of the human adiponectin gene.
