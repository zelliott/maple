The purpose of this study was to validate the use of bioelectrical impedance in assessing human body composition and to explore the use of this technique in obesity. Eighty-seven adults varying widely in body composition (range: 8.8-59.0% body fat) underwent measurement of bioelectrical impedance and underwater weighing (density). Fat-free mass determined from density (FFMd) was compared with FFM estimated from bioelectric impedance according to previously published regression equations. Correlation coefficients were high at all levels of body fat (0.94-0.99) but impedance equations overestimated FFM compared with FFMd in subjects greater than 42% body fat. This effect was greatest in subjects greater than 48% body fat and a regression equation was derived for determination of FFM for these subjects. These data confirm the excellent agreement between body composition determined from bioelectrical impedance and density but suggest that caution should be used in applying existing regression equations to very obese subjects.
