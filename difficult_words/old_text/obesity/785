In order to study the effect of conjugated linoleic acid on PPAR gamma gene expression, serum leptin, blood glucose and blood lipid level.

Five groups of male Wistar rats were randomly selected and fed with different diets (basic diet, high-fat diet, high-fat with 0.75% CLA, high-fat with 1.50% CLA, and high-fat with 3.00% CLA) for 12 weeks. At the end of experiment, the rats were sacrificed, the ratio of lipids to body weight were calculated, and the blood glucose, serum lipids, serum leptin were measured. RT-PCR was used for measuring the expression of PPAR gamma mRNA in white adipose tissue of rats.

It was shown that the supplement of CLA could decrease decreased blood glucose, serum triglyceride, cholesterol and leptin levels, and increased the expression of PPAR gamma in white adipose tissue of obese rat.

CLA could decrease blood glucose, serum lipids, and decrease the levels of leptin possibly via activating peroxisome proliferator--activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), resulting in the improvement of leptin resistance of obese rat.
