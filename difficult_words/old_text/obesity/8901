Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is less prevalent in Asia than in the West, but there is now evidence to suggest that its frequency is rapidly rising in Asia. The different prevalence rates reported in various Asian studies may represent different points in the 'rising' phase of GERD. The cause for the lower but increasing prevalence of GERD in Asia is not known, but genetics and to some extent environmental factors, may have initially protected Asians against GERD. However, with the recent globalization of economies, the associated lifestyle changes in many developing Asian countries may have tipped the balance in favor of the development of GERD.
