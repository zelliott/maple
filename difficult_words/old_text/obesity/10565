To examine techniques that have been used to assess various aspects of body-image perception and body-image attitudes in obesity. It summarizes findings from previous review articles and reports on new research findings that have been published between August 2007 and August 2010.

Body-image perception and attitudes in obesity have been assessed using questionnaires, figural drawing scales and computer morphing or adjustment programs. Most of these techniques have been developed to assess body image in eating disorders and as such are not specific to the assessment of body image in obesity.

Body-image perception and body-image attitudes are commonly assessed in research studies on obesity. However, currently available assessment instruments have not been developed specifically for use in obese populations and not all have been validated in these populations. Researchers should be careful in selecting assessment instruments that are appropriate for use in obesity.
