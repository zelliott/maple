Progressive left hemiparesis followed by face and trunk cutaneous vasodilation and hyperphagia developed in a 28-year-old man. He began eating five to six meals a day and gained 16 kg in 60 days. Computed tomography disclosed a neoplastic lesion involving the midline via the hypothalamus and reaching the contralateral lenticular nucleus. Findings from endocrine studies, including thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, prolactin, and cortisol serum levels, were normal. Hyperphagia and consequent obesity were associated with bilateral destruction of the ventromedial hypothalamic area; cutaneous vasodilation was related to involvement of the preoptic area.
