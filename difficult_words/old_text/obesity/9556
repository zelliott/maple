Blood pressure (BP) was followed simultaneously with body weight in 134 morbidly obese patients randomized to either jejunoileal bypass (101 patients) or dietary treatment (33 patients). After a median observation time of 24 months (range 12-48 months) body weight fell significantly from a median of 124.0 kg to 81.2 kg in the jejunoileal bypass patients whilst median BP decreased significantly from 140/85 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg. In the patients treated with diet, body weight decreased significantly from a median of 129.0 kg to 119.0 kg after a median observation time of 18 months (range 9-36 months) whereas the median BP of 140/90 mmHg was unaffected. The fall in BP after weight loss was significantly positively correlated with the height of BP before the weight loss. The correlation could not be explained by a greater weight loss in the patients with initially high BP. Furthermore, a significantly positive correlation between BP changes and body weight changes was demonstrated, but this correlation was lesser than the above-mentioned. The study shows that the beneficial effect of a weight loss upon BP in obese patients is greater the higher the initial BP is, but also that a normal BP is only little affected and explained mainly by cuff artifact.
