Obesity is considered a risk factor for lymphedema of the arm resulting from breast cancer treatment (BCRL) as well as a poor prognostic factor in response to lymphedema treatment. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of 2 dietary interventions on excess arm volume in BCRL.

A total of 64 women with BCRL were randomized to 1 of 3 groups for 24 weeks: 1) weight reduction through reduced energy intake; 2) low-fat diet with no change in energy intake (isoenergetic); 3) control group with no dietary change from habitual intake.

The primary outcome measure was arm volume at 24 weeks. Results showed significant reductions in body weight (P = .006), body mass index (P = .008), and skinfold thickness measured at 4 sites (P = .044) in the weight-reduction and low-fat groups compared with controls. A slightly greater, but not significant (P = .605), fall in excess arm volume occurred in the dietary groups but a significant correlation between weight loss (irrespective of group) and a reduction in excess arm volume (r: 0.423; P = .002) was demonstrated.

Weight loss, whether through reduced energy intake or low-fat diet, appears to be helpful in the treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema.
