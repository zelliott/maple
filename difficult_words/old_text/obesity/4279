We have shown a significant disruption of 24-h pattern of plasma pituitary, adrenal, and gonadal hormones in high-fat-fed rats. Our objective was to assess the effect of a high-fat diet (35% fat) on mean levels and 24-h pattern of several adipocytokines in rats. A normal diet-fed rats (4% fat) were used as controls. When body weight of high-fat-fed rats attained values about 25% higher than controls (after 66 days of treatment), the animals were killed at six different time intervals throughout a 24-h cycle. Plasma concentrations of insulin, adiponectin, interleukin (IL)-1, leptin, ghrelin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured in a multianalyte profiling by using the Luminex-100 system. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and IL-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A significant hyperglycemia developed in high-fat-fed rats, together with a significant increase in plasma insulin. Mean levels of plasma adiponectin, IL-1, IL-6, TNFalpha, and leptin augmented, and ghrelin decreased, in high-fat-fed rats. The normal daily pattern of plasma insulin, adiponectin, IL-1, IL-6, TNFalpha, leptin, ghrelin, and MCP-1 became disrupted in high-fat-fed rats. The results indicate that a high-fat diet may bring about signs of insulin resistance and mild inflammation in rats, together with the disruption in daily variations of circulating insulin and ghrelin, and of several adipocytokines including leptin, adiponectin, IL-1, IL-6, TNFalpha, and MCP-1.
