Following the discovery of secretin in 1902, a host of further peptide hormones that are synthesised and released from the gastrointestinal tract have been identified. While their roles in the regulation of gastrointestinal function have been known for some time, it is now evident that many of these hormones also physiologically regulate energy balance. Our understanding of how gut hormones signal to the brain has advanced significantly in recent years. Several hormones, including peptide YY, pancreatic polypeptide, oxyntomodulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 and cholecystokinin function as satiety signals. In contrast, only ghrelin, produced by the stomach, has emerged as a putative hunger signal, appearing to act both as a meal initiator and a long-term body weight regulator. Recent research suggests that gut hormones can be manipulated to regulate energy balance in man and that obese subjects retain sensitivity to the actions of gut hormones. The worldwide obesity pandemic continues unabated, despite public health initiatives and current best therapy. Future gut hormone-based therapies may provide an effective and well-tolerated treatment for obesity.
