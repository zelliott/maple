To examine the individual, parental, and neighborhood environment correlates of children's physical activity and risk of obesity.

Secondary data of 1514 children drawn from the Delaware Survey of Children's Health were used for analysis. A conceptual framework was developed based on the Social Determinants of Health and Environmental Health Promotion model and tested using structural equation modeling.

Findings confirmed that parental support on physical activity and a favorable neighborhood environment predicted children's physical activity. However, the risk of overweight and obesity was not associated with parental support of physical activity and children's physical activity.

Future preventive practice requires a multifaceted approach incorporating both individual and environmental changes.
