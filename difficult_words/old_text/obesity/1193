In contrast to the obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSA) the obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is characterised by persistent hypercapnia during the day and predominant hypoventilation during sleep. In this study we wanted to know whether work of breathing (WOB) in a sitting and supine position separates both groups.

OSA population: 20 men, 50.5 +/- 9.2 years, Body Mass Index (BMI: 54.1 +/- 6.9 kg/m2, pO2: 65.6 +/- 6.6 mmHg, pCO2: 40.6 +/- 3.1 mmHg, OHS-group: 14 patients, 13 men age: 53.1 +/- 9.3 years, BMI: 53.1 +/- 9.3 kg/m2, pO2: 51.8 +/- 10.5 mmHg, pCO2: 53.8 +/- 9.2 mmHg. The control group consisted of 10 normal weighted subjects. The intrathoracic pressures were assessed by an oesophageal catheter; at the same time, the minute ventilation (VE) and the breathing frequency (fb) were measured via a pneumotachygraph. The area under the pressure-volume loop was correlated to WOB. After reaching steady state VE, fb, and WOB were determined in sitting and supine position.

In the OSA-group the apnoea index (AI) was 48.6 +/- 17.7/h and the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was 66.3 +/- 19.4/h. The forced expiratory volume (FEV1) was 77.3 +/- 23% pred. and the vital capacity (VC) was 76.3 +/- 18.6% pred.; 7 out of 20 patients suffered from chronic bronchitis. In the OHS-group the AI was 21.5 +/- 19/h and the RDI 44.3 +/- 28.2/h. The majority of OHS patients had an airway obstruction (FEV1: 55.8 +/- 17.5% pred., VC: 58.8 +/- 12.8% pred.); 12 out of 14 patients suffered from chronic bronchitis. Compared to the OSA population WOB in the OHS group was significantly higher both in the sitting (0.67 +/- 0.28 J/I versus 1.04 +/- 0.32 J/I, p &<0.001) and supine positions (1.23 +/- 0.25 J/I versus 1.91 +/- 0.43 J/I, p &<0.001). Compared to the sitting position VE and fb did not change significantly in both groups lying supine.

Compared to the OSA group at the same BMI the WOB of the OHS population was significantly increased in the sitting and supine position. The main reason for these findings may be the increased airway obstruction due to chronic bronchitis. Both populations did not change the breathing patterns during the different positions.
