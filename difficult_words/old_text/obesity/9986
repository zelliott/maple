A total of 507 men and 686 women were opportunistically screened for hypercholesterolaemia and reinvited for a follow-up visit with the nurse after 2 years. Seven-hundred and thirty three (62%) re-attended (group A), while 226 (19%) did not, but saw the nurse at one or more pre-scheduled 6 month check-ups (group B). Two-hundred and thirty-three (20%) did not attend at all (group C). There was no difference between the groups in the number of parallel physician consultations during follow-up. Both groups B and C had higher proportions of smokers than group A. Group C were younger, had lower cholesterol and lower blood pressure (after adjustment for age) than group B, which in turn, had higher cholesterol and blood pressure than group A. The prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia declined during the 2 years in group A. Of 189 smokers at baseline, 26 (14%) quit during follow-up. Of the 544 non-smokers, however, 31 (6%) commenced, to out-balance the quitters. Only five of the 43 patients in group A who had a persistent cholesterol of&> or = 7.9 mmol/l received medication. It is likely that drop-out from a follow-up programme of this kind is to some extent justified because of the parallel organizations for care.
