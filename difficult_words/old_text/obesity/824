Since its release in 1992, the Food Guide Pyramid has become one of the most recognized nutrition education tools in US history. As such, it has been subject to criticism, particularly in several recent media reports that implicate it as the culprit in America's current obesity epidemic. What these reports often overlook, however, is that the diets of many Americans do not adhere to the dietary guidelines illustrated by the Pyramid, refuting the notion that the Pyramid is the cause of the nation's obesity problem. Data indicate that the more likely causes of escalating obesity rates are increased per capita caloric consumption and larger portion sizes, along with a lack of adequate physical activity. Although the Pyramid graphic was designed more than a decade ago, it still communicates three key concepts that continue to be the cornerstone of federal dietary guidance: variety, proportionality, and moderation. As such, it remains a viable and relevant nutrition education tool, especially when used by dietetics professionals as a component of individualized, comprehensive nutrition education and behavior modification interventions. As the United States Department of Agriculture begins to investigate whether the food intake patterns illustrated by the Pyramid are in need of updating, research is urgently needed to determine how nutrition education tools, including the Pyramid, can be most effectively implemented to help consumers adopt healthful eating behaviors and to improve the public health of America.
