This article describes the burden of illness of Indians eligible for services from the Indian Health Service (IHS) and discusses strategies for reducing morbidity and mortality related to those conditions. To improve health to an extent that parallels the IHS's past achievements, the illnesses that now are prevelant among Indians require changes in personal and community behavior rather than intensified medical services. Analysis of these conditions leads to the conclusion that much of the existing burden of illness can be reduced or eliminated. IHS is responding to this challenge by continuing to ensure Indians' access to comprehensive health care services, by increasing educational efforts aimed at prevention, and by enlisting the support of other government and private organizations in activities that have as their purpose treating diseases if intervention will lessen morbidity and mortality (such as diabetes and hypertension) and encouraging of dietary changes, cessation of smoking, exercise, reduction in alcohol consumption, and other healthy behavior.
