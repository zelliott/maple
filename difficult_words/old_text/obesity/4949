The synthetic compound NO-1886 (ibrolipim, [4-(4-bromo-2-cyano-phenylcarbamoyl)-benzyl]-phosphonic acid diethyl ester, CAS 133208-93-2) is a lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-promoting agent that decreases plasma triglycerides, increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and prevents fat accumulation in high fat-fed rats. However, the effect of NO-1886 on body weight, fat accumulation, and energy expenditure in ovariectomized (OVX) rats is not clear. The primary aim of this study was to ascertain whether NO-1886 ameliorated obesity in OVX rats and to examine the effects on fatty acid oxidation-related enzymes. NO-1886 decreased accumulation of visceral fat and suppressed the increase in body weight resulting from the ovariectomy. NO-1886 decreased the respiratory quotient and increased expression of the fatty acid translocase messenger RNA (mRNA) in the liver, soleus muscle, and mesenteric fat. NO-1886 also increased the expression of fatty acid-binding protein mRNA in the liver and soleus muscle and the expression of the uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) mRNA in the heart, soleus muscle, and mesenteric fat, but not in the brown adipose tissue. Furthermore, NO-1886 did not affect UCP1 and UCP2 in brown adipose tissue. Therefore, amelioration of obesity by NO-1886 in OVX rats is possibly because of an the increased expression of fatty acid oxidation-related enzymes and UCP3, both of which are related to fatty acid transfer and fat use. Our study indicates that the LPL-promoting agent NO-1886 may be potentially beneficial in the treatment of obesity and obesity-linked health problems in postmenopausal women.
