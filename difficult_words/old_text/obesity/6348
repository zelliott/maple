The focus of this study was to describe changes the patients make in eating and weight control habits 3--4 months after diagnosis of myocardial infarction, and to identify difficulties associated with the reported changes 1 month later. Subjects were 50 male patients (mean age 48 years, mean body mass index 27.9kg/m(2)) participating in an in-patient cardiac rehabilitation programme. The changes were assessed with a questionnaire (46 items) at the beginning of the rehabilitation programme and 4 days food diaries were used to assess the diet at home. Difficulties were assessed with a questionnaire (34 items) 1 month later. Nearly all patients (96%) had changed their habits after myocardial infarction. The majority of the patients (76%) reported that they had consumed foods containing less fat and many of them anticipated difficulties to eat healthily at workplace. More attention could be paid to self-change without the assistance of formal treatment among patients with cardiac disease.
