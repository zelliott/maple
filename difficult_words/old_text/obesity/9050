It is often stated, "the faster you lose weight, the faster it is regained ". A review of existing literature does not support such a statement--indeed if anything the reverse is true. The origins of this erroneous view are the misconceptions that weight regain is a simple matter of bad dietary and social habits and that it takes time to change these, that physiological adaptations to rapid weight loss are different to those of gradual weight loss and that weight regain is simply due to a return to old habits. Indeed there are many advantages to rapid weight loss achieved with the use of a modern very low energy diet, including the fact that rapid weight loss is a motivating factor, that the mild ketosis that occurs not only suppresses hunger, but also slows protein loss and that adherence is easier with a structured dietary regime. VLEDs are dietary preparations that provide all nutritional requirements together with between 1845 and 3280 KJ (450 and 800 Kcal) per day. An individual takes this meal replacement three times daily as a substitute for breakfast, lunch and dinner. In addition, a bowl of non-starchy vegetables once daily provides some fibre and helps to satisfy the social aspect of eating. A teaspoon of oil on the vegetables contracts the gall bladder to minimise the risk of gall stone formation. Since weight loss, at whatever rate, results in physiological adaptations leading to weight regain, careful attention must be paid to the period after the VLED regime is completed. Lifestyle modification, diet and exercise are instituted optimally with behaviour modification. If, despite the subject's best efforts, weight regain occurs, an appetite suppressant is advisable to help control the drive to eat.
