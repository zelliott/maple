To investigate lipid profiles in Psammomys obesus and relationships between lipid profile and other components of the Metabolic Syndrome.

A total number of 49 adults with a wide range of body weight and glucose tolerance were studied in a cross-sectional analysis. Plasma cholesterol distribution profiles were measured by size exclusion lipid chromatography. Blood glucose was measured using an enzymatic glucose analyser, and plasma insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay.

Obese diabetic Psammomys obesus had elevated plasma cholesterol (P=0.003) and triglyceride levels (&>0.001) compared to their lean littermates. The hypercholesterolemia was mainly due to increased circulating levels of VLDL-cholesterol (P=0.003) and LDL-cholesterol (P=0.003) in these animals. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that body weight was independently associated with plasma cholesterol (P=0.011) and LDL concentration (P=0.009), while plasma insulin was associated with VLDL-cholesterol concentration (P=0.005). All of the variables measured exhibited continuous distributions across a wide range of phenotypes, from a normal rodent lipid profile to profound dyslipidemia.

These data suggest that the dyslipidemia in obese, diabetic Psammomys obesus is closely associated with other components of the Metabolic Syndrome, including obesity and insulin resistance.
