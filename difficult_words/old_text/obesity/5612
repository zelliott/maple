Sexual dimorphism in stature, weight status and body composition were analyzed in a sample of 398 prepubertal children (213 girls, 185 boys) ageing between 7 and 10. Furthermore the prevalence of overweight was tested. Body composition parameters were determined using TBF 105 Body composition analyzer according to BIA-method. Highly significant sex differences in body composition were observed (p &<0.001). In contrast, stature, weight and BMI showed no significant differences between the two sexes. Nevertheless, a significant higher portion (p &<0.05) of girls (29%) corresponded to the definition overweight according to ASNS (Austrian Survey of Nutritional Status), while only 20% of the boys felt into the category overweight. The results of the present study showed not only significant sex differences in body composition, especially in fat mass, long before puberty onset, but also a significantly higher prevalence of overweight among prepubertal girls in comparison to prepubertal boys.
