We studied whether leptin is an independent associate of blood pressure in obese children and adolescence. 102 obese children (48 girls, age: 11.6 +/- 2.22 yr; body mass index [BMI]: 27.45 +/- 4.4; blood pressure: 122.5 +/- 11.1/64.7 +/- 10.6 mm Hg and 54 boys, age: 11.5 +/- 2.4 yr; BMI: 27.6 +/- 4.4; blood pressure: 122.5 +/- 13.2/60.9 +/- 8.1 mm Hg [mean +/- SD]) were investigated. Serum leptin and insulin were measured by RIA; glucose was determined enzymatically. Fat mass (FM) was calculated by bioelectrical impedance. Leptin was higher in girls than in boys (p=0.018) but no significant gender differences were found with respect to indices of adiposity and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Children were divided into three groups, according to pubertal stage (Group 1: prepubertal, 32 boys/13 girls; Group 2: pubertal, 17 boys/25 girls; Group 3: late/postpubertal, 5 boys/10 girls). SBP and DBP correlated with body weight in the whole group (r=0.49, p&<.0001, and r=0.27, p=0.004). In Group 1, BMI showed the highest correlation to SBP; in Group 3 no indices of adiposity were related to SBP. In no case was leptin significantly associated with SBP after adjustment for adiposity. In Group 2, glucose was significantly associated with SBP after adjustment for body weight. In Group 3, however, no correlations were found between SBP, DBP and metabolic characteristics, perhaps due to small sample size. Stepwise multiple regression revealed that body weight and glucose contributed to the variation in SBP in the whole group (R2=0.31, p&<.0001). Insulin accounted for almost 8% of the variation in DBP (R2=0.08, p=0.0034). Body weight contributed significantly to SBP in boys (R2=0.39, p&<.0001) and girls (R2=0.24, p&<0.001). The results imply that body weight contributes independently to the variation in blood pressure. Glucose and insulin contribute to mean blood pressure to some extent, but our data do not support the assumption that leptin per se serves as an independent predictor of blood pressure in obese children and adolescents.
