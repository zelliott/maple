The circadian rhythm of glycogen metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle was studied in lean and gold thioglucose (GTG) induced-obese mice. The active forms of glycogen synthase (GSI) and phosphorylase (GPa) and the total activity of these enzymes were measured every three hours over a 24 h period in mice fed ad libitum. Hepatic and muscle glycogen content displayed a marked diurnal rhythm that was similar in lean and obese mice. In skeletal muscle the glycogen content, GSI and GPa were not significantly different in lean and obese animals over the 24 h period. The activities of muscle GSI and GPa were constant in both groups despite the diurnal variation in the muscle glycogen content. The absence of an increase in the glycogen content of skeletal muscle despite the pronounced hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in the obese mice, may indicate the degree of insulin resistance in this tissue or the maximal capacity of muscle tissue to store glycogen. In liver, glycogen concentration and total glycogen storage were higher in obese mice. Unlike muscle, both hepatic GSI and GPa underwent significant changes in activity over the 24 h period. Hepatic GSI was lower and GPa was higher in obese mice. The circadian rhythm in enzyme activities was independent of both blood glucose and insulin levels. The total glycogen storage and the activities of total phosphorylase and GPa were significantly increased in the liver from GTG obese mice over a 24 h period and could be implicated in the development of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in this model of obesity.
