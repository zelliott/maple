The content and accretion of fatty acids in 30, 45 and 60-day-old Zucker lean Fa/? and obese fa/fa rats fed either reference chow or a cafeteria diet has been studied, together with their actual fatty acid intake during each period. Diet had little overall effect on the pattern of deposition of fatty acids, but quantitatively the deposition of fat was much higher in cafeteria-fed rats. The fat-rich cafeteria diet allowed the direct incorporation of most fatty acids into the rat lipids, whilst chow feeding activated lipogenesis and the deposition of a shorter chain and more saturated pattern of fatty acids. Genetic, obesity induced a significant expansion of net lipogenesis when compared with lean controls. Cafeteria-fed obese rats accrued a high proportion of fatty acids, which was close to that ingested, but nevertheless showed a net de novo synthesis of fatty acids. It is postulated that the combined effects of genetic obesity and a fat-rich diet result in high rates of fat accretion with limited net lipogenesis. Lean Zucker rats show a progressive impairment of their delta 5-desaturase system, a situation also observed in obese rats fed a reference diet. In Zucker obese rats, cafeteria feeding resulted in an alteration of the conversion of C18:2 into C20:3. The cafeteria diet fully compensated for these drawbacks by supplying very high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids.
