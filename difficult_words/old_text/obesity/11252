Proven short-term effectiveness of obesity therapy should be re-evaluated in the long-term. The objective of this paper is to determine the long-term (10 years) outcome for patients from a randomised controlled trial (RCT).

A RCT in 2002 compared laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) for obesity with non-surgical therapy. Follow-up has been conducted at 10 years. Eighty patients (BMI 30-35) were randomised to a non-surgical or a surgical program. Outcome data are available on 37 (92.5 %) of the surgical patients and 27 (62.5 %) of the non-surgical patients at 10 years.

Weight change, the metabolic syndrome, quality of life, adverse events and direct costs of the surgical cohort were the main results of the study. A durable weight loss is present in the surgical group with a mean (SD) 10-year weight loss of 14.1 (7.7) kg (63.4 % EWL), better than the non-surgical group (mean (SD) = 0.4 (10.5) kg; p &<0.001). The metabolic syndrome was reduced from 14 to 4 of the 37 patients who completed 10 years within the LAGB groups. Proximal gastric enlargements occurred in 17 (30 %) of the 57 who had LAGB and removal of the band occurred in 7 (12 %). The annual maintenance costs including additional surgery was AUD $765 per patient per year.

Bariatric surgery with the LAGB can achieve long-term weight reduction which is better than a program of non-surgical therapy. There is also a sustained reduction of the metabolic syndrome. There is a significant maintenance requirement after LAGB.
