Although knowledge of the biological aspects of obesity is increasing very rapidly, psychological approaches are increasingly in demand. Psychological theory and research concerning the emotional and cognitive impacts of being obese, the psychological causes involved in obesity, and the psychological elements of treatment and motivations for treatment are requested. There is no clear separation between the psychological factors that function as causes of obesity and the psychological effects of obesity. Rather, they appear to be related in a circle of interconnectedness. This is important to keep in mind when seeking ways to motivate and support obese patients.
