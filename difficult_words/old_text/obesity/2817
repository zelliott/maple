A combination of neonatal thymectomy and intensive treatment with a highly specific turkey anti-chicken T cell serum effectively abrogates the spontaneous development of thyroiditis and thyroglobulin autoantibodies in the Obese strain chicken. Thus, in addition to a restraining influence of suppressor T cells on the disease process indicated by earlier studies, it would appear that T cells also make a positive contribution to pathogenesis.
