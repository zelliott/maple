To assess the feasibility of conducting empirically supported family-based paediatric obesity group treatment via TeleMedicine. Seventeen families were randomly assigned to one of two conditions (physician visit, TeleMedicine). Measures included feasibility, satisfaction and intervention outcome measures such as BMI percentile, and nutrition and activity behaviours. Measures were completed at baseline, post-treatment and at 1-year follow-up. Analyses indicate that both feasibility and satisfaction data regarding the TeleMedicine intervention were positive. Intervention outcome indicates no change in BMI percentile or nutrition and activity behaviours for either treatment group. A behavioural family-based weight loss intervention delivered via TeleMedicine was well received by both parents and providers. Due to the small sample size, null findings regarding intervention outcome should be interpreted with caution. Future research should focus on methods to increase the impact of this intervention on key outcome variables.
