The present study is to evaluate the roles of HBV infection, host factors and their interactions in the development of ultrasound-diagnosed fatty liver in Fujian province of China, a highly HBV endemic area.

From June 2007 to May 2008, 527 ultrasound-diagnosed fatty liver patients and 1042 controls were ultrasonically diagnosed in this hospital-based case-control study. Their demographic, anthropometric, biochemical, behavioral factors and HBV markers were compared, and factors associated with fatty liver were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Multivariate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (Cls) of fatty liver were 3.96 (2.10-7.48) for HBsAg positivity, 2.97 (1.78-4.94) for HBsAg negativity with antibodies positivity (either anti-HBe or anti-HBc or both), 1.66 (1.10-2.51) for low alcohol consumption, 7.09 (4.28- 11.75) for obesity, 3.19 (1.75-5.81) for reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), 2.17 (1.00-4.72) for elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2.71 (1.72-4.27) for hypertriglyceridemia, 9.19 (4.32-19.57) for hypertension, and 2.89 (1.86-4.48) for hyperuricemia. Furthermore, synergistic interactions on the additive model were observed between HBV infection and obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, reduced HDL-C, and hyperuricemia with regard to the risk of fatty liver.

Ultrasound-diagnosed fatty liver in Fujian province of China is closely associated with HBV infection, low alcohol consumption, obesity, and other features of the metabolic syndrome. In addition, HBV infection was synergistic with obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, reduced HDL-C, and hyperuricemia as far as the risk of fatty liver concerned.
