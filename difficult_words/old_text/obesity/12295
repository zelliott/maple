COPD exacerbations with respiratory acidosis are difficult to manage, especially when OSA and obesity are associated. The solution is the use of noninvasive ventilation associated with oxygenotherapy in order to correct the hypercapnia, hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis and to prevent the invasive mechanical ventilation. Early respiratory rehabilitation and the use of a domiciliary ventilatory support after the acute episode could be a part of the management for these patients. We present a modality of therapeutical approach through a clinical case.
