Parental and intervention-specific environmental supports were examined as potential reinforcers for physical activity and use of a video game, Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), among a cohort of 7- to 8-year-old children.

Sixty children were randomized to an intervention (n = 40) or a control (n = 20) group. Physical activity was measured with accelerometry and DDR logs. Parental support for their child's physical activity was assessed via a questionnaire. DDR-specific environmental supports were captured on an environmental home screen and the DDR log.

At baseline, the absence of other video games and parent DDR participation was associated with child participation in DDR. At follow-up, DDR participation of siblings and friends was associated with child participation in DDR.

The primary findings of this study suggest that parental and peer participation in DDR may play a role in children's initial and sustained participation in DDR.
