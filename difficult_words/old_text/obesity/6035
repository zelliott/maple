The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship of plasma resistin levels with determinants of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and anthropometric parameters in healthy Korean subjects. Plasma resistin levels were determined in 276 subjects. In subjects with MetS, the plasma resistin levels were not significantly increased compared to those without MetS (8.3+/-4.3 ng/mL vs. 8.5+/-3.6 ng/mL, respectively, P=0.84). In addition, the plasma resistin levels were not correlated with the body mass index, the waist circumference, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting plasma glucose or insulin levels. However, the plasma resistin levels were positively correlated with the abdominal subcutaneous fat (r=0.18, P&<.01) in all subjects and correlated with TNF alpha(r=-0.16, P&<.05) and hsCRP (r=0.15, P&<.05) in subjects without MetS but not with MetS. With multiple linear regression analysis, these linear associations remained to be significant. The results of this study show that plasma resistin levels in humans were not associated with markers of insulin resistance, obesity or other determinants of the MetS.
