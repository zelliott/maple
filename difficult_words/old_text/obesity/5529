Beta 3-adrenergic receptors (beta 3 ARs) are important structures in the human body but the role they play is not yet very clear. Stimulation of beta 3 AR in adipose tissue causes greater energy expenditure and increases thermogenesis and lipolysis. Mutation of the gene coding beta 3 AR in position 64 with thymidine instead of cytosine leads to the replacement of tryptophan (Trp 64) with arginine (Arg 64) and may be the cause of greater increase in body mass and the decrease in basic metabolism. The data however, is differentiated in populations and cannot be conclusive. The connection has been discovered between the state of the beta 3 ARs and the blood lipid concentration (also differing in populations). In some patients beta 3 AR mutation is correlated with high arterial diastolic pressure, increased incidence of noninsulin-dependent diabetes in younger, increased insulin resistance and diabetes in pregnant. beta 3-AR agonists might be used in treatment of many diseases, which obviously demands further investigations.
