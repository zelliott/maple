SNF-1/5'-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-related kinase (SNARK) is a member of the AMPK-related kinases. Snark(+/-) mice exhibited mature-onset obesity and related metabolic disorders. Obesity is regarded as a risk factor for colorectal cancer. To investigate whether Snark deficiency is involved in tumorigenesis in the large intestine, obese Snark(+/-) mice were treated with a chemical carcinogen, azoxymethane (AOM). The incidences of both adenomas and aberrant crypt foci (ACF) were significantly higher in Snark(+/-) mice than in their wild-type counterparts 28 weeks after the completion of AOM treatment (10 mg/kg/week for 8 weeks). Furthermore, ACF formation was enhanced in Snark(+/-) mice treated with AOM for 2 weeks, suggesting that Snark deficiency contributed to the early phase of tumorigenesis. The total number of ACF was correlated with bodyweight in Snark(+/-) and Snark(+/+) mice, suggesting that obesity was a risk factor for colorectal tumorigenesis in this model. However, the correlation coefficient was higher in Snark(+/-) mice. Moreover, AOM-induced ACF formation was also enhanced in preobese Snark(+/-) mice. Together, these findings suggest that AOM-induced tumorigenesis in Snark(+/-) mice was enhanced via obesity-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
