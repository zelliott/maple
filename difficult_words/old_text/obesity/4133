Personal lifestyle and working conditions are closely linked for long haul truck drivers. We compare lifestyle related diseases in long haul drivers with other drivers of goods and the working population at large. Standardized hospital treatment ratios (SHR) for lifestyle related diseases were compared for long haul truck drivers and other truck drivers to the working population at large. The follow up group comprised of 2,175 long haul drivers and 15,060 other truck drivers. An increased risk was found for lifestyle related diseases among truck drivers except for alcohol related diseases. We identified a strong association between hospital treatment for obesity and working as a driver and an association between diabetes and working as a driver. No major differences in lifestyle related diseases were found in long haul drivers compared to other truck drivers with the exception of a significant lower risk for alcohol-related diseases and a possibly higher risk for lung cancer in long haul drivers. It is concluded that diseases related to excess caloric intake or lack of exercise may be a problem for truck drivers. This risk is preventable and of importance both in occupational medicine as in public health.
