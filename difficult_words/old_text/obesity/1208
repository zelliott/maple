We evaluated serum concentrations of apoprotein (APO) A1, B, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density cholesterol (LDL-C) in twelve obese subjects whose body mass index (BMI) was&> or = 30 before and after a clinically significant weight loss was obtained utilizing a very-low calorie diet (VLCD) consisting of liquid protein (Optifast) providing 800 calories a day. At baseline, the mean weight +/- SD was 119.77 Kg and decreased significantly to 89.29 +/- 13.46 Kg by 24 weeks. Statistically significant reductions of APO-A1, APO-B, total cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations were also observed along with the weight loss. LDL-C decreased from 156.0 +/- 55.9 mg/dL to 122.5 +/- 42.2 mg/dL (4.03 +/- 1.4 to 3.16 +/- 1.1 mmol/L), but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant change in the HDL-C and the ratios of APO-A1 to APO-B. We conclude that the use of VLCD is associated with changes in the lipid pattern that lower the cardiovascular risk profile in addition to the beneficial effects of weight loss itself.
