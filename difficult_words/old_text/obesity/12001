A silent polymorphism (1359 G/A) of the cannabinoid receptor gene was reported as a common polymorphism in white populations. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of this polymorphism (G1359A) of cannabinoid receptor gene on obesity, insulin resistance, and adipocytokines in women with obesity. A population of 290 women was analyzed. Indirect calorimetry, tetrapolar electrical bioimpedance, blood pressure measurement, serial assessment of nutritional intake with 3-day written food records, and biochemical analysis were performed. One hundred fifty-nine patients (54.8%) had the genotype G1359G (wild-type group), and 131 (45.2%) patients had G1359A (116 patients, 40.0%) or A1359A (15 patients, 5.2%) (mutant-type group). Triglycerides (122.3 ± 65.9 vs 107.2 ± 44.8 mg/dL, P &<.05), insulin (15.8 ± 9.4 vs 13.6 ± 6.9 mUI/L, P &<.05), and homeostasis model assessment values (3.85 ± 2.2 vs 3.33 ± 1.9, P &<.05) were higher in the wild-type group than the mutant-type group. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (56.8 ± 24.1 vs 58.3 ± 13.9 mg/dL, P &<.05) were higher in the mutant-type group than the wild-type group. The novel finding of this study is the association of the mutant-type group G1359A and A1359A with a better cardiovascular profile (triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment levels) than the wild-type group.
