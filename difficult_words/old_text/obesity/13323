Three cases of severe anorexia are reported. It results in a strong protein malabsorption with hepatic steatosis and in a syndrome of mental depression which needed the re-establishment of the intestinal-continuity. Although a mild post-operative anorexia is regular and contributes to the weight loss, massive anorexia must be considered as a new and redoubtable unpredictible complication of the surgical treatment for obesity, which may hinder the intestinal adaptation and increase the protein malabsorption.
