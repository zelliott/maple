Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common nonmalignant condition of the prostate occurring in ageing men. Even though BPH is a major public health problem, causing high morbidity and substantial worsening in men's quality of life, little is known about its risk factors. Several studies revealed that it is a multifactorial disease. Previous studies have documented family history, hormonal imbalance, and growth factors as etiological factors in the development of BPH. This review focuses on the dietary and metabolic risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, hyperinsulinemia, as well as dyslipidemia and their mechanisms in the pathogenesis of BPH.
