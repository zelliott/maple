Normal (&<200 mg/dL) serum concentrations of cholesterol and a favorable ratio of cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol are frequently seen in morbidly obese (body mass index [BMI]&> 35 kg/m2) patients. Because it is unknown whether this subgroup is characterized by differences in other potential markers of cardiovascular disease, serum concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and leptin were determined in 155 obese patients (BMI&> 35 kg/m2, aged 20 to 50 years) with normal (n = 72) or with elevated (n = 83) total serum cholesterol. We found that seemingly negative marginal correlations between serum concentrations of DHEAS and cholesterol, as well as between DHEAS and the ratio cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol, were not any more apparent after correction for age, sex, and BMI. A negative correlation between serum leptin concentrations and the ratio cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol persisted after correction for age, sex, and BMI. In morbid obesity, there appears to be an association between serum concentrations of leptin and a more favorable lipid profile, whereas there is no direct interrelation between serum concentrations of cholesterol and DHEAS.
