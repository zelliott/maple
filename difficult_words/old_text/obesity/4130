Little is knows about the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MS) among overweight first or second generation United States immigrant children/adolescents from Central/South America and the Caribbean basin.

Analysis of anthropometric and laboratory data (N = 224) in overweight children ages 3-18 (64% Hispanic, 25% AfroCaribbean/black, 8% white, 3% multiracial) was conducted. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of individual parameters of MS and the MS (defined as&> or =3 abnormal components).

The prevalence of the MS was 29% for the overall sample; an additional 28% had two MS components. Boys were significantly more likely than girls to have abnormal systolic blood pressure (P &<0.05). Hispanics were significantly more likely than blacks to have abnormal triglyceride and HDL cholesterol (P &<0.01 for both comparisons).

Our results indicate that both sub-groups of, and major ethnic groups (Mexican- and African American) are at equal risk for cardiometabolic disease. Early identification of MS in recent immigrant children may improve their future cardiometabolic health.
