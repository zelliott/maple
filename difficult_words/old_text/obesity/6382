To investigate whether the satiety-inducing agent sibutramine affected body weight and associated anthropometry in overweight and obese (body mass index (BMI)&> 27) Type 2 diabetic patients on sulphonylurea therapy.

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken in 134 patients with stable metabolic control on chronic sulphonylurea therapy. Patients were placed on moderate caloric restriction and received treatment with either sibutramine (15 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months.

Fifty-three of 69 sibutramine-treated and 57/65 placebo-treated patients completed the study. Both groups showed progressive weight loss. At the end of the trial weight loss was two times greater in the sibutramine group (mean +/- SEM; -4.5 +/- 0.5 kg) than placebo (-1.7 plus minus 0.5 kg, P &<0.001 vs. sibutramine). There was a trend for more patients to lose&> 5% of initial body weight in the sibutramine group than placebo. BMI (P &<0.001) and waist circumference (P &<0.001) were also decreased to a greater extent by sibutramine. Mean reductions in HbA(1c) were commensurate with weight loss in both the sibutramine and placebo (- 0.78 +/- 0.17% and -0.73 +/- 0.23%; P = 0.84). Sibutramine was well tolerated with only two patients withdrawn due to potentially drug-related serious adverse events (palpitations).

Sibutramine, in conjunction with moderate caloric restriction, enhances weight loss and reduces waist circumference in overweight and obese Type 2 diabetic patients receiving sulphonylurea therapy. This is associated with additional improvements in glycaemic control in a limited number of patients losing&> or = 10% of their baseline body weight.
