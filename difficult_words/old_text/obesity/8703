A high prevalence of obesity in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been described, but genetic and social influence in obesity has not been analyzed in this group of patients. The authors studied a population of 33 long-term (25 females, 8 males) in first remission who had reached their final height. All patients received cranial irradiation as part of their central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy and no patient received growth hormone. The body mass index (BMI: weight/height2) of patients and their biological parents was calculated and submitted to statistical analysis. Obesity was defined as BMI greater than the 85th centile. No excessive obesity was found among the males at final height. Fifty-six percent of the females were obese. In this group of 14 obese female survivors 59% had obese mother, but only 14% had obese fathers. The results indicate a significant maternal predisposition to obesity.
