To compare the efficacy of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and BioEnterics intragastric balloon (BIB) to lose weight and comorbidities after 12 months of follow-up before a more invasive bariatric procedure.

From January 2004 to December 2006, 40 patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a first step in biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Controls (n = 80) were selected based on charts of patients who, during the same period, underwent BioEnterics intragastric balloon therapy. In both groups we considered: length of procedure, hospital stay, intraoperative or endoscopic complications, postoperative or postendoscopic complications, comorbidities at baseline, after 6 months (time of BIB removal), and after 12 months from baseline, and weight loss parameters [weight in kg, percentage excess weight less (%EWL), body mass index (BMI), and percentage excess BMI loss (%EBL)]. Results are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation.

Mortality, intra- and postoperative complications (in LSG group), and intra- and postendoscopic complications (in BIB group) were absent. Mean operative time in the LSG group was 120 +/- 40 (range 60-200) min. Mean positioning time for BIB was 15 +/- 5 (range 10-25) min. BMI at baseline was 54.1 +/- 2.9 (range 45.1-55.9) kg/m(2) and 54.8 +/- 2.5 (range 45.1-56.2) kg/m(2) in BIB and LSG groups, respectively. At 6-month follow-up, mean BMI was 46.2 +/- 3.5 and 45.3 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2) in the BIB and LSG patients, respectively [p = not significant (ns)]. After 12 months BIB patients regained BMI, even if strictly followed with a diet regimen, while LSG patients continued to lose weight. Significant differences between groups were absent for the comorbidities considered.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and BioEnterics intragastric balloon are two valid options for producing weight loss as a first-step procedure. LSG has all the related risks of general anesthesia, laparoscopic surgery, and digestive anastomosis, whereas BIB presents a very low rate of minor complications, such as psychological intolerance. For all these reasons, at this time, BIB is considered a better option than LSG as a first-step procedure in the short term (12 months).
