The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of body mass index (BMI) on tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) success rates, patient satisfaction, and complications 1 year following surgery.

Baseline and 1-year postsurgery outcomes were abstracted, including Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) scores, Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7) scores, and patient satisfaction ratings. Multivariable logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to examine relationships between outcomes and BMI.

Subjects (N = 195) with a mean age of 59.3 +/- 12.6 were included. There was significant improvement within each group (all p values &<.01) in total UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores from baseline to 1 year postsurgery; all groups had high patient satisfaction. No differences in improvement or complications rates were observed among the BMI cohorts (all p values&>0.05).

Differential counseling of overweight or obese women regarding outcomes of the TVT procedure is not supported by these results; longer follow-up is warranted.
