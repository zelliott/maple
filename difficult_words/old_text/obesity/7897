Relative increases in unsaturated fatty acids (USFA) in the diet are considered to exert beneficial effects on coronary risk factors (CRF). However, detailed analysis of the relationships between serum USFA and CRF are scanty and there is no report of the relationship between nervonic acid (NA) and CRF. The objective of the present study was to analyze the relationships between serum USFA and CRF. Body height and weight, blood pressure, fasting serum total cholesterol (TC), triacyl-glycerol (TG), HDL cholesterol (HDLc), fasting blood sugar (FBS), total fatty acid composition, leptin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in 31 men (age, 41-78 years) and 11 women (age, 54-77 years). The relationships between serum USFA, and body mass index (BMI), leptin, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), TC, TG, HDLc, FBS, and CRP were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The final results were summarized using coronary risk factor scores (CRFS) in order to assess the correlations between USFA with CRF. Oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were positively related to coronary risk factors (total CRFS = 2, 3, and 4, respectively), while nervonic acid (NA) exerted negative effects on these risk factors (total CRFS = -6 ). It is concluded NA may have preventive effects on obesity-related metabolic disorders.
