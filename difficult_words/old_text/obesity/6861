Past studies have suggested that weight loss history is associated with subsequent weight loss. However, questions remain whether method and amount of weight lost in previous attempts impacts current weight loss efforts. This study utilized data from the Weight Loss Maintenance Trial to examine the association between weight loss history and weight loss outcomes in a diverse sample of high-risk individuals. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to determine which specific aspects of weight loss history predict change in weight during a 6-month weight loss intervention. Greater weight loss was predicted by fewer previous weight loss attempts with assistance (p = 0.03), absence of previous dietary/herbal weight loss supplement use (p = 0.01), and greater maximum weight loss in previous attempts (p &<0.001). Future interventions may benefit from assessment of weight loss history and tailoring of interventions based on past weight loss behaviors and outcomes.
