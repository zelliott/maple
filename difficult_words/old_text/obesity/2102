It is apparent that personality is related to the pathogenesis of obesity, and that understanding the personality of the patient may be a key to successful treatment of the disease. Using the Rorschach test and interviews by a psychiatrist, the types of personality were classified into four groups according to the healthiness of personalities. The judgment of healthiness was based mainly on the scores obtained from the Rorschach test. This classification revealed that the occurrence of mental and physical symptoms during therapy with a very low calorie diet (VLCD) and subsequent rebound of bodyweight were more frequently observed in patients with relatively less healthy personalities. We used this classification to adapt our program to treat obese patients. In this program, severe diet restrictions were applied to patients with relatively healthy personalities. These restrictions were applied with modifications to patients with less healthy personality, because severe restrictions would be possibly very stressful for them and would bring about an undesirable reaction. For strengthening the patients' motivation for therapy, the significance of body weight reduction was explained in different ways to patients with different types of personality. The target of bodyweight reduction, reward for patients with successful weight reduction, and the duration of therapy were set up differently for patients with different personalities types. The results showed that bodyweight rebound one or two years after treatment was reduced with the personality-oriented therapy program compared to that observed with the previous conventional therapies. Also, the incidence of psychological problems was remarkably decreased.
