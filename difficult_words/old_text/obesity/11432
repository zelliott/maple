Changes in body configuration that may affect the physical activity may play a role in the caloric consumption and led to the development of obesity.

To determine the presence of genu valgum, an alteration that may decrease physical activity and caloric expenditure, in overweight children.

Thirty-five overweight children without any endocrinological alterations that could lead to obesity were studied. Twenty-nine non-overweight children of a similar age were studied as a control group. In all children weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) were studied, and intermalleolar distance was used to measure the degree of genu valgum. The differences between groups were studied using ANOVA and the correlation between variables was determined using Pearson's correlation.

BMI was higher in overweight children than in the control group. Intermalleolar distance was greater in overweight children than in the non-overweight group (11.0 0.6 vs 2.90 0.43; p &<0.001). A positive correlation between the intermalleolar distance and the BMI was observed in the overweight group (p &<0.009). Fifty percent of the overweight children showed an intermalleolar distance of more than 10 cm, a value considered abnormal.

The incidence of genu valgum is much higher in overweight children than in non-overweight children of the same age. This alteration may lead to decreased physical activity and lead to obesity.
