The frequent connection between essential hypertension and lipid metabolism alterations has led doctors to look for possible pathogenic links between them. Common genetic factors as well as exogenous factors, like diet, have been described. The pathogenic mechanisms through which genetic or exogenic causes work, would be changes in cellular functions. This would be especially so in the case of membrane transporters and insulin resistance which may be a consequence, or a cause, of high blood pressure, but which give rise to lipid metabolism alterations. It is advisable to follow dietetic hygiene measures to combat hypertension and dyslipemic disorders, such as: weight loss, reduction of saturated fats fibre intake reduction of salt and alcoholic drinks, abstaining from tobacco and doing regular aerobic exercise. We will choose the drugs whose structure and doses will not alter lipid levels and will increase insulin sensitivity.
