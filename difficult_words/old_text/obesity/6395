Topiramate, a fairly new anticonvulsant, is increasingly being used as a mood stabilizer in bipolar and schizoaffective disorders. One common side effect is a reduced appetite that often results in weight loss. This finding raises the interesting question of whether both mood and body weight can be stabilized in patients who have gained weight while being treated with neuroleptics for one of the disorders mentioned above.

We studied the body weight, subjective sense of well-being, and psychopathology in two adolescent patients who were being treated with topiramate (alone or in combination with a neuroleptic drug). Both patients had reduced appetite, while body weight either remained stable or was reduced.

The patients reported both improved control of food intake and mood stabilization.

We conclude that adolescents with affective disturbance who have gained weight on neuroleptic drugs may benefit from topiramate in terms of mood stabilization and body weight control.
