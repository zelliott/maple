Agonists of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) receptors promote loss of excessive body fat (adiposity) and improve metabolic parameters associated with adiposity-induced adipose tissue dysfunction (adiposopathy or 'sick fat'). By improving adipose tissue pathogenic endocrine and immune responses in overweight patients, 5-HT receptor agonists may improve metabolic disease. Lorcaserin (APD-356) is a selective 5-HT2c receptor agonist that promotes weight loss. Probably owing to its selectivity for the 5-HT2c receptor, clinical trial evidence supports that lorcaserin does not adversely affect heart valves or pulmonary artery pressure. This review examines: the mechanisms by which serotonergic pathways improve adiposity and adiposopathy; historical data and perspective regarding the efficacy and safety of prior 5-HT agonists; speculation regarding future paradigms in treating adiposopathy; and why lorcaserin may prove to be a safe and generally well-tolerated agent that not only improves the weight of patients, but also improves the health of patients.
