Obesity involves inflammation. MCP-1, an inflammatory chemokine, and MCP-1-induced protein (MCPIP) are known to induce adipogenesis that causes increase in the number of adipocytes. Here we elucidate the intermediate processes through which MCPIP induces adipogenesis. Forced expression of MCPIP in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes caused increased reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) production and inducible-nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER), as indicated by expression of ER chaperones and protein disulfide isomerase, and autophagy as indicated by expression of beclin-1 and cleavage of LC3. Treatment of ROS inhibitor, apocynin attenuated MCPIP induction of adipogenesis as measured by the induction of transcription factors involved in adipogenesis, adipocyte markers and lipid droplet accumulation. Inhibition of ER stress with taurursodeoxycholate or knockdown of inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) inhibited MCPIP induced autophagy and adipogenesis. Preadipocytes in adipogenesis-inducing cocktail manifested ER stress and autophagy. Knockdown of MCPIP attenuated these effects. MCPIP induced p38 activation and p38 inhibitor, SB203580, attenuated MCPIP-induced adipogenesis.
