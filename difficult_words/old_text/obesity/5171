Levels of gastrin-cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity were measured in three brain regions (cortex, diencephalon, brainstem) and the pituitary gland in groups of genetically obese Zucker rats and their non-obese littermates. The obese animals had significantly increased body weights and significantly lowered brain weights. However, levels of gastrin-cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity were not different between the two groups in any of the regions measured. These results contrast with a recent report [11] in which ob/ob mice were found to have decreased levels of cholecystokinin in their brains.
