To examine whether high carbohydrate meals with different carbohydrate digestion rates have an effect on the short-term satiety in normal and obese preschool children.

In total, 48 children of both gender, 24 normal and 24 obese, according to body mass index, aged between 3 and 6 y, were selected from children who were attending to a day-care center where they consumed three meals in the day.

Rapid (potato-based meal) and lente (spaghetti-based meal) carbohydrate digestion rate meal were given at lunch, matching energy intake, carbohydrate, protein and fat levels, and then the preschool children's energy intake at the subsequent mealtime was observed. In this last mealtime, the children received varied types of high-acceptability foods in higher quantities than the normal serving.

At lunch, a significant higher energy intake, lesser satiation, was observed in both groups, normal-weight and obese children, when they consumed the potato-based meal. In the subsequent mealtime, a significant effect of carbohydrate digestion rate was demonstrated, but only in obese preschool children, being higher in the meal with rapid digestion rate carbohydrates.

Rapid carbohydrate digestion rate meal produced a significative lesser satiation in normal-weight and obese children. However, only in obese children a significant lesser satiety was observed after consumption of the rapid carbohydrate digestion rate meal, indicating a decreased capacity of energy regulation in obese children. The finding of the present work could provide dietary strategies required for decreasing prevalence in overweight and obesity in preschool children.
