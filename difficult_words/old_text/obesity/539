Metabolically intact NMRI mice and genetically obese NZO mice were fed ad lib. either a high-carbohydrate diet (standard) or a high-fat diet for a period of about 11 (NMRI mice) or 38 (NZO mice) wk. In both strains of mice, body weight increased more in the groups fed the high-fat diet. However, caloric intake by NMRI mice fed the high-fat diet was less than that of the controls. In NMRI mice fed the high-fat diet, epididymal and subcutaneous fat cell volumes increased; when these mice were fed the standard diet, only epididymal fat cell volume increased. Epididymal and subcutaneous fat cell numbers increased only in the group fed the high-fat diet. In NMRI mice fed either diet, the postprandial blood glucose was lower in older animals, but plasma insulin remained unchanged. The glucose tolerance deteriorated insignificantly. In NZO mice fed either diet, epididymal fat cell volumes and fat cell numbers increased. In this strain of mice the postprandial blood glucose and plasma insulin exhibited the strain-specific pattern, independent of the diet. In older animals fed either diet the glucose tolerance decreased.
