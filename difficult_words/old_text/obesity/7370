Differently from chronic hepatitis C, factors associated with hepatic steatosis in children with chronic hepatitis B are not clearly elucidated.

Aim of this study was to investigate prevalence of steatosis at liver biopsy in HBV-infected children.

A retrospective study including 56 children with chronic hepatitis B undergoing liver biopsy at median age of 8.1 years. In all patients demographic, anthropometric, clinical and laboratory data were evaluated at the time of liver biopsy.

Steatosis was present in 2 (4%) children. BMI was significantly higher in 2 patients with steatosis compared with those without steatosis. Demographic, biochemical and virological parameters did not differ between children with and those without steatosis.

Liver steatosis in HBV-infected children seems to be related to obesity and metabolic factors rather than to viral factors. Detection of steatosis in non-obese children with HBV infection requires a careful investigation to rule out other causes of fatty liver.
