The present study described excess weight gain in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated without cranial radiotherapy, and tested the hypothesis that reduced resting metabolic rate (RMR) predisposes children with ALL to excess weight gain. Changes in relative weight in 35 children were expressed as BMI standard deviation (s.d.) scores from diagnosis to 2 y post diagnosis. RMR was measured by ventilated hood indirect calorimetry in 27 patients who had been in positive energy balance and 27 healthy control children matched pairwise for gender and fat free mass (FFM). Mean change in BMI s.d. score to 2 y was +1.0 (s.d. 1.3), 95% CI +0.5 to +1.5 (paired t, P &<0.01). No significant differences in RMR were observed between patients and controls (paired t-test; analysis of covariance). We conclude that excess weight gain occurs during ALL therapy, even in the absence of cranial radiotherapy. Children with ALL who have been in positive energy balance do not appear to show abnormalities in RMR.
