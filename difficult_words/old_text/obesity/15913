Data on the prevalence of obesity in elderly population in Spain are scarce. The objective of this work was to describe the prevalence of obesity and the related factors in a random sample of Spanish population aged 60 years-old or more, stratified by autonomous communities.

We analyzed the PREV-ICTUS study, a population-based study carried out between September and December 2005 in a random sample stratified by autonomous communities according to the census of inhabitants and the habitat in each community. Subjects were classified as with normal weight (body mass index [BMI] &<25 kg), overweight (BMI 25-29.9) and obesity (BMI&> or = 30 kg).

In 6,843 subjects -mean age (standard deviation): 71.9 (7.1) years-old; 53.3% women-, prevalence of obesity was 34.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33.3-35.5%), higher in women (38.4%; 95% CI, 36.8-39.9%) than in men (30.0%; 95% CI, 28.4-31.6%; p &<0.001), with a tendency to decrease in the older population. In total, 81.7% of the population showed overweight (BMI&> or = 25). Prevalence differed among communities from 46.4% to 20.7% (p &<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, obesity was inversely related to age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.98 per each year increment), and directly to female gender (OR = 1.25), rural (OR = 1.50) or semi-urban habitat (OR = 1.38), sedentary lifestyle (OR = 1.86) and non-smoking history (OR = 1.19).

Obesity was present in one out of 3 individuals of this reasonably representative sample of the Spanish population in an age range, 60 years-old or more, which concentrates a high cardiovascular risk. Differences in the prevalence among autonomus communities were detected.
