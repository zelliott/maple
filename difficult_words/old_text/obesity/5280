This study reassesses the relative influence of internal and external cues on the behavior of obese and normal individuals. Specifically, the effects of external cues and food deprivation on preference ratings, consumption, and buying intentions were tested for overweight and normal subjects. Obese subjects were more reactive than normals to external cues as indicated by their eating more and intending to buy more food after viewing food slides as opposed to scenery slides. However, their behavior also changed in response to food deprivation, becoming more negative. The obese showed lower food consumption, lower buying intentions, and lower ratings of both food and nonfood slides in the empty condition compared to the full condition.
