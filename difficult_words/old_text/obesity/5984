Obesity is a worldwide health problem assuming epidemic proportions. Development of effective clinical interventions is needed to lower the impact of associated morbidity and mortality, without forgetting related costs. We have established an interdisciplinary clinic for obesity management, Unité d'Enseignement, de Traitement et de Recherche sur l'Obésité (UETRO), which consists of individual consultations combined with group sessions. We report here the effectiveness of this program for weight reduction over the first year of follow up.

We performed retrospective analysis of standardized patient records of the first 115 consecutive subjects referred to UETRO with available follow up for 1 year.

Mean age, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) of our cohort were 46 +/- 13 years, 44.7 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2), and 120.5 +/- 1.9 cm, respectively. Hypertension and diabetes were present in 46% and 23% of our patients. Weight and WC loss were gradual over 1 year and were significantly reduced by 6.6 +/- 0.8 kg and 6.7 +/- 0.7 cm, respectively (P &<0.001), without attainment of a plateau. Blood pressure and lipid profile significantly improved after 1 year of follow up. However, the proportion of patients taking metformin, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, or antiobesity drugs increased significantly over follow up, reflecting intensification of treatment of co-morbidities and weight management. Significant weight and WC loss occurred independently of diabetes status and use of antiobesity medications.

This program appears to be as effective for treating obesity as more intensive treatment programs. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the benefits and costs of this therapeutic approach.
