Bariatric surgery is currently the only effective long-term treatment of morbid obesity and its related co-morbidities. Gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, and duodenal switch with biliopancreatic diversion are the three most common operations performed in the United States to induce sustained weight loss. Patient selection is important since compliance postoperatively leads to a successful outcome in over 80% of patients. Preoperative psychological and behavioral problems may lead to maladaptive eating habits postoperatively that defeat the purpose of the surgery. To date, we do not have a 100% reliable method of profiling patients who will fail to keep weight off for the long term. It is therefore important that patients who have preoperative psychological problems that may lead to failure to lose or keep weight off after surgery are offered postoperative counseling along with group support.
