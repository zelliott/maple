To compare body mass index (BMI) of patients with open-angle glaucoma or normal-tension glaucoma with BMI in control subjects.

BMI was calculated for 288 control subjects, 42 patients with open-angle glaucoma with treated intraocular pressure (IOP) higher than 21 mmHg, 87 patients with open-angle glaucoma with progression of glaucomatous damage despite IOP less than 21 mmHg, and 57 patients with normal-tension glaucoma.

There was no statistical difference in BMI between patients with glaucoma and control subjects. If anything, there was a tendency for patients with glaucoma to have a lower BMI than control subjects.

These data show that obesity seems not to be a risk factor for glaucoma.
