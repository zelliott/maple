We report on a 34-year-old developmentally disabled man referred to our clinic for evaluation of possible Prader-Willi syndrome on the basis of obesity and voracious appetite. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis revealed a 47, XYY karyotype and the presence of a trinucleotide repeat expansion resulting in fragile X syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first report of concurrence of XYY and fragile X syndrome in the medical literature. Review of sex chromosome abnormalities associated with fragile X syndrome and phenotypic considerations are presented.
