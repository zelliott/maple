A representative nutritional hygienic survey was performed in a population of secondary school students (ageing from 15 to 18 years) between the years of 1997 and 2000. Herewith, the authors give an account on the anthropometric and blood pressure studies.



the representative sampling sites were selected randomly. In the capital three-stage, in the counties four-stage stratified groups were assigned for the studies. The data for 3071 girls and 3274 boys were evaluated. Anthropometric parameters determined were as follows, body mass, body height, waist and hip circumference. The body mass index (BMI) and the waist/hip ratio was calculated. Blood pressure values were recorded using OMRON M4 automatic device. Repeated blood pressure measurements were performed twice at least&> or = two weeks apart if the systolic blood pressure was 135 and/or the diastolic pressure was&> or = 85 mmHg. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows 9.0.

Out of the anthropometric parameters the gender and age-specific percentile distribution is given in regard to body mass, body height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist/hip ratio. There was a strong relationship between the waist circumference and BMI. Elevated blood pressure values were found at the first recording in 14.1% of boys and in 2.5% of girls. In students who presented three times, the incidence of high blood pressure was 7.5% in boys and 1.1% in girls. Only 1% of students was aware of his or her hypertension.

The representative survey provides reference values concerning body mass, body height, BMI, waist circumference, waist/hip ratio and blood pressure values in the age group of 15 to 18 years. It also provides data for the prevalence of hypertension and gives cut off values for the diagnosis of leanness, overweight and obesity.
