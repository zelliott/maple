The aim of the study was to investigate, whether the degree of metabolic risk factors for atherosclerotic complications in a very rare kind of obesity, the Multiple Symmetrical Lipomatosis, also known as the Launois-Bensaude Syndrome (LBS), are comparable or different from "simple" truncal obesity. 10 patients with LBS (Body mass index 34.4 +/- 1.8 kg/m(2), age: 62 +/- 3 yrs) were compared with 19 BMI - matched patients with "simple" truncal obesity and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) and 20 BMI- matched patients with "simple" truncal obesity without OSAS. Markers of subclinical inflammation and thrombocyte activation (sCD62p = soluble p-selectin, highly sensitive C-Reactive protein = CRP, Interleukin-6 = IL-6, ICAM-1 = Intracellular Adhesion Molecule-1, Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule = VCAM -1, leptin), as well as adiponectin and resistin were studied. The prevalence of atherogenic risk factors as hypertension (80%), type 2 diabetes (30%), OSAS (50%), smoking (30%) and alcohol abuse (80%) was high in the (obese) LBS group. The markers of subclinical inflammation and thrombocyte activation showed an indifferent picture with lower levels of circulating IL-6 and sCD62p, comparable CRP and higher ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 than in controls. Leptin and adiponectin were higher than in controls. However, the accumulation of "classic" cardiovascular risk factors in the LBS group was well reflected by the presence of symptomatic cardiovascular disease in 3 of the 10 LBS patients, putting LBS patients - if obese - at an atherosclerotic risk at least comparable to obese persons.
