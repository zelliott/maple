To evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Xiaopangmei, an experimental study by single method in three groups of rats was done. The first group were fed with Xiaopangmei-01, the second group with a placebo, and the third group were controls. As compared with the control and the placebo groups, the rats that had been fed Xiaopangmei for six weeks showed body weight, food intake, weight of epididymis fat pad and the intestinal absorption of glucose all significantly decreased. The swimming tolerance test showed they swam longer than the other two groups. No significant difference was found between the three groups in the growth and development indices such as body length, length of femur and tibia, weight of heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, stomach, small intestines, gastrocnemius muscle, and adrenal glands. No side effects were found on the liver and kidney. The secretion of insulin was inhibited after the swimming tolerance test and the gastrocnemius muscle test was similar for all three groups of rats. We concluded that Xiaopangmei is an effective anti-obesity drug.
