Breast duct obliteration and periductal elastosis were studied in 100 breast carcinomas with a maximum diameter of 20 mm or less. Seventy percent of all tumours and 90% of lobular and tubular carcinomas had obliterated ducts with radial scars at the centre of the lesion. Obesity, parity and diabetes mellitus had no apparent association with duct obliteration and periductal elastosis. The striking two peaks in age distribution suggest the presence of endocrine influences. Duct obliteration with periductal elastosis occurs where the breast shows most changes during development and involution making this the high risk zone for carcinogenesis.
