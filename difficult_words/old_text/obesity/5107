Four obese patients were given a single-meal diet for two periods of three days each. Blood samples were drawn every four hours for serum determinations of growthormone, cortisol and insulin. At same times urinary samples for urinary cathecholamines determination were collected. Cortisolemia showed a firm circadian rhythm in both regimens: there was a marked over-lap of the two confidences ellipsis so we could conclude for the independence of cortisol rhythm whith both regimes, but there occurred a significant difference in the acrofases between the two regimens. This could mean that meal-timing can play a major role in syncronizing catecholamines urinary excretion as far as subjects in supine position are concerned. No circadian rhythm was detected either in serum insulin or in HGH values.
