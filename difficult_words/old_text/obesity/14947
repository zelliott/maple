Childhood obesity rates are increasing globally. Physical activity is one behavioral variable that influences weight status. Participation in physical activity requires basic gross motor proficiency in early childhood. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between gross motor skill level and weight status in a large national representative sample of kindergarten-aged children.

Body mass index percentile ranking was calculated for 4650 children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort. Children were classified into underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese categories according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. The Early Screening Inventory Revised was used to evaluate gross motor skill level.

Children with obesity displayed lower gross motor skill levels compared with peers of healthy weight. Largest differences were seen in locomotor and balance skills.

Clinicians should consider adjusting gross motor expectations for locomotor or stability tasks in young children with obesity.
