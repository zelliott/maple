The multidisciplinary, four-phase approach, which includes PSMF, BEM, and MPE is successful in treating mild, moderate, and severe degrees of childhood and adolescent obesity. The MPE program is appropriate for use with PSMF and BEM due to its progressive nature, variety of options, and moderate intensity level. In addition, the MPE program is of sufficient intensity, duration, and frequency to promote a significant increase in estimated aerobic capacity (VO2max) and to promote the maintenance of lean body mass and resting energy expenditure. The short-term intervention of PSMF, BEM, and MPE also results in an improvement in body composition, lipid profiles, and IGF-1 and T3 levels. The 1200-calorie balanced diet, MPE, and BEM also provide a successful method of weight maintenance in children and adolescents, as indicated by further improvement in body composition at the 26-week measure. Additional studies are needed to assess the contribution of exercise to the maintenance of lean body mass and resting energy expenditure in obese children and adolescents. In addition, it will be important to assess long-term weight maintenance in obese adolescents who effectively lose weight in this multidisciplinary program.
