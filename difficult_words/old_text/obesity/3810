Adiponectin may be important in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome in youth.

The objective of the study was to determine the unique effect of adiponectin on the metabolic syndrome in overweight Latino youth.

Participants included 175 overweight children (aged 11.1 +/- 1.7 yr, body mass index percentile 97.3 +/- 2.9) with a family history of type 2 diabetes.

Metabolic syndrome was defined according to a pediatric adaptation of the Adult Treatment Panel III report and included dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, and prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance from a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test). Body composition was estimated via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, insulin sensitivity was quantified by the frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test, visceral fat was measured using magnetic resonance imaging, and adiponectin was determined in fasting serum.

In simple linear regression, adiponectin was significantly and inversely related to systolic blood pressure (P &<0.05), waist circumference (P &<0.001), triglycerides (P &<0.001), and 2-h glucose levels (P &<0.05) and positively related to high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P &<0.001). In multiple linear regression, adiponectin was significantly related to triglycerides (P &<0.01) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P &<0.01) independent of age, gender, Tanner stage, body composition, and insulin sensitivity. Analyses of covariance established that adiponectin levels were approximately 25% higher in healthy overweight youth, compared with those with the metabolic syndrome (12.5 +/- 3.5 vs. 9.4 +/- 2.8 microg/ml; P &<0.05). In multiple logistic regression, adiponectin was a significant independent predictor of the metabolic syndrome, even after adjustment for confounders including insulin sensitivity and visceral fat.

Hypoadiponectinemia is an independent biomarker of the metabolic syndrome, and thus, adiponectin may play a role in the pathophysiology of the disorder in overweight youth.
