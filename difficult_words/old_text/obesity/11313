Obesity is a critical risk factor for the development of metabolic syndrome, and many obese animal models are used to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the appearance of symptoms. To establish a new obese mouse model, we screened âˆ¼13,000 ICR mice and discovered a mouse demonstrating spontaneous obesity. We named this mouse "Daruma" after a traditional Japanese ornament. Following the fixation of the genotype, these animals exhibited obese phenotypes according to Mendel's law of inheritance. In the Daruma mouse, the leptin receptor gene sequence carried two base mutations that are good candidates for the variation(s) responsible for the obese phenotype. The Daruma mice developed characteristic visceral fat accumulation at 4 wk of age, and the white adipose and liver tissues exhibited increases in cell size and lipid droplets, respectively. No histological abnormalities were observed in other tissues of the Daruma mice, even after the mice reached 25 wk of age. Moreover, the onset of impaired leptin signaling was early and manifested as hyperleptinemia and hyperinsulinemia. Pair feeding completely inhibited obesity, although these mice rapidly developed hyperphagia and obesity followed by hyperleptinemia when pair feeding ceased and free-access feeding was permitted. Therefore, the Daruma mice exhibited unique characteristics and may be a good model for studying human metabolic syndrome.
