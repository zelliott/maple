To determine differences in dietary intake between overweight and non-overweight schoolchildren and differences in consumption during the day and in the course of the week.

Using a cross-sectional design, 32 schoolchildren (11-y-old) were selected at random. The parents of children recorded dietary intake for a week using the food weighing method. The children were considered to be overweight when the weight for height was higher than 90th percentile.

Some 46.9% of examined schoolchildren were considered overweight. Percentage energy intake reported was significantly lower in the overweight group compared to the non-overweight children (8948.7 vs 9590.1 kJ/day; P&<.01). Carbohydrate intake was significantly greater in the non-overweight schoolchildren (250.9+/-58.8 vs 222.1+/-77.4 g/day; P&<.01). The difference in protein intake between week and weekend days was significant (81.6+/-25.5 in the week days vs 73.9+/-21.4 g/day in the weekend days; P&<.05).

The data suggest the belief that overweight children eat more than non-overweight children is not correct. These findings suggest that the positive energy balance causing overweight is due possibly to a low energy output.
