Prolylcarboxypeptidase (PrCP) is a serine protease that may have a role in metabolism regulation. A class of reversible, potent, and selective PrCP inhibitors was developed starting from a mechanism based design for inhibiting this serine protease. Compound 8o inhibits human and mouse PrCP at IC(50) values of 1 and 2 nM and is not active (IC(50)&> 25 Î¼M) against a panel of closely related proteases. It has lower serum binding than its close analogues and is bioavailable in mouse. Subchronic dosing of 8o in PrCP(-/-) and WT mice at 100 mg/kg for 5 days resulted in a 5% reduction in body weight in WT mice and a 1% reduction in PrCP KO mice.
