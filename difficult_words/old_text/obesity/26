In February 1985, the National Institutes of Health sponsored the Consensus Development Conference on the Health Implications of Obesity. The panel of experts concluded that height and weight tables based on mortality data and the body mass index (BMI) are helpful measures to determine the presence of obesity and the need for treatment.
