This study examined patient demographics, length of hospital stay, and discharge disposition in those undergoing nonelective revision total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) vs elective rTHA. Data from 23 000 patients with hip revisions from 2005 through 2007 were extracted from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. We examined patient admission status, demographics, length of stay, and discharge location. We found that patients undergoing nonelective rTHA were older, were female, had more comorbidities, stayed an excess of 1.61 days in the hospital, and required a skilled care facility after discharge compared with those undergoing elective rTHA. We found that rTHA outcomes varied based on patient hospital admission status. Patients who elected to have rTHA had less comorbidities, cost, and likelihood of being discharged into a skilled care facility.
