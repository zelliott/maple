Buschke sclerodema is a very rare disease. Our objective was to show that persistent scleredema is frequent in certain group of patients at risk.

We studied 49 patients, diagnosed between 1995 and 1999 in dermatology, pneumology and endocrinology departments in Martinique. Diagnosis was performed on classical clinical and histopathological aspects of sclerodema. Data studied were age, sex, mode of occurrence, clinical and histopathological aspects and associated diseases.

The 49 patients presented with cutaneous infiltration of the upper part of the trunk, with thick dermis and large collagen bundles on histopathological examination. Forty-two had mucoid substance deposition, stained with Alcian Blue (this criteria was considered as inconstant by most authors in the literature). Sex ratio H/F was 0.06 (93 p. 100 females). Mediam age at onset was 50 years ranging from 20 to 79 years. The occurrence was insidious in 97 p. 100 of cases. All patients had neck and nuchae involvement. The disease involved the back in 93 p. 100, upper limbs in 50 p. 100 and lower limbs and face in 43 p. 100 of patients. Fifty-six percent of patients had limitation of shoulder movements, 16 p. 100 limitation of mouth opening, 20 p. 100 limitation of eyelid opening, 36 p. 100 had myalgia, 73 p. 100 had pruritus and 66 p. 100 had dyspnea. Obesity was present in 95 p. 100, diabetes in 79.5 p. 100, elevated blood pressure in 81.5 p. 100 and monoclonal dysglobulinemia in 46 p. 100 of patients. Twenty-five patients had a polysomnography showing severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

The large number of patients in our study can be explained by the search for sclerodema in patients with obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. The disease is usually unknown by patients and physicians unless a systematic examination is performed. Association with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was not previously reported and a larger study is ongoing.
