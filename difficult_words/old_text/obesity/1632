This systematic review considers current literature on the association between childhood overweight and obesity and the primary school built environment. Bibliographic databases from the fields of medicine, social science, exercise science and education were systematically searched. The following elements of the built environment were found to have been investigated: playground availability and adequacy; gymnasium availability and adequacy; school field, showers and covered playground availability. One intervention study was identified which utilized the built environment as an adjunct to a behavior change intervention. This systematic review identified minimal research upon the association between the school built environment and weight status and the current results are inconclusive.
