The study of the behaviour profile in subjects with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS).

A total of fifty-eight 3- to 29-year-old subjects with PWS were studied using a standardized parent report of behavioural and emotional disturbances.

There was an increase of behavioural and emotional disturbances for the adolescent and young adult age range, whereas gender and intelligence were not significant. Increasing body mass index (BMI) was also associated with more behavioural and emotional disturbances. There was no significant relation between genetic status and behavioural abnormalities.

This systematic study supports single case observations of a heightened psychiatric vulnerability of adolescent and young adult PWS subjects.
