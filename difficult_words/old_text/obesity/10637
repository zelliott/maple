The aim of this study was to examine whether there is an association of insulin sensitivity with periodontal infection in a non-diabetic, non-smoking adult population.

A subpopulation of the Health 2000 Survey (effective n=2050) consisted of dentate subjects without any indication of diabetes, aged between 30 and 64, and who had never smoked. The outcome variable was periodontal infection measured by means of the number of teeth with deepened periodontal pockets. Insulin sensitivity was measured using the homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals.

We found that insulin sensitivity was associated with periodontal infection in the age group 30-49, but not in persons aged 50-64. Controlling for body weight made the association between insulin sensitivity and periodontal infection disappear.

The lack of knowledge of the underlying causal model prevents making definite conclusions about the role of reduced insulin sensitivity in the pathogenesis of periodontal infection.
