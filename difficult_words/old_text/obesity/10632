Several studies have suggested that the association between obesity and asthma may be stronger in females than in males, but the reason is still unclear.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether differences in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels explain why obesity is associated with asthma in females but not in males.

This study prospectively enrolled 754 subjects ≥ 18 years old from hospital-based asthma patients and population-based controls. We measured adiposity factors [body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and waist-hip ratio], hs-CRP and total IgE levels.

After adjusting for potential confounding factors, we found a significant association between BMI and asthma in females with a significant interaction of gender and BMI on asthma (χ(2) =10.2, P=0.004). If hs-CRP was added to the logistic model, the interaction was attenuated but still significant (χ(2) =7.02, P=0.03). After adjusting for BMI, we did not find that circulating hs-CRP concentrations were significantly associated with asthma in males and females.

We found that BMI was associated with asthma in females, but our results do not support the suggestion that hs-CRP levels contribute significantly to the link between obesity and asthma with respect to gender disparity.
