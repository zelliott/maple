Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are a new class of antihyperglycemic drugs that block degradation ofincretin hormones.

To assess the effects oftreatment with DPP-4 inhibitors on glucoregulation and body weight in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The study included 9 females and 9 males with type 2 diabetes (n=18), BMI=31.24 +/- 2,26 kg/m2, mean age 58 +/- 6,8 years. The patients have been thoroughly evaluated before treatment, and 6 months after treatment with DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) in combination with metformin.

After 6 months of treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors in combination with metformin HbAlc (-1,49%)., FBG (-3.75 mmol/L) and PBG (-5.79 mmol/L) significantly reduced (p=0.000). Mean body weight also significantly reduced (-12.5%; p=0.000). Reduction of mean fasting insulin was 5.46 mIU/L or 27% (p=0.000). Mean HOMA-IR change was -1.64 (p=0.000). Also there was significant decreasing of systolic blood pressure (p=0.001), cholesterol (p=0.004), triglycerides (p=0.001), LDL (p=0.002) and increasing of HDL (p=0.002). Hypoglycaemia was not registered in any of the patients.

These results show that in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, DPP-4 inhibitors treatment in combination with metformin was associated with improvements in glycaemic control, and a reduction in body weight.
