This article presents a unique method for providing weight management assistance to persons who have experienced an acquired brain injury (ABI). Most of the available literature on this topic deals with weight loss methods for individuals who are not faced with the cognitive and behavioural challenges inherent in this population. A treatment selection protocol will be described that allows for appropriate selection of behavioural weight loss interventions. Interventions are based upon specific cognitive and behavioural difficulties that individuals with acquired brain injury may present. A detailed case study will also be presented depicting successful use of the treatment selection model with an adult male with an acquired brain injury.
