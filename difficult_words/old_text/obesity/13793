Type 2 diabetes and obesity are characterised by insulin and leptin resistance. Studies suggest that these may be due to defects in the insulin and leptin signalling pathways. Over the last decade, a considerable body of evidence has been amassed indicating that protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is involved in the downregulation of insulin and leptin signalling. Consequently, compounds that inhibit PTP1B have potential as therapeutics for treating Type 2 diabetes and obesity. This review covers recent advances in PTP1B inhibitors with an emphasis on recent attempts to create potent, selective and cell-permeable small-molecule inhibitors.
