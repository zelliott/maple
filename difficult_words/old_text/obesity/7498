Obesity is associated with increased body fat composition and elevated risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. The activity of the renin-angiotensin system is generally increased in obesity and experimental evidence has shown that angiotensin influences appetite and metabolism as well as mechanisms that induce adipose tissue growth and metabolism in peripheral organs. This review summarises some of the key evidence from animal and human experiments that links the renin-angiotensin system to obesity and metabolic disease. This research has been greatly aided by the continuing development of new pharmaceuticals that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. While their primary use is in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, a range of experimental and clinical evidence indicates their potential use in the treatment of obesity and metabolic disease.
