It was demonstrated that estrogen deficiency and consuming high fat (HF) diet enhanced orexigenic activity of ghrelin. Therefore, we hypothesized that antagonizing of ghrelin action would attenuate food intake and body weight in mice obese both from ovariectomy (OVX) and feeding a HF diet. Ghrelin receptor antagonist [D-Lys(3)]GHRP-6 after seven days of subcutaneous treatment markedly decreased food intake in OVX mice fed both HF and standard diets; furthermore, it reduced body weight and blood glucose, insulin and leptin, and increased Î²-hydroxybutyrate level and uncoupling-protein-1 mRNA in brown adipose tissue. Pair-feeding revealed that effect of [D-Lys(3)]GHRP-6 was primary anorexigenic. Estrogen supplementation reduced anorexigenic effects of [D-Lys(3)]GHRP-6. OVX [D-Lys(3)]GHRP-6 treatment in mice on HF diet resulted in markedly increased circulating level and liver expression of a major metabolic regulator, fibroblast growth factor 21. Our data suggest that ghrelin antagonists could be especially beneficial in individuals with common obesity combined with estrogen deficiency.
