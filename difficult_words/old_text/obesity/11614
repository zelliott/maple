The effect of very low calorie diet (VLCD) on fat-free mass (FFM) and physiological response to exercise is a topic of current interest. Ten moderately obese women (aged 23-57 years) received VLCD (1695 kJ.day-1) for 6 weeks. FFM, estimated by four conventional techniques, and heart rate (fc), blood lactate (la(b)), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory exchange ratio (R) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured during a submaximal cycle ergometry test 1 week before, in the 2nd and 6th week, and 1 week after VLCD treatment. Strength and muscular endurance of the quadriceps and hamstrings were tested by isokinetic dynamometry. The 11.5-kg reduction in body mass was approximately 63% fat and 37% FFM. The latter was attributed largely to the loss of water associated with glycogen. Whilst exercise fc increased by 9-14 beats.min-1 (P &<0.01), there were substantial decreases (P &<0.01) in submaximal MAP (1.07-1.73 kPa), la(b) (0.75-1.00 mmol.l-1 and R (0.07-0.09) during VLCD. R and fc returned to normal levels after VLCD. Gross strength decreased (P &<0.01) by 9 and 13% at 1.05 rad.s-1 and 3.14 rad.s-1, respectively. Strength expressed relative to body mass (Nm.kg-1) increased (P &<0.01) at the lower contraction velocity, but there was no change at the faster velocity. Muscular endurance also decreased (P &<0.01) by 62 and 82% for the hamstrings and quadriceps, respectively. We concluded that the strength decrease was a natural adaptation to the reduction in body mass as the ratio of strength to FFM was maintained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
