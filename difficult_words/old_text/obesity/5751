One particularly interesting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6235 (encoding an S690T substitution), in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) gene has been widely associated with obesity in several European cohorts. The present study was intended to investigate the association between the PCSK1 rs6235 SNP and the prevalence of overweight or obesity, or obesity-related metabolic traits in a Taiwanese population. A total of 964 Taiwanese subjects with general health examinations were analyzed. Our data revealed no association of PCSK1 rs6235 with the risk of obesity or overweight in the complete subjects. However, the PCSK1 rs6235 SNP exhibited a significant association with overweight among the male subjects (P=0.03), but not among the female subjects. Furthermore, the carriers of GG variant had a significantly higher waist circumference than those with the CC variant (82.5 ± 11.5 vs. 81.2 ± 10.2 cm; P=0.01) and those with the CG variant (82.5 ± 11.5 vs. 81.4 ± 10.4 cm; P=0.021). In addition, the carriers of GG variant had a higher diastolic blood pressure than those with the CC variant (81.9 ± 14.2 vs. 80.3 ± 12.9 mm Hg; P=0.023). Our study indicates that the PCSK1 rs6235 SNP may contribute to the risk of overweight in men and predict obesity-related metabolic traits such as waist circumference and diastolic blood pressure in Taiwanese subjects.
