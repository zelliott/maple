The activities of jejunal carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes show adaptive drugs, and sex hormones. To learn whether insulin, tolbutamide, and glucagon had effects on these enzymes, we performed serial peroral jejunal biopsies in normal young men and in obese patients, before and after treatment with these agents. Jejunal mucosa was assayed for glycolytic enzyme activities, pyruvate kinase (PK), hexokinase (HK), and fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase (FDPA), and the nonglycolytic enzyme activity, fructose diphosphatase (FDPase). Insulin significantly increased the activity of jejunal PK (+48% change from control) and HK (+6%), decreased the activity of FDPase (-36%),and had no effect on FDPA. Glucagon had opposite effects; the activity of PK was decreased (-33%) and FDPase was increased (+50%). Tolbutamide significantly increased the activities of PK (+47%), HK (+14%), and FDPA (+7%), and decreased the activities of FDPase (-36%). The results of tolbutamide on glycolytic enzyme activities were independent of endogenous insulin. The data support the concept that jejunal carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes in man respond to hormones and drugs similar to responses observed in rat liver. This is important because it now gives us a means of studying the actions of these hormones directly in human tissue.
