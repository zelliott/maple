The aim of the study was to analyze the effects of sex-specific distribution of adiposity, particularly emphasizing the independent contribution of waist and hip circumferences relative to body mass index (BMI), on cardiovascular risk factors in a Chinese population. Blood pressure and anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured in 2510 population-based Chinese subjects. The relative contributions of waist and hip circumferences to the presence of cardiovascular risk factors were determined. The Chinese men were significantly larger than women, with greater BMI and central adiposity. Waist and hip circumferences were both positively associated with the presence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. However, after adjustment for BMI and age, hip circumference exhibited a significant dose-dependent inverse relationship with dyslipidemia and diabetes in women, but not men. Sex-specific differences exist. After adjustment for age and BMI, hip circumferences independently and inversely contribute to cardiovascular risk in women, but not in men. Increasing adjusted waist circumference was associated with increased risk of hypertension and diabetes in Chinese and dyslipidemia in women only.
