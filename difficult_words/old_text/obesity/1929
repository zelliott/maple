In the present study the effect of long-term fasting (6 days) on obese (ob) gene expression was examined in nine severely obese females of 34 +/- 3 years and with a body mass index of 46.4 +/- 2.3 kg/m2. Six days of fasting induced a significant weight loss (126.8 +/- 5.3 vs 120.5 +/- 5.1 kg, P &<0.0001). Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp, insulin infusion rate 1.5 mU/kg per min) was markedly reduced following fasting (M-value 5.96 +/- 0.74 vs 2.79 +/- 0.23 mg/kg per min, P &<0.0001). Ob mRNA/beta-actin concentration in fat biopsies from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was unchanged after 6 days of fasting (1.50 +/- 0.40 vs 1.47 +/- 0.36 arbitrary units, not significant), whereas serum leptin levels decreased significantly from 53.8 +/- 4.7 to 30.7 +/- 2.0 ng/ml (P &<0.0001) during the same period. No significant correlations were found between insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and serum leptin concentration, either prior to the fast or after the fast. Serum leptin levels were unchanged by hyperinsulinemia for 3 h during the clamp prior to the fast, while hyperinsulinemia for 3 h after 6 days of fasting increased serum leptin by 25% (P &<0.01). In conclusion, 6 days of fasting reduced serum leptin by about 40%. In contrast, ob mRNA in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was unchanged. Furthermore, after 6 days of fasting insulin was able to increase the serum level of leptin significantly, indicating that the effect of insulin on the level of leptin is dependent on the nutritional state.
