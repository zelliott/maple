In a population of 689 patients with primary total hip arthroplasties, perioperative problems and complications were investigated. A preoperative cardiovascular disease was found in 32%, obesity in 18% of the patients. The death-rate was 0.43% in a population of patients, two thirds of whom was older than 60 years, one third even older than 70 years. The importance in preoperative evaluation of health and in treatment of various diseases is emphasized.
