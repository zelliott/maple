To investigate the effect of maternal body mass index (BMI) on minor complications, associated additional medication use during pregnancy and the consequent cost implications.

Retrospective analysis of case notes.

Labour wards, tertiary referral hospital, Royal Infirmary Edinburgh, UK. Population Six hundred and fifty-one women with a singleton pregnancy over four separate time periods in 2007 and 2008.

Descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis and cost analysis using standard techniques and inflation indices.

Minor complications, use of medications during pregnancy and consequent incremental costs from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS).

42.4% of women were overweight or obese (BMI&> or = 25 kg/m(2)). Higher BMI during the first trimester (BMI&> or = 30 kg/m(2) compared with BMI &<25 kg/m(2)) was associated with an increased risk of minor complications including symphysis pubis dysfunction (OR 3.97; 95% CI 2.19-7.18), heartburn (OR 2.65; 95% CI 1.42-4.94) and chest infection (OR 8.71; 95% 2.20-34.44) and with drugs used to treat these complications including Gaviscon (OR 3.52; 95% CI 1.78-6.96). The mean incremental (additional) NHS costs per woman for treating minor complications increased with maternal BMI were 15.45 pounds/woman, 17.64 pounds/woman and 48.66 pounds/woman for BMI &<25 kg/m(2), BMI&> or = 25 to &<0 kg/m(2) and BMI&> or = 30 kg/m(2) respectively.

Increased maternal BMI is associated with increased risk of developing minor complications during pregnancy; use of medications associated with treating these conditions and has significant NHS costs.
