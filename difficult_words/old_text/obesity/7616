The relationship between food intake patterns and obesity remains unclear. The objective of the present review was to evaluate the current body of literature on food intake patterns of older adults and their associations with weight status, including obesity and waist circumference. Eleven observational studies were identified and reviewed. Diets characterized by more favorable dietary scores or indices were generally inversely related to body mass index. Results from data-driven approaches were inconsistent. Findings from this literature review suggest that there is no clear relationship between food intake patterns and body mass index or waist circumference in older adults. Limitations, including heterogeneity of food intake patterns and study populations, hinder the ability to make clear comparisons. Continued efforts to elucidate the relationship between food intake patterns and weight status indicators in older adults, including longitudinal analyses and use of novel statistical approaches for food intake pattern identification, are warranted.
