The VNTR polymorphism 5' of the insulin gene has been related to obesity in a previous study on children with early onset of severe obesity. Our purpose was to analyze the association between this polymorphism and adiposity variability in an unselected population of children and adolescents in northern France.

In 293 nuclear families from the Fleurbaix Laventie Ville Sant√© study, we genotyped the INS VNTR polymorphism in 431 children and adolescents (8 to 18 years of age) and their parents. Overweight was defined according to the international definition in both children and adults. A transmission disequilibrium test in families with an overweight offspring was performed. The prevalence of overweight was compared according to genotype. The effect of the genotype on BMI and waist circumference was tested with a linear regression model, adjusting for age, gender, and Tanner stage.

There was an undertransmission of class III alleles from heterozygous parents to their overweight offspring (p &<0.002). Overweight was associated with class I alleles in children and adolescents (12% I/I, I/III vs. 3% III/III; p &<0.08). Those with a class III/III genotype had a 1 kg/m(2) lower mean BMI (p = 0.04) and 3 cm lower waist circumference (p = 0.02) than those bearing one or two class I alleles. No association of adiposity or obesity with class I alleles was found in parents.

INS VNTR polymorphism seems to contribute to differences in adiposity level in the general population of children and adolescents.
