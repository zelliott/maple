Perilipin is a class of protein-coating lipid droplets in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells. Our purpose was to examine the association between common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the perilipin (PLIN) locus and obesity, as well as related phenotypes, in unrelated American adults.

Four PLIN SNPs (PLIN 6209T>C, 11482&>A, 13041&>G, and 14995&>T) were typed in 734 white subjects (373 men and 361 women) attending a residential lifestyle intervention program. The baseline anthropometric and biochemical measures were used. Obesity was defined as BMI&> or = 30 kg/m(2).

Multivariate analysis demonstrated that, in women, two of the SNPs (13041&>G, and 14995&>T) were significantly associated with percentage body fat (p = 0.016 for 13041&>G and p = 0.010 for 14995&>T) and waist circumference (p = 0.020 for 13041&>G and p = 0.045 for 14995&>T). Moreover, haplotype analysis using these two SNPs indicated that haplotypes A/T and G/T were both associated with significantly increased obesity risk (odds ratio = 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.90 for haplotype A/T, and odds ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 2.82 for haplotype G/T) when compared with haplotype A/A. No significant associations between PLIN variations and obesity were found in men.

Our data support the hypothesis that the PLIN locus may be a significant genetic determinant for obesity risk in whites and that women are more sensitive to the genetic effects of perilipin than men.
