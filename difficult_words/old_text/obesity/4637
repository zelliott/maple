Oxidative stress results from a disparity between the generation of reactive oxygen species and the antioxidant ability of the organism. The alteration of the oxidant-antioxidant system brings in adults an effective state of imbalance, which may influence the pathogenesis of many diseases. Oxidative stress also plays a pivotal role in the progression of various pathologies in childhood, through a manipulation of regulatory proteins. In fact, several studies have demonstrated that an unbalanced oxidant-antioxidant status is able to determine toxic effects even during infancy. Therefore, the aim of this review was to summarize current knowledge about the dynamic relationship between oxidative stress and systemic diseases during childhood. In order to better understand these complex mechanisms, a comprehensive review of the literature was done, focusing mainly on pre-pubertal children. In fact, this age-group offers a unique opportunity to exclude confounding factors, especially those related to the metabolic effects induced by puberty. Early identification of these very young patients should be aimed at minimizing the degree of oxidative damage. Only by achieving early diagnosis, will it be possible to identify those children who could benefit from specific therapeutic approaches targeting oxidative stress.
