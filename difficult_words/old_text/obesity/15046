The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential importance of oxidative stress, measured by isoprostanes-related compounds, as non-traditional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We planned to examine the relationship between concentrations of plasma F₂-isoprostanes (F₂-IsoPs), isofurans (IsoFs), measures of obesity and various cardiometabolic risk factors.

Cross-sectional study using a sub-sample from the population of a survey conducted in the summer and fall 2007 and 2008 by Canadian Coastguard Ship Amundsen in 36 Canadian Arctic Inuit communities. Subjects included a subset (n = 233) of a total study population (n = 2595) with a mean age 42.56 ± 15.39 years and body mass index 27.78 ± 5.65 kg/m². Plasma levels of F₂-IsoPs and IsoFs was determined by gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization/mass spectrometry (GC/NICI/MS) method; and their relationships to waist circumference (WC), blood pressure C reactive proteins (CRP), blood lipids and fasting glucose were assessed by multivariate analyses.

Plasma F₂-IsoPs correlated positively with CRP (r =.132, P =.048) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (r =.157, P =.024) after adjustment for age, sex and body mass index. IsoFs correlated with WC (r =.190, P =.005) and SBP (r =.137, P =.048). F2-IsoPs were not found elevated in smokers (P =.034), whereas IsoFs were decreased in smokers (P =.001). WC, SBP and sex were found to be major correlates of oxidative stress in Canadian Inuit.

Plasma measures of F₂-IsoPs and IsoFs increase with increased obesity and associated cardiometabolic risk factors, including CRP and blood pressure. Simultaneous measurement of IsoFs provides an advantageous mechanistic insight into oxidative stress not captured by F₂-IsoPs alone.
