Patients over age 40 should be made aware of the triad of risk factors for the disease and taught to recognize common signs and symptoms. Those with high-risk profiles should be tested regularly and counseled regarding preventive and therapeutic strategies. For obese patients whose weight cannot be brought under control with diet and exercise alone, a trial of anorectic agents should be considered.
