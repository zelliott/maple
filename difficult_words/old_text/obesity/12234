The aim of our study was to investigate the interaction of tryptophan-to-arginine (Trp64Arg) missense mutation in the beta3 adrenoreceptor (Beta3AR) with polymorphism in the UCP3 promotor (-55C&>T) on insulin resistance in obese patients.

A population of 212 obese patients was analyzed. A bipolar electrical bioimpedance, a biochemical analysis and concentrations of adipocytokines were assessed.

One hundred and sixty-two patients (76.4%) had the genotype Trp64/Trp64 (wild type group) and 50 patients Trp64/Arg64 (23.6%) (mutant type group). One hundred and seventy five (87.2%) had the genotype -55CC (wild type group) and 27 patients (22.8%) -55CT (mutant type group). Five patients (2.4%) had both polymorphisms Trp64/Arg64 and -55CT. Patients with one or both mutant genotypes had higher BMI, weight, fat mass, systolic blood pressure and waist circumference than wild type patients. Patients with 55CT or 55CT and Trp64Arg genotype had higher BMI, weight, fat mass, waist circumference, waist to hip ratio glucose, insulin, triglycerides and HOMA than wild type or Trp64Arg mutation.

Higher concentrations of insulin, HOMA, triglycerides, glucose, BMI, weight, fat mass, waist to hip ratio and waist circumference were observed in patients with -55CT genotype alone or -55CT plus Trp64Arg genotypes than in patients without mutation or only Trp64Arg mutation.
