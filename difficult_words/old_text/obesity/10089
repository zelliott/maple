A follow-up study was conducted to identify the heart disease risk-factor status and dietary changes of surviving elderly subjects in Crete who took part in the Seven Countries Study in 1960. In 1991, data were obtained from 245 of the 686 original male participants (169 of the original 40-49-y age group and 76 men 50-59 y age group). In 1991, the men were 70-79 and 80-89 y old. There was a significant (11.5%) increase in serum total cholesterol concentrations between 1960 and 1991. Body mass index and systolic and diastolic blood pressures also increased significantly, and all age groups were characterized by central obesity. A representative subsample of 21 men took part in a 3-d weighed food record study. Dietary data indicated increases in the intake of saturated fat and decreases in monounsaturated fat over the 30-y period. Comparison with a 1962 representative Cretan sample indicated a significantly increased concentration of adipose palmitic acid (16:0) in our surviving sample. The observed changes occurred during a period when many developed countries were observing a decline in most heart disease risk factors.
