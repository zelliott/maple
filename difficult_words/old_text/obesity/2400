Whether or not obesity per se is an independent risk factor remains controversial. However, a variety of studies have shown that obesity precipitates certain well-known risk factors, such as glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, hyperestrogenemia, hypertension, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Distribution of adipose tissue also seems to influence cardiovascular risk; patients with predominantly male-pattern obesity exhibit more profound risk for cardiovascular disease.
