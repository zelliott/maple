Patients with diabetes display increased platelet activation. Recent data show a markedly increased risk for cardiovascular events already in pre-diabetic individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). We investigated whether IGT is associated with platelet activation. Blood samples were collected from young lean (control) and obese Zucker rats, an established model of IGT, after single oral application of sucrose (4 g.kg-1). Platelet-bound fibrinogen and platelet surface-expression of P-selectin were assessed as indices of platelet activation using flow cytometry. In lean Zucker rats, acute sucrose application induced fibrinogen-binding and P-selectin surface-expression, which was prevented by co-administration of acarbose (10 mg.kg-1). In obese Zucker rats, platelet activation was already maximally increased under baseline conditions with no significant increase after sucrose application. Chronic treatment with acarbose (15 mg.kg-1.day-1) significantly reduced platelet activation in these animals. Acute ingestion of sucrose induces platelet activation which is prevented by acarbose. IGT is associated with marked platelet activation that can be reduced by chronic administration of acarbose. The positive modulation of platelet activation by acarbose may contribute to the reduction of cardiovascular events in patients with IGT.
