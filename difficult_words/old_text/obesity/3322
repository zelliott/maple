High blood pressure and impaired glucose tolerance are frequently associated with obesity: it has been suggested that hyperinsulinemia could represent one of the possible pathogenetic connections between obesity and systodiastolic hypertension. In order to verify this hypothesis we examined fasting and post-load insulin and glucose levels in a group of 102 obese females, 58 hypertensive and 44 normotensive. All of the subjects underwent standard OGTT in order to measure their glycemic and insulinemic levels. No differences were found between two groups, as regard age and degree of obesity; blood pressure values were significantly different (p less than 0.01). No significative differences were detected for glycemic and insulinemic levels between hypertensive and normotensive subjects. These results indicate that hyperinsulinemia is not the prominent link between obesity and arterial hypertension; the relationship between these two conditions may be indirect.
