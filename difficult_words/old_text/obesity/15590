Knowing the grave health consequences of adult obesity and the fact that a high percentage of these adults were obese as children we propose, using a transverse epidemiological study that includes anthropometric measurements and dietary surveys, to learn how this phenomena impacts our area of health care. The prevalence of juvenile obesity (from 6 to 13 years of age) in our community was analyzed, along with factors that are related to its development. The results of our study allow us to draw the following conclusions: The prevalence of juvenile obesity in our community (26%) is considerably higher than the national average (6-15% as of 1991). The factors that significantly influence the development of juvenile obesity are: degree of physical activity, genetic and environmental influences, and conditional behaviors of eating.
