Obesity and diabetes have become the most common human health problems worldwide. Obesity's contribution to type 2 diabetes might be due to dysregulation of adipokines and glucose uptake.

In this study, we performed in-vivo and in-vitro studies to evaluate the effects of Platycodon grandiflorum extract (PGE) on adipokines and glucose uptake. Before study, platycodin D concentrations were analysed by HPLC in PGE prepared in water, in 50% ethanol and in 80% ethanol, and we selected the 80% ethanol extract as the PGE for this study based on the HPLC results.

We found that inclusion of PGE in the high-fat diet (HFD) markedly attenuated food intake, body weight, epididymal fat weight, adipocyte size and blood glucose levels by the oral glucose tolerance test in mice, and maintained serum levels of adiponectin, resistin, leptin, fructosamine and triglycerides. Gene expression analysis revealed that PGE up-regulated adiponectin, and down-regulated TNF-α and leptin in fat tissue. In L6 muscle cells in vitro, PGE increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.

  We conclude that PGE may improve obesity in mice fed an HFD and glucose uptake in L6 muscle cells by modifying adipokines, and could offer clinical benefits as a supplement to treat obesity and diabetes.
