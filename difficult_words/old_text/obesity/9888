The pathogenic factors that account for the development of diabetes condition in Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remain elusive.

To clarify the pathogenic features by evaluating the levels of insulin sensitivity and β cell function in these women with PCOS, either separately or by using of a disposition indexes (DIs).

Cross-sectional study involving 137 Chinese women with PCOS and 123 normal women were examined by anthropometry, lipid profile, sex hormone, high-sensitivity C reactive protein, oral glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests.

After controlling for BMI status, the Matsuda Index was significantly lower in women with PCOS in comparison to those of normal women (p&<.000). The early phase of insulin secretion (insulinogenic index) remained significantly lower in lean women with PCOS(LP) than those of both lean and obese women of control group (p=0.007, and p = 0.01, respectively). The mean HOMA-F values were significantly lower (p =0.045) in obese women with PCOS (OP) than those of BMI-matched women. Further, all DIs derived from non-fasting state indexes in women with PCOS were significantly lower than those of BMI-matched control women (p&<.001 for all). Lastly, DIs derived from fasting states indexes in OP were significantly lower than those of LP.

Early impaired β cell function was detected in both LP and OP. However, more serious primary defect in insulin action was detected in LP compared to OP. These findings imply that early screening and intervention for PCOS would be therapeutic for Chinese women.
