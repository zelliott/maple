To explore patients' experiences of very low calorie diet (VLCD) and subsequent corset treatment of obesity in a primary care setting, and to explore their perceptions of factors influencing weight control.

In western Sweden, five focus group sessions were carried out. The main themes for the discussions were the informants' perceptions of the treatment they had received and their experiences of living with obesity. The analysis was based on the Grounded Theory methodology.

The outcomes reflect obese individuals' struggle to handle the demands of their life situation and to recognize their own resources. The core category generated was labelled ''Achieving a balance in life and adjusting one's identity''. Three categories related to the process of weight reduction were identified: living with obesity, reducing weight and developing self-management. The group treatment with VLCD was positively perceived by the participants, but the corset treatment was considered to be of less value.

Maintenance after weight reduction was demanding and the findings indicate a need for extended support. For some individuals the corset treatment could be a psychological support. Follow-up after weight reduction programmes should focus on long-term self-help strategies.
