Ninety three obese individuals of both sexes were selected to study serum levels of total lipids, cholesterol and triglycerides together with glucose. A control group of people with ideal weight were examined similarly. The four estimated parameters showed statistically significant higher values in obese individuals. Serum level of triglycerides was higher in obese males than in females.
