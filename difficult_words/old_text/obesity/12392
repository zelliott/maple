Preliminary results indicated effectiveness of the online weight reduction program KiloCoach. The current study presents a large collection of user data and compares KiloCoach with other evaluated commercial weight loss programs. Furthermore, potential factors influencing the effectiveness of internet weight loss programs should be identified.

4,310 data sets of KiloCoach users were available, 3,150 of them were suitable for further analysis. 946 program users were considered completers (at least 60 days of continuous protocol). For comparison with other programs, different subsamples were drawn that matched to the inclusion criteria of reference studies.

On average, KiloCoach overweight and obese completers lost 4.5 % of initial body weight. KiloCoach was as effective as the commercial program Weight Watchers® after 1 year (6.4% vs. 5.3% weight loss; p = 0.11) and 2 years (5.1% vs. 3.2% weight loss; p = 0.15). KiloCoach proved to be more effective than other online programs (Viktklubb, eDiets.com) as well as an in-person behavioral program, but less effective than Vtrim®, an online behavioral program providing intensive support.

In comparison to reference programs, KiloCoach proved to be effective for weight reduction. The effect of online weight reduction programs seems to depend on methods and features applied.
