Body fat distribution is a reliable predictor of the health risks of obesity. Abdominal obesity (AO) has been associated with various health complications whereas gluteal-femoral obesity (GFO) appears to be less hazardous. Body size overestimation, a type of body image disturbance, is found in a subset of obese persons.

The current study examined body size estimation accuracy as a function of body fat distribution.

Cross-sectional, retrospective review of clinical records.

101 obese women (Mean age = 39.4) joining a weight loss program.

Subjects provided body size estimates using a live video distortion procedure and were grouped into tertiles (AO; Mixed type obesity (MTO); GFO) on the basis of their waist-to-hip ratios.

GFO women had significantly lower body size estimates and felt thinner than did AO or MTO women. In addition, more AO women (20.6% vs GFO: 8.8%) overestimated their body size by more than 15% whereas more GFO women (29.4% vs AO: 5.9%) underestimated their body size by more than 15%.

Body fat distribution appears to be a mediator in body size estimation accuracy. These findings are discussed in terms of possible differences in perceptual and societal experiences among the groups.
