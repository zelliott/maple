Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a distinct hepatic condition and one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease globally. Prevalence of the disease is estimated to be around 9-32% in the general Indian population, with a higher incidence rate amongst obese and diabetic patients. We conducted this study to determine frequency and risk factors of NAFLD in nonalcoholic Indian type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients, based on elevated aminotransferase levels, defined as per NHANES III criteria. Out of 924 patients (355 female/569 male), in age group of 25-84 years, enrolled at 189 centers across 101 cities in India, a cohort of 522(56.5%) T2DM patients were identified as having NAFLD. Prevalence of the disease was found to be higher in females (60%) than in males (54.3%) T2DM patients; with prevalence of NAFLD varying from 44.1% in western India to 72.4% in northern states. In our study the prevalence of NAFLD increased with increasing age, with 239(45.8%) identified patients in age group of 25-50 years and 283(54.2%) among those aged 51 years (OR:0.71, 95%CI: 0.54-0.92, p=0.005); with highest prevalence recorded in 61-70 year age group, at 61.8%. The results from the study reinforced the well established clinical association of NAFLD with elements of metabolic syndrome (MetS) including dyslipidemia, hypertension and obesity; as T2DM population with these co-morbid conditions had 38%, 17% and 14% higher risk respectively, for NAFLD. The mean AST and ALT levels were 54.8+/-36.1 IU/L and 55.6+/-39.8 IU/L, respectively in NAFLD population and highest in age group of 25-40 years and lowest in 71-84 years age group. Mean ALT levels were found to be higher than mean AST levels across all age groups in identified T2DM NAFLD cohort, with 340(65.3%) patients having elevation of both AST and ALT levels. The results from this study besides demonstrating the prevalence pattern of NAFLD and associated risk factors in Indian T2DM patients, also point out that even mild elevation in aminotransferase levels warrants attention, since it might more often than not point to previously unsuspected liver disease.
