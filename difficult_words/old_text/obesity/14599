To investigate the level changes of obesity-associated factors and puberty-associated hormones and their relationship between obese and normal Children.

The concentrations of orexins, leptin, insulin, testosterone (T), estradiol (E), luteotrophic hormone (LH), as well as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in blood were measured respectively in 78 cases of 13 years old obesity children and 84 normal children as a control group by the means of RIA methods. The bone ages were evaluated with "bone age standard of hundred percent scale".

The leptin and insulin concentrations were significantly higher in obesity children as compared with the control group (P &<0.01). The concentrations of plasma orexinA were significantly lower in obesity children as compared with the control group (P &<0.01). The concentrations of T were significantly lower in obesity boys as compared with the control group (P &<0.01). The concentrations of E2 and LH were significantly higher in obesity girls as compared with the control group (P &<0.01). The bone age of the obese children was significantly older than that of the control group. Along with the bone age of children became older, the concentration of leptin and LH in blood were significantly increased. There was a positive correlation between LH and FSH in two groups of either boys and girls and so did between leptin and insulin, C-peptide, E2 (P &<0.01). In the group of normal boys, the positive correlations between LH, FSH and E2 were shown (r = 0.373, 0.314, P &<.05), and a negative correlations between leptin and T were shown as( r = -0.423, P &<0.01), a positive correlation between leptin and FSH was also shown as (r = 0.308, P &<0.05). In the control group of girls, there were positive correlations between leptin, LH and E2 (r = 0.585, 0.647, P &<0.01). Any correlations between LH, FSH T and E2 were not shown in the two obese groups of boys and girls.

The leptin, orexinA, insulin, T, E2, and LH concentrations had been changed significantly in blood among those obesity children, and so as their interactions. The high level of leptin in obesity children may change the concentrations of T, E2 and LH and affect the development of puberty.
