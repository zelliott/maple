Given the powerful forces promoting population weight gain, the obesity epidemic cannot be reversed solely by promoting individual behavior change. Policy initiatives might lessen the impact of the biological and economical forces promoting weight gain or provide motivation to resist these forces. Unfortunately, there is little information to adequately evaluate the many policies that have been suggested. The intent of this review is to discuss the potential use of policy to stem the global epidemic of obesity.
