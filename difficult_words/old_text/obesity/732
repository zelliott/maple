Overweight and adiposity in children and adolescents are increasing problems in Germany, and more and more primary and secondary prevention programs are being developed. When planning and designing prevention strategies, one should be aware of the target groups and settings. Analysis of epidemiological data for sex/gender, social class, and ethnicity indicates where there is increased need for intervention. Clearly elevated prevalence rates for overweight and adiposity can be found in socially underprivileged children, whereas findings for sex differences are inconsistent because of different systems of reference. This paper gives an overview of epidemiological data in Germany and discusses starting points for prevention. The argumentation focuses on the idea of cooperation between health,education, and social services to reach socially underprivileged children without stigmatizing them and their families.
