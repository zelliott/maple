The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity, beta cell hypersecretion and reduced hepatic insulin clearance in the hyper-insulinaemia of lean and obese PCOS patients. A total of 35 women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and 10 lean normo-ovulatory controls underwent an oral glucose tolerance test and an euglycaemic-hyper-insulinaemic clamp study. PCOS patients were classified into four groups according to their BMI and insulin secretion (normo-lean; normo-obese; hyper-lean; hyper-obese), and results were compared between groups and with the controls. All the PCOS groups showed significantly higher insulin secretion than controls; there were no differences in insulin response to glucose load between lean and obese normo- and hyper-insulinaemic patients. Secretion of c-peptide was greater in PCOS groups than controls. All the hyper-insulinaemic PCOS patients had lower values of hepatic insulin clearance, independent of BMI, when compared either with controls (P &<0.001) or with PCOS normo-insulinaemic women (P &<0.01). Normo- and hyper-insulinaemic obese patients had similar total body glucose utilization (M value), which was lower than in lean PCOS subjects and controls. Our results suggest that evaluation of insulin resistance alone does not fully characterize the PCOS population; differences in liver metabolism of insulin are present in obese insulin resistant subjects and in lean patients with normal insulin sensitivity when divided into normo- and hyper-insulinaemic subgroups. Insulin resistance and hyper-insulinaemia may represent two distinct features of the insulin disorder in PCOS: the former appear to reflect the presence of obesity, while the latter may be a primary feature of PCOS.
