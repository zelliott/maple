It is known that spontaneous and stimulated GH secretion is reduced in obesity. On the other hand, it has been recently reported that, in obese subjects, plasma GH levels did not change during a hyperglycemic clamp. To further study the sensitivity of somatotrope cells to inhibitory influences in obesity, we studied the effect of somatostatin, pirenzepine, or glucose on the GH response to GHRH or arginine in 32 obese patients and 30 controls. Basal GH levels were lower in obese than in normal subjects (1.0 +/- 0.6 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.7 micrograms/L, P &<0.05), while insulin-like growth factor-I levels were similar in both groups (137.3 +/- 13.2 vs. 138.8 +/- 12.2 micrograms/L). In obese as well as in control subjects pirenzepine abolished the GH response to either GHRH (AUC0-120: 43.7 +/- 9.6 vs. 258.3 +/- 59.9 micrograms/L/h, P &<0.04 and 113.0 +/- 75.0 vs. 870.5 +/- 255 micrograms/L.h, P &<0.01, respectively) or arginine (6.5 +/- 2.5 vs. 118.7 +/- 55.9 micrograms/L.h, P &<0.05 and 47.7 +/- 7.3 vs. 334.0 +/- 157.5 micrograms/L.h, P &<0.01, respectively). Differently from pirenzepine, glucose blunted the GH response to either GHRH or arginine in control subjects (260.8 +/- 38.3 vs. 479.5 +/- 83.9 micrograms/L.h, P &<0.03 and 294.8 +/- 46.3 vs. 625.1 +/- 139.1 micrograms/L.h, P &<0.05, respectively), but failed to modify it in obese patients (193.7 +/- 39.4 vs. 172.4 +/- 33.6 micrograms/L.h and 121.1 +/- 43.4 vs. 155.1 +/- 39.7 micrograms/L.h, respectively). On the other hand, somatostatin deeply blunted the GHRH-induced GH release in obese patients (58.5 +/- 25.4 vs. 548.7 +/- 196.6 micrograms/L.h, P &<0.05) as well as in controls (181.4 +/- 44.4 vs. 759.7 +/- 46.6 micrograms/L.h, P &<0.04). In conclusion, our results show that, in obesity, the stimulated GH release is refractory to the inhibitory effect of glucose but not of pirenzepine, in spite of their likely common mechanism of action, i.e. increase of hypothalamic somatostatin release. Exogenous somatostatin is able to abolish GH secretion both in normal and obese subjects. These data suggest the existence of a peculiar inhability of hyperglycemia to trigger somatostatinergic release in obesity.
