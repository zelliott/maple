Primary renal lymphoma (PRL) is a rare lymphoma which usually presents with hematuria, flank pain, abdominal mass, and weight loss. PRL is more diagnosed in adults than children. We describe an asymptomatic child who presented with hypertension and was subsequently diagnosed with primary renal lymphoma. This case represents an atypical presentation for PRL.
