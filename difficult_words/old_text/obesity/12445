Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitors are now used to improve postprandial glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. However, their effects on hepatic glucose production (HGP) in obesity are not clear. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that gluconeogenesis and HGP can be modulated by DPP-4 inhibitors in obesity.

Sprague Dawley male rats were divided into four groups, each on a different diet: general rat chow, n = 10 (G); G + sitagliptin, n = 10; high fat chow (obesity), n = 10 (55% fat calories, HFO); HFO + sitagliptin, n = 10. After 10 weeks, the rats were fasted overnight and glucose metabolism was determined using 3-(3)H-glucose and (14)C-glycerol as tracers.

Glycerol rate of appearance (P &<0.00001), plasma glycerol (P &<0.05) and free fatty acid (FFA) (P &<0.05) concentrations, and HGP (P &<0.05) were decreased in HFO + sitagliptin group compared with HFO group, but there was no significant difference between G and G + sitagliptin groups (P&> 0.05). Gluconeogenesis in HFO group was five times of that in G rats (P &<0.01), but was significantly declined in HFO + sitagliptin group (P &<0.0001).

Gluconeogenesis and HGP were inhibited by sitagliptin in high fat-induced obese rats due to decreased glycerol availability, which was a result of reduced glycerol release from adipose tissues. The finding suggests that sitagliptin is potentially useful for controlling fasting glucose in obesity, thereby delaying or preventing the development of diabetes.
