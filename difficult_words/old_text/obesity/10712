The effects of diet on the serum concentrations of albumin, transferrin, thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA) and retinol-binding protein (RBP) were studied in 3 groups of obese subjects (Groups I-III) and 1 group of normal weight subjects (Group IV). Group I subjects ate either a 830 kcal carbohydrate-containing diet (CCD) or carbohydrate-restricted diet (CRD), Group II and III subjects ate a hypocaloric CRD. Subjects in Group IV ate a eucaloric CRD. Serum albumin concentrations did not change in any of the 4 groups. Only the subjects in Group II had a statistically significant decrease in serum transferrin concentration 6 wk after starting the hypocaloric, CRD. Group I individuals eating the CRD and the subjects in Groups II, III and IV had significant decreases in the serum concentrations of TBPA and RBP after 1 wk which persisted without further change during the remaining 3-5 wk of the diets. Group I subjects eating the CCD had a significant decrease in TBPA concentration at 1 and 6 wk. The RBP serum concentration was significantly decreased after 1 wk on the diet, but was not significantly different from the control diet period at 6 wk. The magnitude of the decreases in serum concentrations of TBPA and RBP in the Group I subjects eating the CRD were significantly greater than in the Group I subjects eating the CCD. Thus, ingestion of a hypocaloric, CRD by obese individuals results in decreased serum concentrations of TBPA and RBP. Isocaloric substitution of carbohydrate for fat reduces this effect. Dietary carbohydrate apparently modulates the serum concentrations of TBPA and RBP, independently of caloric intake, since ingestion of a eucaloric CRD by normal weight individuals also decreased the serum concentration of the two visceral proteins.
