An unusual pattern and type of lichen planus is described in a 57-year-old female in which the flexures were exclusively involved. The affected areas were chronically eroded and ulcerated and resistant to topical treatment. Erosive lichen planus is known to occur on mucosal surfaces and cases of ulcerative lichen planus have been described involving the feet and lower limbs. Lichen planus involving flexures alone is uncommon and for erosion and ulceration to occur at these sites seems rare. We report a case of erosive, flexural lichen planus of long standing in a middle-aged female.
