To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a multifaceted, community-based weight intervention program for children using exergaming technology (activity-promoting video gaming).

This is a prospective observational pilot study. Forty-eight children, between the ages of 8 and 16 years, who are overweight or obese, enrolled in Exergaming for Health, a multidisciplinary weight management program, which used active video gaming. Primary outcome measures were change in body mass index (BMI) z scores.

Most children (n = 40, 83%) completed the program and participated in outcome evaluations. The average BMI change was -0.48 kg/m(2) (SD = 0.93), P &<.002 (BMI z-score change was -0.072, SD = 0.14, P &<.0001). The average Global Self-Worth score improved, screen time and soda intake reduced, and exercise hours per week increased.

The Exergaming for Health program may be an effective weight management intervention that is feasible with high participation rates. A larger randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm these results.
