To explore the effect of tobacco use (smoking and smokeless tobacco) and cessation on body weight.

Cross-sectional and prospective follow-up study.

Northern Sweden.

A total of 2993 men aged 25-64 years who participated in the northern Sweden MONICA study in 1986, 1990 or 1994, 1650 of whom were followed up in 1999.

The prevalence of overweight [body mass index (BMI)&>/= 27] amongst tobacco users was compared with nonusers at entry into the study. The average annual percentage weight gain amongst men was also determined according to tobacco use both at entry and at follow-up, and the development of overweight amongst tobacco-use groups was reported using standardized incidence ratios.

Smokers who quit tobacco during the follow-up period gained significantly more weight than smokers who switched to snus (annual gain 0.96% vs. 0.51%, P &<0.05). At entry, ex-smokers had higher prevalence of overweight than nonusers of tobacco [prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-1.40]. Snus users had slightly higher prevalence of overweight at entry (PR = 1.20, CI = 1.01-1.42). Snus users who quit gained more weight than nonusers (0.70% vs. 0.44%, P &<0.05) or those who continued to use snus (0.42%).

Cessation of tobacco, either cigarettes or snus, leads to significantly increased weight gain. However, snus use may play a role in lowering the weight gain following smoking cessation.
