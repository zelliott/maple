Over the last 20 years, the treatment of acute appendicitis has been transformed by the development of the laparoscopic approach. And yet the net value of this approach continues to be debated. Laparoscopic appendectomy is associated with a lower complication rate and a shorter period of disability in the general population. While operative costs are higher, the global cost of laparoscopic appendectomy is lower than for open appendectomy. There is a somewhat higher rate of abdominal abscess for the laparoscopic route. Laparoscopic appendectomy shows clear advantages in obese patients and in those with gangrenous or ruptured appendicitis. The laparoscopic approach is contra-indicated during pregnancy due to a higher incidence of miscarriage. Treatment of the appendiceal stump by ligature decreases the expense associated with the use of a surgical stapler. When Meckel's diverticulum is encountered during appendectomy, it should be removed in all pediatric patients; in adults, Meckel's diverticulectomy in adults should be performed only for clear-cut pathology. Surgeons continue to innovate and refine appendectomy techniques but many questions remain to be answered.
