This paper analyzes the impact of Internet use on human obesity in the United States. The United States is facing a skyrocketing obesity epidemic among adults and children. The authors hypothesize that the more individuals use the Internet, the more they increase their risks of becoming obese. The explanation is that Internet use may cause sedentarism, which refers to decreased energy expenditure or, simply, physical inactivity. Sedentarism, in turn, may increase obesity.
