Hypertension, dyslipidemias, glucose intolerance and obesity are among the most important cardiovascular risk factors. There is growing evidence for the concept of a relationship between blood pressure regulation and metabolic changes. The combination of hypertension and the metabolic changes mentioned above has been named metabolic syndrome in the literature. The central role of insulin resistance and consecutive hyperinsulinemia in the metabolic syndrome has been shown in epidemiological, clinical, genetic and animal studies. The metabolic syndrome can be demonstrated in about one half of the hypertensive population. This pathophysiological concept has to be taken into consideration in the therapy and prevention of the different cardiovascular risk factors.
