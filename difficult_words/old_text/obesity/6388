Direct assessment of tissue metabolism in vivo is important to understand the pathogenesis of obesity. Labelled glucose analogues are potential candidates to be used for this purpose. The aim of this study was to compare the kinetics and metabolism of 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in obese (fa/fa) and lean (Fa/?) Zucker rat tissues with microdialysis, and the measurement of uptake and phosphorylation with or without insulin bolus injection.

Obese (n = 10) and lean (n = 11) anaesthetized rats underwent a microdialysis study after FDG-injection either with or without insulin stimulation. Microdialysis probes were inserted in the jugular vein, quadriceps muscle and liver. After 110 min, tissue [(18)F]-uptake and intracellular phosphorylation of FDG were studied in blood, liver, skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue, intra-abdominal adipose tissue and hypothalamus.

When measured with microdialysis, insulin-enhanced FDG disappeared from the blood pool and interstitial space of skeletal muscle and liver more effectively in lean rather than in obese animals. Insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle and adipose tissue[(18)F]-uptake was impaired in obese Zucker rats compared with lean animals. Hypothalamic FDG uptake was six to sevenfold higher than in other measured tissues, but was attenuated in obese rats. In liver and in mesenteric fat, insulin-enhanced FDG phosphorylation in lean rats compared with obese animals.

Positron-emitting glucose analogue FDG, combined with microdialysis and tissue analysis, is a feasible method in studying glucose metabolism at the cellular level in animal studies.
