Post-meal energy expenditure (TEM) was compared for 14 healthy obese (body fat = 45.3%, body mass index, BMI = 35.9 kg m-2) and 9 healthy nonobese (body fat = 20.7%, BMI = 17.8 kg m-2) adolescent girls. The test meal for both groups was a standard 3348.8-kJ, 0.473-1 chocolate milkshake of 15% protein (casein), 40% fat (polyunsaturated/saturated ratio = 0.05; 75 mg cholesterol) and 45% carbohydrate (lactose and sucrose). Glucose, insulin and resting energy expenditure (RMR) were measured at rest prior to meal consumption and 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 min after the meal. Cumulative net TEM was calculated as the integrated area under the TEM curve with RMR as baseline. Reliability was assessed by retesting 4 subjects, and a placebo effect was tested by administering a flavored energy-free drink. Results indicated high reliability and no placebo effect. The meal resulted in a greater rise in insulin and glucose for the obese compared to the nonobese subjects (P &<or = 0.05), and a significant TEM for both groups (P &<or = 0.05). The cumulative TEM (W kg-1) was 61.9% greater for the nonobese (P &<0.01) when expressed relative to body mass, and 33.2% greater for the nonobese (P &<or = 0.01) when expressed relative to the fat-free body mass. Expressed relative to the meal, the TEM was 25.5% less for the obese (P &<0.01). The data support an energy conservation hypothesis for obese female adolescents.
