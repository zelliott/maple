Fat-specific protein 27 gene (FSP27), isolated by screening for genes specifically expressed in fully differentiated mouse adipocytes, belongs to the cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor, alpha subunit-like effector family. FSP27 is induced in not only adipose tissue but also the liver of ob/ob mice, and it promotes the development of fatty liver. The FSP27 gene is expressed in a fatty liver-specific manner and is not detected in the normal mouse liver. FSP27 expression is directly regulated by the induction of the hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in ob/ob fatty liver. In the present study, expression of hepatic FSP27 mRNA was determined in non-genetic fatty liver models. The FSP27 gene was markedly induced in the high-fat- or methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced fatty liver, but it was not elevated in alcohol-induced fatty liver. Interestingly, the induction of FSP27 mRNA due to the MCD diet was independent of PPARγ levels and completely absent in the liver from PPARγ-null mice. These results suggest that FSP27 mRNA expression in the liver depends on the etiology of fatty liver.
