Children with obesity have a high cardiovascular risk and an impaired oxidant-antioxidant status, which may lead to endothelial dysfunction and increased carotid intima media thickness (IMT) even in childhood. The aim of this study was to investigate the circulating oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations and the IMT of carotid arteries in prepubertal obese children, and also to search for its possible association with carotid atherosclerosis.

Twenty-seven prepubertal obese children (age, 7.48±2.05 years; boys, 59%) and 30 healthy children (age, 7.80±2.19 years; boys, 55%) were included in the study. Serum concentrations of oxidized LDL, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, LDL, and glucose were measured, and carotid IMT was determined by ultrasound.

Serum oxidized LDL levels were significantly higher in prepubertal obese children than in healthy children (p&<.01). No significant correlation was observed between oxidized LDL levels and carotid IMT measurements. However, a significant positive correlation was found between oxidized LDL levels and body mass index, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol.

Our findings revealed that the oxidation of LDL starts early in obese children but the carotid IMT is not significantly affected. Also, oxidized LDL levels are more strongly associated with obesity and dyslipidemia than the carotid IMT in prepubertal children.
