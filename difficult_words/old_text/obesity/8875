Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) is a ubiquitous peptide of the glucagon superfamily that is involved in glucose homeostasis and regulation of insulin secretion. This study employed the PACAP receptor antagonist, PACAP(6-27) to evaluate the role of endogenous PACAP in genetic obesity-related diabetes and related metabolic abnormalities using ob/ob mice. Acute in vivo antagonistic potency of PACAP(6-27) was confirmed in ob/ob mice by blockade of the insulin-releasing action but not hyperglycaemia. In longer-term studies, ob/ob mice were given once daily injections of PACAP(6-27) or vehicle for 14 days. Feeding activity, body weight, basal plasma glucose and plasma insulin concentrations were not significantly affected by chronic PACAP(6-27) treatment. However, PACAP(6-27) treatment impaired glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and the glycaemic response to feeding. Plasma glucagon and lipids were unchanged. These observations indicate a role of endogenous PACAP for normal glucose homeostasis, but indicate a minor involvement in the regulation of insulin secretion in ob/ob mice.
