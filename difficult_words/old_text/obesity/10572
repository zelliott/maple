Lipin1 has been documented to play an important role in adipogenesis. In the present study, the mRNA expression level of lipin1 and its isoforms in longissimus dorsi muscle were determined by semi-quantification RT-PCR in lean PIC and obese Rongchang pigs. Further, we determined mRNA expression for lipin1 and its two isoforms in Rongchang obese pigs which had either a high or low intramuscular fat content. We demonstrate for the first time that porcine lipin1 has two alternative forms, lipin-α and lipin-β. Unlike mice and humans where the lipin-β has 99 more nucleotides than lipin-α, we found that in swine, lipin-β has 108 more nucleotides than lipin-α. Our results indicate that the longissimus dorsi muscle of Rongchang obese pigs have a higher level of mRNA expression for lipin1 and its isoforms than PIC lean pigs. Furthermore, Rongchang pigs with higher intramuscular fat content had a higher lipin1 and lipin-β mRNA expression in longissimus dorsisi muscle than Rongchang pigs with lower intramuscular fat content (P&<.05), whereas no difference was seen in lipin-α mRNA expression between Rongchang pigs with high or low intramuscular fat. The ratio of lipin-β mRNA to lipin-α mRNA was also significantly different between Rongchang pigs distinguished by a high intramuscular fat content compared with those with low intramuscular fat (P&<.05). These data suggested that the lipin1 gene may have a crucial effect on body lipid accumulation in pigs, whereas the lipin-β isoform may play an important role in intramuscular fat deposition in obese pigs.
