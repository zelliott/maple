Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) is a common and controversial clinical entity. Recent studies have demonstrated that SVT should be seen as a venous thromboembolism (VTE). The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of thrombophilia defects and to estimate the role of age, sex and body mass index (BMI) in patients with varicose veins (VVs) and SVT.

A total of 230 patients with VVs, 128 with, and 102 without SVT underwent thrombophilia testing included factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 mutations, protein C, protein S (PS), anti-thrombin III and plasminogen deficiencies and levels of A2 antiplasmin, activate protein C resistance and lupus anticoagulant. According to Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification patients were categorized in two subgroups: moderate disease (C2,3) and severe disease (C4,5,6). Age and body mass index were also assessed.

The prevalence of thrombophilia defects was significantly higher in patients with moderate disease and SVT (p=0.002). In the C2,3 group, SVT was associated with PS deficiency (p=0.018), obesity (p&<.001), male gender (p=0.047) and age (p&<.001). There were no significant differences in patients with severe disease.

Age, male sex, obesity and PS deficiency are factors associated with SVT development among patients with VVs having moderate disease (C2,3).
