Psoriasis is traditionally considered a skin-specific disease with the exception of coexisting psoriatic arthritis. However, growing evidence suggests a link between psoriasis and other comorbidities. Cardiovascular comorbidity, in particular, is the focus of considerable research, due in part to the associated mortality and possible intervention. A common mechanism that may explain both psoriasis and atherosclerosis pathogenesis is of great interest and utility. The increase of Th1 and Th17 leading to chronic inflammation is thought to be a patho-denominator for both diseases. In addition, progressive adiposity and resultant metabolic syndrome are but the beginning steps in the "psoriatic march". In this article, we review the recent publications on cardiovascular risks in patients with psoriasis. We also examine the effects of psoriasis treatment, including the new biologics, on cardiovascular comorbidities. Although there is generally a lack of Asian research on this issue, we present the most recent pertinent findings from Taiwan.
