Recent studies on diabetes and metabolic syndrome indicate a common disturbance of inorganic phosphate (Pi) metabolism. Pi is an important substrate in the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and many lifestyle diseases and cardiovascular risk factors similarly show deficiencies in either 1 or 2 major components of ATP synthesis. Age, male gender, hypertension, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus are all associated with hypophosphatemia. In addition, tobacco smoking, hyperchylomicronemia, hypertension, and diabetes may involve defects in tissue oxygen delivery. Hypophosphatemia may lead to a critical decrease in intracellular Pi and to mitochondrial dysfunction, which might be counter-acted by the pharmacological use of fructose 1,6-diphosphate.
