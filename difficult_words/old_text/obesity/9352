This is the first study to examine the awareness of major stroke symptoms and stroke risk factors among the general population in Denmark. Early recognition of stroke warning signs and means of reducing stroke occurrence could improve the treatment and prevention of stroke.

A total of 3,520 subjects were invited to participate in the study, using a web-based, closed questionnaire. The recruitment was stratified by region, age and gender to represent the composition of the general Danish population aged 40+ years. Enrollment was competitive with a predefined target of 800 responses. The subjects were asked to rank the 4 most important acute stroke symptoms, and the 3 most important risk factors for stroke. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression was used for assessing factors associated with awareness of stroke symptoms and major stroke risk factors.

From December 12 to December 17, 2008, a total of 811 subjects (mean age: 58 years; SD: 11 years) were included, of which 405 (50%) were women. The 4 most frequently identified stroke symptoms were sudden onset of: speech disturbances (n = 636; 78.4%), facial palsy (n = 450; 55.5%), hemiparesis (n = 435; 53.6%) and visual disturbances (n = 429; 52.9%). The 3 most frequently identified stroke risk factors were: hypertension (n = 586; 72.3%), history of cerebrovascular disease (n = 401; 49.5%) and high concentration of cholesterol (n = 269; 33.2%). Compared with men, women had better knowledge of major stroke symptoms (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.12-1.50) and stroke risk factors (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.10-1.51) in multivariable analyses.

The awareness of major stroke symptoms is insufficient. Whereas hypertension was the most often mentioned stroke risk factor, few subjects recognized tobacco smoking and diabetes mellitus as major risk factors for stroke.
