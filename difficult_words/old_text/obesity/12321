The aim of this study was to examine the effect of adrenal versus ovarian androgen (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate/total testosterone [DHEAS/TT]) on clinical presentation and related metabolic disturbances in Turkish women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Two hundred eighty PCOS cases were taken into the study. For all cases, the DHEAS/TT ratio was calculated. The median value of this ratio was 4.40. Patients with an androgen ratio lower than 4.40 were included in Group 1 and cases with a ratio higher than 4.40 were Group 2. The two groups were compared in terms of hormonal, biochemical and clinical parameters. Body mass index and waist circumference were lower, the Ferriman-Gallwey score was higher and the cycle length was shorter in Group 2. High DHEAS level was associated with better lipid profiles and lower levels of inflammatory markers, meaning good metabolic control in these women, in spite of increased hirsutism rates. In patients with PCOS, both androgens are usually high in proportion to each other. Therefore, it would be more meaningful to use the DHEAS/TT ratio for an assessment of the metabolic and phenotypic effects of PCOS.
