Obesity is known to be a risk factor of cardiac death, that is associated first of all with cardiac arrhythmias. Increased QT dispersion (QTd) and ventricular late potentials (LP) are measurable indices of ventricular arrhythmias risk. The aim of this study is to asses QTd and LP in women with obesity. 62 obese women (mean BMI 36.7 kg/m2) and 15 apparently healthy subjects (mean BMI 24.5 kg/m2) were included in our study. QTd and correlated QT interval dispersion (QTdc) were calculated from 12-lead ECG. LVM were assessed from echocardiograms. LP were obtained by signal averaging of surface electrocardiograms.

QTd, QTdc, LVM were significantly higher in patients. We found LP in six cases and higher QTdc in this subgroup. According to our research, increased QTd in obese women seems to be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and increased QTd is significantly higher in subjects with LP.
