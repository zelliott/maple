Chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is associated with a number of metabolic abnormalities. These include lipid abnormalities, most commonly hypertriglyceridemia, increased VLDL and decreased HDL-cholesterol levels; carbohydrate abnormalities, a result of the absorption of large quantities of glucose; protein losses, consisting of albumin and amino acid losses; and a propensity to obesity. The pathogenesis and possible consequences of these abnormalities are discussed.
