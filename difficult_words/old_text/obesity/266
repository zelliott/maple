The growing prevalence of obesity is closely linked to the increased prevalence of diabetes worldwide. Lifestyle interventions including diet and exercise successfully reduce diabetes incidence. Long-term follow up of lifestyle intervention trials demonstrate continued reduction in diabetes incidence for up to 20. Ongoing studies are continuing to examine the translation of lifestyle interventions, as well as the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in preventing complications of type 2 diabetes. This article will review the major studies of lifestyle interventions in preventing type 2 diabetes and translation of lifestyle interventions beyond clinical trial settings. In addition, authors will review the evidence regarding weight loss in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
