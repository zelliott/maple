Resistant hypertension (RHTN) includes patients whose blood pressure (BP) is controlled with the use of four or more antihypertensive medications, and is referred to as 'controlled resistant hypertension' (CRH). While specifically comparing patients with CRH and uncontrolled resistant hypertension (UCRH), we hoped to identify distinguishing characteristics that would provide insight into factors contributing to resistance to antihypertensive therapies. RHTN patients were identified as controlled (CRH, n=43) or uncontrolled (UCRH, n=47). No statistical differences were observed between the CRH and UCRH subgroups with respect to age and gender. The body mass index, aldosterone-renin ratio and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were significantly higher in UCRH patients. Although both subgroups showed increased cardiac mass, left ventricular mass index was significantly higher in UCRH compared with CRH patients. Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that PWV was significantly dependent on age in both UCRH and CRH patients; however, the influence of ageing was more pronounced in the former subgroup. Older age, greater vascular stiffness, higher aldosterone levels and greater left ventricular hypertrophy were significantly associated with lack of BP control in patients with RHTN. These findings suggest important possibilities in terms of preventing and better treating RHTN.
