Insulin resistance and obesity is a common health problem in the industrialized world. As a result of the availability of high-calorie food and a reduction in energy expenditure, maladaptive metabolic processes may interfere with the action of insulin and increase susceptibility for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. With the advent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), the mechanisms of this maladaptation and its relationship to insulin resistance syndrome components have become less obscure, promising new therapeutic approaches for this common problem. In this review we first focus on the molecular structure and cellular mechanisms of action of these receptors and then discuss how PPAR-gamma, a PPAR isoform, provides a link between adiposity, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis.
