Laboratory research including animal models of human disease suggests that cannabinoids might have therapeutic potential in multiple sclerosis (MS). We have recently seen a 46-year-old woman who developed MS after starting treatment with a cannabinoid receptor antagonist for obesity. The occurrence of MS several months after starting a cannabinoid receptor antagonist suggests that the cannabinoid system might indeed be relevant to disease pathogenesis in MS.
