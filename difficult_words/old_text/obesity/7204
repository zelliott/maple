The aim is to study the relationship between insulin resistance and serum adiponectin and resistin in obese children.

A total 113 obese and 37 nonobese children were enrolled and serum adiponectin and resistin were measured.

Compared with controls, higher insulin resistance by homeostasis model (HOMA-IR) and lower whole body insulin resistance index (WBISI)were found in obese children (all P &<.05). The adiponectin levels in obese children and controls were 3.63 and 5.79 microg/L with a significant difference (P&<.001) while the difference of resistin levels was not significant (P = 0.948). Significant correlations between insulin resistance parameter and age,sexual development, BMI, serum triglyceride, ApoB, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, uric acid, or adiponectin levels (all P &<.05) were noted. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that BMI and adiponectin levels were independent determinants of WBISI.

These results suggest that adiponectin may play a protective role in obese children through decreasing insulin resistance.
