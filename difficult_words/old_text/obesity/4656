The prevalence of overweight in childhood and adolescence in Europe is still growing. This development could not yet be stopped despite numerous intervention and prevention measures. Due to the lack of longitudinal data, so far no reliable evaluation of incidence rates or long-term health effects of overweight and obesity can be made. Overweight and adiposity are caused by multiple factors. Beside genetic predisposition and individual lifestyle, effective prevention measures should e. g. also take account of psycho-social, context and environmental factors. The prevention of obesity is an issue that clinical medicine and public health should tackle together.
