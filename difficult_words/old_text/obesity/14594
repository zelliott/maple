The increased prevalence of obesity after neutering in cats is problematic in veterinary practice. Although many factors seem to be involved, the role of prolactin (PRL) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), both implicated in adipose tissue development and glucose intolerance, should be considered. Seven male cats were castrated when 11 months old. Body weight was then recorded for 56 weeks and PRL, IGF-I and leptin assayed for 44 weeks. Body weight increased steadily but only significantly after 36 weeks. It stabilised after 44 weeks, and the cats then gained about 20% of their initial body weight. IGF-I increased rapidly and was significantly higher by week 3. PRL and leptin increased with initial peaks during the eighth and eleventh weeks, respectively. This study confirms that castration rapidly modifies the hormonal balance, partly explaining the body weight increase, and that hormonal changes precede this body weight increase. Hyperleptinaemia is apparently a consequence of excess weight.
