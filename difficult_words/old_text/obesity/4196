Similar to the mammalian FABP4 gene, the chicken (Gallus gallus) FABP4 gene consists of four exons separated by three introns and encodes a 132 amino acid protein termed the adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP). In the current study, a novel G/A polymorphism in exon 3 of the chicken FABP4 gene was identified associated with different chicken breeds that leads to either Ser or Asn at amino acid 89 of the AFABP protein. The Baier chicken averages 0.89+/-0.12% abdominal fat and expresses the G allele (Ser 89 isoform) while the Broiler chicken typically has 3.74+/-0.23% abdominal fat and expresses the A allele (Asn 89 isoforms). cDNAs corresponding to the two AFABP isoforms were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as GST fusions, purified by using glutathione sepharose 4B chromatography and evaluated for lipid binding using the fluorescent surrogate ligand 1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulphonic acid (1,8-ANS). The results showed that AFABP Ser89 exhibited a lower ligand-binding affinity with apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of 7.31+/-3.75 microM, while the AFABP Asn89 isoform bound 1,8-ANS with an apparent dissociation constant of 2.99+/-1.00 microM (P=0.02). These results suggest that the Ser89Asn polymorphism may influence chicken AFABP function and ultimately lipid deposition through changing the ligand-binding activity of AFABP.
