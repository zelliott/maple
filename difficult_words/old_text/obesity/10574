scholastic competence is a predictor of future achievement, yet there is little research about health factors that influence the development of self-perceived scholastic competence (SPSC). This study examined the relationship of insulin resistance and body fatness with SPSC in low-income, overweight and obese, African American children.

data were analyzed from a convenience sample of 9-10years old African American children (89 boys and 113 girls) enrolled in a type 2 diabetes prevention study. Health variables analyzed for their influence on SPSC (Harter scale) included insulin resistance (Homeostatic model-derived insulin sensitivity, HOMA-IR) and body fatness (% body fat). Adjustments were made for self-esteem (Global Self Worth).

there was a significant gender by insulin resistance interaction effect on the child's SPSC, so separate regression models were developed for each gender. In boys, neither insulin resistance nor body fatness was related to SPSC. In girls, however, insulin resistance was negatively related to SPSC scores, and the significance of the relationship increased further after adjusting for body fatness. Body fatness alone was not significantly related to SPSC in girls, but after adjusting for insulin resistance, body fatness was positively related to SPSC. Thus, insulin resistance and body fatness mutually suppressed SPSC in girls.

high SPSC was associated with lower insulin resistance and, with insulin resistance held constant, with higher body fatness in girls but not in boys. These relationships were not influenced by self-esteem in these children.
