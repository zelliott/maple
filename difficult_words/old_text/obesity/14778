A controlled study has been made of the constitutional background of 300 cases of endometrial adenocarcinoma. The control group was age matched and drawn from the same patient population pool as were the adenocarcinoma cases.Endometrial adenocarcinoma was shown to be associated unduly frequently with hypertension, nulliparity and the late age of menopause. No association was found between endometrial adenocarcinoma and obesity, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease or extragenital malignant disease.It is suggested that these results are explicable on the basis that adrenal dysfunction may be an aetiological factor in the development of endometrial adenocarcinoma.
