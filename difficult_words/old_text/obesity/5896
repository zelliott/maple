Growth hormone (GH) previously was available in limited supply and only for the treatment of GH-deficient children. The recent production of GH by recombinant DNA technology has provided a potential surfeit of this hormone and raises the possibility of its use in other conditions. In addition, the isolation, characterization, and synthesis of GH-releasing hormone (GRH) provides an opportunity to use this peptide in conditions in which increased circulating levels of GH are desired. Both GH and GRH have potential therapeutic uses in conditions other than growth retardation.
