Although the ANGPTL6 (angiopoietin-like 6) gene product is now known to be involved in the regulation of fat mass and insulin sensitivity in mice, its physiological functions in humans have yet to be determined.

Subjects from the population-based French MONICA Study (n=3402) were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ANGPTL6, and associations with anthropometric or biochemical phenotypes were looked for.

On evaluating the frequency of 17 ANGPTL6 SNPs in 100 randomly selected subjects on the basis of linkage disequilibrium mapping, four SNPs (rs6511435, rs8112063, rs11671983 and rs15723) were found to cover more than 95% of the known ANGPTL6 genetic variability. Subjects from the entire MONICA Study were then genotyped for these four SNPs. No significant association was detected for rs11671983 and rs15723. In contrast, the G allele of rs8112063 was associated with lower plasma glucose levels (P=0.009). Also, obese subjects carrying the G allele of rs6511435 had higher plasma insulin levels than AA subjects (P=0.0055). Moreover, the G allele of rs6511435 tended to be associated with a 20% higher risk of the metabolic syndrome (P=0.034). However, when false discovery rate testing (40 tests) was applied, these associations were no longer statistically significant.

These findings constitute the first study in humans of ANGPTL6 genetic variability. Although there was no evidence that polymorphisms in ANGPTL6 might be significantly associated with the metabolic syndrome-related phenotypes, a weak association of these polymorphisms with these parameters cannot be excluded. Further association studies are needed to arrive at any definite conclusions.
