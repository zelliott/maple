It is now generally accepted that adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ producing a number of substances with an important role in the regulation of food intake, energy expenditure and a series of metabolic processes. Adiponectin is a recently discovered protein produced exclusively by adipocytes. A number of studies have shown that obesity, insulin resistance and atherosclerosis are accompanied by decreased adiponectin levels and that adiponectin replacement under experimental settings is able to diminish both insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about the physiology and pathophysiology of adiponectin and to discuss its potential in the treatment of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis.
