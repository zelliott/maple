Herein, we disclose the discovery and optimization of 2-piperidin-4-yl-acetamide derivatives as MCH-R1 antagonists. Structural investigation of piperidin-4-yl-amide and piperidin-4-yl-ureas identified 2-piperidin-4-yl-acetamide-based MCH-R1 antagonists with outstanding in vivo efficacy but flawed with high affinity towards the hERG potassium channel. While existing hERG SAR information was employed to discover highly potent MCH-R1 antagonists with minimized hERG inhibition, additional hurdles prevented their subsequent clinical exploration.
