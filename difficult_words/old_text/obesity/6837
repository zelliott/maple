Some data indicate a potential relationship between insulin resistance level and the concentration of osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the body. There have been few studies concerning OPG level and its relationship with insulin resistance and body composition in young people. The aim of this study was to assess serum osteoprotegerin concentration in obese adolescents, and to evaluate its potential association with insulin resistance. Seventy-eight obese adolescents and 20 healthy volunteers aged 12-18 years were recruited in the study. Selected anthropometrical measurements and blood biochemical analyses were performed. Insulin resistance in the participants was evaluated according to the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) protocol. Level of OPG was assessed in serum. Obese subjects had significantly higher HOMA-IR indices and OPG levels in serum than the control group. A significant positive correlation between OPG and insulin resistance was found. It was observed that high concentrations of osteoprotegerin are associated with insulin resistance in obese adolescents.
