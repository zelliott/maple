In this article we report the obesogenic role of the acute phase protein PAP/HIP. We found that the transgenic TgPAP/HIP mice develop spontaneous obesity under standard nutritional conditions, with high levels of glucose, leptin, and LDL and low levels of triglycerides and HDL in blood. Accordingly, PAP/HIP-deficient mice are skinny under standard nutritional conditions. We also found that expression of PAP/HIP is induced in intestinal epithelial cells in response to gavage with olive oil and this induction is AG490 sensitive. We demonstrated that incubation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with a low concentration as 1 ng/ml of recombinant PAP/HIP results in accelerated BrdU incorporation in vitro. PAP/HIP-dependent adipocytes growth is sensitive to the MEK inhibitor U0126. Finally, patients with severe obesity present higher blood levels of PAP/HIP than non-obese control individuals. Altogether our data suggest that PAP/HIP could be a mediator of fat tissue development, released by the intestine and induced by the presence of food into the gut.
