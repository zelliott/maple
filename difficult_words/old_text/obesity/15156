To evaluate bone turnover markers and bone mineral density (BMD) in women after Roux-en-Y (RYGB) gastric bypass.

In a cross-sectional study, 48 women post-RYGB after three years, and 41 healthy women were evaluated.

body mass index (BMI); physical activity; food intake; serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), osteocalcin, urinary calcium and BMD.

Significantly higher levels were observed for osteocalcin (p &<0.001), CTX (p &<0.001), and PTH (p &<0.001) in the RYGB group when compared with the control group; 25OHD deficiency/insufficiency was more frequent in the RYGB group (p = 0.010), even after adjusted for nutritional status, and it was associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism (p = 0.025); there was no difference in BMD between the groups. Energy (p = 0.036) and protein intake (p = 0.004) were lower in the RYGB group.

Patients submitted to RYGB showed a significantly higher frequency of vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and increase in bone remodeling markers, with no difference in BMD status.
