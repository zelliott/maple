The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of moderate intensity exercise on acute post-exercise energy intake (EI) in normal and overweight females. Twelve normal weight (BMI&<5), and 12 over weight (BM&>25) inactive women (mean age 35+/-8) participated in a 2-day experimental study. On the exercise day, participants were asked to walk on a treadmill at 60% maximum heart rate for 1h. After the exercise, participants selected and ate food at a university cafeteria. Post-exercise EI was compared to a non-exercise day. A single mixed model repeated 2 x 2 ANOVA was used to determine the impact of exercise on post-exercise EI. The overweight women consumed significantly more (p&<.02) than the normal weight women on both experimental days and there was a significant (p&<.03) difference in fat intake. The higher post -exercise EI of the overweight group may have been due to the energy needs associated with a higher BMI but it is also possible that cognitive factors, food availability and environment may influence post-exercise EI.
