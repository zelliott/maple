Obesity is characterized by a pro-inflammatory state commonly associated with type 2 diabetes and fat-liver disease. In the last few years, different studies pointed out the role of Angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) in the metabolic regulation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of oral-administration of Ang-(1-7) in metabolism and inflammatory state of high-fat feed rats. Twenty-four male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: High Fat Diet (HFD); Standard Diet (ST); High Fat Diet+Angiotensin-(1-7) [HFD+Ang-(1-7)]. Glycemic profile was evaluated by glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests, plasmatic glucose and insulin. Cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides analyses presented lipidic profile. RT-PCR evaluated mRNA expression to ACE, ACE2, resistin, TLR4, IL-6, TNF-α and NF-κB genes. The main results showed that oral Ang-(1-7) decreased body weight and abdominal fat-mass. In addition, HFD+Ang-(1-7) treated rats presented enhanced glucose tolerance, insulin-sensitivity and decreased plasma-insulin levels, as well as a significant decrease in circulating lipid levels. These alterations were accompanied by a marked decreased expression of resistin, TLR4, ACE and increased ACE2 expression in liver. Furthermore, Ang-(1-7) decreases phosphorylation of MAPK and increases NF-κB expression. These alterations diminished expression of interleukin-6 and TNF-α, ameliorate inflammatory state in liver. In summary, the present study showed that oral-treatment with Ang-(1-7) in high-fat feed rats improved metabolism down-regulating resistin/TLR4/NF-κB-pathway.
