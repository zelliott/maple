Obesity is characterized by the presence of chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, particularly in the visceral compartment, that has been causally linked to development of obesity-associated comorbidities. This link can be either direct or indirect, through induction of insulin resistance. This review summarizes recent evidence on potential pharmacological targets of adipose tissue inflammation, with emphasis on mediators that are being studied for intervention in chronic inflammatory diseases and are therefore viable therapeutical candidates. Specifically, we discuss evidence on the role of the inflammasome and its downstream products as a potential target for anti-inflammatory strategies as well as T regulatory (Treg) cells and mediators involved in the resolution phase of inflammation such as resolvins, protectins, annexin A1 (ANXA1) and galectins as potential targets for novel agonist therapies.
