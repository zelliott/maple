The authors sought to evaluate psychiatric comorbidity, subjective quality of life, and impact of psychopathology on quality of life measures in a clinical sample of patients attending a center for the diagnosis and treatment of obesity compared to a matched sample of non-obese subjects.

Two hundred ninety-three consecutive obese patients (48 males, 245 females, mean age 45.41 +/- 13.55 yrs; mean BMI 35.60 +/- 6.20) were compared with a control group made of 293 non obese subjects (48 males, 245 females, mean age 45.66 +/- 13.86 yrs; mean BMI 21.8 +/- 2.06); all subjects were interviewed by means of SCID I and SCID II and completed the WHO-QoL-Bref, a self-administered instrument for evaluation of subjective quality of life.

Obesity was associated with a significant lifetime major risk both for axis I (OR = 3.47, p = 0.000) and axis II disorders (OR = 2.27, p = 0.000); obesity was also associated with significantly lower measures of subjective quality of life on physical, social, and psychological domains; comorbidity with axis I/II disorders was associated with lower QoL measures on WHO-QoL-Bref, in particular among obese patients.

Obesity is significantly associated with a significant major risk of psychiatric comorbidity and poor quality of life; comorbid mental disorders play a significant role in worsening quality of life of obese patients; a multimodal approach to the treatment of obesity, including psychiatric evaluation and intervention, is needed to improve quality of life of patients.
