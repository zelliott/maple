The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) in type 2 diabetic men (T2DM) in population of Polish men and examine the possible influence of estradiol levels and glycemic control. We evaluated TT, cfT, estradiol, and glycemic control (HbA1c) in 184 diabetic men and in 149 nondiabetic control group. The mean HbA1c was 8.6 ± 0.2% and 6.1 ± 0.3% and cfT concentration was 0.315 ± 0.08 nmol/L and 0.382 ± 0.07 nmol/L, respectively. T2DM had higher E2 concentration than nonobese control men (29.4 ± 3.7 pg/mL versus 24.5 ± 2.9 pg/mL). Forty-six percent of T2DM were hypogonadal and 93% had HH. We observed inverse relationship between BMI and cfT (r = -0.341, P &<0.01) and positive between BMI and E2 (r = 0.329, P &<0.01). E2 concentration was higher in T2DM with HH versus T2DM with normal TT/cfT concentration (34.5 ± 5.2 versus 27.4 ± 3.4 pg/mL). We observed negative correlation between HbA1c and cfT (r = -0.336, P &<0.005) but positive between HbA1c and E2 levels (r = 0.337, P &<0.002). The prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and CVD was higher in men with hypogonadism. High incidence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in type 2 diabetic men in Polish population is associated with poor glycemic control and can be secondary to an increase in estradiol concentrations.
