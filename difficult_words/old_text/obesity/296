To evaluate the efficacy of levonorgestrel intrauterine systems (LNG-IUS) in obese women with AUB on anticoagulant therapy.

Prospective observational case series (Canadian Task Force Classification II-3).

University affiliated teaching hospital.

Premenopausal women on Warfarin therapy.

From January 2002 through January 2007, 10 women were identified from the senior author's clinical practice (G.A.V.). After clinical assessment, including Papanicolaou smear, endometrial biopsy, and pelvic sonography, the LNG-IUS was placed to treat their AUB.

The median and range of age, parity, and body mass index were 45 years (34-49), 1 (0-4), and 38 kg/m(2) (26-52), respectively. All women were receiving warfarin therapy (4-12.5 mg/d) for previous venous thromboembolism. Some patients had additional comorbid conditions and were at high risk for traditional medical or surgical therapies. After placement of the LNG-IUS, all women reported menstrual reduction at 3 and 6 months. By 12 months, 1 woman with large fibroids expelled the LNG-IUS and was treated with transfemoral uterine artery embolization. Two women had amenorrhea, and 7 had hypomenorrhea. At 2 to 5 years, 1 woman expelled the LNG-IUS and hysterectomy indicated extensive adenomyosis in a 195-g uterus, and 1 woman had hysteroscopic endometrial ablation, 4 were menopausal, 2 had amenorrhea, and 1 had hypomenorrhea. In the 5 women with uterine fibroids measuring 4.2 to 147 cm(3), the fibroids were reduced in volume by approximately 75% in 2, were no longer detectable in 1, were subsequently shown to be adenomyoma in 1, and required uterine artery embolization in 1.

In properly assessed and selected obese, premenopausal women with AUB receiving warfarin therapy and at high risk for traditional therapies, the LNG-IUS was an effective treatment in 70% of patients.
