To study the association of gene polymorphism at cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) locus with obesity and response to dietary intervention in obesity.

The PCR-PFLP method was used to detect the polymorphism of CETP gene of 340 adults in Shanghai. The levels of serum lipid profile, including TG, TC, HDL and LDL were analyzed. Obesity was selected to dietary intervention.

(1)The genotype frequencies of CETP-TaqIB B1 B1, B1 B2 and B2 B2 were 35.6%, 47.9% and 16.5% respectively, which were in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no significant difference in the distribution of genotypes between the obesity group and control group. The result was same after several influence factors controlled. (2) The levels of HDL were significantly different among genotype groups. Subjects for the B2 B2 genotype had the highest HDL levels. The relationship was steady after adjusting several influence factors. (3)Subjects for the B1 B2 genotype had higher HDL level after intervention, which was significantly different to other genotype groups. After adjusting baseline HDL level and gender, genotype didn't effect the change in HDL.

CETP-TaqIB gene polymorphism influenced serum HDL level. But this gene polymorphism at CETP locus wasn't especial in adult obesity. Baseline HDL level influenced the change in HDL response to dietary intervention in three genotype groups.
