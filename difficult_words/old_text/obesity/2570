In the present study, we investigated the influences of a high fat diet (HD) fed for 12 weeks, on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme using 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (HNE)-modified proteins (HNE-mp) and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in the hippocampal CA1 region (CA1) in C57BL/6N and C3H/HeN mice. Body weights and body weight gains were significantly higher in HD fed C57BL/6N mice than in low fat diet (LD) fed C57BL/6N and LD or HD fed C3H/HeN mice. In the HD fed C57BL/6N and C3H/HeN mice, HNE-mp immunoreactivity and protein levels were much higher than in the LD fed C57BL/6N or C3H/HeN mice. In particular, HNE-mp immunoreactivity and protein levels in HD fed C57BL/6N mice was higher than that in the HD fed C3H/HeN mice. SOD1 immunoreaction was detected in the non-pyramidal cells of C57BL/6N mice, while in the C3H/HeN mice SOD1 immunoreaction was observed in CA1 pyramidal cells. The SOD1 immunoreactivity in the LD fed C57BL/6N and C3H/HeN mice was slightly, but not significantly decreased compared to that in the HD fed C57BL/6N and C3H/HeN mice, respectively. In addition, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) immunoreactive microglia in the HD fed C57BL/6N showed hypertrophy of cytoplasm, which is the characteristics of activated microglia. These results suggest that HD fed C57BL/6N mice are more susceptible to lipid peroxidation in the CA1 than in LD fed C57BL/6N and LD or HD fed C3H/HeN mice without any differences of SOD1 expression.
