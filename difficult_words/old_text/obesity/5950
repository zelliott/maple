Review long-term results of the modified cautery-assisted palatoplasty (mod CAPSO)/anterior palatoplasty for the treatment of mild-moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Prospective series of 77 patients. All patients were&>18 years old, type I Fujita, body mass index (BMI)&<3, Friedman clinical stage II, with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from 1.0 to 30.0. The mean follow-up time was 33.5 months. The procedure involved an anterior soft palatal advancement technique with or without removal of the tonsils. The procedure was done under general or local anesthesia.

There were 69 men and eight women; the mean age was 39.3 years old; and mean BMI was 24.9 (range 20.7-26.8). There were 38 snorers and 39 OSA patients. The AHI improved in patients with OSA, 25.3+/-12.6 to 11.0+/-9.9 (P&<.05). The overall success rate for this OSA group was 71.8 percent (at mean 33.5 months). The mean snore scores (visual analog score) improved from 8.4 to 2.5 (for all 77 patients). Lowest oxygen saturation also improved in all OSA patients. Subjectively, all patients felt less tired.

This technique has been shown to be effective in the management of patients with snoring and mild-moderate OSA.
