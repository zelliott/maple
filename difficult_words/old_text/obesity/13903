To investigate the role of resistin gene variants on the adiposity and metabolic changes observed in response to a 100-day overfeeding protocol conducted with 12 pairs of monozygotic twins.

Body-fat measurements included hydrodensitometry and abdominal fat from computed tomography. Plasma glucose and insulin during fasting and in response to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were assayed. A 4.2 MJ test meal was consumed, after which calorimetric measurements were performed for 240 min.

Respiratory quotient (RQ) decreased (P=0.001) more in AA/AG than in GG subjects of the IVS2+181&>A polymorphism after the caloric surplus and the significance persisted when correction for multiple testing was performed. Total abdominal (P=0.027) and visceral (P=0.004) fat increased more in TC than in TT subjects of the IVS2+39&>T polymorphism. In response to overfeeding, glucose area under the curve during the OGTT showed a slight decrease (P=0.031) in the TC while it increased in TT subjects. OGTT insulin area tended to increase less (P=0.055) in TC than in TT subjects. After overfeeding, fasting insulin was lower in TC than in TT subjects (P=0.010). In addition, TC subjects experienced more decrease in RQ than TT subjects (P=0.034).

The IVS2+181&>A variant was associated with the changes in RQ in response to overfeeding. The IVS2+39&>T polymorphism was associated with overfeeding-induced changes in abdominal visceral fat, OGTT glucose area and RQ. The results suggest that sequence variation in the resistin gene is involved in the adaptation to chronic positive energy balance.
