Before men older than age 45 participate in vigorous exercise programs, the American Heart Association and the American College of Sports Medicine recommend they undergo a screening maximal exercise treadmill test. We examined the predictive value for subsequent cardiac events of exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia (SI) during the exercise treadmill test in healthy, sedentary, obese, middle-aged and older men recruited for research studies.

A cohort study with 7 years of follow-up.

Out-patient research at a tertiary hospital.

170 healthy, sedentary, obese, middle-aged and older (ages 45-79 years) men with no prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD) recruited for research studies.

Cardiac risk factors, exercise-induced SI (ST segment depression on the electrocardiogram during a maximal exercise treadmill test), maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max), and 7- year follow-up data on incident CAD.

At baseline, 37 of the men (22%) had exercise-induced SI on their treadmill tests. Seven-year follow-up data was obtained in 97% of the patients. In the interim, 31 men had cardiac endpoints (sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, angina), and four had noncardiac deaths. Seventeen of the 37 men (46%) with exercise-induced SI on their baseline exercise tests had cardiac endpoints compared with 14 of 133 (11%) men with normal exercise tests (P &<.001). Compared with the men with no cardiac endpoints, the men with subsequent cardiac endpoints were older (63 +/- 1 vs 58 +/- 1 years, mean +/- SEM, P &<.001) and had a lower maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) (24 +/- 1 vs 29 +/- 1 mL/kg/min, P &<.001). In Cox proportional hazards analysis, exercise-induced SI and a low VO2max were independent predictors of subsequent cardiac endpoints.

In a healthy population of obese, sedentary, middle-aged and older men, exercise-induced SI and low VO2max were predictors of incident CAD. This suggests that exercise treadmill testing is beneficial in assessing risk for future cardiac events in obese, sedentary individuals.
