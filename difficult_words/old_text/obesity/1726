Incidence and prevalence of owerweight and obesity have greatly increased over the past three decades in almost all countries around the world. This phenomenon is not easily explained by lifestyle changes in populations with very different initial habits. This has led to consider the influence of other factors, the so-called endocrine disruptors, and more specifically obesogens. This study reviewed the available evidence about polluting chemical substances which may potentially be obesogens in humans: DES, genistein, bisphenol A, organotins (TBT, TPT), and phthalates. The first three groups of substances mainly act upon estrogen receptors, while organotins and phthalates activate PPARÎ³. It was concluded that evidence exists of the obesogenic effect of these chemical substances in tissues and experimental animals, but few data are available in humans.
