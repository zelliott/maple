To investigate the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines in the bone metabolism of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) obese adolescents as well as the effects of long-term interdisciplinary therapy on metabolic-related risk factors. Forty post-puberty obese adolescents were randomly assigned into two groups: (1) NAFLD group and (2) non-NAFLD group (diagnosis by ultrasonography) and submitted to a weight loss therapy. Body composition was analyzed by air displacement plethysmography, bone mineral density (BMD) and content by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, blood samples were collected to measure lipid profile, hepatic enzymes, and adipokines. Leptin and adiponectin concentrations were measured by ELISA. A decrease in total body mass, BMI, body fat, visceral and subcutaneous fat, insulin concentration, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol and an increase in lean body mass were observed in both groups after therapy. It was found positive correlation between the Δ BMD and the Δ fat mass (%) (r = 0.31, P = 0.01) and negative correlations between Δ BMC with Δ HOMA-IR (r = -0.34, P = 0.02) and Δ HOMA-IR with Δ leptin (r = -0.34, P = 0.02). In addition, increased levels of adiponectin and reduction in leptin concentrations were observed in NAFLD group. In the simple regression analysis, the HOMA-IR was an independent predictor changes in BMC in total obese adolescents and in the non-NAFLD group. One year of interdisciplinary weight loss therapy for obese adolescents with or without NAFLD, could regulate bone mineral metabolism as result of an increased BMC and improved inflammatory state.
