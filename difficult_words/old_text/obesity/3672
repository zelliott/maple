Obesity is among the fastest growing diseases worldwide; treatment is inadequate, and associated disorders, including gastrointestinal cancers, have high morbidity and mortality. An increased understanding of the mechanisms of obesity-induced carcinogenesis is required to develop methods to prevent or treat these cancers. In this report, we review the mechanisms of obesity-associated colorectal, esophageal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers and potential treatment strategies.
