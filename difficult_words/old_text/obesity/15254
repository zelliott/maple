A patient with a multiple peripheral embolisation of unknown origin is presented. Because of her extreme obesity, some diagnostic procedures could not be performed (CAT), and some were performed with great difficulty (conventional ECHO, DSA of the aorta). Transesophageal echocardiography was the key procedure in the diagnosis of the floating thrombotic mass in the descending aorta. A surgical operation was performed, and a thrombus was found in the aortic orifice of the hemodynamically insignificant patent ductus arteriosus. The patient has now been 18 months in good condition and free of thromboembolic events.
