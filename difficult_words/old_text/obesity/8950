JTP-426467 was identified as a result of screening in search of selective antagonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). We examined whether JTP-426467 functioned as a PPARgamma antagonist in vitro and in vivo and investigated physiological effects of JTP-426467.

The effect of JTP-426467 as a PPARgamma antagonist was studied in a cell-based reporter assay and an adipocyte differentiation assay. Target mRNA expression levels were determined by branched DNA (bDNA) assay. To examine the effects as a PPARgamma antagonist in vivo, a competitive study between JTP-426467 and BRL49653 (rosiglitazone), a PPARgamma agonist, was performed using KK-Ay mice. The effects of JTP-426467 alone after administration to KK-Ay mice were also explored. JTP-426467 antagonized PPARgamma activity in a reporter assay system, but not PPARalpha.

JTP-426467 inhibited the expression of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA, an adipocyte-abundant gene, but not PPARgamma itself or cyclophilin mRNA (as constitutive mRNA), and also suppressed triglyceride accumulation in differentiated stromal vascular fraction cells (SVFs). JTP-426467 antagonized PPARgamma agonistic action by BRL49653 in KK-Ay mice on high-fat diet, in terms of plasma glucose, body weight gain and interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) weight. JTP-426467 alone inhibited body weight gain and decreased plasma leptin level in KK-Ay mice.

JTP-426467 acted as a pure and potent PPARgamma antagonist in vitro. Interestingly, JTP-426467 completely antagonized the effects of PPARgamma agonist BRL49653 in an obese diabetic model. JTP-426467 may be a useful tool for the study of PPARgamma in biological and physiological function.
