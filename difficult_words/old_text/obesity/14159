Adipose tissue is the source of soluble mediators (adipokines), secreted mainly by adipocytes. Leptin acts on the brain and peripheral organs to regulate energy homeostasis and the neuroendocrine axis. Adiponectin regulates glucose and lipid metabolism by targeting the liver and skeletal muscle. Adiposederived proinflammatory cytokines, vasoactive peptides, coagulation and complement factors, visfatin, vaspin and retinol-binding protein signal through paracrine and hormonal mechanisms. Understanding the biology of adipose tissue and the rapidly growing list of adipokines provides new insights into normal physiological regulation, as well as the pathogenesis and treatment of obesity, diabetes and disorders of lipid metabolism and cardiovascular system.
