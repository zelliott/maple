Results of the assessment of the contractive function of the myocardium, external ventilation and arterial blood oxygenation in patients with morbid obesity of the III-IV stages are presented. The main factor responsible for the state of the myocardium function of the left ventricle is shown to be the degree of blood arterialization. Patients with reduced functional reserves of the myocardium should be given special attention in performing general anesthesia and in the nearest postoperative period.
