Provides an update on the metabolic syndrome in childhood.

The metabolic syndrome is increasingly recognized among children. It is nearly exclusively encountered in overweight and obese individuals and is associated with atherosclerosis. Development and clustering of cardiovascular risk factors is influenced by many characteristics including heritable traits, prenatal and infantile influences, diet, physical activity, and socioeconomic status.

Epidemiological data have become mature in this area. Efforts to design and implement systems to prevent and treat the metabolic syndrome are required.
