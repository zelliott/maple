To elucidate determinants of abnormal left ventricular functional responses to exercise in hypertensive patients.

One hundred twenty-seven patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were studied by rest and exercise radionuclide angiography and by echocardiography at rest.

The 24 patients with subnormal left ventricular ejection fraction at peak exercise (less than 54%) were similar in age and rest and exercise blood pressures to the 103 with normal exercise ejection fraction, but were more obese (p less than 0.005) and had greater left ventricular mass (p less than 0.03) and internal dimensions (p less than 0.001). The parallel increase in left ventricular chamber size and mass (eccentric hypertrophy) in the group of patients with exercise dysfunction was associated with higher resting end-systolic wall stress (p less than 0.001) and abnormal increases of end-systolic left ventricular volume from rest to peak exercise (p less than 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that exercise left ventricular dysfunction was independently associated with higher left ventricular mass (p less than 0.0005), end-systolic wall stress (p less than 0.001), dietary sodium intake (p less than 0.01), and body mass index (p less than 0.03).

Among patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension, abnormal functional responses to exercise are strongly associated with eccentric ventricular hypertrophy, obesity, and high sodium intake.
