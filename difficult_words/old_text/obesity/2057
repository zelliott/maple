We investigated the factors which may influence post-operative liver and renal function using a multiple regression analysis after isoflurane or sevoflurane anesthesia in 844 patients (ASA I or II, age 20-90 yr). Hepatic and renal surgeries were excluded from this study. The parameters examined were sex, age, degree of obesity, preoperative liver function, preoperative renal function, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, inhalation anesthetics used, MAC.h of anesthesia, the duration of operation, blood loss, amount of blood transfusion, urine volume during operation, and surgical site. Serum GOT, GPT, total bilirubin, BUN and serum creatinine were examined on the 3rd and 7th day after surgery. An increase in serum GOT, GPT or bilirubin was observed for each of the following parameters; male, infection with hepatitis C virus, long operation, and upper abdominal surgery. Postoperative BUN and serum creatinine increased in patients with preoperative renal dysfunction, in elderly patients, and in hepatitis C carriers.
