Comparison of the parameters of obesity between two populations, urban from Warsaw and agricultural-industrial from Tarnobrzeg province revealed that skinfolds thickness, Quetelet index and body fat index, and per cent of overweight were statistically significantly higher in men from urban population. In the group of women these parameters were also statistically higher in Warsaw population with the exception of triceps skinfold and Quetelet index--differences of no statistical significance. There were also differences in the set of variables which correlate with the parameters of obesity between these two tested populations.
