To emphasis the need for timely diagnosis of Alström syndrome.

We report a case of late-detected Alström syndrome in a boy 15 1/2 years of age who was admitted because of poor wound healing and hyperglycemia.

Diagnosis was made and the patient's impaired glucose tolerance improved by diet.

Regular follow-ups are needed to recognize and possibly prevent late-appearing complications.
