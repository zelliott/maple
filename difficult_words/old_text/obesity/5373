Recommendations for energy intake in obese children rely on accurate methods for measuring energy expenditure that cannot be assessed systematically.

The aim was to establish and validate new equations for predicting resting energy expenditure (REE), specifically in obese children.

REE (indirect calorimetry) and body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis) were measured in 752 obese subjects aged 3-18 y. The first cohort (n=471) was used to establish predictive equations, the second (and independent) cohort (n=211) was used to validate these equations, and the third cohort, a follow-up group of children who lost weight (n=70), was used to examine predictive REE in the postobese period. REE values predicted with the use of various published equations and the new established equation were compared with measured REE by using the Bland-Altman method and Student's t tests.

In cohort 1, significant determinants of the new prediction equations were fat-free mass in boys (model R2=0.79) and age and fat-free mass in girls (model R2=0.76). External validation conducted by using the Bland-Altman method and Student's t tests, in cohort 2, showed no significant difference between measured REE and predicted REE with the new equation. When already published equations were applied, systematical bias appeared with all published equations except for that of the World Health Organization. In cohort 3, the children who lost weight, almost all equations significantly underestimated REE.

These new predictive equations allow clinicians to estimate REE in an obese pediatric population with sufficient and acceptable accuracy. This estimation may be a strong basis for energy recommendations in childhood obesity.
