Body mass index (BMI) has been suggested to provide clinicopathological information in tumor development and progression in patients with gastric carcinoma.

The correlation of BMI with clinicopathological features and operation-related factors was analyzed in 308 patients with gastric carcinoma who had undergone distal or total gastrectomy.

There was no significant correlation of obesity, indicated by a high value of BMI, with tumor-related factors including survival, or with operation-related factors. On the other hand, more advanced tumors and worse preoperative nutritional and immunological conditions were found in patients with a lower value of BMI.

BMI might be a representation of the physical condition brought about by the extent of tumor progression rather than a factor influencing the factors related to gastric carcinoma.
