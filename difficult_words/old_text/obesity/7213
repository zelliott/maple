A selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist, AJ-9677, was reported to ameliorate obesity and insulin resistance in KK-Ay mice. We examined the acute and chronic effects of AJ-9677 on obese dogs. Oral administration of AJ-9677 (0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg) to overnight fasted obese beagles produced a dose-dependent rise in the plasma levels of non-esterified fatty acids and insulin in 1h, followed by a gradual drop of the plasma glucose level. It produced no apparent abnormal behaviors, but easily detectable cutaneous flushing. Daily treatment of AJ-9677 at a lower dose (0.01 mg/kg) for three weeks produced no notable change in body weight, but at a higher dose (0.1 mg/kg) it reduced the body weight compared to a placebo treatment after seven weeks. Computed tomographic examinations revealed a remarkable reduction of body fat after the AJ treatment, being consistent with the histological observations that the adipose tissue of AJ-9677-treated dogs consisted of smaller and some multilocular adipocytes. The plasma levels of leptin and adiponectin were decreased and increased, respectively, after the AJ treatment, reflecting the reduction of adiposity. It was concluded that AJ-9677 is useful for the treatment of obesity in the dog.
