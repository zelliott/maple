We have used B-mode (brightness-mode) ultrasound to investigate the fascial planes within subcutaneous fat at the triceps and abdominal sites in a group of 17 women attending a weight control group over a 12 month period. In most subjects there was a single intralipid fascial plane at each site. As the thickness of adipose tissue increased, most of the change at the abdominal site was in the deep rather than the superficial layer of fat. At the triceps site both deep and superficial layers increased. Our findings confirm the presence of two different layers in human subcutaneous fat at the triceps and abdominal sites. These layers have been shown to be functionally different in animals and our study supports this in humans at the abdominal site.
