During a total fast in obese subjects, the daily rate of nitrogen excretion undergoes only a small further decline after 2 wk, the excretion rate being about 5 g N/day. At this time, ammonium and urea each constitute about one-half of this excretion. The purpose of this study was to consider two alternative hypotheses: first, that the near plateau in nitrogen excretion represents an irreducible minimum rate of net protein breakdown in order to supply essential organs with calories in the form of glucose; second, that protein breakdown could be further reduced by minimizing the requirement to provide nitrogen for ammonium excretion during the ketoacidosis of fasting. Because ammonium excretion is largely controlled by acid-base balance, 150 mmol of sodium bicarbonate plus 60 mmol of potassium chloride were administered daily to decrease ammonium excretion in eight obese subjects who were totally fasting for more than 14 days. Urine ammonium nitrogen fell with this treatment (from 3.8 +/- 0.4 to 2.0 +/- 0.4 g N/g creatinine). In addition, there was a smaller fall in the rate of urea excretion (from 2.5 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.3 g N/g creatinine) together with a fall in the blood urea nitrogen. Therefore, it appears that ammonium excretion contributes to the negative nitrogen balance of a prolonged total fast, as assessed over a 3-day period of observation, is responsible for about one-third of the net lean body mass loss.
