Validate a model of high-fat diet-induced obesity, of low cost, easy reproducibility, that could express characteristics observed in human, and would enable subsequent therapy proposals.

Sixteen Swiss mice received a standard diet (DP) or high-fat diet (DH) for 10 weeks.

Although the DP group had greater water (p &<0.01) and feed (p &<0.001) consumption, the DH group had greater body weight (p &<0.5) and adipose tissue gain (p &<0.001), favoring higher adiposity index (p &<0.001), glucose (p &<0.01), and area under the curve in the insulin (p &<0.001) and glucose (p &<0.01) tolerance tests.

A high-fat diet-induced obesity model has been validated, which was also associated with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance after a period of 10 weeks.
