To describe health beliefs, weight concern, dieting practices, and weight-loss program preferences of American Indian women residing in an urban setting.

Face-to-face interviews using a semistructured questionnaire were conducted and height and weight were measured.

Subjects were 203 American Indian adult women in an urban community setting.

Frequency distributions and chi 2 analysis were performed using the Statistical Analysis System software.

About two-thirds of the subjects were overweight. Most women were concerned about obesity and reported attempting to manage their weight. Healthful weight-loss practices (e.g., eating more fruits and vegetables, increasing physical activity) were used most frequently. However, unhealthful practices, such as skipping meals/fasting, using laxatives/diuretics, and self-induced vomiting were also mentioned. Regular bingeing was reported by 10% of respondents.

Weight-management intervention efforts should focus on helping clients modify their diet and physical activity patterns. Low-cost programs offered in convenient locations would attract more participants, as would the provision of child care. Education about the dangers and ineffectiveness of unhealthful weight-loss practices will be necessary, given the high rates of such behaviors in this population.
