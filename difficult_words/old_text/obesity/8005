Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death of men and women in the United States. The accumulation of visceral adipose tissue, as opposed to subcutaneous fat, increases the risk of developing CVD and metabolic disease. Because visceral adipose tissue uniquely contributes to the pathophysiology of CVD and insulin resistance, waist circumference is now being considered as a more useful marker of potential health risks associated with overweight and obesity than body mass index. Weight loss, particularly a reduction in waist circumference, improves insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and serum adipocytokines, thereby reducing the risk of developing chronic disease and CVD.
