Obesity is a significant public health issue in the US constituting an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality as well as complicating the management of other medical conditions. Yet, traditionally most physicians receive little training in evidence-based obesity interventions. Previous literature suggests many physicians believe they do not have effective tools to address obesity and/or that obesity management is not within their scope of practice. Given the new emphasis from NIH and AAFP urging physicians to conceptualize and treat obesity as a chronic medical condition, we examined obesity-related knowledge and practices among military and civilian primary care physicians. Results were similar across these two physician groups in suggesting many physicians still may be ill-prepared to manage obesity in the primary care setting. Implications for patient care and future research are discussed.
