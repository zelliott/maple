Obesity is an epidemic in the United States, especially among the pregnant population. Obesity is responsible for an increase in fetal anomalies and adverse outcome of both mother and fetus. Due to difficulty in penetrating to the depth of the uterus, the ultrasound image in obese patients is inadequate, fuzzy, and high in artifacts. Hence, obese patients often require multiple scans as well as special scanning techniques just to get borderline image quality. These techniques and the data regarding quality and frequency of scans for the obese pregnant population are discussed in this paper.
