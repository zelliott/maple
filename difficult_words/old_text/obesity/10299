Several new drug therapies with beneficial effects on more than one of the cardiometabolic risk factors that contribute to the metabolic syndrome have been developed recently or are under investigation. Emerging risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD), including low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1), high levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol particles, have been identified. We provide a detailed description of the mechanisms of action and findings from clinical trials of the new drug therapies and discuss established drug therapies with beneficial effects on emerging risk factors for CHD. The new and emerging drug therapies include an antiobesity agent that reduces atherogenic dyslipidemia and abnormal glucose metabolism; cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors that increase HDL cholesterol and apoA-1 levels; glitazars that increase HDL cholesterol and decrease triglyceride concentrations, as well as improve abnormal glucose metabolism; and the amylin analog pramlintide and the incretin mimetic exenatide, both of which reduce body weight as well as improve abnormal glucose metabolism. The insulin-sensitizing effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which may help prevent new-onset diabetes mellitus, and the beneficial effects of the ARB telmisartan on the glucose and lipid profiles also are presented.
