By February, 1948, examinations in the Twin Cities Prospective Study were completed on 284 executive men, then aged 45-55 and "healthy". In 35 years 183 died, 110 were alive, one was lost. Entry body fatness, indicated by body mass index, skinfold thickness at three sites, relative girth, and body density, did not significantly discriminate the 35-year dead from survivors. Age at death was not related to any fatness measure. The multiple logistic equation in five solutions using age, blood pressure and smoking plus each fatness item separately, found no discrimination of dead from survivors by any fatness measure. In other long time prospective studies, two suggested excess mortality at far extremes of over- and under-weight, several found survivors significantly fatter than the dead, others found no relation between fatness and longevity. Framingham reported fatness a risk factor for death when allowance is made for smoking but that singular claim has been criticized.
