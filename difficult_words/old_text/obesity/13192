Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is regarded as an independent risk factor for Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The objectives of this study were: to determine the effects of diet and exercise on Lp(a) and to evaluate the relation of Lp(a) with the lipid profile (total serum cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol). Baseline Lp(a), body mass index (BMI) and the lipid profiles were measured in 343 Obese (BMI&>30kg/m(2)) African-Americans. After a 3-month intervention of diet and exercise by 105 participants, their lipids were re-measured. Baseline Lp(a) levels ranged from 1.2 to 280mg/dl. Lp(a) was inversely associated with triglyceride (P&<.05). After the intervention, Lp(a) and HDL increased by a mean of 20 and 5%, respectively. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and BMI decreased by 7, 10, 11 and 8%, respectively. Women taking estrogen replacement had a negligible change in Lp(a) while participants taking HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors had an increase in Lp(a) levels by 30%.
