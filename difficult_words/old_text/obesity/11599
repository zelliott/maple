The influence of obesity on plasma fructosamine concentration was studied in 68 diabetic and 1335 nondiabetic subjects from a Chinese community. Obese nondiabetic men (body mass index&> 25 kg/m2) had lower fructosamine concentrations than nonobese nondiabetic men (body mass index &<or = 25 kg/m2); the pattern was similar for diabetic women. Stepwise multiple-regression analysis showed that, apart from known factors (total protein, albumin, and indices of glycemic control), fructosamine was also associated with body mass index and plasma fasting triglycerides. However, the contribution of these were small except in diabetic women. We conclude that the effect of obesity on fructosamine is small.
