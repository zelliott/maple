Genetic variation in brwon fat specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) expression and brown adipocyte morphology, have provided models to test the hypothesis that nonshivering thermogenesis is associated with the regulation of body weight. Genetic manipulation using transgenic animals and gene targeting, has resulted in mice with an over-expression of UCP1. These variant animals consistently show that over-expression of UCP1 reduced adiposity. On the other hand, less agreement is found in models that reduce nonshivering thermogenesis. Inactivation of the UCP1 gene, by gene targeting, does not increase adiposity when compared to control animals; however, a mouse expressing the UCP1-DTA transgene (UCPI-diphtheria toxin A chain), in which there is a modest reduction in the number of brown adipocytes, becomes obese. Other phenotypes of this mouse, the hyperphagia, extreme resistance to leptin administration, retinopathy and high residual content of brown adipocytes, suggest that the effects of the transgene may be more extensive than simply a 60% reduction in the number of brown adipocytes. Ectopic expression of UCP1-DTA in the brain could explain the phenotype of this mouse in a manner more consistent with the results of other models with altered UCP1 and brown adipocyte expression.
