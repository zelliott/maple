Clinical evidence shows that combining advice to increase fruit and vegetable consumption with caloric restriction is an effective strategy for weight management. The purpose of this review is to evaluate epidemiologic evidence to determine whether it supports an association between fruit and/or vegetable consumption and body weight. Few studies have been designed to specifically address this issue, and those that are available vary in methodology and offer inconsistent results. We make recommendations on how to strengthen future studies so that the influence of fruit and vegetable consumption on body weight in free-living individuals is better understood.
