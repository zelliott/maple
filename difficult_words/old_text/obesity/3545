We compared the binge eating pathway linking body image dissatisfaction (BID) and psychological distress of obese adults entering and not entering psychological treatment for their weight problems.

90 obese participants seeking an integrated treatment (OB-IT) and 87 obese participants seeking only medical treatment (OB-MT) for their weight problems completed questionnaires on BID, binge eating and psychological well-being.

Only in the OB-IT group, binge eating behaviors mediated the relationship between BID and psychological distress.

Both BID and binge eating behaviors need to be addressed in the psychological and medical treatment for obesity to enhance psychological well-being.
