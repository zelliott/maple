Adiponectin and leptin, polypeptide hormones produced by adipocytes, have recently been reported to be associated with prostate cancer risk, though, the relationship remains poorly understood. We examined the association of adiponectin and leptin levels in serum with prostate cancer risk after adjustments for age, obesity-related factors, and prostate cancer risk.

Fifty-four prostate cancer patients and 70 control subjects provided blood sampled between 2008 and 2009. Using those, we determined serum adiponectin and leptin levels, and evaluated their relationships with prostate cancer risk after adjustments for age, obesity-related factors (body weight, body mass index, waist circumference), and prostate volume. Adipokine densities were calculated by dividing serum level with prostate volume.

There were no differences for median serum adiponectin and leptin levels between the prostate cancer and benign control groups (P=0.22 and 0.78, respectively). Patients with levels of both adipokines in the highest quartile after adjustment for age had significantly higher risks of prostate cancer (adiponectin: odds ratio [OR] 2.79, P=0.014; leptin: OR 2.72, P=0.027). Patients with an adiponectin level greater than the median after adjustment for body weight also had a significantly elevated risk of prostate cancer (OR 2.22, P=0.031), whereas, those with a leptin level significantly greater than the median had a significantly lower risk (OR 0.46, P=0.027). Furthermore, median adiponectin density was significantly higher in the prostate cancer group than the benign group (P=0.0033).

Serum adiponectin and leptin levels are useful markers for prostate cancer risk after adjustments for age, obesity-related factors, and prostate volume.
