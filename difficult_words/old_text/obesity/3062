The psychological and social adjustment of 30 obese children and their families was examined. Mothers completed the Child Behaviour Checklist and the Family Environment Scale; children completed the Self-Perception Profile for Children. The results consistently indicate that the obese children were less socially competent, had more behaviour problems, and had poorer self-perceptions than the non-obese normative samples. Families of obese children differed significantly from families in the non-distressed normative sample in that they interacted in a more negative way. The findings are discussed in terms of an 'at risk profile' and the implications for the behavioural treatment of obese children.
