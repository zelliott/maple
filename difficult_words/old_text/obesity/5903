Characteristics of food behavioral reactions were studied in 159 patients with alimentary obesity, basing on the analysis of a specially developed questionnaire which helped elucidating the features of food motivation (FM) during 8-12 months. Three groups of patients were distinguished (with high, low and normal FM) in relation to the character, degree and duration of changes in the patients' behavioral reactions. The main manifestations of high (109 patients, 68.7% cases) and low (18 patients, 11.2% cases) FM were specified. Thirty two (20.1%) patients with normal FM in their catamnesis showed distinct hyperphagic behavior that, together with other features of FM, was considered as the state of a stable remission of high FM. Two types of high FM were differentiated which should be taken into account in the administration of effective therapy to patients with alimentary obesity.
