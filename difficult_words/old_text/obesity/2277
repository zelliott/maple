Decursin (De), an active component of Angelica gigas, is known to exert anticancer and neuroprotective effects. However, its antiobesity and antidiabetic potential has not yet been investigated. This study evaluated the antiobesity effect of decursin, particularly focusing on its ability to inhibit adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Decursin treatment resulted in the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation and the expression of fatty acid synthase. The study further investigated these antiobesity effects using mice fed a normal diet (ND), a high-fat diet (HFD) and a HFD plus decursin 200 mg/kg diet (HFD + De) for 7 weeks. Mice administered HFD plus decursin showed a drastic decrease in weight gain, triglyceride content, total cholesterol content and fat size compared with those that received the HFD alone; this was observed despite similar quantities of total food intake. Furthermore, decursin improved glucose tolerance in mice fed a HFD. Finally, administration of decursin along with the HFD significantly reduced the secretion of HFD-induced adipocytokines such as leptin, resistin, IL-6 and MCP-1. These results suggest that decursin might be useful for the treatment of obesity and diabetes.
