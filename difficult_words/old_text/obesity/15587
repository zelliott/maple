This study assessed perceived changes in sexual behavior and body image after weight loss in a clinically obese population. Thirty-two women enrolled in a hospital-based multidisciplinary weight management program completed retrospective questionnaires about their sexual functioning and body image before and after weight loss. Subjects reported significant increases in the frequency of their sexual activity. Subjects also perceived significant improvements in their body image. These findings suggest that obese people experience positive changes in sexual functioning and body image after weight loss.
