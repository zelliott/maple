To study the relationship between childhood obesity, weight loss, hyperinsulinaemia and the erythrocyte insulin receptor, we measured the plasma concentrations of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and C-peptide and the binding of 125I-insulin to erythrocytes in 12 obese children with a mean age +/- SD of 11.4 +/- 2.5 years and a mean relative weight score +/- SD of 4.8 +/- 1.4 and 12 age-matched normal-weight children. Eight obese children were re-evaluated after 1 year's participation in a weight reduction programme. The obese children had higher fasting plasma concentrations of IRI (P less than 0.01) and C-peptide (P less than 0.05) and a lower C-peptide to IRI molar ratio (P less than 0.01) than the normal-weight children. The obese children had in addition a reduced erythrocyte insulin binding (P less than 0.05 or less) over the physiological range of circulating insulin concentration. There was a negative correlation (r = -0.60; P less than 0.01) between the insulin tracer binding and the relative weight. The weight reduction programme resulted in a decrease of 1.0 SD (P less than 0.05) in the mean relative weight score. At the end of the therapy the obese children had lower fasting blood glucose levels (P less than 0.05) and lower plasma IRI concentrations at 90 min (P less than 0.05) after an oral glucose load than at the onset of therapy. There were no significant differences between the insulin binding characteristics at the commencement and at the end of the treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
