Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is around 25% in Europe but its           occurrence grows in both genders with increasing age and weight. Lifestyle factors           may contribute to the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. The objective of this           study was to determine the relationship between metabolic syndrome and eating           habits as well as length of sleep and smoking. Participants (519 women and 286           men aged 18-65 years) were chosen by random selection and questioned about           their eating habits, sleep length and smoking. This information was combined with           anthropometric and clinical parameters of metabolic syndrome. The female group           was divided into two subgroups depending on climacteric stage (before and after           menopause). Metabolic syndrome prevalence does not differ between regions in           neither female (29.9%) nor male (32.5%) group. Body mass index ≥25 was detected           in 50.4% of all women and 65.7% of men; 23.5% of all women and 21.7% men had           body mass index ≥30. In conclusion, metabolic syndrome prevalence was proved           to depend on eating habits and family heredity. Positive correlation between           the above mentioned factors demonstrated itself in the total sample but not in           individual regions. Metabolic syndrome prevalence in Czech adults is comparable           with neighbouring countries. No significant interregional differences in metabolic           syndrome prevalence within the Czech Republic were detected. In conclusion,           relationship between eating habits and metabolic syndrome was confirmed.
