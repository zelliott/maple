Acceptable adverse effects and a clinical relevant weight loss of 3 to 5 kilograms have been found in long-term randomized clinical trials for sibutramine (Reductil) and orlistat (Xenical); these drugs may be prescribed for treatment of obesity for a duration of one and four years, respectively. This also seems to be the case for rimonabant (Acomplia), which is expected to receive approval in 2005 or 2006. However, until data on morbidity and mortality are available from RCTs, there is no absolute indication for prescribing drugs for treatment of obesity.
