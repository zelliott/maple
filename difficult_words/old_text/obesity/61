Alteration in insulin secretion and reduced peripheral sensitivity to the hormone have been reported in type II diabetes. In this paper, a comparison is made of basal glucose production (3H-6 glucose), insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in vivo (hyperglycemic clamp) and in vitro (binding to circulating monocytes) in 24 patients with recently diagnosed type II diabetes, matched for age and fasting glycemia and divided into non-obese (14 subjects) and moderately obese (10 subjects), and in 9 non-obese controls. The non-obese diabetics were slightly hyperinsulinemic during fasting (10.8 +/- 1.0 vs 4.8 +/- 0.8 microU/ml in controls, p less than 0.0005), with a significant reduction in early and late insulin secretion (14.0 +/- 1.5 vs 20.8 +/- 2.0 microU/ml, p less than 0.01 and 24.8 +/- 3.3 vs 34.7 +/- 2.14 microU/ml, p less than 0.025). The insulin sensitivity index MCR/I was significantly reduced (2.30 +/- 0.32 vs 4.14 +/- 0.40, p less than 0.005). Endogenous glucose production was significantly increased (107 +/- 10.2 vs 84 +/- 3.7 mg/m2 per min, p less than 0.025) and displayed a positive correlation with fasting glycemia (r = 0.51, p less than 0.05). Insulin binding to monocytes was significantly lower than in controls (2.36 +/- 0.22% vs 4.06 +/- 0.32%, p less than 0.0005). Moderately obese diabetics also were significantly hyperinsulinemic in the fasting state (18.1 +/- 2.8 microU/ml, p less than 0.0005 vs controls) but, typically, lacked the early secretory phase (20.6 +/- 3.6 microU/ml vs baseline, n.s.). A similar increase of hepatic glucose production (107 +/- 11.2 mg/m2 per min, p less than 0.025 vs controls, n.s. vs non-obese diabetics) and decrease of peripheral sensitivity to insulin (MCR/I = 1.78 +/- 0.31, p less than 0.0005 vs controls, n.s. vs non-obese diabetics) was found in moderately obese diabetics, as well as a significant reduction of insulin binding to insulated monocytes (2.62 +/- 0.4% p less than 0.01 vs controls, n.s. vs non-obese diabetics). These results confirm that common defects of both non-obese and moderately obese type II diabetics are: lack of early phase of glucose induced insulin secretion, increase in hepatic glucose production and decrease of peripheral insulin sensitivity together with reduction of insulin binding to circulating monocytes. The hypothesis of a unique defect as a cause of hyperglycemia in type II diabetes in early clinical phase is not borne out by the results of this study. Moderate obesity, even if able to reduce insulin sensitivity, seems to be less important in determining hyperglycemia.
