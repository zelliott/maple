Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability, which will increase further with longer lifetime and higher average weight of the population.

To review a hierarchy of interventions for OA in clinical practice, and compare it with the Strength of Recommendation (SOR) proposed by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI).

Search for relevant randomized controlled trials in databases, as well as published systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Preventive measures are few and uncertain; however, basic therapy includes reduction in weight in the obese and exercises to keep in shape; this is in accordance with the OARSI guidelines (OARSI, 100% consensus) emphasizing the need for obese individuals with knee OA to lose weight (OARSI, SOR = 96%). There are indications of an effect of some nutraceuticals, though further studies are needed for validation (OARSI, SOR = 63%). Pharmacological treatment has paracetamol as primary prescription, which is a safe, albeit weak analgesic. Supplementary medications are prescribed according to level of pain and possible inflammation.
