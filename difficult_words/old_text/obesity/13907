We related the effect of the satiety enhancing drug sibutramine (Meridia, Reductil) on food intake to Rorschach Comprehensive System (Exner, 1991, 1993) personality factors. A placebo-controlled crossover, within-subjects design (n = 36) was used. Food intake after 2 weeks in the sibutramine and placebo conditions was assessed with a test meal using the VIKTOR (Cabmek, Stockholm, Sweden) setup, a computerized eating monitor. Building on baseline VIKTOR measurements, we had earlier studied the microstructure of eating (Elfhag, Barkeling, Carlsson, & Rossner, 2003). In this study, a model including Afr, MOR, and Populars could explain the variance in the effect of sibutramine. Sibutramine may reduce food intake in single test meals for participants whose appetite is prompted by external stimuli including food cues, suggested by the Affective ratio. Distress related to the body in obesity seen in damaged self-imagery (MOR) and adjustment to social expectations (Populars) could also have a moderating effect on the participants' consumption of test meals in an experimental design. Bodily concern (An + Xy) was also related to sibutramine response in univariate analyses.
