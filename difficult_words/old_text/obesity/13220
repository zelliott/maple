To evaluate the effects of metformin administration on spontaneous LH episodic release in a group of nonobese polycystic ovary (PCOS) patients.

Controlled clinical study.

PCOS patients in a clinical research environment.

Twenty nonobese PCOS patients were enrolled after informed consent.

All patients underwent hormonal evaluations and a pulsatility study (sampling every 10 minutes for 4 hours) before and at the sixth month of therapy (metformin, 500 mg, p.o. b.i.d.). Ultrasound examinations and Ferriman-Gallwey scoring were also performed.

Measurements of plasma LH, FSH, estradiol (E(2)), androstenedione (A), 17-hydroxy-progesterone (17-OHP), and testosterone (T), glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations.

After 6 months of metformin administration, the plasma LH, 17-OHP, A, and T levels and LH/FSH ratio were significantly reduced. Insulin sensitivity, expressed as the glucose-to-insulin ratio, was significantly improved under glucose load after 6 months of treatment. Spontaneous LH episodic release showed a significant reduction in pulse amplitude with no changes in pulse frequency. Menstrual cyclicity was restored in all amenorrheic and oligomenorrheic women. The ovarian volume and Ferriman-Gallwey scores also were significantly reduced.

Metformin administration improves reproductive axis functioning in hyperandrogenic nonobese PCOS patients. By acting on the ovary and restoring normal ovarian activity, metformin positively modulates the reproductive axis (namely GnRH-LH episodic release).
