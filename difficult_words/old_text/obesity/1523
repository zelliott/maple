Adipocytes secrete many proteins that regulate metabolic functions. The gene inter-Î± (globulin) inhibitor H5 (ITIH-5) encodes a secreted protein and is known to be expressed abundantly in the placenta. However, using gene expression profiles data we observed high expression of ITIH-5 in adipose tissue. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that ITIH-5 is strongly expressed in human adipocytes and adipose tissue, and is related to obesity and clinical metabolic variables. ITIH-5 adipose tissue mRNA expression was analyzed with DNA microarray and real-time PCR, and its association with clinical variables was examined. ITIH-5 protein expression was analyzed using western blot. ITIH-5 mRNA expression was abundant in human adipose tissue, adipocytes, and placenta, and higher in subcutaneous (sc) compared to omental adipose tissue (P &<0.0001). ITIH-5 mRNA and protein expression in sc adipose tissue were higher in obese compared to lean subjects (P &<0.0001 and P &<0.001, respectively). ITIH-5 mRNA expression was reduced after diet-induced weight loss (P &<0.0001). ITIH-5 mRNA expression was associated with anthropometry and clinical metabolic variables. In conclusion, ITIH-5 is highly expressed in sc adipose tissue, increased in obesity, down regulated after weight loss, and associated with measures of body size and metabolism. Together, this indicates that ITIH-5 merits further investigation as a regulator of human metabolism.
