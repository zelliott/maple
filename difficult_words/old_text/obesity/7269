Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 6 (SAMP6) is a model of senile osteoporosis. From 10 to 22 wk of age, SAMP6 mice were heavier than age-matched AKR/J and SAMR1 mice. Body mass indices of 10- and 25-wk-old SAMP6 mice were higher than those of age-matched AKR/J and SAMR1 mice, indicating obesity in the SAMP6 animals. We compared the blood biochemical values among SAMP6, SAMR1, and AKR/J mice to assess whether the SAMP6 strain has abnormal obesity-related parameters. Plasma glucose, triglyceride, insulin, and leptin levels were higher in 10-wk-old SAMP6 mice than in age-matched SAMR1 and AKR/J mice, whereas plasma glucagon and adiponectin levels in 25-wk-old SAMP6 were lower compared with those in age-matched SAMR1 and AKR/J. Total cholesterol levels in SAMR1 and SAMP6 mice at 10 and 25 wk of age were higher than those in AKR/J mice. Hepatic lipid levels were higher in 10- and 25-wk-old SAMP6 mice compared with age-matched AKR/J and SAMR1 animals. These results indicate that SAMP6 mice exhibit obesity and hyperlipidemia, suggesting that the SAMP6 strain is a potential tool for the study of hyperlipidemia.
