Childhood obesity is reaching epidemic proportions and requires intervention.

To educate high school (HS) students on the effects of obesity and implement small healthy changes. Train medical students to educate and motivate adolescents and utilize a modified team-based learning format.

A medical student-created HS-based module was developed to educate adolescents on obesity's effects on health. Over 2 years, 25 medical students from each semester were trained and presented to 1590 freshmen and sophomores at suburban HSs in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The program included an interactive power point and a 30-day challenge to make small measurable changes in their current health behaviors. A modified team-based learning format was included to engage students and increase classroom interaction.

Medical students reported the program improved their ability to communicate with adolescents and enhanced their training as future physicians. Teachers felt students had sustained retention of knowledge at the end of 30 days and the majority of students fulfilled their self-imposed challenge.

A student-run HS obesity education module using a portion of team-based learning was successfully implemented into HS health science curriculums, exposed medical students to community advocacy while educating and motivating adolescents to improve health behaviors.
