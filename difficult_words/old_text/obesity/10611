Obesity is characterized by the accumulation of triacylglycerol in adipocytes. Coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is one of two known DGAT enzymes that catalyze the final and only committed step in triacylglycerol synthesis. In this report, we describe the pharmacological effects of a novel selective DGAT1 inhibitor, Compound-A. This compound inhibited triacylglycerol synthesis in both adipocytes and skeletal myotubes, and increased fatty acid oxidation in skeletal myotubes at 1 Î¼M. The repeated administration of Compound-A to diet-induced obese C57BL/6J and genetically obese KKA(y) mice (3-30 mg/kg for 3-4 weeks) significantly decreased the visceral fat pad weights and the hepatic lipid contents compared to controls without affecting food intake. In addition, fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle tissues was increased by the treatment of Compound-A in both mice strains. This is the first report demonstrating that a small synthetic DGAT1 inhibitor increases fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle in vitro and ex vivo. These results suggest that DGAT1 inhibition is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of obesity and lipid abnormalities such as hepatic steatosis.
