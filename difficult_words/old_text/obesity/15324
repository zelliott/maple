The Feelings of Fatness Questionnaire (FOFQ) was developed to assess the variability of bodily feelings of thinness-fatness across life situations. The FOFQ, three other conventional measures of perceptual and cognitive-affective body experience, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Eating Attitudes Test were administered to 132 undergraduate women. The FOFQ demonstrated acceptable construct validity and revealed considerable variation in "felt" body experience across psychosocial contexts. Problems with summary measures of body experience and possible cognitive processes mediating the relationship between context and subjective body experience are discussed.
