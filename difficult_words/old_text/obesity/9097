As the increasing prevalence of overweight and obese children is approaching epidemic proportions in North America, this study was designed to investigate whether Body Mass Index (BMI) and age- and gender-specific percentile Body Mass Index (BMI %) are associated with the likelihood of being listed for surgery for Blount disease after initial presentation to a tertiary referral centre. In a restrospective consecutive sample of 102 children with an average age of 5.9 +/- 4.3 years, it was determined that there was a significant association between BMI and BMI% and being listed for surgery, after adjusting for the effects of the child's age and gender, with mean odds ratios of 1.30 (95% confidence interval 1.02-1.60) and 1.05 (95% confidence interval 1.01-1.09) respectively. When the sample was subgrouped into infantile (less than 3 years of age) and late-onset (greater than 3 years of age), BMI and BMI% were still significantly associated with the children being listed for surgery in the late-onset group with mean odds ratios 2.75 (95% confidence interval 1.03-7.33) and 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.01-1.18) respectively. However, of the two measures only the BMI was significant in the infantile group with an odds ratio of 1.27 (95% confidence interval 1.01-1.60). Should these associations be real then measures aimed at decreasing weight in children may have some effect on the number of children undergoing surgery for the treatment of Blount disease.
