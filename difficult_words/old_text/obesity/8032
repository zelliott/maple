There is an increased accumulation of fat tissue with subsequent increase of insulin level, insulin resistance and decrease of testosterone level in aging males.

Assessment of the relations between obesity, insulin resistance and levels of sex hormones.

Indices of obesity (BMI, WHR, waist circumference), insulin level, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and levels of sex hormones (total testosterone, free testosterone, free testosterone index, sex hormone-binding globulin--SHBG, estradiol) were measured in 107 males at the mean age of 60.1 +/- 7 years.

Obesity among aging males is associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinism. All above factors correlate with decreased serum levels of testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin as well as increased ratio estradiol/testosterone ratio.

Our data suggest a role of decreased levels of testosterone and SHBG in pathogenesis of visceral obesity and metabolic syndrome in older males.
