Obesity has become a major public health problem as a consequence of its prevalence, negative impact on morbidity, mortality and quality of life and its associated direct and indirect healthcare costs. The etiology of obesity is multifactorial and reflects complex interactions of genetic, neurohumoral, environmental, behavioral and possibly, microbial factors. Available treatments for obesity include diet and exercise, behavioral modification, medications and surgery. Gastroenterologists are becoming increasingly involved in the care of obese patients. Although much of this care has historically centered on the preoperative and postoperative care of the bariatric patient, gastroenterologists are also evaluating and managing a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders that occur more commonly among obese individuals and are increasingly involved in the primary treatment of obesity. In this review, the gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders that are associated with obesity will be reviewed, the gastrointestinal contribution to the pathogenesis of obesity will be described and the current treatment options of obesity and where the gastroenterologist typically plays a role in the management will be discussed.
