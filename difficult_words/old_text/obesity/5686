To assess the predictive value of microalbuminuria (M) for diabetic macro- and microangiopathy, neuropathy and some related risk factors studies were carried out in 105 diabetic subjects. All examinations were repeated after one year. Microalbuminuria was found to parallel all late diabetic complications, at the beginning of investigations and also after a one-year evolution. It also positively correlated with some risk factors for angiopathy, such as plasma lipid parameters, blood pressure, body mass index and duration of disease.
