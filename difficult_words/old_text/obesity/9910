Androgens have been some traditionally forgotten hormones because, apparently, they do not play a main role in any pathology. However, the conviction that hormones circulating at such a high plasmatic concentration must have a biologic function, have promote an active research in this field, resulting in a better understanding of the regulation mechanisms of the synthesis of these hormones, as well as demonstrating its potential relationship with the etiopathogenicity of such important pathologies as obesity, arteriosclerosis or diabetes. In the present review, we approach the specific regulation mechanisms of synthesis of adrenal androgens, as well as their implications in severe physiological and pathological conditions.
