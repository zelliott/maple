This study examined the effects of acculturation on health behaviors among Korean-Americans in California compared to Koreans in Seoul.

Telephone interviews were conducted with 2,830 Korean-American adults in California (completion rate exceeding 86%) and 500 Korean adults in Seoul (completion of about 50%).

Among Korean-Americans, acculturated women were more likely to smoke and drink while acculturated men were more likely to become obese. All Korean-American men reported significantly decreased rates of smoking and drinking compared to Koreans in Seoul. Among both men and women in California, acculturation was associated with high consumption of American foods, and low consumption of traditional Korean foods.

These results indicate that more acculturated Korean-Americans were exposed to greater health risk than those who were less acculturated.
