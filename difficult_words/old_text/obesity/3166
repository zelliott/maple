A newly discovered hormone named adipocyte-secreted factor, or resistin, is secreted by adipocytes in mice. Expression of resistin is low during food deprivation and in diabetes, and increased greatly during refeeding and insulin treatment. It is found in serum in mice and humans, and is greatly increased in obesity. Resistin inhibits adipocyte differentiation and may function as a feedback regulator of adipogenesis. Administration of resistin to mice resulted in increased glucose production and blood glucose levels. Therefore, resistin also functions as a regulator of glucose homeostasis and a physiologic antagonist to hepatic insulin action.
