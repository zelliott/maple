Weight regain after a long-term weight-loss program is a greater problem in obesity treatment than is weight reduction. Hence, the gut may elevate the absorption rate and nutrient transportation remarkably during chronic food restriction. The extension of gut absorption may be one possible reason for weight regain. But there is little information about the mechanisms that regulate intestinal absorption during food restriction. In this study, we show that the surface absorptive areas of gut villi may be enlarged in the jejunum of rats maintained on a food restriction regimen compared with animals submitted to swimming or sedentary behavior. Our findings show that simply reducing the amount of food intake results in an increased appetite accompanied with obvious weight regain, and suggest that the resulting enlargement of villi surface areas plays a key role in the regain of weight reduction. These results bolster accumulating evidence that gut absorption may be a substantial mechanism for resistance of weight loss and enhancing the weight regain process.
