Inactivity has a number of consequences for the cardiovascular system. In particular, inactivity can lead to obesity, which can aggravate arthritis. An examination of the effect of exercise on the cardiovascular system requires the review of epidemiologic or population-based studies, because there are no large randomized trials with an exercise control group. Small randomized trials looking at exercise and the individual risk factors are reviewed.
