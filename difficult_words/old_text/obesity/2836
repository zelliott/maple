We report the 14th case of myelolipoma of the adrenal gland. Recommendations for appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic methods are made. Myelolipoma of the adrenal gland is a rare non-functioning tumor composed of lipoid and hematopoietic elements. The most consistent complaint is abdominal pain caused by hemorrhage within the tumor. We identified an association with obesity and hypertension. Ultrasound combined with computed tomography is useful in diagnosis. With expanded use of these studies, myelolipoma will be recognized more frequently. Definitive diagnosis and treatment are accomplished by simple excision; radical surgery is unnecessary.
