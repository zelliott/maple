The development of obesity is determined by lifestyle and genetic mechanisms. In particular, the polymorphisms in the adrenergic receptor genes (ADRB) have been extensively studied for association with obesity-related phenotypes. ADRB3 is an obvious candidate gene given its involvement in the regulation of lipolysis and thermogenesis. ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphism, a missense mutation in the first transmembrane domain of the R3-adrenergic receptor is associated with visceral obesity and insulin resistance in the Pima Indian, French, and Finnish populations. The recent meta-analysis that combined data of 6582 individuals from Japanese populations showed significant association the Arg64 allele with increased BMI. There are tested the polymorphisms in the beta3-Adrenoreceptor (ADRB3) gene in associated with body mass index (BMI), fat mass and biochemical parameters.We have been examined 91 persons from Moscow region with BMI&>25 kg/m2. The Trp64Arg polymorphism of ADRB3 genes were genotyped with the use of an allelic discrimination assay. The TaqMan-based real-time PCR method was applied. There have been estimated of anthropometric and biochemicalparameters. The frequencies of the Trp64Trp and Trp64Arggenotypes of ADRB3 gene were 82% and 12%, respectively, the frequencies of mutant allele was 6%. Trp64Arg genotypes of ADRB3 compared to Trp64Trp genotypes had significantly higher body fat percentage (respectively 48,6 +/- 0,96% and 43,8 +/- 1,72%, p&<,05), serum glucose (6,51 +/- 0,18 mmol/l and 5,67 +/- 0,09 mmol/l, p&<,01) and uric acid concentrations (0,46 +/- 0,02 mmol/l and 0,38 +/- 0,01 mmol/l, p&<,05). The test of the ADRB3 gene polymorphisms can be used for the personalization of diet in persons with obesity.
