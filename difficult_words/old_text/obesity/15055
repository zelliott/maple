This study tested the hypothesis that 12 weeks of air board exercise would enhance cardiorespiratory fitness and vascular compliance and reduce % body fat in obese Korean boys.

Twenty-two obese boys &>30% body fat) were studied. They were divided into 2 groups- an aerobic exercise group (N.=12), which trained 3 days/week, 50 min/day for 12 weeks, and a control group (N.=10). Control subjects only performed activities involved in their physical education classes. Body composition, cardiovascular fitness (20 m multistage endurance test performance) and vascular compliance were assessed before and after the completion of exercise training.

The % changes in body fat (-4.6±0.9 vs. -1.5±1.0%), fat mass (-5.4±1.5 vs. -0.1±1.6%) and performance on the cardiovascular fitness test (14.3±2.5 vs. 3.7±1.6%) were greater in the exercise group than in the controls Compared to controls, % increases in vascular compliance were greater in the arms and legs of the exercise group (left arm: 2.8±0.5 vs. 2.0±2.9%; left leg: 2.6±1.2 vs. -0.5±2.0%; right arm: 2.9±0.9 vs. 0.3±2.9%; right leg: 4.8±1.8 vs. 1.5±2.0%).

Results suggest that exercise training can reduce % body fat and enhance vascular compliance in obese male adolescents; changes that may reduce the risk for later development of cardiovascular disease.
