The present study evaluated the efficacy of olfactory aversion conditioning in the management of overeating problems. 42 overweight female subjects were assigned to one of three treatment conditions: olfactory aversion therapy, attention placebo control, and no-contact control. One experimenter administered the 8-wk. treatment phase. The aversion therapy procedure entailed the pairing of selected target foods (CSs) with noxious odors (UCSs). There were 25 pairings of the CS and UCSs during each weekly session. Four noxious odors were employed, one each week, to prevent habituation to the UCS. The attention-placebo control procedure was identical except that "air" was substituted for the putative UCS of the aversion therapy condition. At the end of the treatment period the aversion therapy group had lost 4.7 lb.; the attention placebo controls had lost 3.6 lb. and the no-contact controls 0.5 lb. The difference between the aversion therapy group and the no-contact controls was significant and that between the attention placebo group and the no-contact controls approached significance. At a follow-up 8 wk. after the end of the treatment period the weights of all groups had risen to pretreatment levels and there were no differences between them. These results indicate that olfactory aversion therapy is not an efficient technique in promoting weight-loss.
