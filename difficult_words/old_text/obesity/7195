High-viscosity hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HV-HPMC) is a modified cellulose fiber that produces a viscous gel in the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical trials demonstrate that consumption of HV-HPMC significantly lowers cholesterol, but limited information has been available on the influence of HV-HPMC on postprandial insulin and glucose responses. The objective of this investigation was to assess the influence of HV-HPMC on postprandial glucose and insulin responses in overweight and obese men and women.

Participants were 31 overweight or obese men and women without diabetes who underwent three breakfast meal tests in random order, separated by&> or = 72 h. Test meals containing 75 g carbohydrate plus 4 or 8 g HV-HPMC or control meals containing 8 g cellulose were delivered in a double-blind fashion.

Peak glucose was significantly lower (P &<0.001) after both HV-HPMC-containing meals (7.4 mmol/l [4 g] and 7.4 mmol/l [8 g]) compared with the control meal (8.6 mmol/l). Peak insulin concentrations and the incremental areas for glucose and insulin from 0 to 120 min were also significantly reduced after both HV-HPMC doses versus control (all P &<0.01).

These findings indicate that HV-HPMC consumption reduces postprandial glucose and insulin excursions, which may favorably alter risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
