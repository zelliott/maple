To identify risk factors that may contribute to the development and/or maintenance of overweight and obesity in American Indian children.

The sample consisted of 291 tribally enrolled American Indian children. Body mass index (BMI) was measured by a tribal program and children completed self-report measures during health class. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted for 232 children and included three blocks of predictor variables (diet and physical activity, weight-related attitudes, and psychosocial variables).

Thirty-three percent of children were obese and 20% were overweight. Diet and physical activity (7.6%) and weight-related attitudes (31.9%) made significant contributions, explaining 39.5% of the variance in BMI.

Greater BMI scores were related to healthier food choice intentions, more hours of television viewing, greater body dissatisfaction, higher negative attitudes toward body size, and more weight loss attempts.
