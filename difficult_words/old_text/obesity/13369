301 women, 261 of them obese, were the subject of an anthropometric study of brachial and femoral adipomuscular ratio, adipocytometry in the deltoid and retro-trochanteric areas and oral glucose tolerance. Deltoid adipocyte volume was highly correlated (p less than 0,001) with total fat deposition in this area, while no such relationship was found in the retrotrochanteric area. In obese women with chemical or overt diabetes, deltoid adipose cells were significantly larger than those of non-diabetic obese women. This, however, was not the case for retro-trochanteric adipose cells.
