The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between metabolic risk factors and oxidative stress using urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a recently utilized biological marker, in asymptomatic subjects.

Ninety subjects (males/females = 30/60; mean age = 52 years), who were nonsmoking, nondiabetic and not on any medicine, were enrolled in the study. The body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and glucose as well as urinary 8-OHdG and creatinine were measured.

The median level of 8-OHdG was 9.3 ng/mg creatinine (interquartile range: 5.8-23.2). TG (Pearson's correlation: r = 0.262, p = 0.013) and HDL-C (r = -0.259, p = 0.014) showed a significant correlation with 8-OHdG. A multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for all the variables revealed that only TG had an independently significant and positive correlation with 8-OHdG (Î² = 0.231, p = 0.046).

The data in this population suggest that, among metabolic risk factors, hypertriglyceridemia may be weakly but significantly associated with hyperoxidative stress as assessed by 8-OHdG.
