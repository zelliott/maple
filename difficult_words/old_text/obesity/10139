The purpose of this study was to determine if increased body mass index (BMI) is associated with an increased risk for dental caries.

Caries severity averages were calculated for a convenience sample of 178 children, ages 8 to 11 years, who participated in the University of Louisville Dental School-based dental treatment program "Smile Kentucky." Caries severity averages were then analyzed against the children's BMI, with gender and age used as covariates.

The mean caries average for permanent molars significantly increased with increased BMI, even after adjusting for age and gender. The mean overall caries average did not vary significantly with patient age, BMI, or gender and may be due to confounding mixed dentition events such as eruption, extraction, variable teeth exfoliation, etc.

Elevated body mass index is associated with an increased incidence of permanent molar interproximal caries.
