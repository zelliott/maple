The prevalence of obesity, one risk factor for developing the metabolic syndrome (MS), has increased during the last decades. It has therefore been assumed that the prevalence of MS would also increase.

The aim was to analyse the prevalence of MS and its risk factors in a middle-aged Swedish population.

Data were obtained between 2003 and 2004 from a random population based sample of 502 men and 505 women, 45-69 years old. Measures of plasma glucose, serum lipids, blood pressure, weight, height, waist circumference and self-reported data concerning presence of disease, medication and lifestyle were obtained.

The prevalence of MS was 14.8% among men and 15.3% among women, with an increase by age among women only, 10% to 25% (p=0.029). Among individuals with MS the most frequent risk factor was large waist circumference, present in 85% of men and 99% of women, followed by high blood pressure, high triglycerides, high glucose and HDL cholesterol (38% and 47% respectively).

The prevalence of MS was 15%, increasing with age only among women. Overweight was a dominant characteristic, and only half of the individuals with MS had glucose/HDL cholesterol levels beyond defined cut points of the syndrome.
