Adrenergic modulation of lipolysis was determined in obese and lean women. Epinephrine was infused alone, or in combination with propranolol, or with phentolamine. In both obese and lean subjects slight alpha- and prevalent beta-adrenergic lipolytic responsiveness was observed. alpha-adrenergic blockade by yohimbine potentiated lipolysis and exercise energy expenditure. Yohimbine application during the slimming treatment increased weight loss without side effects.
