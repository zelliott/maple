Weight gain prevention (WGP) among adults who are overweight is an important target in the prevention of obesity. However, little is known about the process from WGP as a goal to successful weight-management. The present study aimed to: (i) gain more insight into this process; (ii) identify cognitive predictors of intention for WGP; and (iii) examine WGP as a potential predictor for the intention to change weight-related behaviours [dietary intake (DI) and physical activity (PA)] and specific action planning.

In this cross-sectional study, overweight adults [n = 510; body mass index 25-30 kg m(-2); mean (SD) age 48 (9.5) years; 30.8% male] completed an online questionnaire, assessing goal intention for WGP, behavioural intention for DI and PA, planning for change in DI and PA and socio-cognitive correlates. Ordinal regression analyses were used to analyse the data.

In 89% of the sample, (parts of) the proposed sequence from goal intention (for WGP), behavioural intention (for DI/PA) and planning (for DI/PA) was observed. Attitude, social norm and perceived control towards WGP, and perceived weight status and risk perception, were associated with intention for WGP. Behaviour-specific perceived control and preferences were more strongly associated with intention to change DI or PA and planning for change than intention for WGP was.

Intention for WGP is important in the process toward weight-management because, for most people, intention for WGP precedes behavioural intention, which precedes planning. Intention for WGP is associated with behavioural intention but behaviour-specific factors are the strongest correlates of behavioural intention and planning.
