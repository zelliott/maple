Calorie intake and the main nutrient contents were assessed in a population of 152 obese (OB) children (86 M; 66 F; age 7-11) and 153 normal weight (NW) peers (87 M; 66 F). The following method was used: a) an interview using a food dictionary to assess food intake during the 2 days prior to the study and on one holiday: and b) a weekly questionnaire. The mean food intake of OB did not exceed that of NW, but on the contrary was lower (OB: 1812.9 +/- 39.6 kcal/die; NW: 1928.5 +/- 39.4 kcal/die; p less than 0.05). The population studied consumed approximately 50% of calories as carbohydrates (CHO), 35% as fats (F) and 15% as protein (P), and no difference was noted between OB and NW. The percentage of CHO was lower than that recommended by LARN, whereas the percentages of F and P were higher. A significant increase with age was noted in F and P intake as was a significant reduction of CO. 70% of OB and 80% of NW matched or exceeded the calorie intake recommended by LARN. 30% of OB and 24% of NW consumed 30% less than the daily calorie intake recommended by LARN.
