An interactive workshop was held to discuss the risk of diabetes in patients with schizophrenia, to evaluate the available data concerning how such patients should be managed in terms of minimising the risk of diabetes and of optimising their care where diabetes to develop. The subjects discussed covered monitoring of risk factors, education about lifestyle and the risk of diabetes, patient care and treatment options, and interfaces between psychiatry and diabetology. The workshop noted that all patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia had an elevated risk of developing diabetes and that this needed to be reflected in the follow-up of the patients in order to reduce the chances of the emergence of disease. The risk of diabetes is complicated by the presence of other risk factors and the intensity of the diabetes prevention programme needs to reflect adequately the overall risk. The most important prevention methods relate to lifestyle changes that patients with schizophrenia may be spontaneously unlikely to adopt and therefore necessitate the implementation of specific education measures aimed at patients and their families. The workshop proposed follow-up intensities, monitoring procedures and prevention programmes stratified according to the risk of developing diabetes. It was not considered that there was sufficient data available to orientate treatment choices between individual antipsychotic drugs according to the potential risk of developing diabetes.
