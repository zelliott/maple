To assess whether liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has cardioprotective properties in addition to its glycemic effects.

We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records of 110 obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with liraglutide for at least 6 months between March 2010 and April 2011 at our tertiary care referral center. The variables analyzed were body mass index, hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C), systolic blood pressure (SBP), plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, and serum lipids.

In our overall study cohort, we noted a reduction in mean weight from 120 ± 5 kg to 115 ± 3 kg and a decrease in mean A1C from 7.8% ± 0.6% to 7.2% ± 0.2%. The mean triglyceride concentration decreased from 173 ± 19 mg/dL to 151 ± 15 mg/dL, the mean SBP was reduced from 132 ± 6 mm Hg to 125 ± 4 mm Hg, and the mean CRP concentration declined from 4.7 ± 0.8 mg/L to 3.2 ± 0.4 mg/L after treatment with liraglutide for a minimal duration of 6 months and a mean duration of 7.5 months (for all the foregoing changes, P&<05). These variables decreased whether these patients were previously treated with orally administered hypoglycemic agents alone or in combination with insulin or exenatide.

Our findings in a clinical practice show that liraglutide is a potent antidiabetes drug, whether given in combination with orally administered agents or insulin or as a substitution for exenatide. It lowers body weight, A1C levels, SBP, and CRP and triglyceride concentrations.
