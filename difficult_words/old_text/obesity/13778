The changes in body composition and in serum levels of total cholesterol (T-chol), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), very low plus low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL + LDL-C), the ratio T-chol/HDL-C and non esterified fatty acid (NEFA) were studied in nineteen obese male adolescents after 28 days of slimming treatment which consisted in hypoenergetic diet and exercise. Relative fat body weight (%BF) was calculated by Parizkov√° and Roth's regression equations for five fatfolds and lean body weight was obtained as the difference between body weight and fat body weight. Significant reductions in %BF, T-chol and T-chol/HDL-C ratio were found. The decrease in TG was not significant but had a better correlation with the reduction of adiposity (delta %BF) than the previously mentioned two variables. The increase of lipolysis during the four weeks of study is expressed in the significant rise of NEFA and its correlation (r = -0.714) with delta %BF. A tendency to increase in HDL-C could be observed, and a significant inverse correlation (r = -.804) with delta %BF was found. The results obtained showed that the combination of diet and exercise for treating obesity in adolescents influences favourably the risk factors of ischaemic heart disease related to serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles and does not significantly affect lean body mass, at least up to four weeks.
