The aim of the work was to analyse the basic parameters of perinatal care of diabetic pregnant women, hospitalized in the Clinical Hospital in Bytom in years 1992-2001. The retrospective analysis of 405 diabetic pregnant patients who delivered their babies there was carried out. Diabetes types were following: GDM--44.9%, DM without vascular lesion--43%, DM with vascular lesion--12.1%. Mean age of pregnant women was 28.8 +/- 16 years. 42% patients were primipara, 58% patients were secundipara and multipara. The most often complications during pregnancy were following: threatening premature labour (36.5%), PIH (11.7%), urinary tract infection (9.65%) obesity (8.27%). Mean time of pregnancy was 38 +/- 2 Hbd. Prematurity was 25.9%. 199 patients had caesarean section (49.1%). 24 unsuccessful cases included fetal congenital defects, abortions, missed labour, perinatal fetal death. The authors suggest that such complications in diabetic pregnant patients can be prevented by early diabetes detection, intensive biophysical and biochemical control over fetus, achievement of normoglycaemic condition and a proper choice of delivery time. During last 10 years in our clinical hospital there was observed a decrease in infantile and perinatal mortality, better condition of infants and decrease in number of complications.
