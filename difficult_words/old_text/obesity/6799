The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair under spinal anesthesia in obese patients (BMI&> 30 kg/m(2)).

From January 2007 to February 2010, 23 obese patients had their elective laparoscopic ventral hernia repair under spinal anesthesia. We looked primarily for intra-operative incidences as well as immediate postoperative complications. Long term results and especially recurrences were also to be evaluated.

Median operative time was 55 min (range 20-100). Intraoperatively, six patients (26%) complained of shoulder pain, three patients (13%) developed bradycardia and two (8.7%) hypotension. Postoperatively, nausea and/or vomiting were recorded in four patients (17.4%), four patients (17.4%) experienced urinary retention and one patient developed wound infection. Median pain score at 4th, 8th and 24th postoperative hour was 0.5 (0-5), 1.5 (0-6), and 1.5 (0-5) respectively. The median length of hospital stay was one day (1-2). At a median follow up of 39 months, one patient was diagnosed with a recurrence.

Spinal anesthesia for LVHR in obese patients (BMI&> 30 kg/m(2)) proved an efficient and safe alternative to general anesthesia in the given patient sample.
