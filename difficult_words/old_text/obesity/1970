To examine the relationship between leptin levels and visceral obesity or plasma insulin levels, we studied serum leptin levels, fat distribution assessed by CT scan, and plasma insulin levels during 75 g oral glucose load in 100 Japanese men. Regression analysis adjusted by age and body mass index (BMI) showed leptin levels to be associated with visceral fat area(V)(p = 0.003), subcutaneous fat area(S)(p &<0.0001), and V + S(p &<0.0001), but not with V/S ratio(p = 0.897). By regression analysis adjusted by age, BMI, and V + S, serum leptin levels were still highly and positively correlated with plasma insulin levels during 75 g oral glucose load (p &<0.001), insulin resistance index(p &<0.001), and beta cell function index(p = 0.009) in homeostasis model assessment. These data suggest that hyperinsulinemia, but not visceral obesity, may be regulators of serum leptin levels independent of BMI.
