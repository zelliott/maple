The renal resistive index (RRI) reflects intrarenal vascular resistance and stiffness, which are associated with chronic kidney disease. The links connecting renal function, intrarenal arterial resistance, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) with hypertension and metabolic factors remain elusive. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible relationship of RRI with glomerular filtration rate, PTH, hypertension, obesity (body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio), bioelectrical impedance analysis in body composition assessment, serum lipids, and insulin resistance assessed by homoeostasis model insulin resistance index.

This study was carried out on 387 (246 women, 141 men) nondiabetic patients, between&>25 and &<5 years, referred to an Internal Medicine Clinic and Day Hospital for essential hypertension, overweightness-obesity, and/or dyslipidemia. Lower salt/lower calorie Mediterranean diet, physical activity increase, smoking withdrawal, and lifestyle counseling, provided by a health psychologist support, were prescribed.

Higher hypertension risk, present in 42.5% of the overall group of eligible patients (164/387), is associated with high PTH and high RRI, along with greater renal insufficiency, insulin resistance, and obesity. There is a straight linear relationship of RRI to PTH (0.202; p=0.009) in arterial hypertension, which is not observed in normal blood pressure patients. By gender-adjusted multiple linear regression analysis, it was found that fat mass, waist-to-hip ratio, and PTH account significantly for 62.3% of the variance to RRI in hypertensive patients.

Increased arterial stiffness and intrarenal arterial resistance are associated with higher PTH in arterial hypertension; obesity (defined by greater fat mass and waist-to-hip ratio) and PTH are the independent conditions that account significantly for higher RRI.
