The neurovegetative state was studied by a questionnaire in 70 obese patients. In 61 of them frontal and distal thermometry with liquid crystal cholesterol thermoindicators was performed and the polarization currents of the hands were recorded. In 21.3% of the obese patients deviations in the thermoregulatory state were found. A tendency toward hypothermia of about 2 degrees C, localized predominantly in the medial frontal zone, was registered. Disturbances in the sudomotorics--hypo or hyperhydrosis--were found. The results show mixed and/or parasympathicotonic dystonia in the patients studied. Thermodiagnostics with liquid crystals and registration of the polarization currents are recommended as noninvasive methods for determination of neurovegetative disorders in obesity.
