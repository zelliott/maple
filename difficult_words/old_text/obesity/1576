It has been suggested that obesity increases fall risk, based on diminished static balance and increased fall-related injury risk. However, these findings only indirectly relate obesity and falls. The purpose of this study was to use existing data to directly explore the relationship between obesity and falls by community-dwelling women aged 55 years and older. Eighty-six subjects (42 obese) reported falls occurring during the previous year (retrospective falls), and over the following year responded to biweekly communications inquiring whether they fell or stumbled (prospective falls/stumbles). Because trips represent the largest fall cause by community-dwelling adults, we also analyzed outcomes and recovery strategies of 25 women (13 obese) after laboratory-induced trips. Obese and healthy weight women retrospectively reported similar fall rates (40.9% vs 40.5%; P=.97). Similar percentages of healthy weight and obese women prospectively fell (64.7% vs 64.3%; P=.98) and stumbled (38.9% vs 14.3%; P=.24). After laboratory-induced trips, 46.2% of obese verse 25.0% of healthy weight women fell (P=.44). Unlike healthy weight fallers, most obese fallers failed to initiate or complete the recovery step before full-body harness support. Obesity does not appear to increase overall fall risk; although, fall rates after laboratory-induced trips were notably higher, potentially due to altered recovery responses. An incomplete recovery step could increase impact force with the ground, predisposing obese individuals to injury. The fact that there is concurrence between 4 independent outcomes strengthens the findings, suggesting that further, large-scale studies are warranted to inform future clinical practice regarding fall-risk assessment for obese older adults.
