Insulin biosynthesis, content, and secretion were investigated in islets derived from pancreas specimens of normal weight (100.4 +/- 1.1% of ideal body weight) and obese (137.2 +/- 5.9% of ideal weight) patients. The pancreatic islets from the obese subjects were characterized by a significantly enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion and biosynthesis and by an insulin content that was nearly double when compared with islets from the nonobese subjects. The results support the hypothesis that an enhanced beta-cell reactivity significantly contributes to the insulin hyperresponse observed in the obese state.
