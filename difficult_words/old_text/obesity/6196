To objectively assess physical activity (PA) and body size in 6-year-old children and their mothers participating in the Pacific Islands Families (PIF) cohort study, and to identify factors potentially related to PA and body size in Pacific children.

The PIF cohort was drawn from live births at Middlemore Hospital (South Auckland, New Zealand) in 2000. Information has been collected at birth, 6 weeks, 12 and 24 months, and 4 and 6 years postpartum. At 6 years, the Child and Parental Physical Activity and Body Size (PIF:PAC) study was simultaneously conducted and measures of child and mother PA (8-day accelerometry), body size (waist circumference, body mass index), and PA supports and barriers (questionnaire) taken.

254 mothers and their children took part in the PIF:PAC study. Usable accelerometer data were gathered for 173 mothers and 199 children over an average of 3-4 days. High levels of overweight and obesity were found in boys, girls, and mothers (62%, 58%, and 97% overweight or obese, respectively).

Strategies for obesity reduction in Pacific populations are urgently required. Combined, the PIF and PIF:PAC studies will provide vital information for understanding and targeting the obesity epidemic in Pacific children.
