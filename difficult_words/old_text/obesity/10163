Obesity is a characteristic feature of patients with sleep apnea syndrome (SAS). The aim of the study was to show how obesity exerts an influence on the polisomnography results and other clinical feature in untreated SAS patients.

On the basis of SAS questionnaire SAS was suspected in 770 patients. The preliminary investigation was MESAM 4, and revealed 110 patients with desaturation during sleep. In all of them polisomnografic examination confirmed diagnosis. The other performed investigations: spirometry and blood pressure during the day and polisomnografic examination.

the analysis of the obtained results show the dependence of BMI on the polysomnographic study results, spirometry and blood pressure value.

We observed that obesity is favorable to the development of: obstructive SAS, hypoventilation and desaturation during sleep, hypertension by SAS patients, SAS provoked disorders of sleep structure by all of the SAS patients.
