A program of automated calculation of an individual diet for patients with diabetes mellitus and obesity has been worked out for the Elektronika HMC-80 PC. During a 15-20 min. interactive dialogue with the PC the caloric value and balance of a diet of 160 food items are assessed. Indices like sex, age, height, body mass, physical activity and diet are taken into account in dietary calculation. The testing of the program under clinical conditions has shown its multifunctional nature: it permits the detection of disturbed quantitative (caloric value) and qualitative (the ratio of proteins, fats and carbohydrates) indices of a diet, errors of an inpatient dietetic service and helps to form habits of nutritional culture in patients and medical staff.
