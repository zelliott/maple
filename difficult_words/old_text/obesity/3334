Among the numerous techniques used to measure body composition, this study utilised anthropometric methods (weight, height, circumference and skin folds) and impedance measurement (measurement of bioelectric impedance). Results from the two methods were compared in order to assess whether BMI parameters and the waist/hips ratio (WHR) influenced this correlation. One hundred and eighty patients (133 F, 47 M) were included in the study. Patients were divided into groups according to the degree of obesity expressed as BMI and WHR. Body composition was evaluated using anthropometric methods (according to Garrow Webster, Durnin-Womersley, modified Durnin-Womersley and Jackson-Pollock) and impedance measurement in which resistive bioelectric impedance is measured using a tetrapolar technique. A good correlation was generally observed in the female population between impedance assessment and anthropometric methods, and this correlation was not influenced by either BMI or WHR. In the male group, on the other hand, the correlation between the two methods was limited by BMI greater than 30 and WHR greater than 1. In conclusion, impedance measurement and plicometric methods are generally compatible, but areas of uncertainty arise in the male population with BMI greater than 30 and WHR greater than 1.
