Variations in body weight, behaviour of lipidaemic fractions proteinaemia, uricaemia and uricuria, and lipid and protein absorption were studied preoperatively and at varying times following operation in five subjects who had undergone jejuno-ileal bypass for obesity. The results showed high serous NEFA and a definite, early and persistent reduction in all lipidaemic fractions after operation. The post-operative levels of serous proteins, particularly albumin, which were reduced in all subjects, reached pathological levels in two patients where proteic malnutrition following on the operation was associated with serious liver disease. The results agree with reported data. The variations in lipidic and proteic malabsorption proved to be in agreement with weight drop and the serous parameters considered. The reduction in uricaemia encountered in the five patients studied failed to agree with data reported in the Anglo-Saxon literature. This may be explained by alimentary and racial differences between the two populations of patients.
