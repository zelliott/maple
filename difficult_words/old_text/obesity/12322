The aim of this study is to determine the serum levels of visfatin in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to understand its correlations with other metabolic and hormonal parameters. Thirty-seven patients with PCOS and 30 women without concomitant disease were included in this study. Serum visfatin levels were similar in patients with PCOS and control group. Visfatin levels were higher in normal weight PCOS when compared with obese PCOS, but it did not reach statistical significance. Visfatin levels correlated negatively with fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and lipoprotein-a levels in PCOS patients. CRP levels increased both in obese PCOS and in obese controls. Plasma visfatin levels had no correlation with homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance and fasting insulin levels, but the negative correlation between plasma visfatin levels and lipoprotein-a, fasting plasma glucose, TC and LDL levels may indicate a role for visfatin in cardiovascular disease independent of insulin resistance.
