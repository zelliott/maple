To analyse the evolution over the last six years of the nutritional state of the current adolescent population (10-14 years old) of our health area in order to identify risk groups and to draw up specific therapeutic strategies.

Observational, retrospective and longitudinal study. Systematic and stratified sampling.

Rural primary care.

Sample of 360 healthy adolescents, aged between 10 and 14 (176 boys and 184 girls) out of a sample frame of 811. Interventions. During the 1999-2000 school year (year 2000), weight, height, Quetelet index (QI) and Body Mass Index (BMI) of one in every three young people at their routine health check-up were recorded. Those with acute and/or chronic pathology that might affect their nutritional state or with dietary restrictions of any sort were excluded. The weight, height, QI and BMI of the check-ups 2, 4 and 6 years previously (1998, 1996 and 1994) were also recorded.

In the year 2000, 17.5% and 16.4% of the young people evaluated had excess weight and obesity, respectively. Between 1994 and 2000 there was an increase (p &<0.05) in obesity (5.9% against 16.4%). 31.8% of the obese young people in the year 2000 were already obese 6 years previously, 18.2% were normal then, but 50% of them were already overweight in 1994. There were no significant differences between sexes.

In the year 2000, 33% of adolescents between 10 and 14 in our health area had a BMI that suggested excess body fat. As excess weight in school students supposes a situation of risk of obesity in adolescence, this demands follow-up and preventive activity.
