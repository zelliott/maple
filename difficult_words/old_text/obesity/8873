Alanine-for-threonine substitution at codon 54 (A54T polymorphism) in the fatty acid-binding protein 2 gene (FABP2) has been associated with hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance. Impairment in the activity of delta 6 and 5 desaturases is also supposed to be a factor predisposing the development of insulin resistance syndrome.

We investigated the relationship between A54T polymorphism in FABP2 and the impairment of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism in obese children.

Thirty-two obese children participated. During the study, the children continued their habitual diet, which was documented in a 3-day food record using household measures. Anthropometry was performed, and serum lipid and fatty acid composition in plasma were analyzed. The polymorphism of codon 54 in the FABP 2 gene was analyzed.

The allele frequency was 0.66 and 0.34 for Ala54 and Thr54, respectively. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, fasting serum glucose, insulin or serum lipoproteins among the three polymorphism groups. These were also no significant differences in the intake of energy, the percentage of energy nutrients or in the dietary lipid composition. The content of arachidonic acid (AA) in plasma was lowest in Thr/Thr54 (p &<0.05). The indices of delta-6 desaturase (D6D) activity in Thr/Thr54 were significantly lower than in Thr/Ala54 or Ala/Ala54 (p &<0.05, p &<0.01, respectively).

In obese children, Thr/Thr54 of the FABP 2 gene is associated with impaired activation of D6D and reduced AA content. The results in the LCPUFA profile suggest that Thr/Thr54 may predispose the to development of insulin resistance.
