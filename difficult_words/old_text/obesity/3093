Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis was assessed by measuring mitochondrial guanosine diphosphate (GDP) binding, cytochrome oxidase activity and oxygen consumption in ovariectomized (OVX) and sham-operated rats. The food intake and body weight of OVX rats increased more than those of controls and OVX rats became obese. Mitochondrial GDP binding, as an indicator of thermogenic activity, cytochrome oxidase activity, as a marker of mitochondrial abundance, and mitochondrial respiration of BAT in OVX rats were significantly reduced compared with those in controls. And, also, even when OVX rats were restricted in food intake (pair-gained) to produce comparable changes in body weight with sham-controls, or matched in food intake (pair-fed) with sham-controls, these parameters in both pair-gained and pair-fed OVX groups were decreased markedly compared to those in sham-controls. As expected, body weight in pair-fed OVX rats increased significantly more than that in sham-controls. In response to cold exposure, these parameters of OVX rats increased as much as those of controls did. These results suggest that reduced brown adipose tissue thermogenesis might be one of the important factors that are responsible for the development of obesity after OVX.
