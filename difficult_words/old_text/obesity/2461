A pasta containing 10% guar-flour was successfully prepared and administered to ten obese women in a seven-day experimental design which included: a control meal (day 1) containing alimentary wheat-pasta, a first guar-pasta meal (day 2), to assess the acute effects of guar-pasta, a second guar-pasta meal (day 7), performed after four days of a weight-maintenance diet containing one guar-pasta meal per day. Compared to wheat-pasta, guar-pasta significantly lowered glucose and insulin response, as well as fasting total cholesterol. Moreover, it had excellent palatability and no gastrointestinal side-effects.
