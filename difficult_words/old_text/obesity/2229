There is little information regarding the obesity epidemical situation and risk factors of childhood hypertension (HTN) in China. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of HTN/prehypertension (PHTN), as well as the associated risk factors, among adolescents in Changsha city, China.

A total of 88,974 adolescents from 49 middle schools in Changsha city between 12 and 17 years of age were examined during 2009. Body weight, height, and blood pressure (BP) were measured in all adolescents. HTN and PHTN were defined according to sex- and age-specific Chinese reference data. Overweight and obesity were also defined according to sex- and age-specific Chinese reference data.

It was determined that the prevalence of PHTN and HTN were 7.2 and 3.1%, respectively. Furthermore, 14.6% of male adolescents were overweight and 7.0% were obese, whereas 8.6% of female adolescents were overweight and 2.9% were obese. The risk ratio (RR) of HTN were significantly higher in overweight (RR: 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6-3.2) and obese (RR: 8.7, 95% CI: 8.1-9.5) adolescents adjusted for age, sex, and height.

Chinese reference data were used to evaluate BP and body mass index (BMI) of children and adolescents. Higher prevalence of HTN was associated with higher BMI percentiles. Being overweight or obese markedly increased the risk of both HTN and PHTN among adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age in Changsha city, China.
