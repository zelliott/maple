To elucidate if there are alterations in insulin metabolic clearance in obesity under basal conditions, plasma insulin and C-peptide were measured in 22 obese patients and 8 normal subjects, and the plasma C-peptide to insulin molar ratio was used as an index of hepatic insulin extraction. In obese patients, the C-peptide to insulin molar ratio correlated indirectly with basal plasma insulin levels (r = 0.71; P less than 0.001), being low in the obese patients with higher insulin levels and within the normal range in obese patients in which insulin levels were similar to those of control subjects. It is suggested that hepatic insulin extraction is decreased in obesity, even under basal conditions, but this alteration is only manifested when plasma insulin levels are high.
