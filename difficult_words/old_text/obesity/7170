This study investigated the temperature changes at acupuncture points resulting from a weight reduction program. A standard method using a digital infrared thermographic imaging device was employed to monitor the temperature at 20 acupuncture points in 32 participants treated for obesity at an Oriental obesity clinic. There were significant temperature increases at all of the acupuncture points except for LI4 (Hegu) and TE5 (Waiguan). The mean total temperature change at the acupuncture points was significantly correlated with the BMI change (r = .588, p &<.001). The weight-reduction-induced increase in temperature at acupuncture points may reflect improvements in the circulation of energy flows. However, further study is necessary to understand fully the relationship between the temperature at acupuncture points and weight reduction, including the use of appropriate controls.
