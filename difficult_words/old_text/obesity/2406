Motor activity was approximately 60% lower in genetically obese than in lean mice, during three consecutive hours at thermal neutrality. It is suggested that this must have contributed to the lower heat production measured in the obese mice and that activity-induced thermogenesis contributes significantly to differences in energy expenditure between the genotypes, at least in the short-term.
