The efficacy of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) to control type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been demonstrated in morbidly obese patients. Surgical procedures primarily focused on T2DM control in patients with body mass index (BMI) &<35 kg/m(2) have shown to effectively induce remission of T2DM. However, only few reports have evaluated the safety and efficacy of RYGB in this group of patients. The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of RYGB in TD2M patients with BMI &<35 kg/m(2). All T2DM patients with BMI &<35 kg/m(2) and at least 12 months of follow-up who underwent laparoscopic RYGB were included. Safety of the procedure was evaluated according to mortality, need of reoperation/conversion, and complication rates. Metabolic parameters were evaluated at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Thirty patients were included. Seventeen (56.6%) were women. Age, BMI, and duration of diabetes were 48 ± 9 years, 33.7 ± 1.2 kg/m(2), 4 ± 2.9 years, respectively. No mortality was observed. No conversion/reoperation was needed. Average length of stay was 3.2 ± 0.9 days. Early and late postoperative complications were observed in five (16.6%) and five (16.6%) patients, respectively. Twelve months after surgery, remission was observed in 25 of 30 patients (83.3%). After 2 years, remission was achieved in 13 of 20 patients (65%), and hemoglobin A1c decreased from 8.1 ± 1.8% to 5.9 ± 1.1% and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance from 5.7 ± 3.2 to 1.9 ± 0.8 after 12 months. RYGB is a safe and effective procedure to induce T2DM remission in otherwise not eligible patients for bariatric surgery. Evidence from prospective studies is needed to validate this approach.
