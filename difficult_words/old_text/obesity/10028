In patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the vagal stimulation caused by inspiration against the upper airway obstruction results in sinus bradycardia during the apnea followed by a reflex tachycardia at apnea termination. We report on five heart transplant recipients with obstructive sleep apnea who demonstrated no change in baseline heart rate in spite of marked hemoglobin oxygen desaturation, presumably on account of parasympathetic denervation of the allograft. Heart transplant recipients with obstructive sleep apnea may be at an increased risk of development of potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias if the allograft is unable to respond appropriately to hypoxia. Should cardiac parasympathetic reinnervation occur, prospective polysomnography may be a marker for this process in these patients.
