Recently, the obese Zucker rat (OZR), an animal model of non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes, was shown to respond to converting enzyme inhibition with decreased albuminuria and a marked attenuation of glomerular injury. It was hypothesized that the OZR would possess low plasma renin values and an increased vascular responsiveness to angiotensin II, and therefore, the renin-angiotensin system (PRA, active renin, inactive renin, renal renin content, and plasma angiotensinogen) and vascular reactivity in OZR at 10 and 24 wk of age were investigated. PRA and renin concentration, inactive plasma renin, and renal renin content were all significantly (P &<0.05) reduced in OZR when compared with age-matched lean controls. The ratio of inactive to total renin was significantly increased in the OZR. OZR aortic ring vascular reactivity to KCl, norepinephrine, and angiotensin II was assessed. Despite essentially equal or increased contractile responses to KCl and norepinephrine at both 10 and 24 wk of age, the OZR was not more sensitive to angiotensin II and displayed a significantly reduced contractile response to angiotensin II at 24 wk of age, when compared with lean age-matched controls. It was concluded that the renal protective effect of converting enzyme inhibition in OZR, despite significantly reduced PRA and concentration, inactive plasma renin, and renal renin content, may not be due to a diabetes-induced increased vascular reactivity to angiotensin II.
