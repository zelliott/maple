To measure left atrial (LA) diameter in normotensive, overweight children and to determine the variables that independently influence LA diameters.

A cross-sectional study on 22 overweight children (age, 13.40 +/- 1.22 years) and 18 control children (age, 13.40 +/- 2.19 years) was performed. LA diameter, left ventricular (LV) geometry, and LV systolic/diastolic function were measured through echocardiography. Data were compared between the two groups. Multiple regression analysis, with LA diameter as dependent variable, was conducted.

In the overweight group, LV diastolic dimension, LV mass index, peak S, S/D ratio, Am, maximal LA diameter (34.1 mm vs 25.4 mm), middle LA diameter (26.9 mm vs 18.1 mm), and minimal LA diameter (22.5 mm vs 16.1 mm) were increased and Em/Am ratio was decreased. In multiple regression analysis, body mass index (R(2) = 0.7040, 0.7085, 0.7406 in respective maximal, middle, and minimal LA diameter) and systolic blood pressure (R(2) = 0.0540, 0.0477, 0.030 in respective maximal, middle, and minimal LA diameter) were significant independent correlates of all three measures of LA diameter.

LA diameter in normotensive overweight children is increased. Body mass index and systolic blood pressure were significant correlates of LA diameter.
