Higher screen-viewing levels increase the risk of obesity. Understanding the correlates of screen viewing is an important first step in designing interventions but there is lack of information on the correlates among Spanish children. This study examined associations among environmental, sociocultural, age variables and screen viewing among Spanish children.

Children completed a questionnaire about time spent in screen viewing. BMI was assessed and children were classified into obesity groups using International Obesity Task Force cut-off points. Parents completed a questionnaire about sociodemographic, environmental and sociocultural variables.

Participants were 247 primary and 256 secondary school-aged children and their parents. Time spent in screen viewing increased with age. Males spent more time than females in screen viewing. Greater access to bedroom media sources was associated with higher screen viewing. Younger children from single-parent households and older children having a younger parent, siblings and a father who was not working were higher screen-viewers on weekends and weekdays, respectively. For older children parental TV viewing time appeared to be a significant correlate, while parental rules was a determinant predictor for younger children on weekdays.

Environmental and sociocultural factors influence the time children spend in screen viewing. Parents play a central role in child's screen viewing; therefore, interventions that target environmental and family TV viewing practices are likely to be effective.
