To investigate associations between maternal diabetes and blood pressure (BP), obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and serum lipids in offspring and whether these parameters correlate with metabolism during pregnancy.

Body mass index, BP, serum glucose, and insulin during an oral glucose tolerance test, and lipid concentrations were measured in 99 offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM) and 80 members of a control group.

ODM were more obese (body mass index 22.5 +/- 5.6 vs 20.3 +/- 4.0 kg/m(2)) and had higher systolic (8 mm Hg) and mean arterial BP (4 mm Hg) but similar diastolic BP compared with the control group. ODM had higher 2-hour glucose (6.6 +/- 1.3 vs 5.7 +/- 0.9 mmol/L) and insulin (580 +/- 544 vs 377 +/- 239 pmol/L) concentrations but lower fasting concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (2.54 +/- 0.67 vs 2.82 +/- 0.70 mmol/L) and total cholesterol (4.01 +/- 0.80 vs 4.40 +/- 0.78 mmol/L). In both groups body mass index, triglycerides, and fasting and 2-hour glucose concentrations showed correlations with BP measurements. Fasting insulin was correlated with BP readings only in the ODM. Correlations were found between second- and third-trimester maternal free fatty acid concentrations and diastolic and mean arterial BP. Third-trimester beta-hydroxybutyrate was correlated with mean arterial BP.

In ODM, abnormalities in weight and glucose tolerance are associated with abnormal maternal metabolism. Higher BP is an additional abnormality associated with fetal overnutrition.
