Lateral hypothalamic area dopamine activity (LHA-DA) appears to play a contributory role in regulating food intake, in particular, meal size. In this study we examined our hypothesis that bilateral LHA-DA injection induced depression of food intake via reduced meal size. Dopamine (11 mg/ml) or vehicle was infused into bilateral LHA at 0.5 microliter/h via two osmotic minipumps in six study or six control obese male Zucker rats for 13 days, respectively. Meal size, meal number, as well as food intake were continuously measured before, during, and after dopamine infusion. Intra-LHA-DA infusion significantly depressed food intake. The decreased food intake was solely caused by a significant and profound reduction in meal size. There was a modest compensatory rise in meal number that gradually increased food intake so that it reached control level on 10th dopamine infusion day. However, feeding pattern did not normalize until dopamine infusion ceased. The findings support our hypothesis that LHA-DA may participate in regulating meal size. Data also demonstrate that meal size and meal number are regulated in a reciprocal and independent manner to compensate for each other.
