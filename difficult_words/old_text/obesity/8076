To assess baseline characteristics, glycemic control, and treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.

This multinational, observational study recruited patients ≥ 21 years of age who were newly diagnosed and/or treated with OAD monotherapy for &< months but were inadequately controlled. In cross-sectional phase, data on demographics, medical history, diabetic complications and comorbidities, OAD treatment, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were collected. In longitudinal phase evaluating 6-month follow-up of sulfonylurea (SU)-treated patients, additional data on reasons for not achieving HbA1c targets were collected.

Of 1487 patients (mean [± SD] age 52.0 ± 11.6 years; 46.7% men; mean BMI 25.8 ± 4.4 kg/m(2) ) recruited, 75.9% were newly diagnosed, 73.3% had central obesity, 43.8% had hypertension, and 60.5% had dyslipidemia. The mean HbA1c was 9.8 ± 2.4%, and the mean FBG was 11.3 ± 4.3 mmol/L. At T0 (baseline) and T6 (month 6 visit), 99.8% (n=1066) and 97.1% (n=830) patients received SU, respectively. There was decrease from T0 to T6 in mean HbA1c (10.2% vs 7.3%, respectively; P&<.0001) and mean FBG (12.0 vs 7.6 mmol/L, respectively; P&<.0001). Number of patients with HbA1c &<% increased from T0 (4.5%) to T6 (46.8%). Reasons for not achieving target HbA1c included poor diabetes education (50.7%), non-compliance to OADs (21.4%), and fear of hypoglycemia (19.7%).

Marked reductions in HbA1c and FBG are achievable in T2DM patients managed with OADs. However, patient education and compliance are important for achieving and maintaining treatment targets.
