Adipose tissue secretes numerous bioactive peptides, collectively termed "adipocytokines" or "adipokines". Adipokines act in a paracrine, autocrine, or endocrine manner and regulate several physiological and pathological processes. Increasing evidence indicates that adipokines are implicated also in several malignancies, including lung cancer as well.

The aim of this study is to summarize data concerning adipokines in lung cancer pathogenesis, prognosis and survival; the role of adipokines in lung cancer cachexia is also examined.

A systematic literature search was performed in the electronic database of Medline. Several studies and review articles met the inclusion criteria.

Leptin and adiponectin are the best studied adipokines. The majority of the relevant studies has investigated the potential correlations mainly between leptin, adiponectin, and sometimes also resistin, and nutritional status, systemic inflammation of lung cancer or lung cancer cachexia and have also assessed their prognostic significance. Few other studies have studied genetic variations in leptin, leptin receptor and adiponectin genes and their association with lung cancer susceptibility and prognosis. The ongoing list of adipokines associated with lung cancer also includes resistin, chemerin, and visfatin.

Increasing evidence points to the involvement of certain adipocytokines in lung cancer development, progression and prognosis. No conclusive evidence exists so far with regards to the role of adipocytokines in lung cancer cachexia. Future, longitudinal studies are warranted in order to clarify the role of adipocytokines in lung cancer and also uncover adipocytokines as novel therapeutic targets.
