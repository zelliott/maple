Ninety-three overweight adult males with labile blood pressure elevation participated in a 20-week dietary intervention program to achieve a 10 per cent reduction in body weight and a reduction in dietary sodium intake to 70 milliequivalents per day. By random assignment, half were treated with intensive group treatment procedures and half with individual counseling. Written handouts and assignments were identical, as was the schedule of treatment visits. Both techniques produced significant decreases in weight, sodium intake, calorie intake, and blood pressure. Calorie and sodium knowledge also increased significantly with both intervention approaches. The two treatment modalities did not differ in effectiveness.
