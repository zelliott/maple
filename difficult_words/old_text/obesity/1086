Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were used to determine the distribution of orexin receptors in the rat brain. Strong orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) immunoreactivity was detected in the hypothalamus including the arcuate, ventromedial, and tuberomammillary nuclei that are involved in feeding regulation. The neuropeptide Y- and proopiomelanocortin-containing neurons of the arcuate nucleus, which act to stimulate or to inhibit feeding, respectively, displayed intense OX1R immunoreactivity by double immunostaining. Western blotting analysis yielded a 50-kDa major band of OX1R.
