The obese Zucker rat manifests a number of physiologic and metabolic abnormalities which are controlled or modulated by the sympatho-adrenal system. The interrelationship of these was examined by subjecting 3-4 month old male, homozygous lean and obese Zucker rats to various stresses which are known to activate the sympatho-adrenal system, and by chronic (16-19 days) phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) treatment to block alpha-adrenergic receptors. Both obese and lean PBZ treated rats gained only 1% and 10% of the body weight of their respective control rats during the treatment period, while only the lean rats had a significant reduction (20%) in food intake. Control obese rats failed to maintain rectal temperature after 4 hr at 7 degrees C and their relative output of plasma catecholamines (CA) to cold stress, as measured from indwelling atrial cannulae, was decreased. PBZ treatment did not alter this rectal temperature response although it was associated with increased baseline norepinephrine levels (at ambient temperature 21-22 degrees C) and relative output of CA in the obese rats, suggesting tat sympathetic neural activity was increased under these circumstances. No abnormalities of sympatho-adrenal function, as reflected in plasma CA levels, were found in treated or control obese rats immobilization for 1 hr followed by decapitation. Simultaneously obtained baseline plasma glucose levels were similar in untreated lean and obese rats, but insulin and glycerol levels in the obese rat were 1350% and 213% of lean values, respectively. During sequential stresses, the obese rats became markedly hyperglycemic and hyperglycerolemic compared to the lean rats, while insulin levels were decreased more in the obese than lean rats (12-15% versus 34-35% of controls, respectively). PBZ affected insulin levels only in the obese rats, reducing their baseline levels by 4-fold and stressed induced levels to those seen in the lean control rats. These results suggest that some of the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities of the obese Zucker rat which are modulated by the sympatho-adrenal system can be normalized by procedures which increase sympatho-adrenal activity.
