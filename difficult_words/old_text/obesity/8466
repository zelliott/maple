Insulinemia in patients with essential hypertension and normal glucose tolerance was assessed. The study involved 25 patients divided into subgroups according body weight and 9 of control subjects. It was found, that hyperinsulinemia seen in hypertensive patients seems to be associated with obesity. Moreover, hyperinsulinemia does not depend primarily on hypersecretion of insulin but may reflect resistance to insulin and ab normal metabolism in the liver.
