Since 1 January 2005, the outcomes of bariatric surgeries have been examined in Germany. All data are registered prospectively in cooperation with the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgery at Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg.

Data are collected in an online data bank. Data collection began in 2005 for the results of gastric banding (GB) and in 2006 for sleeve gastrectomies (SGs). In addition to primary bariatric operations, data regarding the complications of revision procedures and redo operations have been analyzed. Participation in the quality assurance study is required for all certified centers in Germany.

SGs are a popular redo operation after failed gastric banding. Using the German Bariatric Surgery Registry, we analyzed data from 137 SGs that were used in a one-step approach after GB and 37 SGs that were used in a two-step approach. Leakage rates for primary SGs dropped to 1.9 %. The incidence of leakage after a one-step SG after GB is significantly higher (4.4 %) than for a two-step approach (0 %).

SGs are popular procedures after failed GB in Germany, but the complication rates for one-step band removal are higher than for a two-step approach. After examining the data, we suggest performing band removal and SG as a two-step procedure. Further analysis is necessary to evaluate the optimal time period between band removal and SG. Follow-up investigations must be performed to determine if SG is an effective and safe option after GB.
