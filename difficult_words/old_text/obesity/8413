Obesity leads to a deterioration of glucose tolerance and the action of insulin. The purpose of this study was to determine insulin resistance (IR) by indirect methods, and its correlation with clinical, anthropometric and biochemical variables in obese normoglycemic school children. This was a descriptive-correlational study of 72 school prepubescent children, who attended the ambulatory "El Concejo" of the University of Carabobo (UC) and at the Gastroenterology and Pediatric Nutrition service of the city hospital "Enrique Tejera" (CHET), in Valencia, Venezuela, between January-April 2011.

exogenous obesity. We assessed personal and family history, presence of Acanthosis Nigricans and nutritional and biochemical status. We found a higher percentage of IR, through the use of the QUICKI method (66.7%), followed by the HOMA (55.6%) and basal insulin (45.9%). The mean (chi) indexes of body mass and waist circumference were significantly greater (p &<0.05) in patients with IR, by HOMA and QUICKI techniques. The QUICKI method detected significant differences (p &<0.05) in the values of glycemia, basal insulin and postprandial insulin, among patients with diminished and normal insulin sensitivities. While HOMA, detected these differences (p &<0.05) in the values of glycemia and basal insulin. A statistically significant relationship was observed (p &<0.05), between the presence of Acanthosis Nigricans and IR, by the HOMA, QUICKI and basal insulin methods. In conclusion, the evaluated techniques, QUICKI, HOMA and basal insulin indexes, were most effective for detecting the IR.
