In this review the authors recognise the growing contribution of obesity to problems in obstetrics and gynaecology. They then focus on methods to reduce complications in intrapartum and gynaecological care particularly in relation to operating on the obese woman. Strategies to reduce surgical morbidity are discussed including consideration of the site of incision, asepsis and reduction in postoperative complications.
