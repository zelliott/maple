To examine the relationship between maternal and toddler dietary variety.

Longitudinal; maternal and toddler dietary data were collected at 13 months; anthropometry was collected at 13 and 24 months.

Data were collected in homes.

109 primiparous, low-income, African American adolescent mothers and toddlers.

Maternal and toddler dietary variety and toddler obesity at 24 months.

Correlations were computed to estimate associations between maternal and toddler dietary variety at 13 months; multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate associations between maternal and toddler diet and toddler growth.

Maternal and toddler fruit, vegetable, snack, meat, dairy, and soda variety were significantly correlated. There was no association between maternal and toddler dietary variety and obesity at 24 months. Adolescent mothers who purchased groceries consumed more fruits and vegetables and provided more variety for their toddlers than those who relied on others to purchase groceries.

Adolescent mothers and toddlers exhibited similar dietary patterns; consuming more sweets and less fruits and vegetables than recommended. Toddlerhood is an optimal time to address healthful dietary patterns and to help adolescent mothers influence grocery purchasing decisions. Goals are to establish healthful dietary patterns and reduce pediatric obesity.
