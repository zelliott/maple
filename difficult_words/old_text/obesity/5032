The prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly in most parts of the world and effective therapeutic drugs are urgently needed. The discovery of leptin in 1994 initiated a new understanding of adipose tissue function, and adipose tissue is now known to not only store and release fatty acids, but also to produce a wealth of factors that have an impact on the regulation of body weight and blood glucose homeostasis. Also, adipocytes express proteins that engage signalling pathways playing important roles in fuel substrate and energy metabolism. These proteins constitute a diverse array of adipose target candidates for the development of drugs to treat obesity. Some of these potential targets have been validated and are now in drug development stages, providing hope that the current obesity epidemic can be addressed by effective drug treatments in the near future.
