Familial aggregation of the metabolic syndrome has been reported in some nations. The aim of this study was to evaluate familial aggregation of the metabolic syndrome in Tehranian families.

In a cross-sectional study, anthropometry, blood pressure and biochemical data were collected for 4,558 individuals in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. Variables of the metabolic syndrome in offspring were correlated with those of their parents.

There were 1,274 fathers, 1,576 mothers, 802 sons and 906 daughters. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 24.4% for fathers, 39.7% for mothers, 9.0% for sons and 7.6% for daughters. Triglycerides and HDL-C of children whose fathers had metabolic syndrome, and BMI, triglycerides and HDL-C of those whose mothers had it were significantly different from those adolescents whose parents were free of metabolic syndrome. Compared with children whose parents did not have metabolic syndrome, the odds ratio (confidence interval) for children with both parents having metabolic syndrome was 4.53 (2.42-8.8) for metabolic syndrome, 2.22 (1.17-4.19) for abdominal obesity, 1.90 (1.15-3.13) for high blood pressure, 2.66 (1.77-4.00) for low HDL-C and 3.16 (2.10-4.75) for high triglyceride levels.

This survey provides evidence suggesting that there is a familial aggregation of the metabolic syndrome among Iranian families.
