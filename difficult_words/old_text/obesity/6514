Substrate cycles (SC) are formed by a 'forward pathway' (FP) and a 'backward pathway' (BP), the difference between FP and BP forming the 'metabolic flux' (MF) through the route of which the cycle is part. SC modulate regulatory effects, i.e. amplify or reduce the % change in MF compared to the % change in FP and BP, thus affecting the sensitivity to regulatory factors, including hormones. A formula is given to calculate (with an approximation of +/- 0.5) the 'flux response index' (FRI), i.e. the factor by which the % change in FP plus the % change in BP must be multiplied to obtain the % change in metabolic flux, when FP and BP undergo opposite, non-unidirectional changes (as is often the case in metabolic regulation). The formula is: FRI = [( FP + BP)/(FP-BP)]/2. By this formula we evaluated the hepatic activities of glucose-6-phosphatase and glucokinase (which roughly reflect hepatic glucose production and uptake, respectively), i.e. the two enzymes that catalyze the cycle between glucose-6-phosphate (glucose-6-P) and glucose. Based on data obtained in normal, nonobese diabetic and obese diabetic subjects as well as in normal, streptozotocin-diabetic, and obese diabetic (ob/ob) mice, we found that FRI was reduced in non-obese diabetic humans and animals whereas it was increased in obese-diabetic humans and mice, compared to normal controls. Thus, diabetes without obesity decreases, and obesity with diabetes increases, the sensitivity of the glucose-6-P/glucose cycle to regulatory agents.
