Resistin and adiponectin, recently discovered adipokines, are secreted from adipose tissue, with postulated opposing functions in insulin resistance and inflammation. More recently, an abundance of resistin was detected in macrophages, which suggests its important role in inflammation. The aim of this study was to clarify circulating serum adipokine levels in women with periodontitis. Thirty-four women with moderate to severe periodontitis and 42 control individuals with healthy gingiva (50- to 59-year-old women) were selected. The serum level of adipokines was analyzed between groups, along with the obesity index, smoking status, and age. Having periodontitis was significantly associated with an increased level of resistin, both in bivariate (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2-7.6) and multivariate (adjusted OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.6) analyses. The association of periodontitis with a decreased level of adiponectin did not reach statistical significance. It was concluded that an increased serum resistin level in middle-aged Japanese women with periodontitis may affect systemic health.
