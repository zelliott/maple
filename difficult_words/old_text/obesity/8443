We compared the physical activity of 11 lean and 11 obese men and women over a 7-day period. There were no significant differences in either the amount of movement recorded with an accelerometer (9.5 (SD 3.9) vs 9.9 (SD 2.6) kcounts.day-1), or in the energy expenditure due to physical activity reflected by the difference between the average daily metabolic rate measured by the doubly labelled water technique and the sleeping metabolic rate measured in a respiration chamber and adjusted for fat-free mass: 112 (SD 33) vs 118 (SD 22) kJ.kg-1.day-1. The obese showed a non-significant loss of body mass of 0.5 (SD 1.1) kg, probably due to reduced intake during the 7-day intake recording period.
