To investigate the effects of: I) short- (8 weeks), II) long-term (3 years) weight loss, and III) the degree of weight loss on circulating levels of adiponectin, high sensitive-C reactive protein (hs-CRP), and fibrinogen in obese subjects. Moreover, to evaluate the effect of the lipase inhibitor, orlistat, on these parameters.

Weight loss induced in 93 obese subjects (mean weight: 108.9+/-15.8 kg) through 8-week very-low-energy diet (VLED, 800 kcal/day) followed by randomization to orlistat or placebo together with lifestyle intervention for further 3 years. Adiponectin and hs-CRP were measured at baseline, after 8 weeks of VLED and 6, 12, and 36 months after the VLED by flowmetric xMAP technology (Luminex Multi-Analyte Profiling System, Luminex Corp., Austin, TX, USA). Fibrinogen was measured in a coagulation assay.

Weight loss after VLED treatment was 14.3+/-4.5 kg and after 3 years 7.7+/-8.7 kg. Orlistat-treated subjects regained 3.9 kg less than placebo-treated from the end of the VLED to 3 years (P=0.01). No differences were detected between the two groups regarding changes in adiponectin, hs-CRP, or fibrinogen. Accordingly, the groups were combined for further analyses. Serum adiponectin increased by 22% (P&<.05) after the VLED but returned to baseline after 3 years. Both short- and long-term weight losses needed to be in excess of 10% (approximately 12 kg) in order to increase adiponectin levels significantly. Weight loss was associated with a significant decrease in hs-CRP. Fibrinogen decreased by 12% (P&<.05) after 3 years.

In obese subjects, weight loss was associated with an increase in serum adiponectin and a decrease in hs-CRP and plasma fibrinogen. Long-term weight loss (3 years) must exceed 10% to induce a combined significant improvement in these inflammatory markers.
