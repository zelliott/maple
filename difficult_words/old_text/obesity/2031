Patients who had received obesity surgery (n = 144) and comparison adults (n = 72) selected the most attractive male and female size and the same-sex size they most wanted to look like from an array of 15 outline drawings. Subjects also reported their height, and current and desired weights (transformed into body mass index units [BMI]). There was a remarkable consensus on the sizes considered most attractive: Two male sizes were chosen by 78% of all subjects, and two female sizes by 83%. The hypothesis that adults who had obesity surgery would idealize thin sizes and, therefore, select thinner sizes and lower weights than comparison adults was not supported. Not only did patients and comparison adults select the same desired size, but women patients desired significantly larger BMIs than comparison women. There was a large range of desired BMIs associated with each desired size; the correlation between desired BMI and desired size was significant for women but not for men. It was speculated that subjects' desired size reflected cultural norms while subjects' desired BMI was a function of their current weight. Health professionals working in weight loss and/or physical fitness areas need to help clients understand weight-size relationships so that clients can have both realistic weight and realistic size goals.
