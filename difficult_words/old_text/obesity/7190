Methylenedisalicylic acid derivatives were synthesized and their inhibitory activities against protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) examined. Two of the compounds, 8 and 9, showed K(i) values of 9.4 and 6.3microM against PTP1B, 4- and 7-fold lower values compared to those against TC-PTP. They were reversible and slow-binding inhibitors against PTP1B. When compound 8 was fed to a mouse model, the weight gain and adipocyte fat storage induced by a high-fat-diet were significantly suppressed.
