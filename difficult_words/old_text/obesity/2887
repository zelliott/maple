In a continuation of studies on the metabolism of foreign compounds under the influence of diet or other factors in relation to neoplasia development, male and female weanling rats, in-bred Wistar-derived rats (50-60 g) free from disease or infection were obesified with N, N-bis (B-chloroethyl)-4, 4-bipiperidine (BPN) prior to determining the biliary excretion of tartrazine. Obese and normal animals excreted the dye unchanged and in sex-related proportions.
