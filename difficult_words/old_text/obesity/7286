The purpose of this study was to determine whether obesity affects pulmonary responses following a 3-day ozone exposure. Obese db/db and lean wild-type mice were exposed to ozone (0.3 ppm) for 72 h. In wild-type mice, ozone exposure caused pulmonary injury and inflammation, and these events were associated with reduced pulmonary compliance. In db/db mice, ozone-induced neutrophil recruitment to the lung was reduced and no reduction in compliance was observed. Similar results were obtained in obese Cpe(fat) mice, indicating that loss of leptin signaling in db/db mice does not account for these obesity-related changes. To examine the role of interleukin (IL)-6 in this obesity-related difference in ozone responsiveness, wild-type and IL-6-deficient mice were raised on 10% or 60% fat diets. Compared with 10% fat-fed mice, wild-type 60% fat-fed mice were obese and had reduced neutrophil recruitment following ozone. IL-6 deficiency reduced ozone-induced neutrophil recruitment in 10% fat-fed mice. In contrast, in obese mice, no effect of IL-6 deficiency on neutrophil recruitment was observed. Obesity-related differences in the effect of ozone on compliance were observed in both wild-type and IL-6-deficient mice. Obesity-related differences in serum IL-6 were observed and may account for obesity-related differences in the effect of IL-6 deficiency on neutrophil recruitment. In summary, the neutrophilic inflammation induced by prolonged low level ozone exposure was attenuated in obese mice and appeared to result from an absence of IL-6-dependent neutrophil recruitment in the obese mice.
