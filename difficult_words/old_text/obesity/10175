The surgical treatment of obesity has existed for over 50 yr. Surgical options have evolved from high-risk procedures infrequently performed, to safe, effective procedures increasingly performed. The operations used today provide significant durable weight loss, resolution or marked improvement of obesity-related comorbidities, and enhanced quality of life for the majority of patients. The effect of bariatric surgery on the neurohormonal regulation of energy homeostasis is not fully understood. Despite its effectiveness, less than 1% of obese patients are treated surgically. The perception that obesity surgery is unsafe remains a deterrent to care.
