The familial aggregation and degree of adiposity of 108 Indian patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes in the young was studied. All patients had onset of diabetes under 30 yr and the female to male ratio was 5:1. Obesity as defined was present in 52 patients (48.2%). A positive family history of diabetes was present in 90 patients (83.3%). Two distinct subtypes emerged in the patients with a positive family history; the offspring of conjugal diabetic parents (29%) and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) with 3-generation transmission (13%). In conclusion, the syndrome of NIDDY in Indians comprises at least 3 subtypes: offspring of conjugal diabetic parents, MODY and patients without a family history (sporadic type).
