The etiology of the hypoferremia of obesity is unclear. Hepcidin is the body's main regulator of systemic iron (Fe) and has been reported to be elevated in obese patients. Thus, we aimed to assess Fe status and serum hepcidin-25 levels and their relationship with body mass index (BMI) in obese Egyptian children and adolescents.

Fifty obese children were compared to 50 age-, sex- and pubertal stage- matched controls. All subjects were subjected to history and anthropometric assessment and measurement of serum Fe, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), ferritin, transferrin saturation (TS), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and hepcidin.

Fe, TS and TIBC were lower, while ferritin, sTfR and hepcidin-25 were higher in obese patients than controls. BMI standard deviation score (SDS) correlated negatively with Fe (r = -0.82, p &<0.01), TS (r = -0.79, p = 0.02) and TIBC (r = -0.69, p = 0.02), and positively with ferritin (r = +0.73, p &<0.001), sTfR (r = +0.80, p &<0.01) and hepcidin (r = +0.95, p &<0.001). Higher BMI SDS and hepcidin were risk factors for iron deficiency (ID).

Hypoferremia and elevated hepcidin-25 are prevalent in obese children and correlated with BMI SDS. The connection between hepcidin and inflammation could explain the association of ID with obesity.
