We measured skin elastic properties (distension ability, retraction ability, and the skin elasticity) of 4 different body sites, finger, hand, forearm, and chest, in 191 normal individuals by means of a new suction device and investigated the correlation of skin elastic properties with sex, site, age, and the degree of obesity. Neither sex nor the degree of obesity were correlated with skin elastic properties. The skin elastic property of the chest was significantly higher than those of the other three sites. Decrease in the skin elasticity of the hand, forearm and chest were associated with aging. This simple and non-invasive device can provide an objective method for evaluating skin elastic property.
