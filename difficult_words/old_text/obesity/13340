A method is presented for the determination of serum lipid groups changes in conditions of venous fatty tolerance test as well as for time defining in reaching the initial levels of serum triglycerides. A variant of the quantitative thin-layer chromatography is applied, combined with carbonization and densitometry for lipid groups determination in the serum of 40 patients, subdivided into four groups: with  chronic ischemic heart disease, with arterial hypertension, with obesity and a control ggroup. Lipid analysis was carried out by the 5th, 20th and 40th minute after the beginning of the test. After loading with Intralipid, it was established to develop quantitative changes not only in triglycerides but in the rest of the lipid groups as well. At the same time, the time for reaching the initial values of triglycerides, calculated by extrapolation, shows significant differences between the control group and those with ischemic heart disease and arterial hypertension. The investigation method adopted guarantees more thorough information about lipid changes after Intralipid infection, than the method with the determination of plasma opasity in corresponding time intervals. The criterion "time for reaching the initial values" characterized more fully the dynamic changes in triglycerides and could be used in the detection of latent anomalies in lipid metabolism.
