Of the 31 patients who developed polyarthritis following jejunoileal bypass for obesity, 24 had cutaneous vasculitis (urticarial, pustular, and nodular), 11 paresthesias, 10 Raynaud's phenomenon, and 1 pericarditis. Blind loop symptoms (14 of 26 patients), cryoglobulinemia (10 of 28), and immune deposits in biopsied skin lesions (5 of 7) support the theory of a relationship between bowel bacteria and immune complexes. Treating the blind loop with antibiotics and sphincteroplasty to prevent bacterial reflux into the blind loop helped 5 of 10 and 6 of 9 patients, respectively. A comparison is made to other bowel associated arthritides.
