The purpose of this research, using correspondence analysis on responses to semantic differential scores, was both to examine self-perception in a clinical sample of 120 obese women and to compare this with their attitudes toward obese, thin, and normal persons. Analyses allow us to conclude that, if obese women, as reported previously, consider obesity as a largely negative condition, they have an ambivalent attitude towards themselves. Even though they share the negative connotations socially attributed to obesity, emotionally these obese women not only tend not to recognize their "abnormality" but strongly desire it.
