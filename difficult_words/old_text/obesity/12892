TNF-alpha (so-called cachectin), IL-1 and 6 are important regulating agents in the homeostasis of energy in the organism, as among others they control processes of apoptosis and thus also the volume of adipose and muscular tissues. They are produced not only in immunocompetent cells but also in adipocytes and muscle cells. The cytokine system is then activated not only in tumours and infections but elevated values were found also in obesity, NIDDM, in myocardial infarction and in advanced decompensated cardiac patients. By acting on phosphorylation of IRS-1 and PI-3 kinase TNF-alpha promotes significantly insulin resistance, causes deterioration of diabetes, as well as elevated body temperature, sleepiness and anorexia. In a group of 65 patients, mostly with android obesity, in hyperleptinaemic and insulin resistant probands with coronarographically confirmed microvascular angina pectoris (n = 22) or IHD, mostly after a myocardial infarction (n = 43) with one or more significant stenoses on the epicardial coronary arteries in half the patients positive or elevated TNF-alpha was found and in 28% also IL-6. This increase did not correlate however with BMI, the percentage of body fat, IRI and C peptide levels nor with cortisol and leptin levels. Insulin resistant subjects had more frequently elevated homocysteine and Lp(a) values which are further two independent risk factors of atherothrombogenesis. Hyperhomocysteinaemia can be favourably influenced by vitamin fortification of the diet or by administration of folate and pyridoxine (1 tablet per day) involving negligible financial costs.
