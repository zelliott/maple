To assess nutritional status, dietary intake and lifestyle habits of non-manual workers in Sarajevo.

Healthy employees in non-manual occupations from four large companies were invited to participate in a nutrition and health survey during 1990 and 1991.

All the subjects were working in the city centre of Sarajevo.

1860 subjects (1120 men and 740 women) aged from 20-65 years of age participated.

Nutritional status was evaluated through anthropometric measurements (weights and heights) and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Data on health status, diet and lifestyle were gathered through individual questionnaires.

Overall, 4.3% of the sample was found to be underweight (BMI &<18.5). Nearly 12% of women and 5.5% of men were obese (BMI&> 30.5). The majority of the obese men were in responsible positions (for example, directors, heads of departments). The majority of obese women were in the 35-45 years old age group in the post-maternity period. Intakes of energy, protein, fat and carbohydrate exceeded former Yugoslavian recommended dietary allowances. About one third of participants (34.3% men and 27.3% women) smoked heavily and 18.1% of men drank alcohol. A total of 16.2% of men and 11.6% of women suffered from hypertension.

The food intake of the population of Sarajevo before the war was generally high. There was high consumption of meat, fatty foods and alcoholic drinks (particularly among men) and low levels of physical activity. This resulted in high levels of obesity and chronic degenerative diseases such as hypertension. Thus, high living standards and physical inactivity had a damaging effect on the health of non-manual workers in pre-war Sarajevo.
