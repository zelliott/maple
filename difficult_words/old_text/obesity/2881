Fourteen morbidly obese subjects, referred to our institution for bypass surgery for obesity, were studied with regard to pulmonary function and respiratory patterns during sleep. The seven female patients experienced no episodes of desaturation or disordered breathing during sleep. Six of the seven male patients experienced desaturation or disordered breathing. The one who did not had hypogonadism, suggesting that testosterone may have a role in the regulation of breathing during sleep. The two patients with the most frequent episodes of apnea and lowest oxygen saturation had a clinical picture consistent with the pickwickian syndrome. This supports the relationship previously noted between the degree of hypoxia and the presence of hypersomnolence.
