As the obesity epidemic continues to grow in the Unites States, so does the search for the ideal nonsurgical or surgical solution. Bariatric surgery continues to be the most sustainable form of weight loss available to morbidly obese patients. In addition, bariatric surgery has established an acceptable safety profile with respect to morbidity and mortality. With the number of elective bariatric cases growing in recent years, it is unsurprising that results have improved and better data are emerging regarding improvement of obesity-related comorbid conditions. Additionally, ample evidence suggests that bariatric surgery may increase longevity, particularly through reducing cardiovascular deaths. Although the specific mechanisms involved in the remission of these medical conditions remain to be fully elucidated, it has become clear that bariatric surgery has established a significant and firm role in the treatment of medical comorbidities that result directly from obesity. However, until commercial insurance carriers provide improved coverage for bariatric surgery, patient access to these treatments will remain limited.
