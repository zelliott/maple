An obese group and a nonobese group of moderately mentally retarded adults were identified through use of body weight and tricep skinfold thickness measures. Subjects were observed individually in a sheltered workshop cafeteria during their normal lunch period. A variety of eating behavior measures were obtained. Results indicated that the obese retarded subjects did not differ from their nonobese peers in eating rate, total meal time, or caloric intake. Large variability was observed in the measures for both groups. Implications of these data for behavioral treatments of obesity and the need for alternative explanations of an obese condition were discussed.
