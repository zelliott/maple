Work fitness was assessed in 120 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) of varying gravity according to which all the patients were distributed into 3 groups of DM. Work fitness was discovered to be lowered, correlating with the disease gravity. Overweight was noted to influence its lowering. During rehabilitation treatment including dietetic management, the treatment with sugar-reducing drugs, physical rehabilitation, work therapy and physiotherapy, work fitness and hemodynamics improved. The rise of work fitness due to rehabilitation treatment was associated with its more effective maintenance. Compensation of DM is a necessary prerequisite for work fitness increase.
