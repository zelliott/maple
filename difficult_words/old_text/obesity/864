Abdominal fat accumulation is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Identifying the demographic and lifestyle correlates of abdominal adiposity is an important step to target at-risk populations in prevention programs. There are few data of this kind in France.

Anthropometric indicators of overall (body mass index, BMI) and abdominal (waist hip ratio, WHR; waist circumference, WC) adiposity, educational level, smoking status, and physical activity were assessed in 6,705 middle-aged men and women participating in the SU.VI.MAX study.

The likelihood of being obese was increased more than twice in physically inactive subjects of both genders after adjustment for age, smoking status and educational level (OR=2.22, CI95%: 1.74-2.83 in men; OR=2.38, CI95%: 1.84-3.09 in women). Having a high WHR &>=0.95 in men,&>=0.80 in women) was more likely in subjects&>=50 y, in current smokers, and less likely in men with higher education. The likelihood of having a high WHR was also increased in physically inactive subjects of both genders after adjustment for age, BMI, smoking status and educational level (OR=1.33, CI95%: 1.10-1.60 in men; OR=1.46, CI95%: 1.22-1.74 in women). Having a high WC &>=102 cm in men,&>=88 cm in women) was positively associated with age and also with physical inactivity (OR=1.63, CI95%: 1.20-2.22 in women).

These cross-sectional data suggest significant positive associations of physical inactivity with both the WHR and WC, independently of overall adiposity as assessed by the BMI.
