Cancer prevention as related to the problem of cervical and endometrial cancer involves a great number of factors that are considered contributory to the development of neoplasms in the uterus. Lifestyles encouraging the development of cervical cancer are different from those encouraging endometrial cancer. Cancer of the cervix is a disease of the inner city. It is seen in those staring intercourse in their teens, having multiple partners, having many children, and coming from the low socioeconomic groups. Semen and herpes virus II may have an adverse effect on immature cells, but there are no hard data to confirm these roles. Cancer of the endometrium is a disease of suburbia. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be 38,000 new cases of endometrial carcinoma in 1980, making it the most common female genital cancer. Women at highest risk for later carcinoma of the endometrium are those who have obesity, diabetes, infertility, irregular menses and failure of ovulation, adenomatous hyperplasia, and/or prolonged estrogen administration. For both cervical and endometrial cancers, it is possible to identify the high-risk patient, to detect changes at an early stage, and, by instituting appropriate therapy, to prevent a more serious problem. It is obvious that prevention, detection, and treatment are all closely intertwined. This paper identifies the patient at high risk and makes suggestions for correcting any imbalance that may predipose to the development of invasive cancer.
