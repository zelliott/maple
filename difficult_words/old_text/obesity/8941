Obesity as a disease is a yet-unidentified sum of genetic and environmental factors. Risky eating behavior and lifestyle may bring the disease. The aim of the study was to find out risk factors for obesity factors influencing definition of obesity. Participants (n = 1500) who filled out a questionnaire about eating habits are grouped according to their body mass indices as normal weight, overweight and obese (n = 500 in each group). According to our results, the prevalence of having obese first-degree relatives is significantly higher in obese individuals (p &<0.001). Sixty-two of normal weighing subjects were university graduates, whereas this ratio was only 31% in the obese group (p &<0.001). Incidence of obesity was higher in married participants when compared to the single or divorced/widowed persons (p &<0.001). Multinomial logistic regression analysis gave the following results: risk of obesity was 57% less in participants lacking a family history of obesity when compared to the ones with a positive family history (p = 0.005). Being married increases the risk of obesity 2.5 times; being a primary school graduate increases the risk about 1.5 times. Lower educational level, unemployment and lack of counseling seem to be risk factors associated with obesity. Diverging patterns of sociodemographic features, lifestyles and perception were evident even between overweight and obese populations.
