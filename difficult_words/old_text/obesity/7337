The cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway helps regulate both cell growth and division, and triglyceride storage and metabolism in response to nutrient status. Studies in yeast show that disruption of this pathway promotes longevity in a manner similar to caloric restriction. Because PKA is highly conserved, it can be studied in mammalian systems. This report describes the metabolic phenotype of mice lacking the PKA catalytic subunit Cbeta. We confirmed that Cbeta has high levels of expression in the brain but also showed moderate levels in liver. Cbeta-null animals had reduced basal PKA activity while appearing overtly normal when fed standard rodent chow. However, the absence of Cbeta protected mice from diet-induced obesity, steatosis, dyslipoproteinemia, and insulin resistance, without any differences in caloric intake or locomotor activity. These findings have relevant pharmacological implications because aging in mammals is characterized by metabolic decline associated with obesity, altered body fat distribution, and insulin resistance.
