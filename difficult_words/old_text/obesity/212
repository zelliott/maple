Forty-five grossly obese patients (averaging 64.1 kg. above ideal body weight) were treated as in-patients with a modified protein-sparing fast. Twenty-seven of these patients had diabetes, sixteen of them requiring insulin. In-patient treatment with PSMF ranged from three days to two years. The dietary regimen provided 1.2 gm. protein per kilogram ideal body weight, with no added fat or carbohydrates; this generally amounted to 270 to 430 gm. meat, distributed in three meals (about 500 to 800 kcal per day). Generous vitamin and mineral supplements were provided. Concomitant psychotherapy was also part of the treatment. Before discharge, the patients had lost from 0.45 to 93.2 kg., depending on compliance, length of hospitalization, and amount of exercise. After discharge, compliance fell, despite provision of group therapy with a psychologist and bi-weekly appointments with the physician and dietitian. The more committed patients who attended group therapy regularly have been more successful in continuing to lose weight.
