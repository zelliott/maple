This review of the connection between unopposed estrogen therapy for climacteric symptoms and the development of endometrial hyperplasia briefly outlines the history of the association, and then concentrates on clinical classification problems which muddy the attempts to come to a clear understanding of the relationship between estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and endometrial cancer.  Little agreement exists about the definition of endometrial pathology and of the malignant potentials of different types of hyperplasia.  This paper classifies 4 types of hyperplasia: 1) cystic hyperplasia, which has the risk of malignant change of less than 2%; 2) adenomatous hyperplasia, which has a risk of malignant change from 12-25%; 3) atypical hyperplasia, which has a malignancy potential of 45%; and 4) carcinoma in situ, which is malignant.  The following conditions are discussed as they are associated with endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma: 1) obesity; 2) anovulation; 3) late menopause; 4) Stein-Leventhal syndrome; 5) functioning ovarian tumors; and 6) diabetes history.  In addition hypertension and cancers of the breast and ovary occur more often with endometrial cancer than would be expected by chance.  The remainder of the paper discusses the administration of exogenous estrogens unopposed, exogenous progestins, and their concurrent use, especially in controlling menopausal symptoms.  Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hyperplasia are discussed.  In terms of prevention, a study showed that low-dose cyclical Premarin (.625 mg) resulted in an incidence of hyperplasia of 7% and with higher doses (1.25 mg) rose to 15%.  The addition of d-norgestrel for 7 days to the high dose of Premarin reduced incidences to 3%, whereas estrogen plus low-dose norethindrone resulted in 0% incidence of cystic hyperplasia.  It is recommended that the unopposed use of estrogens be avoided if possible, although short-term therapy up to 6 months is probably safe.  Longer term therapy must have added progestogen, and endometrial sampling in the form of Vabra curettage should be performed every year in patients taking unopposed estrogens and every 3 years in patients taking combined estrogen therapy.
