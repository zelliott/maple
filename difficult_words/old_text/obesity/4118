Few studies have explored the relationship between weight bias and weight loss treatment outcomes.

This investigation examined the relationship between implicit and explicit weight bias and (a) program attrition, (b) weight loss, (c) self-monitoring adherence, (d) daily exercise levels and overall caloric expenditure, (e) daily caloric intake, and (f) daily caloric deficit among overweight/obese treatment-seeking adults.

Forty-six overweight/obese adults (body mass index&> or = 27 kg/m(2)) participating in an 18-week, stepped-care, behavioral weight loss program completed implicit and explicit measures of weight bias. Participants were instructed to self-monitor and electronically report daily energy intake, exercise, and energy expenditure.

Greater weight bias was associated with inconsistent self-monitoring, greater caloric intake, lower energy expenditure and exercise, creation of a smaller caloric deficit, higher program attrition, as well as less weight loss during the self-help phase of the stepped-care treatment.

Weight bias may interfere with overweight/obese treatment-seeking adults' ability to achieve optimal health.
