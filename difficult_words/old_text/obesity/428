In order to better understand the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes, lipolysis and its adrenergic regulation was investigated in various adipose depots of obese adult females SHR/N-cp rats. Serum insulin, glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides (TG) and glycerol were measured. Adipocytes were isolated from subcutaneous (SC), parametrial (PM) and retroperitoneal (RP) fat pads. Total cell number and size, basal lipolysis or stimulated by norepinephrine (NE) and BRL 37344 were measured in each depot. Obese rats were hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic, suggesting high insulin resistance. They presented a marked dyslipidemia, attested by increased serum FFA and TG levels. High serum glycerol levels also suggest a strong lipolytic rate. Obese rats showed an excessive development of all fat pads although a more pronounced effect was observed in the SC one. The cellularity of this depot was increased 8 fold when compared to lean rats, but these fat cells were only 1.5 to 2-fold larger. SC adipocytes showed a marked increase in their basal lipolytic activity but a lack of change in responsiveness to NE or BRL 37344. The association between high basal lipolysis and increased cellularity yields to a marked adipose cell lipolytic rate, especially from the SC region. SHR/N-cp rats were characterized by a hyperplasic type of obesity with an excessive development of the SC depot. The dyslipidemia, attested by an altered serum lipid profile could be attributed to excessive lipolysis that contributes to increased FFA levels, and to early development of insulin resistance through a lipotoxicity effect.
