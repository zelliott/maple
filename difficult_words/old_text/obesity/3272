The aim of this study was to use a novel method to examine and compare physical activity levels in four different groups of men to investigate the impact of modernity on activity levels. Physical activity levels of four different groups of men were measured and compared, using a tri-axial accelerometer (Tracmor). The first group (HA = historically active) were actors in a historical theme park who play the part of Australian settlers 150 years ago, the second were sedentary modern-day office workers (MS = modern sedentary), the third men who had successfully lost weight (SWL) in a modern men's weight loss program and the last, men who were unsuccessful (UWL) in the same program. Men who had successfully lost weight in a weight loss program were active at a level similar to that of men performing activity at a level carried out historically. Both of these groups were in turn significantly more active than modern-day sedentary workers (p &<0.05) and men who had not been successful at losing weight (p &<0.01). A linear regression between weekly average activity levels and the degree of waist size loss showed a significant positive association (r = 0.52, p &<0.01). The data suggest that a higher activity level facilitates the maintenance of long-term weight loss and this level is likely to approximate activity levels in the past. For the prevention and treatment of obesity an increase in physical activity is necessary, because (long-term) weight loss or weight maintenance is unlikely to occur when people are as sedentary as most people are today.
