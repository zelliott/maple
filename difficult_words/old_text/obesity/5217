This study involved a 1st generation of 194 aged residents at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center plus 2nd and 3rd generations of 357 and 306 offspring, respectively. Serum cholesterol levels (including type of abnormality) and triglyceride levels were determined. The results suggest that hyperlipidemia at all ages is related to a familial genetic problem. The data on each generation, starting even with the 80-year-old parents, could be used to predict lipid abnormalities in each succeeding generations. However, when comparing the 1st generation with the 3rd generation, predictability was lacking, probably because of the inclusion of two sets of spouses and many enviromental factors that altered the situation. In the 2nd generation, 40 per cent of the subjects had an elevated lipid level compared to 30 per cent in the 1st and 3rd generations. The higher concentrations in the 2nd generation probably reflected increased risk factors such as improper diets, smoking, hypertension, obesity and stress at that age level. Hyperlipidemia in the aged apparently is not just a metabolic degenerative abnormality. It should be treated, as in younger people. Data on risk factors such as a high blood lipid level may help not only the aged, but succeeding generations.
