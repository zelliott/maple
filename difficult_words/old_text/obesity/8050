It is well-established that laparoscopic Roux-en-y gastric bypass is a technically challenging operation that requires a long learning curve. With the demand for bariatric surgery, particularly laparoscopic bariatric surgery on the rise, the focus has changed to ensure those performing this difficult procedure are trained appropriately. The ideal training would emphasize two things: (1) acquisition of advanced laparoscopic skills and intraoperative techniques, and (2) knowledge of preoperative and postoperative care of the bariatric patient. The current models for training for laparoscopic bariatric surgery fall into several categories: no training, formal courses, mini-fellowships, and formal minimally invasive surgery/bariatric fellowships. Each of these training paradigms is examined, as well as the available data that compare their effectiveness.
