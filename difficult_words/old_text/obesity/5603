Overweight and obesity are also found among persons with type 1 diabetes.

The present study examined which nutrients predict the body mass index (BMI), the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and the waist circumference (WC) of European persons with type 1 diabetes.

Cross-sectional, clinic-based study (EURODIAB Complications Study).

Nutrient intakes (assessed by a 3-day dietary record) predicting measures of body weight (BMI, WHR and WC) were determined by stepwise forward regression analysis in 1458 males and 1410 females with type 1 diabetes (P&<or =0.05 for inclusion).

In men, a higher carbohydrate intake was a significant independent predictor for lower levels of BMI, WHR and WC, an increased saturated fat intake and a lower intake of cereal fibre predicted a higher WHR, a higher monounsaturated fat intake and a lower glycaemic index of the diet determined lower levels of WHR and WC, and a moderate consumption of alcohol determined an increased WC. In women, a higher carbohydrate intake predicted a lower BMI and a thinner WC, no alcohol consumption determined a lower BMI, and an increased intake of saturated fat and a lower consumption of cereal fibre were significant independent predictors for a higher WHR.

A modified fat intake, an increase of carbohydrate and cereal fibre intake and a preferred consumption of low glycaemic index foods are independently related to lower measures of body weight in European persons with type 1 diabetes.
