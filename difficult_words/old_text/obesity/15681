Most research confirms that metformin therapy has a positive influence on cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The aims of the present study were to establish other CVRF, such as plasma adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, in obese premenopausal women with PCOS and to investigate the effect of metformin treatment on these factors.

The study group consisted of 29 PCOS woman with body mass index (BMI)&>25 kg/m(2). They were treated over 6 months with 500 mg metformin twice daily. Twenty-nine healthy individuals matched for age and BMI were controls. Adiponectin, TNFalpha, IL-6 and CRP levels were examined in all PCOS (before and after treatment) and control women.

In the PCOS group significantly lower plasma adiponectin and TNFalpha levels were observed, whereas there were no differences in plasma IL-6 and CRP levels between PCOS and control groups. Plasma adiponectin increased significantly after metformin treatment, but levels of inflammatory factors did not change.
