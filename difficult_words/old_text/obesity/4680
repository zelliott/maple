Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most common bariatric procedures performed. Dumping syndrome, intolerance to RYGB-induced restriction, and weight loss issues are possible problems bariatric surgeons are confronted with. This study reports the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of laparoscopic reconversion of RYGB to original anatomy (OA) as treatment of these complications.

Between January 2005 and April 2008, eight patients benefited from laparoscopic reconversion of RYGB to OA. Reason was dumping syndrome without postprandial hypoglycemia (three), intolerance to RYGB-induced restriction (three), too much (one) and too little weight loss (one). Mean weight and body mass index (BMI) at RYGB were 104.7±19.3 kg and 38.7±6 kg/m(2), respectively. Four patients suffered of obesity co-morbidities. Mean time between RYGB and reconversion was 21±18.8 months. Mean weight, BMI, and % excess weight loss at reconversion was 66.8±21.7 kg, 20.1±7 kg/m(2), and 23.7±55%, respectively. The procedure involved dismantling both gastrojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy, reanastomosing gastric pouch to gastric remnant, and proximal alimentary limb end to distal biliary limb end.

Mean operative time was 132.2±29.5 min. There were no conversions to open surgery and no early complications. Gastrogastrostomy was performed manually (four) and by linear stapler (four), and jejunojejunostomy by linear stapler (eight). Mean hospital stay was 7.7±3.5 days. After a mean follow-up of 18.3±9.2 months, two patients continued to further lose weight, two patients maintained the same weight, and four patients presented weight regain. Gastroesophageal reflux disease appeared in three patients.

Laparoscopic reconversion of RYGB to OA is feasible and safe. Dumping syndrome and intolerance to RYGB-induced restriction are resolved. The anatomy remains one of the aspects besides nutritional and psychological factors in cases of reconversion for weight issues.
