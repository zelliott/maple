In 2005, an expert committee was convened on behalf of the American Medical Association, the Health Resources and Service Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to update the previous recommendations on the evaluation and treatment of childhood obesity. Fifteen national health care organizations, which served children, participated in writing these recommendations. This article reviews recommendations on assessment of BMI, nutrition and activity, and obesity-related comorbidities. Principles of obesity prevention and treatment are discussed and high-risk eating and activity behaviors are addressed. Prevention and treatment of obesity are reviewed as set in the context of the Medical Home using the principles of the chronic disease model. The stepwise approach to obesity treatment and prevention is reviewed along with specific evidence-based/informed strategies. The skills needed to implement the recommendations, such as integration of the care team, roles and training, links to the health care system, connection to the community, and the role of the subspecialist, are discussed.
