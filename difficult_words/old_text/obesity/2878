In a double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation in obese adults given comparable dietary and exercise recommendations, controlled-release diethylpropion hydrochloride promoted significantly more weight loss than matching placebo. The mean reduction in 12 weeks was 15.9 lb (average 1.32 lb/week) for 12 patients taking diethylpropion hydrochloride, 10.0 lb (0.84 lb/week) for 13 taking placebo, and 12.2 lb for 13 taking drug for two four-week periods separated by four weeks of placebo (1.38 lb/week on active drug and 0.30 lb/week on placebo). Amphetamine-like side effects were virtually absent. Diethylpropion hydrochloride is an effective adjunct to caloric restriction in therapy of obesity.
