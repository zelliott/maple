The pathophysiological mechanisms in hypertension may differ in men and women. Plasma renin activity was measured in 27 premenopausal, never-treated hypertensive women (blood pressure 141 +/- 2/93 +/- 1 mm Hg) and in 18 age-matched normotensive women (blood pressure 113 +/- 2/71 +/- 2 mm Hg). All subjects were unaware of their blood pressure status. The hypertensive women had on average lower plasma renin activity (0.21 +/- 0.03 nmol/L/h) than their normotensive controls (0.42 +/- 0.07 nmol/L/h, P less than .01). Serum estradiol was also lower in the hypertensive women (0.57 +/- 0.06 v 0.81 +/- 0.09 nmol/L, P less than .05). No difference in epinephrine, norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic peptide, or vasopressin was found between the groups. Plasma renin activity was positively correlated to plasma norepinephrine in the hypertensive women only (r = 0.41, P less than .05). Since low renin hypertension is associated with less cardiovascular complications, this may offer an explanation for the better prognosis of hypertension in women.
