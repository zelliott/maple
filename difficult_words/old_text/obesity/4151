India, with a population of over a billion is likely to increase global concern on cancer, particularly that of head and neck. The increasing immigration of Indians is likely to influence other parts of the world and an analysis of cancer-related practices could serve as a model for defining cancer-prevention strategies across the globe. The objective of this study was to review the anti- and pro-carcinogenic practices in India pertaining to head and neck cancer. The published literature on practices, compounds/chemicals/crude reparations related to the head and neck cancer in India was retrieved for analysis, while unauthentic or local information was discarded. The anti-carcinogenic practices prevalent in India consisted of classically varied diet being predominantly vegetarian, along with spices, condiments, beverages etc. The pro-carcinogenic practices predominantly include all shades of alcoholism and tobacco intake. Moreover, the diverse culture of the country reflects unique regional practices. The enormous diversity in practices related to head and neck cancer in India is very unique and interesting. Cancer prevention strategies need to focus on these trends to define a better global prevention.
