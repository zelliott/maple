The relationship between food addiction (FA) and weight and attrition outcomes in overweight and obese adults participating in weight loss interventions were prospectively examined in this study.

Participants were 178 adults (51.2 ± 11.7 y, 36.1 ± 4.8 kg/m(2) ) in one of two outpatient weight loss treatment programs for approximately 6 months. The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) assessed FA diagnosis and symptom count. The relationship between FA and weight loss and attrition was assessed.

After controlling for treatment arm, gender, and baseline weight, there was no effect of FA status on weight loss (P = 0.17) or attrition (P = 0.37). Similarly, baseline FA symptom count was not associated with weight loss (P = 0.14) or attrition (P = 0.10).

Neither FA status nor symptom count affects weight loss or attrition during weight loss treatment.
