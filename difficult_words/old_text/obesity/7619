Dyslipidemia is frequently found in association with obesity. Obesity-related dyslipidemia is characterized by elevated triglycerides, elevated VLDL, increased apo-B, decreased HDL cholesterol and increased small dense LDL particles. This combination of lipid abnormalities is particularly atherogenic and, along with related comorbidities, explains the increased cardiovascular risk seen in obesity. Weight loss, through diet, medication and/or surgery all result in beneficial effects upon serum lipids. Dietary modification and lifestyle change are essential components in the management of obesity-related dyslipidemia. Many patients, however, require pharmacotherapy to achieve lipid goals.
