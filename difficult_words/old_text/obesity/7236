To examine the effect of self-weighing frequency on weight change and body satisfaction.

Observational study based on findings from a 6-month randomized controlled telephone-based weight loss trial. Data collected at baseline and 6 months.

Metropolitan community-based sample.

Sixty-three obese adults. Mean age 49.5 years, 82% percent white, and 79% female. Mean body mass index at baseline was 34.2 kg/m(2).

Change in weight and body satisfaction.

General linear model regression was used to assess the effect of self-weighing on outcomes of interest. Statistical significance was set at alpha level .05. Treatment group and baseline values of dependent variables included as covariates in all analyses.

Participants who increased their frequency of self-weighing over the 6-month period demonstrated significantly better weight loss outcomes than those who maintained or decreased their frequency of self-weighing (-6.8 kg vs -3.1 kg, F = 8.59, P = .006). There were no significant associations between self-weighing frequency and body satisfaction at 6 months (F = 0.55, P = .58).

These findings support frequent self-weighing for weight control. There appears to be little or no effect of self-weighing on body satisfaction. Future research should replicate these findings across a larger, more diverse population of overweight adults.
