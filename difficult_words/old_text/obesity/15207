Obesity (body mass index â‰¥30) is associated with worse outcomes after colon cancer surgery. Most research, however, has been performed outside bariatric centers of excellence. We sought to determine the relationship between obesity and outcomes after colon cancer resection when performed at a center with bariatric expertise.

We performed a retrospective review of 245 consecutive patients undergoing elective colectomy for adenocarcinoma at a single institution from 2008 to 2009. Body mass index, major and minor postoperative complications, tumor characteristics, lymph node yield, type of resection, and operating times were determined.

Complication rates, operative times, and lymph node counts were all similar between the two weight groups. Obese patients had similar tumor characteristics at all stages when compared with nonobese patients. On multivariate analysis, obesity did not correlate with tumor size, tumor differentiation, or presence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion.

We conclude that obese patients undergoing colon cancer resection at a bariatric center of excellence have similar tumor characteristics and equivalent short-term outcomes as do nonobese patients.
