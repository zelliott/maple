To assess classical and non-classical metabolic risk biomarkers in prepubertal children with different levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF).

CRF was assessed by the 20 m shuttle run test. To estimate physical activity, participants were observed while engaged in an after-school programme. Additionally, a short test based on a validated questionnaire was used to obtain information about physical activity practice and sedentary habits. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, and classical and non-traditional metabolic risk biomarkers--plasma lipid profile, glucose and insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), plasma uric acid, transaminases and C-reactive protein (CRP)--were measured.

The study was conducted in local elementary schools in CÃ³rdoba, Spain.

One hundred and forty-one healthy children (eighty-eight boys, fifty-three girls) aged 7-12 years, in Tanner stage I, were recruited. They were divided into two groups after they performed the 20 m shuttle run test: equal or higher cardiovascular fitness (EHCF) group and low cardiovascular fitness (LCF) group.

The LCF group displayed significantly higher TAG (P = 0.004) and lower HDL cholesterol levels (P = 0.001), as well as significantly lower values for the non-traditional lipid marker apo-A1 (P = 0.001) compared with the EHCF group. The LCF children displayed higher plasma glucose (P = 0.003) and insulin levels, higher HOMA-IR scores (P &<0.001) and higher plasma uric acid and CRP levels (P &<0.05). After adjustment for BMI, age and sex, no statistically significant differences were found between groups for the biomarkers analysed.

The study provides new information to understand the role not only of weight status but also of the level of CRF on the metabolic health profile of prepubertal children.
