To evaluate feasibility and clinical outcomes of myomectomy performed through minilaparotomic access in a large series of consecutive patients.

All patients submitted to laparotomic conservative surgery for uterine myomas through an initial minilaparotomic approach (4-8-cm transverse skin incision) were retrospectively evaluated. Preoperative findings, surgical technique, rate of laparotomic enlargement, operative time, surgical complications and length of recovery were the main analyzed outcomes.

One hundred and seventy out of 212 patients experienced minilaparotomic approach for uterine myomatosis. In 97 (57.1%) multiple myomas were present (maximum, 23). The size of the largest myoma ranged from 2 to 19 cm (median 5.6). In 161 (94.7%) patients myomectomy was ended through minilaparotomic access with a mean length of skin incision of 6.2 cm (4-7.8). The correlation between severe obesity and laparotomic enlargement was statistically significant (p&<.05). The mean operative time was 57 min (32-118). One bladder intraoperative injury was successfully managed through minilaparotomic incision. Bowel or vascular complications never occurred. Estimated blood loss was not significant except in three cases (1.9%) requiring transfusion. Febrile complications were observed in nine patients (5.6%). The median postoperative stay in uncomplicated patients was 2.5 days (2-4).

Our report supports the wide application of minilaparotomic myomectomy and suggests that more than 85% of women with fit uterine myomatosis could be successfully managed in this way with a failure rate of 5.3% in eligible patients. The main criteria of minimal invasive surgery seem to be by minilaparotomic myomectomy, which should be considered a valid option for uterine myohas conservative treatment.
