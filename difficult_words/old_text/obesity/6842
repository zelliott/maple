Midwives have previously reported concerns about discussing and referring obese pregnant women to weight management services, with some women stating that this referral can be upsetting. The current study interviewed obese women who had declined a weight management service during pregnancy to explore if it was the referral process that made them decline the service. Fifteen women participated and reported that being informed about and referred to a service by their midwife was acceptable to them. Participants also mentioned they would expect this information from their midwife. No participants reported being upset by this referral.
