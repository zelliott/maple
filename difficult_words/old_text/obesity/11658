In this study, plasma concentrations of hemostatic molecular markers were investigated in 118 elderly persons with normal renal function (aged 65 to 97 years) who could manage their activities of daily living (ADL) by themselves, to find a strategy for conservation or elevation of ADL and quality of life (QOL). In all subjects, the frequency by which hemostatic markers exceeded their upper limit of normal range was 35.9% for thrombin-antithrombin HI complex &> or = 3.7 ng/ml), 38.3% for soluble fibrin monomer &> or = 4.0 microg/ml), 41.8% for D-dimer &> or = 1.0 microg/ml), 49.0% for plasmin-alpha2 plasmin inhibitor complex &> or = 1.0 microg/ml), and 53.7% for thrombomodulin &> or = 20 ng/ml). The mean plasma levels of these markers were slightly higher than the upper limit of their normal range. These markers were also investigated in samples of patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors and with and without cardiovascular diseases (ischemic heart disease and/or cerebral infarction). Furthermore, the results were analyzed in relationships between cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factor or aging. The findings suggest that aging exerts a stronger influence on plasma levels of these hemostatic molecular markers than the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases. From the viewpoint for conservation or elevation of ADL and QOL in elderly persons, also other factor, such as drug intake, lifestyle, aging, and so on, must be considered to clarify the relationship between the plasma levels of the hemostatic molecular markers and cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular diseases.
