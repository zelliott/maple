Obesity has become an international public health problem. Unfortunately, effective treatment options are limited. In the last 20 years, research in obesity and associated pathologies has derived in a significant increase in the knowledge of the physiological and molecular mechanism regulating body mass, such as gastrointestinal-neuroendocrine communications. Gut-brain peptides may provide attractive therapeutic targets against this disease. This review summarizes research into energy balance through gastrointestinal tract peptides. Understanding these molecular mechanisms will provide new pharmacological targets for the treatment of obesity and appetite disorders.
