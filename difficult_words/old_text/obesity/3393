Chronic inflammation is known to promote metabolic dysregulation in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Although the precise origin of the unchecked inflammatory response in obesity is unclear, it is known that overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells affects metabolism. For example, TNF-α contributes to the inability of cells to respond to insulin and to the increase in levels of insulin. Whether this hyperinsulinemia itself is part of a feedback loop that affects the progression of chronic adipose inflammation is unknown. In this article, we show that regulatory T cells (Tregs) express the insulin receptor, and that high levels of insulin impair the ability of Tregs to suppress inflammatory responses via effects on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Insulin activated AKT signaling in Tregs, leading to inhibition of both IL-10 production and the ability of Tregs to suppress the production of TNF-α by macrophages in a contact-independent manner. The effect of insulin on Treg suppression was limited to IL-10 production and it did not alter the expression of other proteins associated with Treg function, including CTLA-4, CD39, and TGF-β. In a model of diet-induced obesity, Tregs from the visceral adipose tissue of hyperinsulinemic, obese mice showed a similar specific decrease in IL-10 production, as well as a parallel increase in production of IFN-γ. These data suggest that hyperinsulinemia may contribute to the development of obesity-associated inflammation via a previously unknown effect of insulin on the IL-10-mediated function of Tregs.
