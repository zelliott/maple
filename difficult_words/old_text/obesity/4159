Bariatric surgery is the only reliable treatment that offers sustained, long-term weight loss. This results in cure or improvement in almost all of the obesity-associated diseases and translates into reduction in the relative risk of death or increased longevity of the operated morbidly obese population. Since the treatment of obesity-associated conditions is very costly, bariatric surgery also results in significant reductions in healthcare costs with a return on investment of 3 years. It is not just weight loss, it is health gain.
