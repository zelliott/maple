Between January 1977 and August 1979 there have been 14 courses at the Harrow Slimming Club--a non-profit-making group run by the Harrow Health District using local authority premises, and with trained dietitians as course counsellors. The administrative structure, recruitment procedures and dietary advice are described. The 249 course members were typically moderately-obese middle-aged women, but there was a wide range in both age and in severity of obesity. During the initial ten-week course the average attendance was 7.1 sessions per person, and the average weight loss was 4.4 kg. Members who attended more regularly showed greater weight losses. Those members who attended regularly were eligible to join follow-up courses, and 110 members took this option. The average attendance at follow-up was 9.2 sessions per person with a small further weight loss, but again there was wide variation about this average figure. The results compare very favourably with those obtained either by commercial slimming clubs or hospital obesity clinics.
