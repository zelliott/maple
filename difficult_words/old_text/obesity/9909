We performed this study in order to assess the degree of insulin secretion, both in moderate and severe obesity, and its relationship with body mass index (BMI). During fasting, we did not observe, in general, any modification in the hepatic clearance of insulin, both the moderate and severe obesity groups. After oral overload of glucose (OOG), there was an increase in the secretion of insulin and a decrease in its hepatic clearance in both groups of obesity, with no differences between them. The OOG produced a decrease in the hepatic clearance of insulin in the obese and control groups. Just a slight correlation was observed between insulin secretion and BMI in the control, group, and no correlation at all in both groups of obesity. Neither a correlation was observed between insulin secretion and age or sex.
