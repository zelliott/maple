Since 1980 clinical, biochemical and anthropometric examinations have been performed annually on 46 adipose patients (25 males, 18 females) and 53 test persons (35 males, 18 females) at the age of 25 to 40 years. Several of the established parameters (e. g. cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, blood pressure among others) in the course of the 5 years within the known normal regions drew towards the adequate limiting value to the pathological. The results of the study clearly show the central role of the overweight for the formation of risk factors. Despite the partly only in a certain tendency recognizable behaviour of individual signs after 5 years from our point of view the longitudinal technique represents itself as a very well suitable method to realize dynamic processes and risk factors of ageing.
