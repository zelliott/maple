H-2 haplotype differences distinguish the related C57BL/KsJ (BKs) and C57BL/6J (B6) inbred strains. BKs mice are more susceptible to diabetes induction by a recessive obesity gene, diabetes (db), or by multi-dose streptozotocin (MSZ) administration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the H-2 differences were the important genetic background modifiers determining inbred strain susceptibility or resistance to these diabetogenic stresses. Diabetes susceptibility of BKs. B6-H-2b congenic mice was compared with that of the parental BKs and B6 stocks. In addition, diabetes severity was studied in (B6 X BKs)F1 and F2 db/db mice and an H-2 segregation analysis was performed. BKs susceptibility genes expressed in a dominant fashion in the F1 generation, and were transmitted to F2 db/db males without apparent segregation. No association between H-2b haplotype and B6-type diabetes resistance was found in response to either the db mutation or to MSZ. Insulitis, associated with development of hyperglycemia in BKs males, also occurred in the H-2b congenic stock. However, an apparent interaction between H-2b haplotype, the db mutation (on chromosome 4), and male gender (Y chromosome?) was indicated by a segregation ratio distortion in recovery of this genotype. A more moderate diabetes in some F2 db/db females suggested that non-MHC-linked genes controlling sex steroid metabolism were the important determinants of diabetogenic sensitivities in the C57BL stocks. In support of the latter, strain differences were demonstrated in activity levels of steroid sulfatase, which is regulated by a sex-linked gene likely expressed on both the X and Y chromosome, and which may control tissue levels of active androgens and estrogens. We show that the diabetes-susceptible F1 hybrids exhibit the higher activity associated with the BKs strain.
