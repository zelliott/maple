Based on cognitive theory (CT), the aim of this study is to investigate the cognitive processing of food cues in clinically overweight adolescents.

An experimental design with performance-based measures.

Eighty-seven (45 overweight, 42 normal weight) adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 years were examined. All completed an imbedded word task (IWT), containing high caloric food words and matched control words, as a measure of attention interference. A free-recall task was used to detect explicit memory biases. To study the effects of cognitive avoidance, participants were instructed to suppress thoughts about food or merely to monitor them, prior to completing the IWT and memory task.

No evidence was found for interference in the attention processing of food cues. Also, no effects of thought suppression were found. However, consistent with hypotheses, the overweight adolescents did show an explicit memory bias for food stimuli, not due to a more general negative evaluation of food words.

The results provide at least partial support for the applicability of CT to adolescent obesity. The study was the first to reveal a memory bias for high caloric food cues in overweight youngsters, which may well reflect a later-stage activation of food-related schemata. These may play a role in food-related preoccupations and overeating. The existence of an early-stage attention bias is less clear and requires further investigation.
