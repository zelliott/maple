To evaluate variations in children's attitudes to obesity in relation to age, gender and social class.

Evaluation of sex, age and social class differences in judgements of figure drawings varying in body shape.

180 children aged from 4-11 from six schools, varying in the social background of their pupils.

Self ratings of body shape, choices of ideal body shape now and in adulthood from a range of line drawings of figures varying in fatness, and behavioural and personality stereotype judgements of illustrations of thin, average and fat children.

Few children in this age group were fat and few felt too fat; though a substantial minority felt too thin. Girls selected thinner ideal figures than boys. Children demonstrated strongly negative attitudes to obesity, which were less favourable among those who were older and from the higher social status schools.

There are significant social variations in attitudes to obesity which might be important in understanding variations in the prevalence of obesity and weight control practices.
