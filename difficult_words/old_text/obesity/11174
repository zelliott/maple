We report on a family affected by Camurati-Engelmann disease, characterized by radiological signs limited to the tibia, and associated with overweight or obesity, which is not a known feature of this disorder. The affected patients were heterozygous for a c.466C&> T mutation (which predicts p.Arg156Cys) in the latency associated protein (LAP)-coding domain of the TGFB1 gene. This mutation had previously been reported once in another family with a similar, atypical phenotype, which suggests a possible phenotype/genotype relationship.
