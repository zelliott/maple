This study examines gender differences in the physical activity levels of young African-American adults. One hundred twenty-seven African-American college freshmen (57 males and 70 females) completed the Lipid Research Clinic's Physical Activity questionnaire. Using a four-point scoring method (ie, very low active, low active, moderately active, and high active), approximately 71% of females compared with 49% of males were classified as very low active or low active. Statistical analysis revealed significant gender differences between groups. Post hoc analysis revealed that the difference existed in the high-activity category for females, with few females being categorized as high active. The results of this study suggest that young African-American adult females are less active than their male counterparts.
