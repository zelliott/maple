Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking have all been directly related to CHD. Obesity is on the rise in the United States and has also been associated with CHD. This review clearly establishes obesity as an independent risk factor for CHD as demonstrated by the Framingham Heart Study, Nurses Health Study, Buffalo Health Study, and the Cancer Prevention Study II. Morbid obesity was found to correlate with a significant risk of mortality from CHD, especially in young men. Prevention of obesity, and therefore reduction in risk from cardiovascular disease, is paramount in the management of obesity. New approaches to behavioral, medical, and surgical management of obesity are reviewed, including thalidomide, an antiangiogenic agent. A primary and secondary prevention model details a multidisciplinary approach to reducing risk in obesity.
