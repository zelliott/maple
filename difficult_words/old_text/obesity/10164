To assess whether metformin prevents body weight gain (BWG) and metabolic dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia who are treated with olanzapine.

Forty patients taking olanzapine (10 mg daily) were randomly allocated to a metformin (n = 20; 850 to 1700 mg daily) or placebo (n = 20) group in a 14-week double-blind study. Waist circumference (WC), BWG, body mass index (BMI) fasting glucose, insulin, and lipids were evaluated at baseline and at Weeks 7 and 14 of treatment.

At Week 14, BWG (kg) was similar in the metformin group (5.5 kg) and the placebo group (6.3 kg), P = 0.4. There were no differences between the changes in BMI, WC, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), and plasma lipid levels observed in the treatment group and the placebo group; however, glucose levels decreased significantly after metformin administration (P = 0.02). The HOMA-IR decreased significantly in both groups, but 3 subjects from the placebo group developed fasting glucose levels greater than 5 mmol/L. After taking metformin, triglyceride levels increased, but the cholesterol profile improved significantly.

Metformin did not prevent olanzapine-induced BWG. While some lipid parameters worsened during placebo, the HOMA-IR improved in both the placebo and the metformin groups. Carbohydrate metabolism impairment was not systematically observed during short-term olanzapine administration.
