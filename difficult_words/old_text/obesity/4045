Immunoreactive insulin (IRI) concentrations were measured in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of four-month old genetically obese Zucker rats, their heterozygote lean littermates, and age-matched normal-weight Wistar rats. Basal plasma IRI was 201 + 35 microU/ml (means +/- SEM) in the obese animals and was significantly elevated compared to both lean Zucker rats (18 +/- 2.4 microU/ml, P less than 0.001) and Wistar rats (12 +/- 2.4 microU/ml, P less than 0.001). The mean CSF IRI concentration of fasted obese Zucker rats was 1.59 +/- 0.19 microU/ml; this was significantly higher than the CSF IRI level of either fasted Zucker lean rats (0.31 +/- 0.08 microU/ml, P less than 0.001) or Wistar rats (0.34 +/- 0.12 microU/ml, P less than 0.001). Plasma and CSF IRI concentrations were increased in free-feeding as compared with fasted animals. These data provide evidence that endogenous CSF insulin is derived from circulating plasma insulin in the rat and suggest that the hyperphagia and obesity of the Zucker fatty rat are not due to an inability of circulating insulin to gain access to the CSF.
