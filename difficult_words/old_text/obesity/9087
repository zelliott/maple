The number of overweight children is constantly increasing in both developed and underdeveloped countries. Most epidemiological surveys consider school age children with little attention being given to preschool age children. This study was undertaken to define the prevalence of being overweight or obese in a population of children 3-6 years of age, living in North-East Italy. We also identified differences when comparing body mass index (BMI) data against three different national and international standards.

The study involved 258 children (124 males and 134 females) with an average age of 4.8 years. Weight and height were obtained for each child and BMI was calculated according to the formula weight (kg)/height (m)(2). The prevalence of overweight and obese subjects was then determined using the growth curves of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the growth curves of the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) and the curves published in 2003 by Luciano et al.

All three methods gave similar, but not identical, estimates of the prevalence of overweight in both boys and girls. However, when determining the prevalence of obesity, the use of the CDC curves led to a significantly higher prevalence of obesity in both males and females when compared to the growth charts of the IOTF and Luciano et al.

The use of the CDC growth curves leads to an increase in the prevalence of obesity when evaluating children under 5 years of age. The lower cut-off values inherent in the CDC charts, in contrast to the ones proposed by the IOTF, allow for earlier identification of a larger number of subjects with weight problems and therefore provide the potential for earlier intervention.
