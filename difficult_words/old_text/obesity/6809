While the components of effective pediatric exercise interventions have been identified in structured research settings, recent reviews have highlighted the need for translating these interventions into accessible programs. In this paper we evaluate a behavioral intervention-based exercise program designed to serve community children and teens at risk for adult obesity. Measures of weight, strength, cardiovascular fitness, and exercise intensity improved significantly over the course of this program, and qualitative assessments indicated that attitudes towards exercise also improved. Our experiences suggest that structured, protocol-driven exercise interventions can be successfully translated into effective programs accessible to children of different ages and socioeconomic levels.
