The results have shown that schoolchildren with moderate body mass (M +/- 0.3 sigma) have the highest physical capacity for work (PWC 170/kg) and schoolchildren with body mass from M + 0.3 to M + 1 sigma show a decrease by 20% and with an excessive body mass M + 1.75 sigma by more, about 40%. Bearing in mind this rough drop of capacity to work and the significant aggravation of functional state with an excessive body mass M +/- 1 sigma we consider that limitation of body mass standard by limits M +/- 0.67 sigma is advisable. The studies showed the high efficiency of exercises of cyclic nature (swimming, running, skiing, bicycle) with a view to correcting disorders due to obesity.
