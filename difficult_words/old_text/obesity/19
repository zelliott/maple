The aim of this investigation was to compare the contributions of the genotype of the brown adipose tissue (BAT) and of its environment to the obesity of the mutant mouse C57 BL/6J ob/ob. Pieces of interscapular BAT from lean or obese mice were transplanted to a site underneath the kidney capsule of recipient lean or obese mice. The grafts were left in place for 6 to 12 weeks and then examined by histological methods by electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructure of the mitochondria and by fluorescence histochemistry to examine the catecholaminergic innervation of the grafts. When lean BAT was grafted into obese mice, or when obese BAT was grafted into lean mice, kept at ambient temperatures, the characteristics of the donor BAT (i.e. lipid droplet size, mitochondrial ultrastructure and catecholaminergic innervation) transformed partially, but not completely, towards those of BAT in the host mouse. However, if lean mice containing obese BAT grafts were cold-acclimated at 4 degrees C or obese mice containing lean BAT grafts were warm-acclimated at 33 degrees C, the characteristics of the donor BAT transformed completely towards those of the BAT in the host mouse. This complete transformation occurred even if the host mice were returned to 23 degrees C after the period of temperature acclimation. Fluorescent histochemical observations indicated that the sympathetic innervation of BAT grafts was only indistinguishable from that of the lean or obese host BAT when the mice received a period of temperature acclimation (cold for lean mice; warm for obese mice). We conclude that BAT grafts from lean mice can assume the typical characteristics of BAT in obese hosts and that BAT grafts from obese mice can assume the typical characteristics of BAT in lean hosts provided that both the sympathetic innervation and the vascularization of the grafts is the same as in the host. Intrinsic properties of BAT in genetically obese mice are therefore unlikely to be of paramount importance in determining the obesity of the ob/ob mouse. Our results support the conclusions of other workers in implicating the low activity of the sympathetic innervation of BAT as being crucially important in causing the reduction of thermogenic activity.
