Metformin improves insulin sensitivity, which is correlated to phospholipid fatty acid composition in obese type 2 diabetics. We aimed at investigating the relationship between Metformin and fatty acids in obese insulin resistant non-diabetic individuals. A double-blind, placebo-controlled 20-week trial was performed in 21 BMI and age-matched insulin resistant non-diabetic individuals receiving either Metformin or placebo. Insulin sensitivity together with metabolic parameters and fatty acids in serum phospholipids were measured at baseline and at 20 weeks. A significant decrease in body weight, BMI, percentage body fat, the sum of saturated fatty acids in serum phospholipids and increase in insulin sensitivity index were observed following the 20-week treatment. These changes did not differ significantly between the groups. Energy restriction rather than Metformin treatment appears to be responsible for the observed changes. The associations previously found in diabetics between insulin sensitivity and phospholipid fatty acids may not be mediated by Metformin.
