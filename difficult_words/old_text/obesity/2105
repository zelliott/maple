To search for genetic and environmental determinants of obesity, we compared the prevalences and the impact of obesity in three populations from two cities: Mexican Americans (n = 820) and non-Hispanic whites (n = 1112) from San Antonio, Texas, and Mexicans from Mexico City (n = 1878). In the age range examined, 35-64 years, only Mexican men and women showed a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity with age. On the other hand, genetic ancestry, especially in women, made significant differences in the rates of obesity. Mexican Americans showed relatively high, and non-Hispanic whites low, rates of obesity. To discriminate between genetic and environmental influences mediating the impact of obesity on a set of hemodynamic and metabolic variables, we compared this impact between Mexican Americans and both non-Hispanic whites (same macro-environment, different gene pools), and Mexicans (same gene pool, different environments). We found that obesity always worsens the hemodynamic and metabolic profiles of individuals, but the magnitude of the effects may be variable. We showed that the levels of insulin concentrations for a given level of obesity were similar in Mexicans and Mexican Americans, suggesting that genetic influences predominate in determining insulin levels; the levels of triglycerides and HDL for a given level of obesity were similar in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites, suggesting predominant environmental influences on lipid levels. On the other hand, the levels of glucose and systolic blood pressure for a given level of obesity were usually different between Mexican Americans and either of the other two populations, suggesting that these levels may result from genotype-by-environment interactions.
