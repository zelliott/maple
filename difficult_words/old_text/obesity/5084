This report describes the preliminary results of a feasibility study of detection of endometrial carcinoma in an asymptomatic population of women aged 45 and above. The initial sample of 1280 women was evaluated by several cytologic smear techniques and by 2 endometrial sampling methods assigned by computer. The clinical approaches and the techniques used are detailed. During this initial period of study 8 histologically proved endometrial cancers were diagnosed, 2 of which were deeply invasive. With 1 exception, the 8 patients were either obese or had a past history of treatment with conjugated estrogens. A relatively small number of women with endometrial hyperplasia of various types were also identified. The accuracy of the detection methods and their long-term impact on morbidity and mortality cannot be assessed as yet. Incidentally, a small number of cancers and precancerous states of organs other than the endometrium have also been diagnosed.
