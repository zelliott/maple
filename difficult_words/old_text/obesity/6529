Multifactorial analysis of effects of metabolic and endocrine determinants of the host and morphology of the tumor on cellular immunity has been undertaken in 29 patients with cancer of the corpus uteri. Several regression models obtained using the Hocking-Leslie method demonstrated significant effects of age, obesity, triglyceride levels, morphologic differentiation of the tumor and magnitude of invasion on various levels of cellular immunity, presenting as an increase in T-helper and decrease in suppressor counts. The multifactorial analysis depicted additive effects of endocrine homeostatic determinants and the tumor on different aspects of cellular immunity in cancer of the corpus uteri.
