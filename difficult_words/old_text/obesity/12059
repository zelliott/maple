Local data about prevalence of obesity in emerging countries are rather scarce. Risk factors for obesity, well known in most industrialized countries, are poorly understood in Tunisia.

To assess prevalence of overweight and obesity and to investigate associations with possible risk factors in a group of 6-12 year- old schoolchildren in Tunis, Tunisia.

A descriptive transversal study including a sample of 1335 schoolchildren (6-12 years; mean: 9.7 Â± 1.5 years) was conducted in Tunis. Personal and parental data were collected by questionnaires completed by parents. Height and weight were measured and body mass index was calculated. Prevalence of overweight and obesity was defined based on international agreed cut-off points.

Prevalence of overweight and obesity was 19.7% and 5.7%, respectively. Risk factors associated with overweight were: high degree- educated mother and father: 17.3% vs 11.7% (p=.01) (OR (95%CI): 1.58; 1.09-2.29) and 26% vs 17.4% (p=.002) (OR: 1.66; 1.21-2.29), respectively; mother, father high in occupational hierarchy: 7.2% vs 3.6% (p=0.009) (OR: 2.1; 1.2-3.7) and 14% vs 9% (p=.014) (OR: 1.6; 1.1-2.48), respectively. Overweight children had a significantly higher consumption of bread (p=.044), of snack intake (p=0.046) and of soft drink consumption (p=.035).

Prevalence of overweight and obesity in this cohort are 19.7% and 5.7%, respectively. Substantial differences in food choices in families with the highest socio-economic status are among risk factors contributing to obesity development.
