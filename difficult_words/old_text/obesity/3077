In this study a new modified videosystem, designed for measuring body-image, was evaluated alongside the major size-estimation measure, namely, the visual size-estimation apparatus. The advantages afforded by a videosystem which allows independent adjustment of size and height/width proportions were highlighted, and its validity and reliability were examined, based on estimates made by obese, normal weight, and pregnant groups.
