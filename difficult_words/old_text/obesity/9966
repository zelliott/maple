It has been recently shown that the opioid antagonists naloxone and naltrexone are able to reduce appetite and to raise energy expenditure in animal models. The results of studies in humans are inconclusive. In 10 female obese patients we have evaluated the effects of naloxone infusion (2 mg/2 h) on energy expenditure, measured by indirect calorimetry (Deltatrac) and on plasmatic levels of glucose, insulin, glucagon and somatostatin, fasting and after the assumption of a standard 567 kcal meal (C = 20%, P = 20%, L = 60%). We have repeated the tests after a dietary period of 1 month, associated with naltrexone assumption. Acute administration of naloxone caused similar effects at the beginning and at the end of the study; we have observed a raise of caloric expenditure, a decrease of hyperinsulinemia and a high response of somatostatin to metabolic stimulus. After therapy, even with a weight reduction of 6%, we haven't observed either variations of energy expenditure or hormonal level changes. We conclude that in obese women opioid hypertone plays a role in thermic effect of meals and in the impaired response to the nutrients of the gastroenteropancreatic axis. The absence of any effects of naltrexone on the variables that we have studied is perhaps due to the difference in the dose, way of administration and of the different action on the target receptor by the two opioid antagonists.
