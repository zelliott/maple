Obesity is associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased inflammation. The expression of adhesion molecules may be influenced by a high glucose load. The aim of the present study was to evaluate serum sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin concentrations in obese women, and to evaluate the role of high-glucose load on postload circulating levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin in obese women with normal glucose tolerance.

A total of 21 obese women (BMI = 37,7 +/- 8,0 kg/m(2)) and 19 lean controls women (BMI = 21,6 +/- 1,9 kg/m(2)) were recruited and serum sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin levels were measured in fasting state. After an overnight fast, obese (n = 6) and lean women (n = 6) underwent a 2 h - 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Pre and postglucose load (30, 60, 120 min) sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin were measured.

Obese women had fasting serum levels of sICAM-1 (p = .03), sVCAM-1 (p &<.0001) and sE-selectin (p = .047) higher than those of control women. Serum sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 levels were positively related to body mass index in the obese group. Serum adhesion molecules levels were no affected by a high glucose load.

Serum sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin levels are increased in obese women. A high glucose load is not associated with an increase in serum adhesion molecules levels.
