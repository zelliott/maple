A community health survey was conducted to describe the current health status and preventive health practices of National Guard military employees and their dependants residing in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia. In a cross-sectional survey in 2010, data were collected via a questionnaire interview and direct physical measurements. A total of 1339 adults aged 14 years completed the survey [mean age 30.7 (SD 12.7) years]. About two-thirds of the sample had problems of overweight and obesity, while 50% had high serum lipids and psychiatric disorders. Hypertension and diabetes were detected in 9.0% and 9.1% of the participants respectively and 15.8% were smokers. The rates of complete immunization and breastfeeding of children were 88.9% and 80.2% respectively and 21.7% of the women had ever used oral contraceptives. However, only 6.5% of the women had ever had a mammogram and 13.4% a cervical smear. The survey results provide a baseline from which to strengthen many oublic health nolicies and orogrammes.
