Studies exploring the impact of overweight on mortality have reported controversial results in dialysis patients; some have found overweight to increase mortality, whereas others suggest that it offers a survival advantage. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the impact of overweight on atherosclerotic events (AE) in dialysis patients with special respect to the malnutrition/inflammation complex syndrome (MICS).

Five hundred and forty-one hemodialysis patients from 11 dialysis centers in France were included. A number of baseline parameters including traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors were measured and the cohort was followed prospectively.

Over a mean follow-up of 39 months, 207 patients (38.3%) experienced an AE. Overweight, defined by a body mass index greater than 25 kg/m(2), was associated with increased risk of AEs [RR: 1.68 (CI: 1.11-3.56)], and CV mortality [RR: 1.51 (CI: 1.07-2.13)]. The effect of overweight was different in patients with and without MICS. Age, diabetes, a previous history of CV disease, high serum levels of homocysteine and MICS were also associated with an increased risk of AEs.

Similar to the general population, overweight contributes to an increased risk for AEs and CV mortality in hemodialysis patients. The presence or absence of MICS can modify the impact of overweight on development of AEs and mortality in this population.
