Many edentulous patients are "sick patients." Often geriatric considerations are involved, as well obesity and postmenopausal problems. These patients have deficient tissues on which to build dentures. The degenerative processes which initiate the loss of teeth continue after extraction and cause further shrinkage of supporting tissues. Repeated relining and rebuilding of dentures can be avoided and happier and healthier patients maintained by (1) saturating patients with therapeutic dosages of vitamins and minerals prior to surgical intervention, (2) using scientifically evaluated liquid and semisolid diets containing the maximum quantities of nutrients and the minimum number of calories during the preoperative and postoperative periods, and (3) thereafter maintaining the patient on a high-protein, high-vitamin, high-mineral diet.
