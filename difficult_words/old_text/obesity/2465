The available evidence concerning the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus suggests that although insulin antagonism is common to many patient groups (i.e., obese, older), overt NIDDM will only develop in a subset who may have a genetic susceptibility for inadequate beta-cell reserves. Since the role of a receptor defect in causing type 2 diabetes is doubtful, the insulin antagonism in these patients is due to a post-receptor defect.
