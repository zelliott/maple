The medical risks of obesity increase exponentially as weight increases, and these risks are reduced by sustained weight loss. Behavior modification and dieting provide an approximately 6% loss of body weight at 1 year. Fenfluramine provides an approximately 8% weight loss at 1 year, which can be doubled to 16% when a drug such as phentermine, which works through a different biochemical mechanism, is added to it. This amount of weight loss is insufficient for many severely obese individuals. It was with these facts in mind that the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference in 1992 recommended that obesity surgery is an appropriate treatment for patients with a body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2 who had failed in attempts at medical treatment and for patients with a body mass index greater than 35 kg/m2 with severe complications of obesity. Vertically banded gastroplasty and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are the two operations presently recommended because of their relative safety and effectiveness. This article reviews previous procedures that have provided insight into the mechanisms by which these surgeries cause weight loss. The presently used surgeries and their results also are reviewed because until medical therapy improves substantially, surgery remains the most reasonable treatment option for most morbidly obese patients.
