According to current views obesity especially with increased amount of visceral fat is characterized by prothrombogenic changes of hemostasis and fibrinolysis. This combined with insulin resistance, compensatory hyperinsulinemia, disturbances of carbohydrate metabolism, atherogenic dyslipidemia and hypertension substantially increases risk of origination and progression of cardiovascular diseases. Results of our study demonstrate high prevalence of various prothrombogenic abnormalities in coagulation and anticoagulation systems in patients with visceral obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS). Disturbances of hemostasis were detected by such screening methods as measurement of APTT, INR and concentration of fibrinogen in blood plasma. We received data on positive association of severity of some abnormalities of hemostasis with anthropometric and biochemical parameters of obesity and MS, parameters of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Revealed disturbances of hemostasis create prerequisites for development of thrombophilia and make additional contribution to increase of cardiovascular risk in this category of patients. This dictates necessity of more thorough and deepened examination of patients with visceral obesity and MS with the aim of detection and correction of pathological changes of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, system of hemostasis and fibrinolysis at earliest stages.
