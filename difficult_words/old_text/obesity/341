We sought to derive normative reference values for the thoracic great vessels using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in a healthy normotensive non-obese population free of cardiovascular disease.

Non-gated axial computed tomography (CT) of the chest has traditionally been used to evaluate normal great vessel anatomy for prognosis and management. However, non-gated axial chest CT cannot account for the obliquity, systolic expansion, and non-axial motion of the great vessels during the cardiac cycle and may misclassify patients as normal or abnormal for prognostic and management purposes. To date, normative reference values for double-oblique, short-axis great vessel diameters have not been established using current generation electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated 64-detector row MDCT. A total of 103 (43% women, age 51 +/- 14 years) consecutive normotensive, non-obese adults free of cardiopulmonary or great vessel structural disease, arrhythmias, or significant coronary artery disease were studied by MDCT. Individuals underwent examination for determination of end-diastolic (ED) pulmonary artery (PA) and superior vena cava (SVC) dimensions in double-oblique short axes for comparison with the ascending aorta and the right-sided cardiac chambers.

For right sided great vessels, the 5th to 95th interval was 1.89-3.03 cm for ED PA diameter and 1.08-4.42 cm(2) for SVC cross-sectional area. The pulmonary artery to ascending aortic (PA-to-Ao) ratio was 0.66-1.13. In multivariate analysis, the PA was significantly associated with weight, whereas the PA-to-Ao ratio was inversely associated with age. Axial PA measurements were significantly higher and PA-to-Ao measurements significantly lower than corresponding short axis measurements (P = .04 and P &<.001, respectively).

This study establishes ECG-gated MDCT reference values for right-sided great vessel dimensions derived from a healthy population of individuals free of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and obesity. The traditional axial PA-to-Ao discriminant value of 1 for pulmonary hypertension is a poor diagnostic tool because it encompasses normal patients and is negatively affected by age. Thoracic great vessels should be measured by CT in ECG-gated double-oblique short-axis for accurate quantitation. These data may serve as a reference to identify right-sided great vessel pathology in individuals being referred for ECG-gated MDCT imaging.
