To compare the effects of ezetimibe plus orlistat or rimonabant on anthropometric and lipid parameters in nondiabetic statin-intolerant overweight/obese patients with dyslipidemia.

Thirty participants received a hypocaloric diet and were randomized to open-label combination of ezetimibe (10 mg/day) with orlistat (120 mg, 3 times a day with meals; ezetimibe/orlistat [EO], n = 15) or rimonabant (20 mg/day; ezetimibe/rimonabant [ER], n = 15). Anthropometric and metabolic variables were assessed at baseline and 3 months posttreatment. Similar reductions in body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference were recorded in both groups (-8.3%, -8.6%, and -5.2% in the EO group and -7.3%, -7.2%, and -7.0% in the ER group, P &<.01 vs baseline for all). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels decreased in both treatment groups, but this reduction tended to be more pronounced in the EO group (28.4% vs 15.3%, respectively; P &<.01 vs baseline for both). Triglycerides tended to decrease more in the ER compared with the EO group (-20.4% vs -14.1%, P &<.01 vs baseline for both). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels tended to decrease in EO group, but remained unaltered with ER treatment. Apolipoprotein B levels were equally reduced in both treatment groups.

For similar body weight reduction, the combination of ezetimibe with orlistat may be more efficient in LDL-C lowering, whereas the combination of ezetimibe with rimonabant may be more potent in terms of improving HDL-C and triglycerides.
