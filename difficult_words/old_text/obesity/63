Subcutaneous and visceral fat distribution as related to sex, age, and overweight was studied in 130 subjects and 10 women with Cushing's disease. Fat depots were evaluated by computed tomography at one thoracic and one abdominal level. Adipose tissue (density range - 50 to 250 Hansfield units) was highlighted and the fat areas were measured by a laser planimeter. The ratio between subcutaneous and visceral fat areas (S:V ratio) was assumed as an index. Ratios of both nonobese and obese groups were significantly higher in females than in males. Ratios decreased markedly over age 60. There was a significant inverse correlation between age and S:V ratios in females (r = 0.65; p less than 0.001) and in males (r = 0.61; p less than 0.001). Statistically significant correlations were found between S:V ratios at thoracic and abdominal levels. In Cushing's patients, the S:V ratio at the abdominal level was significantly lower than in controls matched for age, sex, and body mass index.
