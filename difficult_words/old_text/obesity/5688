Study the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the list of patients of a general practitioner (GP).

Study cardiovascular risk factors of all patients of a family doctor.

Health Center.

All the patients of a GP appointment (n = 1143).

To study the clinic cards of all the patients of a GP appointment (n = 1143), in connection with the existence of cardiovascular risk factors: dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity, diabetes and lack of physical exercise. To study these factors by age groups, sex and its association.

From the 1143 patients, 62.8% showed at least one vascular risk factor; 14.9% two, 8.7% three, and 5% four or more. As a whole risks factors with more prevalence were obesity (26.5%), hypertension (24.5%), lack of exercise (24.1%), smoking (16.8%) dyslipidemia (12.7%) and diabetes (4.6%). The 1143 patients were 417 men and 726 women. Comparing sexes, obesity and lack of exercise were outstanding in women; smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia and the association of risk factors were more frequent in men. All risk factors increased with age.

From the present work we conclude that the majority of these patients appear to have at least one risk factor of cardiovascular disease and about a quarter association of risk factors. GP can and should take advantage of the privilege situation which occupies in terms of knowledge of its population to trace and if possible to control the present vascular risk factors.
