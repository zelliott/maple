The Asia-Pacific region contributes more than half the world population and includes some of the world richest and most developed countries alongside some of the world's poorest and least developed countries. Despite persisting levels of underweight in some countries, overweight and obesity have become a major public health concern for almost the entire region. Official levels of obesity ranges from over 80 % of the entire adult population of some Pacific nations to less than 3 % in the Philippines. There remains much debate about the most appropriate BMI cut points to define the overweight and obesity in Asian populations and thus the true levels of obesity are likely to higher in most Asian countries. The causes of this rapid increase in overweight within the region are likely to be complex. However, rapid development leading to a shift away from traditional diets to an eating pattern containing more high fat, high energy foods and drinks together with a significant reduction in physical activity through shifts in occupational and recreational patterns is likely to be major contributors to the problem. This weight gain has been associated with an epidemic of chronic diseases such diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancers which is threatening to overwhelm the health care systems of less developed countries and results in an enormous, health, social and economic burden to the region.
