Some controversy exists in the literature concerning the effects of leptin on bone metabolism. Thus we have compared femoral bone density and biochemical markers of bone metabolism in male and female fatty (leptin-resistant) Zucker rats and their lean homozygous controls at 3 and 6 months of age. At 3 months, no differences concerning total, diaphyseal (cortical bone), and distal metaphyseal (trabecular bone) femoral bone densities, plasma osteocalcin concentrations, and urinary deoxypyridinoline excretion were observed between fatty and lean rats. On the opposite, at 6 months of age, in both males and females, total, diaphyseal, and distal metaphyseal femoral bone densities and plasma osteocalcin concentrations were lower in Zucker than in lean rats. Soybean isoflavone consumption (40 microg/g body weight/day for 90 days, a dose which prevents osteopenia following ovariectomy both in lean Zucker homozygous controls and in Wistar rats) by obese female Zucker rats had no significant effect upon their bone mass.
