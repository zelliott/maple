Obesity treatment effects are difficult to maintain on a long course, especially when patients also suffer from an eating disorder. Confronted with this statement, authors were interested in the use of new technologies to enhance the treatment palette at disposal. A self-treatment for bulimia nervosa on the Internet as well as a system of relapse prevention using Telephone-Linked Care (TLC) technology for obese patients after a weightloss have already been evaluated with success. A new self-treatment program for people suffering from compulsive eating disorders was developed and implemented on the Internet. It contains eleven steps based on cognitive and behavioural therapy and has to be done under a psychologist's supervision.
