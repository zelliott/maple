Obesity has been associated with increased bone mineral density (BMD). There is evidence of differential effect of regional fat on BMD. Hence, we undertook this study to evaluate the correlation between total body fat and its distribution with BMD in nonobese (mean body mass index: 25.0 ± 4.7 kg/m²) Indian adult volunteers. A total of 2347 participants (men: 39.4% and women: 60.6%) included in this cross-sectional study were divided according to sex and age. Fasting blood samples were drawn for biochemical parameters. Percent total body, truncal, and leg fat and BMD at lumbar spine, femur, and forearm were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The BMD at all sites (radius, femur, and spine) increased from lowest to highest quartiles of percent body fat. Percent truncal fat was positively correlated with BMD at all sites in both sexes, except for femoral neck in men, where it had negative correlation. Percent leg fat was positively related with BMD at all sites in premenopausal women, and spine and radius BMD in postmenopausal women. However, in men, it had negative correlation with femoral neck BMD. On multiple regression analysis, regional fat had positive association with BMD at all sites after adjusting for age, sex, lean mass index, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and intact parathyroid hormone levels. Leg-to-total body fat ratio was negatively associated with BMD at all sites in men and pre- and postmenopausal women. Percent total body and regional fat have positive association with BMD at all sites in men and women.
