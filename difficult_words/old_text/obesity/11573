To determine the effects on weight loss of feeding isonitrogenous diets in mildly restricted (4.2 MJ/d) and severely restricted (2.1 MJ/d) amounts, we measured body composition, weight loss-energy deficit ratio, and nitrogen metabolism in 14 obese women housed in a metabolic ward consuming hypoenergetic diets for 21 d. Subjects consumed either a 4.2-MJ/d diet (50 g protein, 175 g carbohydrate) or a 2.1-MJ/d diet (50 g protein, 75 g carbohydrate). Body composition and leucine oxidation and turnover were determined before and after weight loss. Energy deficit was calculated from resting metabolic rates. Subjects fed the 2.1-MJ/d diet showed a greater weight loss (6.1 +/- 0.5 vs 4.5 +/- 0.5 kg; mean +/- SE, P less than 0.05) and fat loss (3.9 +/- 0.3 vs 3.0 +/- 0.3 kg, P less than 0.05). Weight loss-energy deficit ratio was the same with both diets. Nitrogen balance and leucine oxidation and turnover were similar in both groups. We conclude that with feeding of isonitrogenous hypoenergetic diets, severe restriction of energy content (2.1 MJ/d, 75 g carbohydrate) will enhance weight and fat loss without increasing nitrogen loss compared with mild restriction of energy (4.2 MJ/d).
