Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium in patients 40 years of age or younger is rare and accounts for 2.9% of all endometrial cancers diagnosed in the study community. However, the diagnosis of malignancy was confirmed in only 32 of 54 patients (59.2%) with pathologic material available for review. None of the 32 patients had Stein-Leventhal syndrome or was receiving sequential oral contraceptives. Obesity was found in only 37.5%, nulligravidity in 37.5%, and hypertension in 25%. In 81%, the presenting symptom was abnormal vaginal bleeding, and 6 patients (19%) had coexisting ovarian neoplasms (4 endometrioid carcinomas, 1 mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, and 1 adenocarcinoma arising in a cystic teratoma). Atypical endometrial hyperplasia, previously interpreted as well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, was diagnosed in 11 of 22 patients. The pathologic criteria for establishing a diagnosis of atypical endometrial hyperplasia and distinguishing it from well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the endometrium are emphasized. Thirteen of 32 patients received no radiation therapy and none developed pelvic recurrence or metastatic tumor. The 2 deaths from tumor were in patients with stage 3 ovarian cancer, and no patients died of endometrial carcinoma. The current policy is to treat patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (clinical stage I, pathology confirmed) by hysterectomy without irradiation treatment. Because of 6 of the 32 patients (19%) had coexisting ovarian neoplasms, careful examination of the adnexa at the time of clinical staging is emphasized.
