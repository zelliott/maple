Obesity in childhood often leads to obesity in adulthood, with the resulting potential risks to health. It has been suggested that in some cases, obesity develops because of a reduction in energy expenditure rather than excessive energy intake. While it is possible that this mechanism contributes to the development of obesity in specific cases, there is little evidence to suggest that it is an important contributory factor in the general population.
