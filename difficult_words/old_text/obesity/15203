Prostate problems, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatic  intra-epithelial neoplasia, prostatitis, and prostate cancer have been  recognized as problems largely related to androgens and genetic factors. They  affect a large fraction of the elderly population, contributing significantly  to morbidity and mortality. Estrogen has also now been recognized as one of  the important regulators of prostate growth. Diet, general health, and obesity  were disregarded as the causative or complicating factors until very recently.  Increasing episodes of prostate problems, complications in overweight/obese  individuals, or both have attracted attention toward these contemporary risk  factors. Prostate problems are reportedly less frequent or less severe in  areas in which a plant-based diet is predominant. Consumption of certain fatty  acids, particularly of animal origin, has been correlated with increased  prostate problems. As adipose tissue is increasingly being regarded as  hormonally active tissue, high body fat and obesity need in-depth exploration  to understand the associated risk of prostate problems. Adipose tissue is now  known to affect circulating levels of several bioactive messengers and  therefore could affect the risk of developing prostate problems in addition to  several other well-recognized health problems. Nevertheless, increased plasma  volume, excess tissue growth, and fat deposition could affect resection and  number of biopsies required, thus adding further complications because of a  delayed diagnosis. In short, evidence is gathering to support the influence of  diet and obesity on prostate health. In this review article, we have tried to  make this connection more apparent using supporting published data.
