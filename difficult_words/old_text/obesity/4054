This study investigates the prevalence of obesity among the high risk individuals (those obese and those likely to become obese) in selected towns in Anambra State, Nigeria. Two hundred and four subjects were investigated. One hundred thirty-one were men between the ages of 30 and 60 years and others were women between the ages of 20 and 55 years. Data were collected by means of questionnaire; anthropometric measurements; and a 24-hour period dietary recall. Results of anthropometric measurements showed 78.12% of business executives, 58.82% of market women, 54.29% of chiefs and 40.58% of top civil servants were 20% above desirable weight for age. The prevalence of obesity was higher in women than men. In men the incidence of obesity appears to be inversely proportional to age. In women, it is directly proportional to age.
