We reviewed our experience with 3 operative techniques for abdominal panniculectomies to determine differences in complication rates and levels of patient satisfaction.

This retrospective study included 92 consecutive patients who underwent abdominal panniculectomies over a 9-year period. Patients underwent one of 3 panniculectomy techniques: fleur-de-lis (n = 25), transverse incisions with minimal undermining (n = 30), or transverse incisions with extensive undermining (n = 37). Postoperatively, patient satisfaction surveys were completed.

Median pannus weight was 4.4 kg (range, 1.6-20.5). Sixty-eight patients (73.9%) had a previous gastric bypass. Median body mass index (BMI) was 38 kg/m2 (range, 22-66.9). Median follow-up for complications was 8.1 week (range, 1-235). Forty of 92 patients (43%) suffered wound complications. The reoperation rate was 13%. Postoperative complication rates were higher among hypertensive patients (61% vs. 36%; P = 0.04). There was a trend towards increased complications among those with higher BMI and pannus weights. There was not a significant relationship between operative technique and overall complication rate. Mean length of follow-up for patient questionnaire completion was 2 years, 11 months (range, 1-9 years). Eighty-one percent of those responding to the mailed questionnaire were satisfied with their operative results. There were no statistically significant differences between the technique used and patient satisfaction level. Concomitant hernia repair was performed in 47% of patients without increased wound complications.

Patients were satisfied with the results of their panniculectomy, although complications were common. Higher BMI, larger pannus size, and hypertension were correlated with increased complication rates. The minimal undermining, extensive undermining, and the fleur-de-lis panniculectomy techniques result in similar patient satisfaction rates and complication rates.
