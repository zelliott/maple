1. Japanese sumo wrestlers have a diet rich in energy, which results in marked obesity. Their plasma urate and triglyceride levels were significantly elevated. 2. Erythrocyte phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) and ATP concentrations in sumo wrestlers were significantly elevated when compared to the levels in control subjects. 3. There were no significant differences in erythrocyte PRPP synthetase (EC 2.7.6.1), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.1) and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (EC 2.4.2.8) activities between sumo wrestlers and control subjects. 4. Erythrocyte adenosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.20), adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4) and adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (EC 2.4.2.7) activities in sumo wrestlers were significantly elevated. 5. It seems that sumo wrestlers have an increased turnover of adenine nucleotides which may contribute to hyperuricaemia.
