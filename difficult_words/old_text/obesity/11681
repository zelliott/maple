Active left ventricular relaxation, assessed by Doppler isovolumic relaxation time, is impaired in obesity. There is little information on left ventricular passive properties during filling.

To evaluate left ventricular late diastolic stiffness in obesity, Doppler echocardiographic interrogation of mitral inflow tract and pulmonary vein flow velocities were obtained from 47 normotensive, young obese subjects (11 males, 36 females) and 43 normotensive, young normal-weight volunteers (13 males, 30 females) of comparable age.

After controlling the effect of blood pressure and left ventricular mass, isovolumic relaxation time was prolonged in obese subjects (p &<0.0001 vs normal-weight controls). No difference was found in transmitral peak early and late flow velocities. Obese subjects exhibited prolonged pulmonary vein reverse flow velocity during atrial contraction (p &<0.004), and a higher difference or ratio between duration of pulmonary reverse flow and duration of transmitral forward late flow (6 +/- 31 vs -20 +/- 39 ms or 1.06 +/- 0.3 vs 0.84 +/- 0.3, p &<0.002 and p &<0.001, respectively). These differences were also confirmed after controlling blood pressure and left ventricular mass. Non-invasively estimated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was higher in obese subjects than in controls (p &<0.002). At multivariate analysis a higher body mass index was the sole predictor of prolonged difference between duration of pulmonary reverse flow and duration of transmitral forward late flow (beta = 0.38, p &<0.001).

Obesity is associated with prolonged left ventricular active relaxation and abnormalities of filling pressure not detectable by the sole mitral inflow velocity pattern. These latter abnormalities are consistent with the presence of early increased left ventricular passive stiffness.
