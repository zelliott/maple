Causal relationships between the use of oral contraceptives (OCs) and cardiovascular complications are ascertained to date.  Severe or fatal complications, however, are very rare events.  Predispositions in nearly every fatal case can be found more often by retrospective analysis than by prospective data.  Profiles of the risk patient for OC use can be described:  obese women, age over 40, long duration of OC use, severe smoking habits, hypertension, juvenile diabetes, hypercholesterinemia, anamnestic data of arterial as well as venous vascular disorders, altered low density lipoprotein/high density lipoprotein ratio, the latter being probably more influenced by progestins than by the estrogen content of the pill.  The repeated control of laboratory parameters may be useful, but more efficient are anamnestic and clinical data evaluated by the prescribing physician.  (author's)
