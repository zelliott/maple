More than ever before, physicians and patients alike are aware of the benefits of regular exercise. The involved physician must be able to prescribe individualized programs (e. g., for the post-MI patient) and to recognize side effects that may arise. Exercise is rarely ineffective as therapy: however, the potential for noncompliance is great unless the patient is motivated to begin at an appropriate level.
