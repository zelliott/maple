An attempt was made to give a clinical interpretation of the data on the pathogenesis of hypertensive disease by generalizing the experience available in the diagnosis and differential treatment of patients with various arterial hypertensions. The findings from epidemiological studies into essential hypertension and associated cardiovascular complications and death were also used. Ways and prospects for preventing hypertensions and actions to minimize the influence of risk factors were assessed to successfully manage and prevent the complications in hypertensive patients.
