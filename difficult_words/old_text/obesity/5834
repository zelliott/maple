to investigate cytokine profile in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with different degree of obesity. 154 patients with type 2 DM were examined (55.2% women, 44.8% men). All patients received standard antihyperglycemic therapy; mean age was 46.1 +/- 0.82 years, mean duration of disease was 7.2 +/- 1.43 years. The patients were divided into the following groups according to their degree of obesity: grade I obesity (n = 50), grade II obesity (n = 51), grade III obesity (n = 53). 18 healthy volunteers (38.9% men, 61.1% women, mean age 41.2 +/- 3.2 years, BMI - 22.1 +/- 1.8 kg/m2). The patients and healthy volunteers were underwent biochemical analysis, determination of the cytokine profile and estimation of TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-4, TGF-beta1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. It has been shown that increase of the body weight excess in patients with type 2 DM and obesity is accompanied with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1, TGF-beta1) along with the reduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-4). The TNF-alpha concentration in patients with grade I obesity was 2,8 fold higher than in the comparison group, in patients with grade II and III - 4 and 5,7 fold respectively. A similar trend occurred in TGF-beta1 level: 2 fold increase--when I obesity, 3,3 and 4 fold--respectively for grade II and III. Unidirectional dynamic changes of IL-1 in patients with type 2 diabetes reflects 1,3 fold increase in its level under obesity I grade, 1,7 fold--under II degree and 2,2 fold--under III degree compared to the level in the comparison group. IL-4 level in patients with diabetes and obesity is strikingly contrasted with the index of the comparison group and progressively reduced: 1,7 fold--when grade I obesity, 3,6 fold- with grade II, 7,7 fold--in the grade III. The data obtained indicates that cytokine profile play a critical part in pathogenesis of type 2 DM in association with obesity.
