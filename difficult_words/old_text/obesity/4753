The US is facing an obesity epidemic. Recognizing the biomarkers associated with adipose tissue may impact physicians' management of cardiometabolic disease greatly. EVIDENCE OF ACQUISITION: We searched PubMed for keywords 'obesity', 'leptin', and 'adiponectin', reviewed national surveys, and searched reference articles used in review articles retrieved via the PubMed search. We included articles with multiple relevant citations. Observational data acquired from two sources, not previously published, were also used to support our conclusion.

Literature review and analysis of observational data showed that the level of leptin increases with the increase in weight gain, while adiponectin decreases. The roles of these adipokines in the body have been defined. With the increase in leptin levels, the incidence and prevalence of the components of the metabolic syndrome were seen to be higher, resulting in higher cardiovascular disease, while adiponectin was seen to play a more protective role in the body against developing such disease.

Measuring circulating levels of leptin and adiponectin as a screening tool may help recognize those individuals who do not only have obesity as a major risk factor toward developing cardiometabolic disease but also may have an unfavorable 'biomarker profile', putting them at highest risk. This may encourage the mobilization of resources to help these individuals lose weight rapidly with possibly aggressive measures such as bariatric surgery.
