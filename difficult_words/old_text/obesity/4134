Recently, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending to grant a marketing authorization for liraglutide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Liraglutide is the first human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog, based on the structure of native GLP-1, with pharmacokinetic properties suitable for once-daily dosing. In the phase III Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes (LEAD) program, liraglutide has been shown to lower glycated hemoglobin to the same extent or more than other antidiabetic drugs including insulin. Liraglutide determines favorable changes in the global cardiovascular risk profile because its use is associated with weight loss, blood pressure reduction, as well as improvements of several cardiovascular risk biomarkers. Liraglutide is generally well tolerated, the most frequently reported adverse effect is transient nausea, and it does not seems to have significant interactions with medications commonly used for cardiovascular prevention. This article reviews, for the practicing cardiologist, the results of the LEAD program and explores liraglutide potentials for cardiovascular prevention in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
