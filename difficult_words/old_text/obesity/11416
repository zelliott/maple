We have previously shown that sex and obesity independently affect basal very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride (TG) kinetics. In the present study, we investigated the effect of hyperglycemia-hyperinsulinemia on VLDL-TG kinetics in lean and obese men and women (n = 6 in each group). VLDL-TG kinetics were measured during basal, postabsorptive conditions and during glucose infusion (5.5 mg x kg FFM(-1) x min(-1)) by using [(2)H(5)]glycerol bolus injection in conjunction with compartmental modeling analysis. Basal VLDL-TG secretion in plasma was greater in obese than in lean men (7.8 +/- 0.6 and 2.9 +/- 0.4 micromol x l plasma(-1) x min(-1); P &<0.001) but was not different in lean and obese women (5.0 +/- 1.1 and 5.9 +/- 1.1 micromol x l plasma(-1) x min(-1)). Glucose infusion decreased the VLDL-TG secretion rate by approximately 50% in lean and obese men and in lean women (to 1.5 +/- 0.4, 4.0 +/- 0.6, and 2.2 +/- 0.4 micromol x l plasma(-1) x min(-1), respectively; all P &<0.05) but had no effect on the VLDL-TG secretion rate in obese women (4.9 +/- 1.0 micromol x l plasma(-1) x min(-1)). These results demonstrate that both sex and adiposity affect the regulation of VLDL-TG metabolism. Glucose and insulin decrease VLDL-TG production in both lean men and lean women; obesity is associated with resistance to the glucose- and insulin-mediated suppression of VLDL-TG secretion in women, but not in men.
