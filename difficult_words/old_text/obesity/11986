Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ contributing to the regulation of multiple metabolic pathways via self-produced bioactive products called adipokines. These adipokines are key players in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. Co-occurrence of obesity and psoriasis could lead to interactions of both diseases in which adipokines, at least in part, are involved and may contribute to associated comorbidities of psoriasis. Until today numerous adipokines have been identified of which the most important ones are discussed in the following within the context of obesity, chronic inflammation and their possible role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Adipokines could serve as a missing link in the causal relationship between psoriasis and comorbidities and may provide a biomarker for disease severity, risk of comorbidities and treatment success.
