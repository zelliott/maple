Caring for patients with cirrhosis requires special consideration. The role of the hepatologist is to assist the primary care physician in caring for such patients. This involves an active role in immunizations, lifestyle modifications, and providing instructions on when to go to the emergency room (ER). There are also specific recommendations geared toward the patient with cirrhosis relating to slowing down the disease process, maintaining quality of life, and improving survival.
