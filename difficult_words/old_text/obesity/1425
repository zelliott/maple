The results of a 4-week summer camp for childhood obesity were reported. Twenty-one children with moderate to severe obesity, aged between 8-13 years, joined the program. Dietary restriction during the official hours and dietary self-control at home were implemented throughout the program. Exercise, swimming and group therapy were also implemented throughout the program. Weekly sight-seeing outside the camp was very interesting for the participants. After the program, all participants had lost weight which was about 5 per cent of their initial weight. Most of the weight loss was due to loss of body fat but not lean body mass. No complications occurred during the program. The 4-week summer camp is then practical for initiating weight loss for obese children. Long-term follow-up which is underway will be reported later.
