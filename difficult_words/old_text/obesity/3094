Exocrine pancreatic function insufficiency, even of short duration, has been reported in juvenile-onset insulin dependent diabetic patients. To evaluate the status of pancreatic acini under decreased B-cell function, tissue insulin, amylase, chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen in the pancreas were measured in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and non-obese diabetic mice in various conditions. In streptozotocin diabetic rats, a dissociation of three enzyme contents was demonstrated in the condition with discontinuation of insulin injection, i.e., a marked decrease in amylase, a significant increase in chymotrypsinogen, but no significant change in trypsinogen. This dissociation was markedly improved in the insulin-treated condition. In non-obese diabetic mice, these enzyme contents were not significantly changed although severe insulitis together with the marked decrease in insulin content was observed. These data show that the cessation of B-cell function alone does not cause insufficiency of exocrine pancreas.
