Current guidelines from the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommend first-line treatment with a thiazide diuretic but do not provide specific guidance for obese patients. The renin system is activated in obesity-associated arterial hypertension. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the oral direct renin inhibitor aliskiren could provide additive blood pressure lowering in obese patients with hypertension (body mass index&>or=30 kg/m(2); mean sitting diastolic blood pressure: 95 to 109 mm Hg) who had not responded to 4 weeks of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg. After a 2- to 4-week washout, 560 patients received single-blind HCTZ (25 mg) for 4 weeks; 489 nonresponders were randomly assigned to double-blind aliskiren (150 mg), irbesartan (150 mg), amlodipine (5 mg), or placebo for 4 weeks added to HCTZ (25 mg), followed by 8 weeks on double the initial doses of aliskiren, irbesartan, or amlodipine. After 8 weeks of double-blind treatment (4 weeks on the higher dose), aliskiren/HCTZ lowered blood pressure by 15.8/11.9 mm Hg, significantly more (P&<.0001) than placebo/HCTZ (8.6/7.9 mm Hg). Aliskiren/HCTZ provided blood pressure reductions similar to those with irbesartan/HCTZ and amlodipine/HCTZ (15.4/11.3 and 13.6/10.3 mm Hg, respectively), with similar tolerability to placebo/HCTZ. Adverse event rates were highest with amlodipine/HCTZ because of a higher incidence of peripheral edema (11.1% versus 0.8% to 1.6% in other groups). In conclusion, combination treatment with aliskiren is a highly effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option for obese patients with hypertension who fail to achieve blood pressure control with first-line thiazide diuretic treatment.
