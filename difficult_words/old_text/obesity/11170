Resistin and visfatin have been proposed as playing a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. We assessed the relationship between their serum concentrations and insulin resistance in lean, obese diabetic and obese non-diabetic. We explore their relationship with inflammatory markers and anthropometric parameters in obese patients. We measured serum resistin, visfatin levels in obese diabetic, obese nondiabetic patients and in lean subjects. The concentrations of serum resistin showed significant differences among the three groups. Higher levels of visfatin occurred in obese diabetic and non diabetic compared to lean subjects. Higher levels for HOMA-IR occurred in obese diabetic and non diabetic compared to lean subjects. Resistin correlated positively with insulin, HOMA-IR and with hs-CRP in obese diabetic subjects. Visfatin correlated positively with insulin and HOMA-IR in obese diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Resistin might be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Additionally, IL-18 might be a predictor of insulin resistance.
