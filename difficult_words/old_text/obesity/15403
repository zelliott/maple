The importance of traditional coronary artery disease risk factors in the development of coronary heart disease is well known. African Americans have a higher prevalence of such risk factors as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cigarette smoking, and left ventricular hypertrophy, which might account for the disproportionate rate of coronary heart disease mortality in African Americans. Compelling data from randomized lipid-lowering trials show conclusively that lowering cholesterol levels, specifically low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lowers coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality. Recent data has also demonstrated the beneficial effects of lowering blood pressure on cardiovascular mortality. Left ventricular hypertrophy, which results from elevated blood pressure, seems to raise coronary heart disease risks independently. Diabetes mellitus, cigarette use, physical inactivity, stress, and obesity play critical roles collectively and individually in increasing coronary heart disease, morbidity, and mortality. Clustering of coronary heart disease risk factors in African Americans must be strongly considered to play a critical role in the excess mortality from coronary heart disease seen in African Americans. New innovative approaches are required if the course of coronary heart disease is to be altered.
