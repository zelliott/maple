Lactating rats made obese before conception by feeding high energy foods show a decreased rate of lipogenesis in vivo in mammary gland, but not in liver. Obese lactating rats have an increased hepatic fat content, together with moderate increase in blood ketone bodies. It is suggested that these changes are due to mobilization during lactation of the expanded adipose tissue lipid pool in the obese rats which results in overloading the liver with fatty acids. The concomitant increase in ketone body concentrations may inhibit glucose utilization and hence lipogenesis in the lactating mammary gland of obese rats.
