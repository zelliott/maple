The melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) is a member of family A rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors. Mouse genetic studies suggested that MC3R and the related MC4R are non-redundant regulators of energy homeostasis. Lack of Mc3r leads to higher feed efficiency and fat mass. However, until now only a few MC3R mutations have been identified in humans and the role of MC3R in the pathogenesis of obesity was unclear. In the present study, we performed detailed functional studies on nine naturally occurring MC3R mutations recently reported. We found that all nine mutants had decreased cell surface expression. A260V, M275T, and L297V had decreased total expression whereas the other six mutants had normal total expression. Mutants S69C and T280S exhibited significant defects in ligand binding and signaling. The dramatic defects of T280S might be partially caused by decreased cell surface expression. In addition, we found mutants M134I and M275T had decreased maximal binding but displayed similar signaling properties as wild-type MC3R. All the other mutants had normal binding and signaling activities. Co-expression studies showed that all mutants except L297V did not affect wild-type MC3R signaling. Multiple mutations at T280 demonstrated the necessity of Thr for cell surface expression, ligand binding, and signaling. In summary, we provided detailed data of these novel human MC3R mutations leading to a better understanding of structure-function relationship of MC3R and the role of MC3R mutation in obesity.
