Obesity is associated with an altered inflammatory and extracellular matrix (ECM) profile. Tenascin C (TNC) is an ECM glycoprotein with proinflammatory effects.

We aimed to explore the expression levels of TNC in adipose tissue analyzing the contribution of adipocytes and stromovascular fraction cells (SVFC) as well as its impact on inflammation and ECM regulation. We also analyzed the effect of the stimulation with TNF-α and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on both SVFC and adipocytes.

Samples obtained from 75 subjects were used in the study. Expression levels of TNC, TLR4, MMP2, and MMP9 were analyzed in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) as well as in both adipocytes and SVFC. In addition, Tnc expression was measured in two mice models of obesity.

We show, for the first time, that VAT expression levels of TNC are increased in normoglycemic and type 2 diabetic obese patients (P&<.01) as well as in obese patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (P&<.01). Furthermore, expression levels of Tnc in epididymal adipose tissue from two different mice models of obesity were significantly increased (P&<.01). TNC and TLR4 were mainly expressed by SVFC, and its expression was significantly enhanced (P&<.01) by TNF-α treatment. LPS treatment also increased mRNA levels of TNC. Moreover, the addition of exogenous TNC induced (P&<.05) TLR4 and CCL2 mRNA expression in human adipocyte cultures.

These findings indicate that TNC is involved in the etiopathology of obesity via visceral adipose tissue inflammation representing a link with ECM remodeling.
