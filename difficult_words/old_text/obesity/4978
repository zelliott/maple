To examine the effect of fasting during Ramadan on certain serum components such as fasting serum glucose (FSG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), high density lipoproteins (HDL-C), and low density lipoproteins (LDL-C) parameters in obese women patients with type 2 diabetes.

We conducted the study in Petit-Vichy Diabetology Center, Sidi-Bel-Abbes, Algeria from October 2003 to March 2004, on 60 obese outpatient women (BMI = 35.41 +/- 3.64 kg/m2), aged 51 +/- 10 years, who had diabetes for 5 +/- 2.5 years. The patients followed no specific diet, on medications, and presenting no degenerative complications. We carried out the study over 3 periods: before (pre-fasting), during (fasting), and after Ramadan month (post-fasting).

Comparing Ramadan (fasting period) with non-Ramadan days (pre- and post-fasting periods), we observed significant decreases in FSG (16.72%, p&<.001), in HbA1c (11.3%, p&<.005), and in HDL-C (26.81%, p&<.001) rates, while TC (13.85%, p&<.001), TGs (16.9%, p&<.003), and the LDL-C (22.39%, p&<.0001) levels increased significantly.

These findings show a beneficial effect of fasting during Ramadan on glucose homeostasis, however, we observed an unbalanced profile on lipids.
