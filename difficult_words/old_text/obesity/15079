The goal of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a manualized cognitive-behavioral therapeutic (CBT) approach for patients with obesity and binge eating disorder (BED) on the short and longer term. A prospective study without a control group consisting of three measurements (a baseline measurement and two follow-up assessments up to 5 years after the start of the CBT treatment) was used. A total of 56 patients with obesity and BED (age = 39.7 ± 10-9 years; body mass index [BMI] = 38.5 ± 8.3 kg/m(2)) participated in the study. BMI, number of binges per week, general psychological well-being, mood, attitude toward one's body, and loss of control over the eating behavior were evaluated by means of mixed models. Results indicate that a CBT approach offered 1 day a week during an average 7 months produces benefits on eating behaviors, weight, and psychological parameters that are durable up to 3.5 years post treatment.
