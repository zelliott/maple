Hyperuricemia is often associated with obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia, and is thought to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, thereby making resemblance to the insulin resistance syndrome. Our data showed a low, but significant correlation between serum uric acid concentration and the degree of insulin resistance (GIR) estimated by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp method in 67 subjects with combined normal glucose tolerance and IGT(r = -0.278, p &<0.05). Plasma HDL-C and TG levels were also correlated with uric acid levels. One hundred sixty NIDDM patients who had undergone the clamp study were stratified into 5 groups according to the serum uric acid level. In the top quintile (UA : 7.8 +/- 0.8 mg/dl), BMI, male prevalence, plasma TG, HDL-C, fasting IRI, and total IRI response(0 + 60 + 120 min) during meal tolerance test were significantly higher, while age and GIR value tended to be lower without significance compared with those in the bottom quintile (UA : 3.4 +/- 0.5 mg/dl). These results, which are in agreement with the previous studies, support the notion that elevated serum uric acid is a feature of insulin resistance syndrome.
