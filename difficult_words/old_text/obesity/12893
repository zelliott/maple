PAI-1 levels are closely associated with insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, including patients with obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Clinical studies demonstrated PAI-1 correlations with insulin (IRI), triglycerides (TG) and body mass index (BMI) values, but these relations have not been confirmed in all studies. In obesity PAI-1 levels correlate with IRI and BMI in the relation to increased adipocyte PAI-1 production, which is dependent on stimulative insulin action. In the case of endothelial hyperproduction in patients with IR elevated PAI-1 levels correlate with TG values. Insulin inhibits induced endothelial PAI-1 production. PAI-1 levels in patients with IR represent cumulative production in described tissues.
