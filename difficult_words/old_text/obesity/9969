The relationship between insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia on one hand and hypertension on the other hand has become apparent during the last few years. Insulin resistance, which may be genetically determined, is, according to our present understanding, the 'key player' in the metabolic syndrome. However, the pathophysiology of the combination of factors has not yet been fully elucidated. Early therapeutic intervention for insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and hypertension may prevent the clinical manifestation of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes. Preliminary results of an ongoing study investigating the effects of trandolapril or the diuretic combination of hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene on serum glucose and insulin levels are presented.
