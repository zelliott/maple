We previously described a putative role for inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, in lipid accumulation. Here we present data which demonstrate that IMPDH activity is required for differentiation of preadipocytes into mature, lipid-laden adipocytes and maintenance of adipose tissue mass. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes inhibition of IMPDH with mycophenolic acid (MPA) reduced intracellular GTP levels by 60% (p&<.05) and blocked adipogenesis (p&<.05). Co-treatment with guanosine, a substrate in the salvage pathway of nucleotide biosynthesis, restored GTP levels and adipogenesis demonstrating the specificity of these effects. Treatment of diet-induced obese mice with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the prodrug of MPA, for 28 days did not affect food intake or lean body mass but reduced body fat content (by 36%, p=0.002) and adipocyte size (p=0.03) and number. These data suggest that inhibition of IMPDH may represent a novel strategy to reduce adipose tissue mass.
