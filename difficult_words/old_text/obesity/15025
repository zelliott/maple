To investigate the effects of obesity and exercise training on plasma adipocytokines a sample of 42 children (lean = 24, %BF = 17.8 ± 7.5%; obese = 18; %BF = 29.1 ± 9.3%; mean age = 12.4 ± 1.9 yrs), were divided into 4 age-matched for activity groups: lean inactive (n = 11), obese inactive (n = 9), lean active (n = 13) and obese active (n = 9). Active children participated in swimming training (≥1 year, ≥3 times/week, ≥1 h per session, covering a distance of 10,000-12,000 m per week).Obese individuals demonstrated greater visfatin levels (3.3 ± 1.3 ng/ml) than their lean counterparts (2.6 ± 1.1 ng/ml; p = .06) whereas adiponectin was significantly lower in obese children (3.8 ± 1.9) than their lean counterparts (5.9 ± 2.7; p £ .05). Insulin and HOMA values were significantly greater in obese compared with lean children (p £ .05). Within obese individuals, active individuals had significantly lower visfatin levels (2.8 ± 1.2 ng/ml) compared with their inactive counterparts (3.8 ± 1.2 ng/ml; p £ .05). Resistin levels were comparable between groups (p&> .05). Childhood obesity elevates visfatin and lowers adiponectin levels whereas exercise training could reduce visfatin levels in obese children.
