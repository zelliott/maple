The objective of the study was to identify the prevalence of obesity and dyslipidaemia in primary care physicians.

A cross-sectional study was carried out in 775 primary care physicians (301 men and 474 women), self-described as healthy. Waist circumference was measured and body mass index was calculated. Glucose concentration and lipid profile (total, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and triglycerides) were measured.

Of 775 physicians, 63.3% were overweight or obese. There were significant differences in waist circumference (P &<0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P &<0.001) and triglyceride concentrations (P &<0.001) when the population of physicians was divided in accordance with the body mass index categories. Waist circumference was considered as a risk in 78.9% of physicians. At least one abnormality in the lipid profile was observed in 90.9% of the total subjects studied. Impaired fasting glucose was found in 2.1% of the population.

In Mexico the prevalence of obesity and dyslipidaemia in primary care physicians was higher than expected.
