The article deals with reflections about the differential indication for out-patient group therapy treatment of patients suffering from a considerable overweight by the example of the "Interdisciplinary therapy of obesity". First the conception of the "Interdisciplinary therapy of obesity" is presented. Within the context of evaluation of the therapy program, especially the results of a long-term follow-up study and the special conditions for severely obese people are dealt with. Empirical results and clinical experiences build the foundations to work out differential indication criteria like therapy motivation, degree of overweight and degree of psychological strain. On this basis modifications of the therapy program are suggested in the form of three different kinds of treatment, taking into account the clinically different groups of obese people.
