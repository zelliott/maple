The aim of this study is to investigate whether abdominal aorta intima media thickness (aIMT), increases in obese children and to determine risk factors. Ninety-six children aged 5-16 (51 obese and 45 non-obese) were enrolled in this prospective and cross-sectional study. Age, gender, and relative body mass index (BMI) were recorded. Their serum lipids, thyrotropin, fasting glucose and insulin levels were analyzed. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) score was calculated for insulin resistance. Anthropometric and biochemical data were assessed along with aIMT. Findings in obese children were compared with those of non-obese control subjects. The aIMT was significantly greater in obese children. Similar trends were observed in both prepubertal children and adolescents. In obese children, the mean aIMT (mm) was 0.021 (years of age) +0.519. In non-obese children, the mean aIMT (mm) was 0.017 (years of age) +0.381. Our data suggests a relationship between glucose metabolism and aIMT in obese children. BMI was an independent risk factor for increasing aIMT. In conclusion, when compared with non-obese controls, obese children demonstrated significantly increased aIMT. Higher BMI, insulin, HOMA-IR and increased systolic blood pressure seem to be the main factors contributing to increased aIMT and risk for developing vascular disease. Childhood obesity contributes to the development of an increased aIMT.
