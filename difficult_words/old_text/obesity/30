Endometrial carcinoma is found more frequently in obese subjects. In this study, we evaluated the comparative risks of endometrial cancer relative to obesity indices calculated using the Brocas coefficient. From 1979 to 1983, we treated 185 patients with endometrial cancer at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Tokyo. Compared to nonobese subjects, those who exhibited an obesity index of 1.2 or more were found to have a relative risk value of 2.0 or more times that of normal subjects across all age groups. Based on these findings, it is suggested that a practical and effective preventive measure against endometrial cancer is to avoid becoming obese.
