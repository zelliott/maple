Personal health practices are important determinants of health. Smoking habits are well documented among doctors. However, alcohol consumption, exercise rates and obesity rates are not. No indigenous studies have been done in this area. This descriptive population study aims to determine these factors. A questionnaire was sent to 381 consultants in hospitals affiliated with UCC Medical School. The response rate was 52.5% (200/381). The smoking rate was 7.5% (15/200) and the alcohol consumption rate was 94% (188/200). Both were more prevalent in females. Over a fifth took no exercise and activity levels were similar between groups. Female consultants were better at weight management than males with a lower proportion over the healthy body mass index (BMI) level. The smoking rate and alcohol consumption rate is higher than other studies. When compared to the general population, doctors are a healthier weight and smoke less but more consultants drink and less exercise regularly.
