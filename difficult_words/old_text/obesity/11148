Leptin-related effects on inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in the human airway have not been demonstrated.

To investigate the relationship between the levels of serum leptin and BHR and urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) and 9α,11β-prostaglandin F2 (9α,11β-PGF(2)) release after exercise challenge in asthmatic children.

Eighty-six prepubertal children between 6 and 10 years old were enrolled and divided into 4 groups: 19 obese asthmatic children, 25 normal-weight asthmatic children, 21 obese nonasthmatic children, and 21 healthy controls. We measured serum leptin levels and urinary LTE4 and 9α,11β-PGF2 levels in children before and 30 minutes after the exercise challenge.

Serum leptin levels were significantly higher in obese asthmatic children compared with normal-weight asthmatic children. Significant increases in urinary levels of LTE4 and 9α,11β-PGF2 were observed in obese asthmatic children after the exercise challenge. Although smaller than in obese asthmatic children, significant increases in the urinary levels of LTE4 and 9α,11β-PGF2 were also observed in the normal-weight. Asthmatic children Logarithmic serum leptin values were significantly associated with the logarithmic maximum percentage change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, the logarithmic urinary LTE4 change, and the logarithmic urinary 9α,11β-PGF2 change from baseline to after exercise in both obese and normal-weight asthmatic children.

The serum levels of leptin were significantly associated with BHR and urinary LTE4 and 9α,11β-PGF2 release induced by exercise challenge in asthmatic children.
