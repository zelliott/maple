Fat patterning of 110 adolescent males and 80 adolescent females was determined by principal components analysis of five skinfolds (triceps, subscaplular, iliac, abdominal and thigh). Densiometrically determined body fatness was employed to create two groups: obese (greater than 30% fat) and non-obese (less than 30% fat). Three fat patterning components emerged: trunk-extremity, upper-lower trunk and medial-lateral abdomen. The first two components accounted for 80% of the variance in fat distribution. The obese males and females demonstrate increased trunk fat patterning compared to the non-obese. Furthermore, obese males deposit increased trunk fat in the lower trunk while obese females deposit fat in the upper trunk.
