Over the past three decades, an increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC) has been reported throughout North America and Europe at a rate exceeding that of any other human solid tumor. Recent studies have clearly implicated chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and several lifestyle risk factors, including tobacco consumption, diet and obesity, to be associated with increased risk of EADC. Although physical inactivity is now recognized as a risk factor for several chronic diseases including cancer, only a very limited number of studies have specifically evaluated the association between physical activity and esophageal malignancy. Furthermore, the precise biological mechanisms underlying the association between physical activity, obesity and cancer risk remain unclear. Since successful promotion of healthy body weight and exercise may substantially reduce the future incidence of cancer in the population, the purpose of this review is to explore current evidence linking physical activity, obesity and risk of malignancy - specifically EADC.
