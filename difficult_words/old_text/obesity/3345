Bearing in mind the reports which clearly document the constant dissociation between daily calorie intake from diet, obesity and the positive effects of the mechanical load on bone trophism, the possible correlation between total daily calorie intake of some nutrients (Ca, P and vitamin D) on the one hand, and bone mineral density (BMD) on the other was evaluated in 61 obese women. The results appear to indicate that the higher BMD in obese compared to normal weight subjects may largely depend on the presence of notoriously high estrogen levels which allow a better efficacy and use of dietary calcium.
