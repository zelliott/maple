The ob/ob mouse is genetically deficient in leptin and exhibits both an obese and a mild non-insulin-dependent diabetic phenotype. To test the hypothesis that correction of the obese phenotype by leptin gene therapy will lead to the spontaneous correction of the diabetic phenotype, the ob/ob mouse was treated with a recombinant adenovirus expressing the mouse leptin cDNA. Treatment resulted in dramatic reductions in both food intake and body weight, as well as the normalization of serum insulin levels and glucose tolerance. The subsequent diminishment in serum leptin levels resulted in the rapid resumption of food intake and a gradual gain of body weight, which correlated with the gradual return of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. These results not only demonstrated that the obese and diabetic phenotypes in the adult ob/ob mice are corrected by leptin gene treatment but also provide confirming evidence that body weight control may be critical in the long-term management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in obese patients.
