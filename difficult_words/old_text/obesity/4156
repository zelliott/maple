Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a dermatological condition that is often associated with obesity and may be a physical marker of insulin resistance. Studies have documented a high prevalence rate of AN in people with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, there have been no Nigerian reports on AN and DM. This report bridges the information gap and documents the prevalence of AN in Nigerians with type 2 DM as well as its clinical correlates. Three hundred and forty consecutive subjects with type 2 DM were examined for the presence of AN and its associated clinical features. The prevalence of AN in type 2 DM in this report is 17%. Factors associated with AN include obesity, a family history of DM, female gender, the presence of hypertension and poor glycaemic control.
