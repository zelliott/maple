To investigate the plasma viscosity in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Patients with PCOS and healthy controls were assessed for plasma viscosity. The acquired data were tested for association with hyperandrogenemia, obesity and insulin resistance (IR) in patients with PCOS. Plasma viscosity was determined by a viscometer Type 53610/I SCHOTT-Instruments, Mainz at 37 degrees C.

The study included 96 young women with PCOS and 72 healthy controls. Main outcome measures. Plasma viscosity and IR.

Plasma viscosity was 1.243 +/- 0.67 mm(2)/s in the control group and 1.252 +/- 0.82 in women with PCOS (p = 0.416). Using multiple regression analysis, total protein (B = 0.348, p = 0.005), area under curve for insulin (B = 0.320, p = 0.011) and BMI (B = 0.315, p = 0.013) were proven to be significantly correlated to plasma viscosity. Plasma viscosity was significantly increased in women with PCOS with IR compared to matched for age and BMI PCOS women without IR (1.300 +/- 0.055 vs. 1.231 +/- 0.049 mm(2)/s) (p = 0.004).

Young women with PCOS presented a plasma viscosity that was increased by obesity and IR. Therefore, clinical management of young overweight women with PCOS with IR should always include a serious reduction in body weight and the use of oral contraceptive treatment with cautious.
