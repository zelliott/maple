Neuroendocrine dysfunction in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was addressed by studying the steroid hormone changes in women with PCOS with either high or normal LH levels leading to inferences regarding the primacy of elevated LH in the pathophysiology of PCOS.

A cross-sectional study was designed in an academic clinical facility involving 234 women with PCOS. Patients were divided into two groups based on an LH/FSH ratio &<or&>1 and hormonal and metabolic studies were performed in both groups. Factors were determined by binomial logistic regression that predicted group membership of these women.

Higher follicular phase estradiol (E2) and androstenedione (A4) levels as well as greater insulin sensitivity were the only factors that predicted the presence of neuroendocrine dysfunction with elevated A4 being necessary for neuroendocrine dysfunction.

It was concluded that uncoupling of hypothalamic E2 inhibition by elevated ovarian A4 associated with E2 related sensitization of pituitary LH leads to neuroendocrine dysfunction in PCOS.
