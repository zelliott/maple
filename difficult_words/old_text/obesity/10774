Whenever normal concentrations of insulin produce a biologic response that is less than normal, insulin resistance should be suspected. Insulin resistance may occur in many different disease states and may involve an entire organism, a single tissue or cell, or even a single metabolic pathway of insulin action. This report outlines current knowledge about the mechanism of insulin resistance, as well as specific examples of disease states in which it occurs.
