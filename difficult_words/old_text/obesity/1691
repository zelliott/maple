Two water-soluble chitosan derivatives, O-carboxymethyl chitosan (O-CM-chitosan) and N-[(2-hydroxy-3-N,N-dimethylhexadecyl ammonium)propyl] chitosan chloride (N-CQ-chitosan), were prepared, and the therapeutic effects of chitosan, O-CM-chitosan, and N-CQ-chitosan on insulin resistance were simultaneously evaluated by rats fed on a high-fat diet. The parameters of high-fat diet-induced rats indicated that chitosan and its two derivatives not only have low cytotoxicity but can control overnutrition by fat and achieve insulin resistance therapy. However, the results in experiment in vivo showed that the therapeutic degree varied by the molecular weight and surface charge of chitosan, O-CM-chitosan, and N-CQ-chitosan. N-CQ-chitosan with a MW of 5 Ã— 10(4) decreased body weight, the ratio of fat to body weight, triglyceride, fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, free fatty acid, and leptin by 11, 17, 44, 46, 44, 87, and 64% and increased fecal lipid by 95%, respectively.
