Noninvasive body contouring is perhaps one of the most alluring areas of esthetic surgery today. This article discusses current noninvasive body-contouring modalities, including suction massage devices, radiofrequency energy, high-frequency focused ultrasound, cryolipolysis, and low-level light laser therapy devices. It also discusses imminent technologies awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration, reviews the basic science and clinical effects behind each of these existing and emerging technologies, addresses patient selection and clinical applications of each modality, and discusses the applicability and economics of providing noninvasive lipolysis services in office.
