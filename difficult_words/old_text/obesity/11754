The screening and special management of high risk patient, is possible strategy to reduce the high morbidity and mortality of stroke. In the II. district of Budapest we examined high vascular risk patients cooperating with general practitioners. We let the severity of risk with arithmetic of the cumulative risk index. Significant relation was found between of high cumulative risk index and 50% or higher carotis stenosis, as well as the cumulative risk index and low Se HDL level. Increased blood pressure level has been found in among the treated hypertonic patient. Reduction of high blood pressure was documented in the 6 month control examination. Finally there was very low level of smoking in the high vascular risk patient group.
