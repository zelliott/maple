Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) and uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) are mitochondrial proteins that may play a role in the control of energy expenditure by uncoupling respiration from ATP synthesis. The present review focuses on data obtained in humans. UCP2 is widely expressed in the body, whereas UCP3 expression is restricted to skeletal muscle. Positive correlations have been reported between UCP2 mRNA concentrations in adipose tissue, UCP3 mRNA concentrations in skeletal muscle, and components of the metabolic rate. Fasting induces an up-regulation of UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA expression. In vivo and in vitro studies suggest that fatty acids could modulate uncoupling protein gene expression. The putative relationship between obesity, energy expenditure and uncoupling protein expression, and the unexpected rise in UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA concentrations during short-term fasting, are discussed in view of the recent data obtained in rodents and cell lines.
