Matched-pair analyses of twins were used to examine nongenetic influences of obesity on the lipid profile and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (cross-sectionally) during two phases of development--the school-age years (n = 73 twin pairs) and adolescence (n = 56 twin pairs)--and (longitudinally) in the transition between these two developmental phases. Data were collected during an early morning home visit. Results of the matched-pair t tests indicated significant environmental influences on obesity in both phases and in the transition (change in obesity) between these two phases. Intraindividual associations of obesity (kg/m3) and atherogenic lipids (total and LDL cholesterol) emerged during the school-age years. In adolescence, obesity was associated with HDL cholesterol and total triglyceride. Change in obesity (kg/m3) from the school-age years to adolescence was associated with total triglyceride. Results suggest an emphasis on obesity as part of CVD risk factor management in children and point to the importance of primary prevention early in life.
