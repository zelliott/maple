In humans, dietary-induced obesity markedly increases plasma lipid profile and impairs vascular function leading to increased incidence of cardiovascular events. We have recently reported that chronic withdrawal of obesity-inducing diet attenuates obesity and completely corrects endothelial function. The aim of this study was to investigate whether fenofibrate-induced decrease in adiposity would also correct vascular function in the presence of obesity-inducing diet. Wistar rats were fed with either standard laboratory chow (lean, n = 9) or given a highly palatable diet (diet-fed, n = 18) for 15 weeks. After 7 weeks, half of the diet-fed group was treated with fenofibrate (fenofibrate-treated, n = 9) for 8 weeks before being sacrificed. Untreated diet-fed (n = 9) rats had significantly higher body weight, total fat mass (by up to two-fold, p &<0.001 for both), and raised fasting plasma levels of insulin, leptin and triglycerides (up to 110%; p &<0.001), but not glucose or nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) than both lean control and fenofibrate-treated groups. Resistance mesenteric arteries responses to KCl- and noradrenaline-induced vasoconstriction were similar in all three groups. However, compared with lean controls, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation responses were shifted to the right in both untreated and fenofibrate-treated diet-fed groups. Fenofibrate treatment improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation at only high carbamycholine concentrations (10 microM). There were no differences in endothelium-independent vasorelaxation between the three groups. These results indicate that, in the presence of obesity-inducing diet, fenofibrate markedly reverses obesity and corrects insulin resistance and lipid profile, but it only has a limited beneficial effect on vascular function. Therefore, it seems that diet component rather than obesity per se plays a key role in the genesis of vascular abnormalities.
