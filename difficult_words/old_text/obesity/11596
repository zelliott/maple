Several epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is related to the mortality from cardiovascular disease. In this study, the epidemiology of obesity and the correlation between body mass index and other cardiovascular risk factors was studied in a representative sample of the adult population of Catalonia. It was obtained a random sample (n = 704) of the adult population of Catalonia aged 15 or more years. Height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated (height in Kg/weight2 in m2). Obesity was defined as a BMI greater than 30, and overweight as a BMI from 25 to 30. In the first 314 participants, it was determined the concentration of total cholesterol, cholesterol-HDL and triglyceride, and it was measured the blood pressure. The correlation between BMI and other cardiovascular risk factors was analysed. The study was carried out in 1989. The mean of BMI increased with age in both sexes. BMI was significantly higher in men (26 kg/m2) than women (25 kg/m2). The prevalence of obesity was of 12% in both men and women, and the prevalence of overweight was of 48.5% in men and 38% in women. The prevalence of arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes was greater individuals with obesity, with differences statistically significant for hypertension (odds ratio of 3.26). The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the association between obesity and hypertension was not statistically significant (OR adj. = 2.09), when the effect of the other risk factors, the age and sex were controlled.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
