To determine whether closed subcutaneous drainage systems were efficacious in reducing the rate of wound breakdown of Pfannenstiel incision after cesarean section (CS) in obese females.

Prospective controlled clinical trial.

118 obese pregnant females with a body mass index&>32 undergoing CS were divided into two groups: group I (n = 78) with closed subcutaneous drainage system and group II (n = 40) without drainage system. Incision closure technique was standardized. Prophylactic antibiotics were given routinely to both groups.

Primary outcomes were the incidence of wound breakdown in both groups together with rate of hematoma formation and occurrence of fever. Secondary outcomes were amount of fluid drained, need for redressing.

Wound breakdown occurred in 9 cases in group I (11.5%), while it happened in 5 cases in group II (12.5%) (p&> 0.05). Relative risk was 0.92 (95% CI 0.26-3.75). Hematoma formation was observed in only 1 case in the nondrainage group (group II). Fever was observed in 18 cases in group I (23.1%) in the first 24 h postoperative while in group II, 13 cases developed fever (32.5%) (p&> 0.05). The need for redressing within the first 24 h was only in 2.5% of cases in group I while it was 17.9% in group II (p &<0.05).

We found no significant benefit in using a subcutaneous drain as a prophylactic measure against wound breakdown in obese pregnant females undergoing CS as long as they received a prophylactic antibiotic.
