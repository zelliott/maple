Dietary antioxidant intake has been suggested to protect against oxidative damage and related clinical complications. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential relationships between the dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and obesity-related features in children and adolescents.

Anthropometric variables from 369 children and adolescents were measured (184 obese and 185 control). A validated food-frequency questionnaire was used to calculate the TAC and the daily nutrient and energy intake.

Dietary TAC showed positive associations with fiber, folic acid, magnesium, and vitamins A, C and E. The body mass index, standard deviation score of body mass index and total body fat were inversely associated with dietary TAC only in obese subjects.

These data suggest that dietary TAC may be a potential indicator of the risk to develop obesity-related features and could be considered a useful method in assessing antioxidant intake.
