To investigate the impact of obesity on incidence of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in hospitalized hypertensive patients.

A total of 825 hospitalized hypertensive patients from April 1 to June 30 in 2009 in our hospital were included. Patients were asked to answer the questions concerning snoring, daytime sleepiness. Patients with loud snoring and daytime sleepiness, tubbiness neck, retrognathia, enlarged tongue, orolingual cyanosis were selected to undergo polysomnography monitoring for a whole night. OSAHS is defined by clinical symptoms and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) not less than 5 per hour.

(1) The detection rate of OSAHS in this cohort was 23.52% (178/825), 34.34% (148/431) in males and 11.68% (46/394) in females respectively. (2) The detection rate was 6.6% (12/183) in normal weight subjects, 22.22% (78/351) in overweight subjects and 36.75% (104/283) in obesity subjects (χ(2) = 56.736, P &<0.01). The severe OSAHS rate in obesity group (16.61%) was significantly higher than that in normal weight group (2.19%) and overweight group (7.69%, χ(2) = 29.219, P &<0.01). (3) The OSAHS rate was 7.83% (9/115) in normal waist circumference group and 26.29% (184/700) in centricity obesity group (χ(2) = 18.623, P &<0.01). The severe OSAHS rate was 2.61% (3/115) in normal waist circumference group and 10.57% (74/700) in centricity obesity (χ(2) = 7.32, P &<0.01). (4) The moderate to severe OSAHS rate increased in proportion with BMI increase in female patients (χ(2) = 5.846, P &<0.05) and increased in proportion with BMI and waist circumference increase in male patients (P &<0.01).

The incidence of OSAHS in hypertensive patients is high. Obesity further increases the morbidity of OSAHS in hypertensive patients.
