Recent official publications have highlighted obesity as one of the biggest threats to public health and the prevalence of obesity in children is widely believed to be rising rapidly. However, there are no data on the prevalence of childhood obesity at a local level. We have developed a simple low-cost method of gaining such data by working with local schools.

We designed our method on the observation that numeracy and data handling skills are often taught in schools by getting children to measure their height and weight. We recruited seven schools and offered them a numeracy lesson plan suitable for year 5 (aged 9-10) children together with healthcare staff to attend the lesson. As part of the lesson, each child's height and weight was measured and recorded anonymously. Parental consent was obtained on an 'opt out' basis. The method was evaluated by questionnaire.

We gained data on body mass index for 252 children. In total, 20% of the children were overweight, and 7% obese. The brief questionnaire survey indicated that both teachers and school nurses were happy with the method and would repeat it. Weighing was carried out sensitively.

Our findings were in line with national studies of the prevalence of childhood obesity. The method was simple, low-cost and acceptable to schools and school nurses. There seems no reason why this project cannot be used more widely across the Primary Care Trust (PCT) and beyond. We now propose to roll out the method across all primary schools in Birmingham.
