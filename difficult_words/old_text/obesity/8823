Visceral obesity assessment is not easy, and although computed tomography (CT) is an accurate tool, this technique is expensive and sometimes not suitable in clinical practice. We developed a new two-dimensional elliptical anthropometric equation to classify visceral obesity and evaluated the validity and the reliability of the new equation compared with CT.

We collected anthropometric and CT data from overweight/obese subjects (n = 61, BMI = 32.4 +/- 3.7 kg/m2). A validation group of 32 subjects was also selected. An equation for the assessment of visceral obesity was developed using multiple regression analysis. Once validated, the equation was compared with previous models. Tests for accuracy included mean differences, analysis of diagnostic, R2, Snedecor's F-test, and Bland-Altman plot.

Multiple regression analysis revealed that the sagittal and coronal diameters and the triceps skinfold were significant contributors to the model. The final equation was: visceral area (VA)/subcutaneous area (SA)predicted = 0.868 + 0.064 x sagittal diameter - 0.036 x coronal diameter - 0.022 x triceps skinfold. Patients with visceral-subcutaneous area ratio (VA/SA)&> 0.42 were classified as having visceral obesity. The predictive equation was valid, showing a significant association with VA/SA assessed by CT (VA/SA(CT); r = 0.68; p &<0.0001). Paired Student's t test showed no significant differences with VA/SACT (p = 0.541). The reliability was high [F(24/60) = 2.12; p = 0.01].

The new two-dimensional and elliptical predictive equation is valid to assess visceral obesity and is more precise than previous models.
