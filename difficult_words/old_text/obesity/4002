Body weight and food intake of lean and obese, male and female Osborne-Mendel rats following treadmill exercise were compared. Rats were assigned, separately by sex, to one of three diet groups; Group 1 was fed a low fat (10%) diet throughout the study, Group 2 was fed a high fat (55%) diet for 16 weeks and then switched to the low fat diet 1 week prior to exercise, and Group 3 was fed the high fat diet throughout the study. To control for differences in work output between the leanest and heaviest animals, exercise intensity was adjusted across groups such that all exercised rats had equivalent energy expenditure. After a 3 day training period, the exercise was successively increased over 8 days until a work output of 374.9J was reached. Relative to their respective controls, obese exercised males showed a reduction in body weight but no change in food intake. In contrast, exercised females showed no change in body weight or food intake, regardless of dietary condition.
