In a single large pig production unit of 6,000 breeding sows, 3 Groups of 100 sows each were formed at random on the 110th day of pregnancy. Each Group was evaluated and divided according of body condition in three Subgroups. The Groups were treated as follows: Group 1: received on the 113th day of pregnancy a 3 mg single intramuscular dose of Alfaprostol. Group 2: received on the 113th day of pregnancy a 100 mg single intramuscular dose of Prednisolone. Group 3: received a 3 ml intramuscular dose of physiologic NaCL solution on the 113th day of pregnancy. The Parameter "intrapartum dead piglets" was evaluated. Groups 1 and 2 show better results compared to Group 3 (57 and 55 to 90). Between Group 1 and 2 was no significant difference. Regarding Subgroup 5 (chosen according to body condition), the intrapartum mortality is significantly different between Group 3 and Groups 1 and 2 (%: G 1/5 17.64, G 2/5 22.35, G 3/5 31.08; +/-: G 1/5 1.71, G 2/5 2.37, G 3/5 3.83; SD G 1/5 1.60, G2/5 1.40, G 3/5 2.78). These results show, that in the case of overweight sows, where the birth passage is a priori narrower due to the presence of surrounding fatty tissue, birth is more difficult. As Groups 1 and 2 show compared to Group 3, Alfaprostol or Prednisolone is an effective help against intrapartum mortality in overweight sows (i. e. in Subgroup 5). From the results it is also to be seen, that the above-mentioned veterinary measures help less in reducing intrapartum mortality in thinner sows.
