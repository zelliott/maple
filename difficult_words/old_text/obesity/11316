Oxidative stress has been postulated as an additive factor linking obesity to cardiovascular disease.

Derivatives of reactive oxygen species metabolites (d-ROMs) were measured in 136 obese (42 males, 94 females; mean age: 47 ± 12 years; BMI: 36 ± 5 kg/m(2)) and in 306 over- and normal-weight subjects (112 males, 194 females; age: 47 ± 12 years; BMI: 24 ± 3 kg/m(2)).

d-ROMs levels were higher in obese than in over- and normal-weight subjects (395 ± 104 vs 362 ± 102 and 351 ± 84 arbitrary units (AU); p &<0.001), in women than males (390 ± 104 vs 327 ± 68 AU; p &<0.001), in subjects with than those without hypertension (390 ± 103 vs 360 ± 95 AU; p &<0.01) and in smokers than former and nonsmokers (380 ± 97 vs 358 ± 97 AU; p &<0.05). A positive correlation was found between d-ROMs and BMI (r = 0.25; p &<0.001) and age (r = 0.13; p &<0.01). Levels of d-ROM &>75th percentile: 420 AU) remained as an independent obesity predictor (odds ratio: 2.5; p &<0.001) in women. Continuous variables are reported as mean ± standard deviation.

d-ROMs are a powerful obesity predictor, and could represent a reliable tool in obesity and cardiovascular risk evaluation, especially in women.
