The effectiveness of a school-based intervention trial for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease was studied by measuring cardiovascular risk factors in 701 children with intervention and 663 children without intervention. Outcomes were assessed using preintervention measures at 10 years old (fall 1991) and follow-up measures at 13 years old (fall 1994). In girls with intervention, HDL-cholesterol level was significantly higher and atherogenic index was significantly lower than that in girls without intervention. In obese girls with intervention, frequency of reduced obesity index was significantly higher than that in obese girls without intervention. In boys, however, body size and cholesterol measures did not differ significantly between intervention groups and nonintervention groups. These results indicate that school-based intervention for cardiovascular health can produce a reduction in risk factors for atherosclerosis in girls over a period of 3 school years.
