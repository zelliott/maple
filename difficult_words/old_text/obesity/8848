To evaluate the effects of a greater-than-5% weight reduction in hemodynamic, metabolic, and neuroendocrine profiles of grade I obese subjects.

Observational study with 47 grade I obese subjects, with mean age of 33 years who received monthly orientation regarding diet, physical exercises, and eating behavior for four months. Blood pressure using the auscultatory method and pulse rate were assessed monthly, whereas the following variables (and respective methods) were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study: total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol (enzymatic method), LDL-cholesterol (Friedewald formula), blood glucose (hexokinase method), leptin, adiponectin, renin, aldosterone, insulin (radioimmunoassay) and insulin-resistance index (HOMA).

After adjustment for other variables, significant reductions of 6 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure, 7 pg/ml in renin, 13 mg/dl in total cholesterol and 12 mg/dl in LDL-cholesterol were observed in the greater-than-5% weight reduction group. Also, a tendency to a higher increase in adiponectin levels by the end of the study, as well as a three-fold higher reduction in blood glucose, insulin, and HOMA levels, and a six-fold higher reduction in leptin levels were observed in this group.

Non-pharmacological measures that promote a greater-than-5% weight reduction produce hemodynamic, metabolic, and neuroendocrine effects that improve the cardiovascular risk of obese subjects.
