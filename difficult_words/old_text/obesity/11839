The clinical and epidemiological importance of cardiovascular diseases, which primarily involve vascular lesions, has increased rapidly in recent years. Diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obesity, which serve as a basis for the development of atherosclerosis, are induced by a genetic predisposition coupled with environmental factors. High plasma LDL cholesterol level has important effects on the process of atherosclerosis because, not only are vascular endothelial cells injured, they actually supply LDL cholesterol which is then deposited in the vascular wall. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia with statin significantly reduces the cholesterol level in plaques and normalizes the function of vascular endothelial cells, leading to plaque stabilization and preventing cardiovascular events.
