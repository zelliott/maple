Factors influencing sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations in obesity are poorly understood. Preliminary observations suggest that dietary lipids may be involved and there are data confirming a direct inhibiting effect of insulin. Since only some obese subjects show lowered SHBG levels, we performed this study with the aim of defining obese women with low SHBG (LSO) (2 SD above normal values) in comparison with those presenting normal globulin concentrations (NSO). These groups were selected from a larger group of obese women with a history of normal menses and aged less than 40 years. An age-matched group of normal weight healthy women served as controls. Both LSO and NSO had similar body mass index and percentage body fat, but the waist to hip girth ratio (WHR), an index of body fat distribution, was significantly higher in LSO (0.88 +/- 0.04) than in NSO (0.81 +/- 0.09; P less than 0.05). Gonadotropin and androgen concentrations were similar in both groups, whereas estrone (E1) levels were higher in LSO (32.8 +/- 15.8 pg/ml) than in NSO (19.4 +/- 6.2 pg/ml; P less than 0.05; controls: 23.5 +/- 7.8 pg/ml; P less than 0.05). Moreover, compared to NSO, LSO women had significantly higher glucose-stimulated insulin and C-peptide levels. Partial regression analysis revealed significant correlation coefficients between SHBG, stimulated insulin values (r = -0.38; P less than 0.05) and WHR (r = 0.40; P less than 0.005). Therefore, compared to NSO, LSO women have distinctive clinical and endocrine characteristics, namely more pronounced hyperinsulinemia, higher E1 concentrations and a central type body fat distribution.
