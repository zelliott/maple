It is widely reported that obesity is one of the major risk factors for developing type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and also carries with it a higher risk of diabetic complications.

Body Mass Index was examined in type 2 diabetes mellitus complications and the prevalence of overweight and obesity were determined.

fifty-two type 2 diabetic patients were studied. 13 patients with diabetic nephropathy, 16 were hypertensive diabetics while 23 were normotensive diabetics. The weight, height and blood pressure of the patients were measured and the BMI were calculated.

The mean BMI was highest in the diabetic nephropathy patients (27.9+/-1.0) and lowest in the hypertensive diabetics (25.5+/-5.2) P=0.0001. The prevalence of overweight and obesity were 31 and 46 respectively in diabetic nephropathy compared with 19 and 12.5 respectively in diabetics with hypertension.

Overweight and obesity are more common in diabetics with nephropathy compared with normotensive and hypertensive diabetic patients.
