Summarizing the examinations demonstrate a normal A-cell-sensitiveness to glucose in patients with hyperlipoproteinaemia and normal glucose tolerance. Disturbances of the secretion of pancreatic glucagon are to be proved only in a common presence of a hyperlipoproteinaemia and diabetes mellitus and thus is rather characteristic for diabetes than for hyperlipoproteinaemia. From the bihormonal point of view (relation insulin-glucagon secretion) adipose persons with normal glucose tolerance after stimulation by glucose or amino acids are characterized by an anabolic state, which theoretically means an increase and/or persistence of the fat depot.
