We studied the relationship between plasma insulin level and hypertension in 510 cases with normal glucose tolerance and impaired glucose tolerance. In nonobese group (BMI &<25kg/m2), plasma insulin was higher in those with hypertension than those with normal blood pressure (P &<0.0001). There was no correlation between diastole blood pressure and plasma insulin; multiple regression analysis showed that fasting plasma insulin was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure after controlling age, BMI and plasma glucose level (beta = 0.27, P = 0.0078). The result suggested that age, BMI and plasma insulin level were independent risk factors of hypertension. In obese group (BMI&> 25kg/m2), blood pressure was significantly associated with age and BMI, there was no association between blood pressure and plasma insulin level.
