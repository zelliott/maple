A long-term follow-up which is still being carried out was started in the school-year 1985-86 in a Primary School of Rome and we suggested a written diet of 1300 calories and correct physical exercises. During this long follow-up we studied the changes in percentage of obesity of these subjects, considering their familiarity with obesity. It resulted that after a starting benefit due to the diet and the sport activity, which lasted till 1989, the youngsters with familiarity have subsequently regained the initial situation in 62.5% of cases, unlike those without familiarity who have kept themselves slim in 75% of cases. Even many other facts have been considered, as for example the psychologic approach, blood-tests for cholesterol, triglycerides etc, arterial pressure and above all a very careful feeding recall that has shown as the now obese subjects intake more calories than not obese one, with and excess of calories from fats to the detriment of carbon hydrates.
