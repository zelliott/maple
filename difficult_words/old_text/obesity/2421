To investigate the interrelationships between body weight and gonadotropin secretion of polycystic ovarian disease (PCO), basal hormonal pattern and responses of gonadotropins and 17 beta estradiol (E2) to 25 micrograms (bolus) and 175 micrograms (4-h infusion) of synthetic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) were studied in two age-matched groups of 18 obese (OB-PCO) and 18 normal-weight (NO-PCO) women suffering from the syndrome. Unlike other hormone levels, plasma LH and the LH/FSH ratio values were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in NO-PCO than in OB-PCO females. Moreover, LH response to both stimuli was significantly greater in NO-PCO with respect to OB-PCO. No differences were found in FSH response, whereas E2 response was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in the NO-PCO group during the continuous infusion test. These results emphasize the role of body weight in the development of PCO in obese females.
