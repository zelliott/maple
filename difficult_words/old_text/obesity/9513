The effect of 57 days of moderate physical activity on the energy intake and balance of three obese women (187% of ideal weight) was investigated in a metabolic balance study. Food was offered in extra quantity, prepared in a palatable but simple fashion, and intake was covertly monitored. Expenditure was measured using the factorial method and indirect calorimetry done every 3 to 4 days. After a 5-day evaluation phase which no exercise was done, individual treadmill assignments were given to subjects to increase daily expenditure to 125% of sedentary levels. Mean dialy intake (1903 kcal/day) and expenditure (2882 kcal/day) did not change with time. As a result, negative energy balance was obtained and sustained. A consistent rate of weight loss (0.12 kg/day) at a reasonable cost (8200 kcal/kg)occurred. Therefore, obese women doing long-term moderate exercise do not compensate by an increase in caloric intake. This can produce a negative caloric balance when exercise is coupled with ad libitum selection of ordinary foods.
