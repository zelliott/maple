To assess the characteristics of patients with wet AMD and low intake of lutein and zeaxanthin in our population.

A prospective, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with active wet AMD. A full blood count, a lipid and liver profile, a dietary interview (24-hour recall), and an anthropometric study were performed. Lutein-zeaxanthin (LZ) intake results split the patents in two groups.Group 1 ("sufficient" intake): patients with â‰¥1,400 mg/day intake in women and 1,700 mg/day in men (2/3 of the average daily intake in a normal population). Group 2: patients with daily intakes below that of group 1. A descriptive and comparative statistical study was performed.

Fifty-two patients with a mean age of 78.9 years. Group 1: eleven patients (21% of the sample). Group 2: forty-one patients. The subjects with adequate intake of LZ had higher a body mass index and waist circumference. Between 70-80% of patients in group 1 had inadequate intake of vitamin A, C and E and zinc.

Seventy-nine per cent of the patients with wet AMD have a deficient daily intake in lutein-zeaxanthin. The population with adequate intake is associated with an increased body mass index and waist circumference, and in addition, most of them have an insufficient intake of vitamin A, C, E and zinc.
