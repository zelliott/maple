To examine the impact of a 3-week weight-reducing program on body composition, physical condition, health-related quality of life, and eating behaviors of sedentary, obese (body mass index, 29-35 kg/m) women, according to menopausal status and menopause duration (&<,&>or=5, and&>or=10 y).

Thirteen premenopausal and 27 postmenopausal women received a dietary plan of 1,400 +/- 200 kcal/day and completed 110-minute endurance exercise 6 days per week. Body mass index, fat mass, lean mass, distance walked in the Six-Minute Walk Test, health-related quality of life estimated by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and eating behaviors (restriction, disinhibition, and susceptibility to hunger) assessed by the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire were determined before and after weight reduction.

Body mass index and fat mass decreased (P &<0.0001), whereas distance walked increased in both groups after weight reduction (P &<0.001). Although the SF-36 mental component score increased after weight loss in both groups (P &<0.0001), the SF-36 physical component score increased in postmenopausal women only (P &<0.001). Restriction increased (P &<0.0001), whereas disinhibition and susceptibility to hunger decreased after weight reduction (P &<0.001 and P &<0.01, respectively) in both groups. Distance walked and SF-36 physical component score after weight loss were higher in women whose menopause ranged between 5 and 9 years and exceeded 10 years, respectively (P &<0.01).

Our study shows that a short-term weight-reducing program combining caloric restriction and physical activity has a favorable impact on women's body composition, physical condition, health-related quality of life, and eating behaviors irrespective of their menopausal status.
