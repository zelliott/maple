This study is an attempt to characterize a group of people who volunteered to complete 7-day food record forms. The group was an age- and sex-stratified random sample, comprising 4807 men and women, born in 1922, 1932, 1942 and 1952, drawn from the Civil Registration System. They all received an invitation to the Glostrup Population Studies in 1982-1984. A total of 49.2% completed a 7-day record form. The percentage of respondents was highest in the older age groups. Women were more willing to participate. There was no difference between the groups regarding body mass index. Marital status had some influence, but school education and vocational training had minor importance. A higher percentage of participants, who had never smoked or had quit smoking, completed the records. The male respondents had a lower weekly consumption of beer. No significant differences could be found between the dietary values of the respondents' and non-respondents' food consumption according to a food frequency questionnaire.
