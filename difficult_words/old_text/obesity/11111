Aboriginal children are at increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Healthy Buddies™-First Nations (HB) is a curriculum-based, peer-led program promoting healthy eating, physical activity, and self-esteem.

Although originally designed as a pilot pre-/post-analysis of 3 remote Aboriginal schools that requested and received HB training, one school did not implement the program and was used as a control group. Outcomes included changes in body mass index z-score (zBMI), waist circumference (WC), blood pressure (BP), self-esteem, health behavior, and knowledge over 1 school year in kindergarten to grade 12 children.

There was a significant decrease in zBMI (1.10 to 1.04, p = .028) and WC (77.1 to 75.0 cm, p &<.0001) in the HB group (N = 118) compared with an increase in zBMI (1.14 to 1.23, p = .046) and a minimal WC change in the control group (N = 61). Prevalence of elevated BP did not change in the HB group, but increased from 16.7% to 31.7% in the control group (p = .026). General linear model analysis revealed a significant interaction between time, group, and zBMI (p = .001), weight status (p = .014), nutritious beverage knowledge (p = .018), and healthy living and self-esteem score (p = .005).

The HB program is a promising school-based strategy for addressing obesity and self-esteem in Aboriginal children.
