The prevalence of microalbuminuria (MA) in children and adolescents differs from the one in adults, and it is estimated to be about 5.7-7.3% in boys and 12.7-15.1% in girls. The percentage is greater in smaller age group, whereas a positive association is found between albumin excretion rate and pubertal development stage in nondiabetic subjects. The data so far suggest that impairment of glucose metabolism, obesity-related proatherosclerotic pathways and the impact of haemodynamic load constitute major determinants of albuminuria development in the early years of life. In everyday practice if persistent MA is present at a young age, especially in the setting of diabetes, further investigation of cardiovascular risk factors, a more careful follow-up and dietary/lifestyle interventions are needed.

Although the significance of MA in paediatric essential hypertension has yet to be determined, its role in diabetic children and adolescents is established and albuminuria assessment has been utilized as a screening test for the presence of diabetes-related kidney disease.
