The obesity epidemic continues to grow. As the number of obese people increases, it is logical to expect an increasing number of obese patients and increasing costs to care for these patients. Orthopedic surgeons will see many of these patients who need treatment for injuries and chronic conditions. Care of obese patients requires more work and time in providing nonoperative and operative care. No system has been proposed to handle reimbursement disparities, particularly for providers. The model for health care will change and, along with it, should be all parties coming together to address inequalities and inequities in care for obese and morbidly obese patients.
