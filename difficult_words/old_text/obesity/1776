This study examined the association between binge eating and productivity impairment.

Using data drawn from individuals completing a health risk appraisal and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire, analyses examined associations between binge eating and obesity, health risks, and productivity impairment. Regression analysis tested associations between binge eating and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment scores, adjusting for demographics, obesity, and health risks. Unstandardized regression coefficients estimated annual productivity loss due to binge eating using a hypothetical employer.

Significant associations were found between binge eating and impairment. Adjusting for demographics, obesity, and other risks, binge eating remained a significant correlate of productivity impairment. Estimated annual productivity loss due to binge eating in a company of 1000 employees was $107,965.

Efforts to reduce productivity impairment need to target binge eating as a modifiable risk behavior.
