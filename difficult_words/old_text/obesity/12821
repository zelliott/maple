The acceptance of medication as a legitimate adjunct to diet and behavior modification in the treatment for obesity is an emerging phenomenon spurred by advances in understanding the biologic basis of body weight regulation and by the demonstration of safe and effective chronic maintenance of weight loss using a pharmacobehavioral approach. The decision to medicate for obesity depends on good clinical judgment based on such considerations as body mass index; body composition; body fat dissociation; age; sex; and comorbid conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension. Several nonadrenergic agents and a serotonergic agent have FDA-approved indications for weight loss. Phenylpropanolamine is available over the counter. Clinical trials support the efficacy of fluoxetine and ephedrine or caffeine in producing weight loss, although these agents do not have FDA-approved indications for treatment for obesity. In addition, new agents are being developed or are anticipated for approval. The use of existing agents in combination and their use adjunctive to diet and behavioral approaches to obesity treatment are fertile areas for research. The expectant attention to this subject is demanded by the imperative that the health in one three people in the United States is adversely affected by obesity.
