To determine plasma levels of apoprotein (apo) C-II and apoprotein C-III in Type 2 diabetic patients and to examine the clinical and biological factors that are associated with elevated apoC concentrations.

We measured apoC-II and apoC-III in total plasma and in non-high-density lipoprotein fractions by an immunoturbidimetric assay in 88 Caucasian Type 2 diabetic patients and in 138 healthy control subjects.

Plasma levels of both apoC-II and apoC-III were increased in Type 2 diabetic patients. The clinical conditions associated with an increase of plasma apoC-II and apoC-III were abdominal obesity, body mass index, poor glycaemic control and lack of insulin treatment. However, when multivariate analysis was used, plasma apoCs levels correlated with triglyceride levels only. The apoC-III/apoC-II ratio was similar in the Type 2 diabetic and control subjects.

Our study shows the parallel increase of apoC-II and C-III in Type 2 diabetic patients. This parallel increase is related to hypertriglyceridaemia only.
