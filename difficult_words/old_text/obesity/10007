A cross-sectional study for prevalence of arterial hypertension in the population aged 15-74 years of age of the urban area of Araraquara County, 250 km from the city of S. Paulo, S. Paulo, State, Brazil, in 1987, was performed. The questionnaires presented to 1,199 people (533 men and 666 women) at the interview consisted of regarding sociodemographic variables, as well as the use of tobacco (smoking), the ways in which tobacco was used and the habit of inhaling the smoke. The sample was taken by the procedure of clustering, carried out in three stages. The sample was equiprobabilistic. The prevalence of tobacco smoking was very high being of 45.2% for men and 22.8% for women. The ex-smokers accounted for 15.9% of men and 8.0% of women. The men smoked much more than the women. The poorer smoked more than the richer, in both sexes. Among men, the prevalence of smoking was inversely proportional to duration of schooling, but that difference was not noted in women. As there have been other studies regarding the high prevalence of obesity and high blood pressure, it was concluded therefore that the population of Araraquara, an average town of the affluent urban interior of S. Paulo State, has a high frequency of risk factors for chronic non-transmissible diseases.
