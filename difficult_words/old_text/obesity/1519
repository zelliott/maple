The objective of this study was to develop a screening instrument for easy identification of overweight in children and adolescents in the United States. Data derived from the 2000 Growth Charts published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were utilized to compute gender-specific screening values for identification of overweight in children and adolescents. Computations were based on age- and gender-specific 85th percentile BMI calculated for the various height percentiles at 6-month age intervals. The simplified approach for identification of overweight in children and adolescents consisted of two tables, one each for males and females. Each table described the screening values for overweight at 6-month age intervals for all the nine height percentiles described in the CDC Stature for Age Tables. Two screening tables for identification of obesity were also developed in a similar manner using age- and gender-specific 95th percentile BMI. The simplified approach described for identification of overweight uses only the child's height and weight measurements and obviates the need to compute BMI or assess BMI percentile scores.
