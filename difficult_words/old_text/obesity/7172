Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) dosed by weight is recommended as first-line therapy for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and as monotherapy for long-term treatment of cancer-related VTE. In 'special populations' such as those with renal impairment or the elderly, weight-based dosing may be excessive, and capping the dose in obese patients may lead to inadequate dosing.

We determined the frequency of 'special population' characteristics (renal impairment, advanced age, obesity) and cancer among VTE patients in clinical practice, and assessed whether these characteristics appeared to influence the type and dose of anticoagulants prescribed.

During 2004-2005, among consecutive patients with VTE at two large Canadian hospitals, the proportions with the above characteristics were calculated and treatments prescribed were determined.

Of 524 VTE patients, 31% were aged&> 75 years. Moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) 30-59 mL min(-1)] was present in 20% of patients, and severe renal impairment (CrCl &<30 mL min(-1)) in 5% of patients. LMWH was prescribed to 67% of patients with severe renal impairment and to 83% of patients with moderate renal impairment. Body weight was&> 100 kg in 15% of patients. Underdosing of LMWH by&> 10% was documented in 36% of such patients compared with 8% of patients &<100 kg (P &<0.001). Among 26% of patients with active cancer, only one-third were prescribed LMWH monotherapy.

In clinical practice, renal impairment, advanced age, obesity and cancer are frequently present in patients with VTE. A considerable proportion of these patients may not receive the optimal type or dose of medication to treat VTE.
