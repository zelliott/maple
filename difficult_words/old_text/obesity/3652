Obesity is associated with Barrett's esophagus (BE) and with changes in circulating levels of adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) and cytokines. Although studies have reported that adipokines and inflammatory cytokines are necessary for the development of BE, their role is controversial.

We performed a case-control study; cases (n = 141) were patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and were found to have BE, which was based on endoscopy and histology, and controls (n = 139) were primary care patients eligible for screening colonoscopies who agreed to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy. We examined the association between BE and circulating levels of adipokines and cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12p70; tumor necrosis factor-α; and interferon-γ). Cases and controls were compared by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and using unadjusted and multiple logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, race, waist-hip ratio, use of proton pump inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and Helicobacter pylori infection.

The adjusted ORs for BE were 2.62 (95% CI, 1.0-6.8), 5.18 (95% CI, 1.7-15.7), and 8.02 (95% CI, 2.79-23.07) for the highest quintile vs the lowest quintile of levels of IL-12p70, IL-8, and leptin, respectively, but the OR was not significant for IL-6 (2.39; 95% CI, 0.84-6.79). The adjusted OR for BE was 0.14 for highest quintile of IL-10 compared with lowest quintile (95% CI, 0.05-0.35) and 0.03 for IL-1β ≥ median vs none detected (95% CI, 0.006-0.13). Higher levels of IL-8 and leptin and lower levels of IL-10 and IL-1β were associated with the presence of long-segment (≥3 cm) and short-segment BE. There were no differences between cases and controls in levels of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, adiponectin, or insulin.

BE is associated with circulating inflammatory cytokines and leptin and low levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines. These findings could partly explain the effect of obesity on BE.
