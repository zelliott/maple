Systolic time intervals were measured with 55 middle aged healthy normal weight and 76 healthy overweight probands in two positions (standing and lying). In 39 adipose patients and 55 normal weight subjects an ergometric work was carried out. A significant difference between normal and extremely adipose subjects without cardiac diseases could not be noticed with regard to the preejection index. Preejection period and left ventricular ejection time showed significant differences in both positions between normal and overweight probands, independent of blood pressure. In overweight patients there was a significantly decreased heart work load. The preejection index of adipose patients with a work load below 76 watts amounted to a mean value of 1,04. A work load of 100 watts was reached by only half of the adipose patients. In 32 adipose subjects with a heart work load above 75 watts the regulation of heart-rate and blood-pressure was not different from that of normal weight persons. Muscle blood flow was measured by 133Xenon-Clearance after Lassen et al. The measurement of the 133Xenon-Clearance of the arm muscle at rest in 29 adipose patients resulted in significantly lower values compared with normal weight persons.
