The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between patterns of meal replacement (MR) adherence and changes in outcomes during a behaviorally-oriented weight loss program. Data from the present study are based on sixty female participants (age: 29-62 years, BMI: 27.99-37.50 kg/m(2)). Participants were randomized into either a control or experimental condition, which tested the use of MRs during weight loss maintenance. Outcome measures included body weight, depression, physical activity, cognitive restraint, disinhibition, hunger, and binge eating collected at four assessment points. Within the experimental condition, we further examined adherence to MRs and its relationship with the outcome measures. We found evidence of differences at baseline on some measures (e.g., weight, physical activity and depression) while on others (cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and hunger), differences that emerged over the course of treatment. Further research is necessary to determine if there are measures associated with successful MR use that can be detected at baseline and if MR adherence itself leads to changes in eating behavior.
