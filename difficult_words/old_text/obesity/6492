Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat lacking CCK-A receptors are hyperphagic and obese. Previous work has demonstrated alterations in neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA expression in ad libitum fed OLETF rats compared to lean Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) controls. In order to determine whether alterations in sensitivity to central peptides involved in overall feeding control may contribute to the hyperphagia and obesity in OLETF rats, we assessed OLETF and LETO rats feeding responses to lateral ventricular infusions of NPY (1 and 3.2 nmol), the melanocortin 3/4 agonist MTII (0.1 and 0.32 nmol) and the melanocortin receptor antagonist SHU-9119 (0.25 and 0.5 nmol). At a 3-h time point, NPY increased food intake in both OLETF and LETO rats. OLETF rats were more sensitive, having significant increases at both NPY doses and a greater increase at the higher dose. The melanocortin agonist MTII decreased intake in both LETO and OLETF rats. At the 20-h time point, the magnitude of suppression was greater in OLETF rats. SHU-9119 increased food intake in both groups. OLETF rats were more sensitive with larger relative increase and longer-lasting effects at the lower dose. These results are consistent with demonstrated alterations in neuropeptide gene expression in OLETF rats and indicate that alterations in responsivity to NPY and melanocortin signaling are unlikely to contribute to their hyperphagia and obesity.
