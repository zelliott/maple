To determine the prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia in individuals with other major risk factors of coronary heart disease and markers of hypercholesterolaemia.

A community-based cross-sectional study on a random sample of 261 persons aged between 35 and 69 years residing in the flatted housing estate of West Coast, Singapore, was conducted in 1997. A questionnaire, together with a medical examination and investigation involving the use of Reflotron machine, were used to collect the information required.

43.2% of the population had at least 1 major risk factor, with 18.1% being smokers, 18.1% with hypertension, 6.5% with diabetes mellitus, 5.1% being obese, and 5.0% with a family history of coronary heart disease. Higher percentages of individuals with hypercholesterolaemia were found when each risk factor was present. 9.5% had 2 or more risk factors, of which, 21.1% had high cholesterol levels. A high prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia that was statistically significant was found amongst subjects with corneal arcus below the age of 60.

The risk factors of coronary heart disease remain prevalent in our population. We recommend screening for serum cholesterol only in those with at least 2 major risk factors of coronary heart disease in the general population between 35 and 69 years of age.
