Apart from assessing the nutrition status, the diagnosis of obesity also includes the assessment of mass and distribution of adipose tissue which provides revealing of latent types of obesity that hold higher health risks. The aim of our study was to assess the nutritional status and to analyze the prevalence of normal weight obesity and abdominal obesity in students from the University of Novi Sad.

The body mass index, waist circumference and body fat mass were assessed in the group of 371 students from the University of Novi Sad (their average age being 22.9 +/- 2.5 y).

One-fifth of the study sample students were found to be overweight and obese, i.e. 21% and 1.1%, respectively. The frequency of overweight and obesity was higher in male respondents (overweight: 41.67% vs. 6.05%; obesity: 1.92% vs. 0.46%). Among the survey respondents, there were 4.6% of underweight students, all of whom were female students. Body fat was found to be increased in 11% of the students, the frequency being higher in the males. The phenomenon of obesity in normal body mass was recorded in 7% of the respondents, being more frequent in female students. The total of 5.6% of female students and 5.8% of male students had abdominal obesity.

The survey results indicate the necessity and obligation to direct attention to regular and complete diagnostics of obesity in order to determine the size of fat body mass and its distribution. The presence of obesity in normal body mass among young, student population requires the comprehensive, detailed and timely diagnosis and treatment of this disease.
