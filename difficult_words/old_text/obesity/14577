It is recognised that obesity is a major driver for insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes in both adult and young members of diverse societies. Weight loss strategies involving diet, exercise and behaviour modification work only for the minority of highly motivated individuals, but fail completely in the vast majority; yet weight loss is associated with benefits in metabolic health. Why is it so difficult to maintain weight loss in the longer term? Here, the authors explore the possibility that energy partitioning, especially of lipids, plays a key role in both weight recidivism and, by association, insulin resistance. Drug targets that address key pathways important in this process, where progress in drug discovery is apparent, are discussed.
