Despite robust interest in minimally invasive surgery for obese gynecologic patients, widespread use by gynecologic surgeons has been hindered by the technical difficulty of completing these procedures. The use of robotic assistance to overcome these challenges continues to increase. This study discusses the problem of obesity in the United States, provides basic definitions and calculations related to the disease, reviews some of the literature supporting laparoscopic surgery in obese patients, explores the emergence of robotics in this patient population, and offers "surgical pearls" to aid in the successful completion of minimally invasive robotic gynecologic procedures in heavier patients.
