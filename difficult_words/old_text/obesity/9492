Obese patients who fasted during seven days were divided into four groups according to whether they received triiodothyronine (100 to 150 microgram per day), calcitonin (1 MRC unit per day), both T3 and calcitonin, or neither of these two hormones. Urinary calcium and phosphate were increased in patients receiving T3 or calcitonin. T3 given with calcitonin did not increase the calcitonin-induced calciuria but did increase the phosphaturia. The authors suggest a possible explanation for these findings. No changes in serum parathormone were recorded during fasting acidosis.
