The measurement of weight and height in old people may in some cases be impossible. A subjective assessment of obesity is a simple alternative. Results are presented of a study of overweight in elderly women, where fieldworkers made subjective assessments and anthropometric measures. In analysing an index of weight adjusted for height, it was found that differences between means of the five assessment categories explained 61 per cent of the total variation, although the percentage dropped to 59 when analysis was restricted to patients whose weight was taken from their notes. The method should be useful for cross-sectional studies in which the prevalence of obesity is to be estimated.
