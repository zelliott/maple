The effects of fasting on insulin-induced antilipolysis and lipogenesis were investigated in vitro in isolated human fat cells of 11 obese females. Glycerol release and lipogenesis were determined simultaneously in the same test tube and related to methylglucose transport and specific insulin binding. Insulin binding and sensitivity and the responsiveness (maximum effect) of insulin-induced antilipolysis were enhanced by fasting. The latter was strongly correlated with an enhancement in the lipolysis rate. The effects of fasting on antilipolysis were not dependent on the glucose concentration, unlike insulin-stimulated lipogenesis. At 1 mumol/l of glucose, where hexose transport is rate limiting, sensitivity and responsiveness of insulin-induced lipogenesis were inhibited by fasting. Similar results were obtained with methylglucose transport. At 1-10 mmol/l of glucose, where hexose metabolism is rate limiting, insulin stimulated lipogenesis before fasting but was totally ineffective after fasting. In conclusion, fasting induces multiple alterations in insulin action on lipolysis and lipogenesis in adipocytes. Antilipolysis is enhanced because of stimulation at the receptor and postreceptor levels, which may be associated with an enhanced rate of lipolysis. Fasting inhibits the lipogenic effect of insulin due to postreceptor changes involving both transport and metabolism of glucose, making lipogenesis unresponsive to insulin at physiological glucose concentrations.
