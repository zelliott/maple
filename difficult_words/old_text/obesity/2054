Long-term metabolic studies indicate that over-feeding underfeeding to gain and lose body weight produce consistent increases and decreases in energy expenditure. These changes occur in both lean and obese subjects and cause deviations from the normal relationship between energy expenditure and metabolic body size. The low energy expenditure/metabolic body size in the reduced obese may contribute to the difficulty in maintaining the reduced body weight.
