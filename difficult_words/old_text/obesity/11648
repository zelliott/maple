Continuity and change in the evaluation of ideal and acceptable body sizes across a wide subject age span were examined.

Ratings of ideal and socially acceptable body sizes were elicited from 303 children, 427 adolescents, 261 young adults, and 326 middle-age adults. Line drawing arrays of babies, children, young adults, middle-age, and older adults were portrayed, ranging in size from very thin to very obese.

All subject groups selected, in all arrays, similar ideal body sizes, rated sizes in the midrange of fatness as socially acceptable, and were least accepting of very thin and obese body sizes. Tolerance for body size variations increased with subject age.

Continuity throughout a wide subject age span was observed in evaluations of body sizes. However, adults were more accepting of body size variations than younger subjects, especially children. Implications of endorsing midrange body sizes for the fashion industry are discussed.
