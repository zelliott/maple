Schizophrenic patients have a higher prevalence of obesity than the general population. There are several factors implicated in weight gain, including poor dietary conditions, sedentary lifestyle and antipsychotic drugs use. Obesity is also associated with metabolic disturbances such as diabetes mellitus. Weight gain interventions are necessary in this population, especially non-pharmacological interventions.

To review the non-pharmacological interventions for weight gain management in patients with schizophrenia.

Eight clinical trials and four open-label studies using these interventions were found. The methodology, strength and limitations of the studies were reviewed.

Non-pharmacological interventions seem to have an important effect on weight gain prevention and control, and should be encouraged and adapted to patients and in mental health institution's reality.
