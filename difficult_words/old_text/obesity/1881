Children and adolescents (n=3906, 10-15 years old) have been participating in a screening program for high blood pressure. Sixty-four individuals (17-23 years old) from this population were followed up for 8 years and four consecutive screenings and were stratified into three groups according to blood pressure: group 1 (n=23),&> or = 95th percentile for at least three of four evaluations; group 2 (n=28), &<50th percentile for at least three of four screenings; and group 3 (n=13), with unstable blood pressure percentiles. All 64 individuals underwent an oral glucose tolerance test after a 12-hour fast. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes for insulin and glucose measurements. Group 1 had a greater body mass index and higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, basal glucose and insulin levels, and peak values of insulin and glucose levels than the other groups (P&<05). Group 1 also had a higher prevalence of overweight and abnormal values of basal insulin than the other groups (P&<05) and a higher proportion of glucose-intolerant individuals when compared with group 2 (P&<05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were positively related to body mass index (P&<05) and insulin variables (P&<05); however, when body mass index was controlled for, only systolic blood pressure demonstrated a significant correlation with insulin variables (P&<05). The association of overweight, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and high blood pressure can be detected early, but the significance of these findings would be better explained by longitudinal studies.
