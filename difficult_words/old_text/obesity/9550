Vitamin A deficiency associated with retinopathy and night blindness was observed in a patient 4 yr after jejunoileal bypass. Upon further investigation, a multiple vitamin deficiency state was established. Daily supplementation with 30 000 units of vitamin A resulted in normal levels of vitamin A and retinol-binding protein. The patient's night blindness improved, but his retinopathy remained unchanged as demonstrated by fluorescein angiography. We conclude that patients who have undergone jejunoileal bypass should be supplemented with vitamin A since the vitamin A deficiency is preventable and the retinopathy associated with the deficiency may not be totally reversible.
