This study aims to evaluate the outcome and safety of the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap for breast reconstruction in a group of Southeast Asian women treated in our unit and to identify risk factors for breast reconstruction using the DIEP flap in this population.

This is a prospective study on 50 consecutive DIEP flap breast reconstructions by a single surgeon in an academic institution between July 1999 and July 2006. Data on patient demographics, diagnosis, procedure type, adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments, risk factors and complications were prospectively collected and registered in a clinical database. Outcome variables include total flap loss, partial flap loss, fat necrosis and minor complications related to the donor site or flap. Known risk factors are analysed to determine if they affect outcome in terms of complication rate in this group of patients.

Total flap loss, partial flap loss and fat necrosis complication rates were 6%, 4% and 10%, respectively. Flap complication rates were comparable to those quoted by previous studies done worldwide. Obesity (BMI&>27) is a statistically significant factor associated with development of DIEP flap complications in our population.

Breast reconstruction with DIEP flap is a safe and reliable method when used in Southeast Asian women, offering optimal results with less donor -site morbidity. Obesity increases the incidence of flap complication in this group of patients.
