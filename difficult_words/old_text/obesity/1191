We evaluated the influence of family history of hypertension on insulin sensitivity in lean and obese hypertensive subjects (H): 40 lean [body mass index (BMI) &<or = 25 kg m-2] H with normotensive parents (F-), 50 lean H with one or two parents hypertensive (F+), 30 obese HF- (BMI&> or = 30 kg m-2) and 35 obese HF+. The four groups were comparable in terms of age, sex and ambulatory blood pressure values. We evaluated glucose, insulin and C-peptide before and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after an oral glucose load, insulin sensitivity index (ISI, fasting glucose/insulin ratio), fasting insulin/C-peptide ratio (I/Cp). Glucose, fasting and during test, and I/Cp were similar among the four groups; insulin and C-peptide, fasting and stimulated, were significantly higher and ISI lower in obese H than in lean H; at similar BMI, insulin and C-peptide were significantly higher in F+ than in F-. Insulin directly correlated with night-time blood pressure only in lean HF-. The correlation between insulin and BMI was significantly closer in F-than in F+. In conclusion, family history of hypertension appears to play a relevant role in insulin sensitivity in hypertensive subjects also in the presence of obesity.
