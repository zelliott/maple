Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was carried out in 200 patients between January 1991 and September 1992 at the Second Department of Surgery, Helsinki University Central Hospital. Mortality was nil. The overall major complication rate was 4% (n = 8). The incidence of common bile duct lesions was 0.5% (n = 1). In seven (3.5%) patients the procedure had to be converted into open cholecystectomy. Repeat surgery was needed in two patients. The average hospital stay was 3.0 +/- 1.5 days and the average sick leave 14 +/- 4 days. Obese and high-risk patients tolerated the procedure well without significant increase in complication rate or hospital stay. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be regarded as the treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstone disease.
