Obesity poses a serious health hazard and its treatment is often disappointing. Surgical approaches have been proposed for treating severe obesity (body mass index or BMI&> or = 35 kg/m2) with comorbidities or extreme obesity (BMI&> or = 40 kg/m2). Before accepting bariatric surgery as alternative treatment, the four following prerequisites should be met: 1. the medical condition is serious enough; 2. it can not be treated satisfactorily with classical means; 3. the surgical treatment is effective in improving the clinical situation; and 4. bariatric surgery is safe enough, so that the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. On the basis of the literature and our own experience, it appears that gastric reduction surgery may be considered as a valuable alternative for treating severe/extreme obesity, despite the possible occurrence of perioperative and, more frequently, late complications, provided that it is performed by an experienced and multidisciplinary team in well-selected patients.
