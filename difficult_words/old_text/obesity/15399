Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with large effects on fatness and growth have been identified previously on pig chromosome 4 in an intercross between the European wild pig and Large White domestic pigs. Two F2 sows, heterozygous for the actual chromosome region, were backcrossed to a Large White boar, and two backcross (BC1) boars were in turn backcrossed to Large White/Landrace sows. One of the boars was heterozygous for an intact wild pig-derived QTL region, whereas the other carried a recombinant haplotype. A total of 85 BC2 animals were produced. Phenotypical measurements included daily weight gain, ultrasonic measurements of fat depth at 70 and 90 kg and several carcass traits. QTL segregation was deduced using 15 markers previously assigned to chromosome 4. Highly significant QTL effects were observed on all fatness traits and on the length of the carcass. A small but significant effect on growth was also observed. The results confirm the presence of one or more QTLs on chromosome 4 affecting fatness and growth. There was a good agreement between the estimates of QTL effects in the F2 and BC2 generations. The results from the recombinant sire family allowed us to map the major QTL effect distal to the recombination breakpoint. We propose that this confirmed QTL with a major effect on fatness is designated FAT1.
