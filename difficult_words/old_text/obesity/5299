The effect of a six weeks clofibrate treatment on lipid metabolism was investigated in a collective of 38 constantly maladjusted elderly diabetics with an average of 30% overweight and various forms of hyperlipoproteinemias. Clofibrate produced a significant lowering of the mean triglyceride and cholesterol levels, whereas no such effect was observed in an untreated control group. Related to the various types of hyperlipoproteinemia (IIa, IIb and IV), the group treated with clofibrate showed a rate of normalization of nearly 50%, while the rate of improvement in the untreated control group was 10%.
