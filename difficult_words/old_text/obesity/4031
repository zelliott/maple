Results of extensive follow-up for weight loss and complications in 150 consecutive patients who underwent a standardized gastric exclusion procedure have been presented. A comparative review of the literature has also been presented. All patients were followed for up to 6 years (mean 27.8 months). Only one patient was lost to follow-up. Complications during this period occurred in 54.7 percent of our patients. These were mainly postsurgical biliary disease and ventral hernias. Our recent experience has suggested that the latter complications could have been prevented. The absence of pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and stomal ulcer in our series, as well as the low incidence of perforations, thrombophlebitis, and stomal and pouch complications suggest that the occurrence of these complications can be minimized as well. Patients in this series lost an average of 75 percent of their excess weight, 38 percent of their original weight, and stabilized at 30 percent above their ideal body weight. Ninety percent of the weight loss occurred in the first 12 months. Eighty percent of the patients, however, continued to lose weight 18 months postoperatively and 40 percent lost weight up to 24 months postoperatively. Weight loss has been maintained from 2 to 5 years. In conclusion, analysis of available data has demonstrated that careful patient selection, attention to technical detail, and close follow-up are of paramount importance for providing successful results and minimizing complications in the morbidly obese population who undergo gastric exclusion surgery.
