Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, fenfluramine, and dexfenfluramine, are frequently used to treat obesity, depression, and bulimia. A common side effect of these medications is xerostomia, or dry mouth. A case study demonstrating the impact of drug-induced xerostomia on oral health and subsequent nutrition implications is presented. Rampant caries can result from a combination of xerostomia and inappropriate dietary and oral hygiene habits. Preventive dietary and dental guidelines are presented to assist nutrition and dental professionals in treating and counseling patients with xerostomia.
