Enlargement of the lingual tonsils is being increasingly recognized as a not uncommon and treatable cause of obstructive sleep apnea, particularly in patients with Down syndrome who have undergone palatine tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. We have recognized an increasing number of patients who are obese and have obstructive sleep apnea with enlarged lingual tonsils. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of enlarged lingual tonsils in obese children.

Seventy-one obese children (mean body mass index = 41.6 kg/m(2)) underwent sagittal fast spin-echo inversion recovery imaging. Lingual tonsils were identified and measured in the greatest anteroposterior diameter. Lingual tonsils&> 10 mm were considered markedly enlarged. The subgroup with absent palatine tonsils (previous tonsillectomy) (n = 41) were compared with those with palatine tonsils present (n = 30).

Forty-four (62%) of the obese children had measurable lingual tonsils, which is greater than the frequency previously reported in normal subjects (0%), subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (33%), or subjects with Down syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea (50%). Ten (14%) had lingual tonsils&> 10 mm. Obese subjects with absent palatine tonsils (previous tonsillectomy) had a higher prevalence of measurable lingual tonsils than those with palatine tonsils (78% vs 22%, respectively; p &<0.001) and a higher prevalence of lingual tonsils&> 10 mm (90% vs 10%, p &<0.001).

Obese children have a high frequency of enlargement of the lingual tonsils with a significantly higher prevalence in those with previous tonsillectomy. Enlarged lingual tonsils may play a role in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea in obese children.
