We studied the effect of incisional vacuum-assisted closure (IVAC) on wound complications (dehiscences, infections) associated with surgical treatment of acetabular fractures in morbidly obese patients (body mass index,&>40 kg/m(2)). No wound complications were found in 19 consecutive patients over 5 years of IVAC use. IVAC is an attractive treatment adjunct for minimizing postoperative wound complications in morbidly obese patients undergoing acetabular fracture surgery.
