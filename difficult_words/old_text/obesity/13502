Rising obesity represents one of the most disturbing health trends in the U.S. and elsewhere. Obese people are at greater risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, disability, and mortality. However, recent studies also suggest that the obese population has grown "healthier" since the 1960s, probably due to improved medical care for cardiovascular disease. It is unclear whether these improvements have resulted in more or less disability in obese people as they age. This issue Brief summarizes two studies that examine the prevalence of obesity over time in the elderly and disabled, and the changing relationship of obesity and disability.
