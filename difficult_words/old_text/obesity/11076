A series of benzimidazole derivatives with a phenylcyclohexyl acetic acid group as DGAT-1 inhibitors was developed. Among the benzimidazole series, compound 5k showed submicromolar in vitro activity toward human and mouse DGAT-1, good selectivity toward DGAT-2, human liver metabolic stability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles such as hERG, CYP and acute toxicity. Additionally, 5k showed good in vivo efficacy in 4weeks study with DIO mouse model.
