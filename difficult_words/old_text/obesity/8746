The evaluation process for obesity uses the same framework of a history, physical examination and interpretation of selected laboratory and diagnostic tests that are used for other chronic care patient encounters. What makes this evaluation process different is knowing how to take an obesity focused history, what to examine, and which tests to order. An assessment of risk status is then determined based on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults. Other important aspects of the evaluation process include determining the patient's goals, expectations, and motivation for weight loss along with support systems and/or barriers to behavior change.
