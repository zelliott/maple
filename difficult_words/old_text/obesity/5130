To delineate the hormonal mechanism of dietary-induced changes in sodium balance, the role of insulin and glucagon in natriuresis of fast was evaluated in obese subjects submitted to a total starvation and given either glucagon or somatostatin infusion on day 4 of fast. While large amounts of glucagon (1 mg over 6 h) stimulated concomitantly ketonaemia, ketonuria and renal sodium losses, the ten-times lower amounts of glucagon induced an increase in renal ketone body and sodium excretion without any significant change in ketonaemia. It was concluded, therefore, that elevated plasma glucagon level may enhance renal sodium loss in ketotic states, through a direct renal effect reducing tubular ketone body reabsorption, hence increased ketonuria and natriuresis. It appears nevertheless that decreased insulin secretion, rather than an increase in plasma glucagon level must be considered as a key hormonal factor responsible for natriuresis attending starvation. Indeed, the concomitant reduction in plasma glucagon and insulin levels, resulting from somatostatin infusion on day 4 of fast, was followed by significant increase in natriuresis. The latter observation supports several previous studies indicating that insulin stimulates sodium reabsorption by the kidney and that the reduction in insulin secretion may induce an increase in renal sodium excretion. It was concluded, therefore, that not only sodium intake but also the carbohydrate content of the diet should be reduced in an attempt to induce a negative sodium balance and to correct hypertension in obese subjects.
