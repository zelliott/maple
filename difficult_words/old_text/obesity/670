Alzheimer's disease is a devastating condition that is increasing in prevalence. No known prevention or cure exists for Alzheimer's disease. Cardiovascular risk factors are prevalent and increase in the elderly, and there have been conflicting reports of associations between modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms for these associations are uncertain, but they are likely to be the result of a combination of direct and cerebrovascular disease-related mechanisms. From this standpoint, diabetes and hyperinsulinemia seem to have the strongest evidence from laboratory, clinical, and epidemiologic studies. Studies have also indicated that hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, and smoking are potentially important risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.
