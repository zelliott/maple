The influence of morbid obesity and gastric bypass operation on pancreatic polypeptide (PP), pancreatic glucagon and enteroglucagon was studied in six morbidly obese patients before and 6-9 months after surgery. Hormone plasma levels were determined in the fasting state and after a standardized test meal. Fasting levels of PP, pancreatic glucagon and enteroglucagon were not significantly different between the pre- and post-operative state as well as compared to normal controls. The postprandial response showed a significant reduction of PP, a significant increase of enteroglucagon and no change of pancreatic glucagon after surgery compared with the preoperative values.
