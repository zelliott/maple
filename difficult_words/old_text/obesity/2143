The chemoattractant protein chemerin has recently been shown to be expressed in adipose tissue.

We aimed to evaluate the association of chemerin with obesity and early-onset metabolic and vascular sequelae in children.

We quantified chemerin serum levels in 69 lean and 105 obese children and assessed associations with metabolic and cardiovascular parameters. In addition, a potential direct effect of chemerin on the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules and cell viability was assessed in human coronary artery endothelial cells in vitro.

Chemerin concentrations were significantly higher in obese compared to lean children and correlated with obesity-related parameters such as body mass index sd score, leptin, and skinfold thickness. Moreover, we identified significant associations with the measures of inflammation high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and white blood cell count, as well as with the markers of endothelial activation intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin. Multiple regression analyses confirmed chemerin as the strongest predictor of ICAM-1 and E-selectin independent of body mass index sd score. Likewise, on the cellular level, chemerin induced ICAM-1 and E-selectin expression in endothelial cells in vitro, whereas VCAM-1 and eNOS expression and endothelial cell viability were unaffected.

Our results suggest an association of chemerin with obesity and inflammatory and endothelial activation markers and support a role for chemerin as a molecular link between increasing fat mass and an early atherogenic risk profile in obese children.
