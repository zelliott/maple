The urinary excretion of oxalate, calcium, citrate, magnesium, urate and creatinine and the inhibition of calcium oxalate crystal growth were determined in 30 patients operated with three different types of jejunoileal bypass. In addition the ion-activity products of calcium oxalate and calcium oxalate saturation were calculated. 15 of the patients had formed urolithiasis postoperatively. The patients were investigated on an out-patient basis with their ordinary diet. All patients had hyperoxaluria. The oxalate excretion did not seem to decrease with time after operation. The patients operated with a biliointestinal shunt had a significantly higher excretion of oxalate than those with the other two types of operation, indicating that variations in the anatomy of the small intestine after jejunoileal bypass might result in different absorption of oxalate or oxalate precursors. Urinary oxalate, calcium oxalate saturation and ion-activity products were higher whereas the excretion of calcium, magnesium and citrate was lower in patients than in controls. The urine volumes, excretion of creatinine and urate and inhibition of calcium oxalate crystal growth were equal in patients and controls. Analogous urine composition was found in patients both with and without urolithiasis with the exception of a higher magnesium excretion observed in stone formers.
