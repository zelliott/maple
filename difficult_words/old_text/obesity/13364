A series of 35 xenon-133 (133Xe) ventilation studies yielded nine cases demonstrating accumulation of activity in the liver. Maximum intrahepatic deposition of radioxenon occurred during the washout phase of the study. In addition to those clinical instances which make this phenomenon possible, i.e., obesity, alcoholic-induced liver steatosis and diabetes mellitus, we found that hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease also favor xenon-133 localization into the hepatic parenchyma. It is concluded that the lipid avidity of 133Xe facilitates its liver accumulation hyperlipidemic patients and in patients with coronary artery disease, and that this action may be explored to further understand deranged metabolic pathways in the liver of these patients. Hepatic accumulation of 133Xe during ventilation studies must be considered when assessing regional ventilation/perfusion relationships.
