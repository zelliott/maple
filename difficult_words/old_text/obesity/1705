A series of potent inhibitors of prolylcarboxypeptidase (PrCP) was developed by modifying a lead structure that was discovered by high-throughput screening. The tert-butyl pyrrolidine was replaced by an aminocyclopentane to reduce the metabolic liabilities of the original lead. The compounds demonstrated sub-nanomolar in vitro IC(50) values, minimal activity shifts in pure plasma and improved pharmacokinetics. Complete ex vivo plasma target engagement was achieved with low brain exposure at the 20 h time point following p.o. dosing in a mouse. The results indicate that the aminocyclopentanes are useful tools for studying the therapeutic potential of peripheral (non-CNS) PrCP inhibition.
