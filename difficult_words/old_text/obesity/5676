In order to understand the effect of acupuncture and moxibustion on hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in simple obesity, the authors have observed the obese indices, the lipid level, the content of ACTH in plasma and that of salivary cortisol in 39 simple obesity before and after the acupuncture and moxibustion treatment. The results showed that the markedly effective rate was 38.5%, the effective rate was 51.3%, the ineffective rate was 10.3% and the total effective rate was 89.7% after treatment. The results also showed that the function of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in simple obesity was lower than that of normal. Acupuncture and moxibustion treatment not only regulated the lipid level and achieved the antiobesity effect but also enhanced the function of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal system. The results suggested that the key factor of antiobesity by acupuncture and moxibustion was to increase the function of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal system.
