To compare subcutaneous adipose tissue topography (SAT-top) in obese juveniles with age-matched normal-weight controls.

The optical device LIPOMETER (European Patent EP 0516251) enables the non-invasive, rapid, safe, and precise measurement of the thickness of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Fifteen defined body sites (1 = neck to 15 = calf) characterize the individual SAT-top like an individual fingerprint. SAT-top of 1351 juveniles (obese: 42 boys, 59 girls, normal weight: 680 boys, 570 girls) from 7 to 19 years of age were measured. For visual comparison, the 15-dimensional SAT-top information was condensed by factor analysis into a two-dimensional factor plot.

Both female and male obese juveniles had markedly increased adipose tissue layers at 7 = upper abdomen, 8 = lower abdomen, 5 = front chest, and 6 = lateral chest. The pubertal changes of body shape and fat distribution of the normal-weight boys and girls (boys show thinner adipose tissue layers on their legs, whereas girls had thicker adipose tissue layers at the extremities) were not seen in the obese group. Independently of age and sex, all of the obese juveniles showed a similar, more android body fat distribution with increased trunk fat.

SAT-top of the obese juveniles is similar to that of patients with type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, and coronary heart disease. Patients with these metabolic disorders and obese juveniles are located in the factor plot in the same area. This body shape may indicate a risk profile for developing polycystic ovary syndrome (women), type 2 diabetes, and early atherosclerosis (both sexes).
