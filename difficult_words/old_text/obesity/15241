A total of 1012 persons were divided into the following four groups according to the values of both SV1 + RV5 by the criterion of Sokolow and Lyon and cardio-thoracic ratio (CTR). In all cases the blood pressure, chest X-ray, body surface area, degree of obesity, and chest PA length were measured. From the above data, it was concluded that cases in GII had fat physiques and those in GIII were slender. It is widely known that there are many factors which produce a high voltage in the left ventricle on ECG. This study suggests that the physique is one of many important factors which cause a high voltage in the left ventricule on ECG.
