The tubby mouse, which shows late-onset obesity and neurosensory deficits, arises from a mutation in the Tub gene. Tub shares homology with the genes for tubby-like proteins Tulp1, Tulp2 and Tulp3. Ablation of Tub, Tulp1 or Tulp3 causes disease phenotypes that are indicative of their importance in nervous-system function and development. Despite this importance, the biochemical functions of tubby-like proteins are only now beginning to be understood. At present, data indicate that tubby-like proteins might function as heterotrimeric-G-protein-responsive intracellular signalling factors, although an array of data also implicates them in other processes.
