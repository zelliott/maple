To evaluate efficacy of percutaneous ultrasound-guided thrombin injection (UGTI) of iatrogenic femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (PSA) and to identify the risk factors associated with PSA recurrence.

We treated 140 patients aged 76 years (range 49-83) presented with femoral artery PSA after cardiac catheterisation by percutaneous UGTI (500 IU/ml solution of activated human thrombin). Factors associated with the recurrence of PSA were analysed. One hundred nineteen patients were successfully treated by one injection of thrombin (immediate success rate 85%). In 19 patients (13.6%), short local compression following injection was needed for complete occlusion (overall success rate 98.6%, 138/140). In one case, progression of PSA required conversion to surgery (0.7%). In one patient with pre-existing stenosis of superficial femoral artery, acute limb ischaemia developed after UGTI (0.7%). The recurrence of PSA in 30-days follow-up (10 patients, 7%) was associated with obesity (BM&>30, OR=1.39, 95% CI 1.09-1.78, p&<.05), and with extensive combination of anti-aggregation and anti-coagulation therapy (OR=2.11, 95% CI 1.23-3.62, p&<.0001) as revealed by both univariate and multivariate analysis.

The UGTI is a safe and effective treatment of iatrogenic femoral artery PSA. Recurrence is low and associated with obesity and extensive use of combined anti-aggregation and anti-coagulation therapy.
