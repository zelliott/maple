An increase in androgenicity may contribute to the development of insulin resistance in postmenopausal women. Increased androgenicity in women has been found to be associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. In addition, obesity and central obesity are associated with greater androgenicity. Insulin sensitivity, androgenicity, and body composition were characterized in 34 nondiabetic postmenopausal women age 72 +/- 1 years (mean +/- SEM) to test the hypothesis that androgenicity is a predictor of insulin sensitivity independent of measures of obesity. Androgenicity was measured using levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), total and free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), androstenedione, and free androgen index (FAI). Insulin sensitivity (S(I)) was determined from a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Body composition measures included body mass index (BMI) and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements of total and central fat mass. S(I) was found to be associated with total fat mass (r = -.51, P =.002), central fat mass (r = -.62, P =.0001), BMI (r = -.55, P =.0008), SHBG levels (r =.65, P =.0001), and FAI (r = -.41, P =.01). SHBG levels were inversely correlated with central fat mass (r = -.59, P =.0002). Using multiple regression, SHBG and central fat mass were the only significant independent predictors of S(I), accounting for 50% of its variance (r =.71, P =.0001); total fat mass, BMI, total and free testosterone, DHEA-S, androstenedione, and FAI did not enter the model. We conclude that there is a significant association between insulin sensitivity and androgenicity in postmenopausal women that is independent of obesity. Interventions to decrease androgenicity may therefore be useful in improving insulin sensitivity in postmenopausal women.
