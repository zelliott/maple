Recently, there has been an increase in the prevalence of coronary risk factors, such as diabetes and dyslipidemia, in Japan; however, it is unclear whether this has resulted in an increased incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We investigated the relationship between risk factors changes and AMI incidence in a Japanese population.

Trends in AMI incidence (per 100,000 person-years) were examined using data from the Yamagata AMI Registry from 1993 to 2007. We included 6,222 patients with a first-ever AMI (4175 men). The prevalence of coronary risk factors was investigated in three age groups of AMI patients (&<5, 65-74, and â‰¥75 years) for the periods 1993-1997, 1998-2002, and 2003-2007. Coronary risk factors were further compared between recently registered AMI patients and 2,400 age-matched controls.

The age-adjusted incidence of AMI increased significantly in men, but not in women. Younger men particularly showed a significant increase in the incidence of AMI. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes increased in both genders; however, the prevalence of treatment for risk factors was significantly lower in men than women. Younger men showed significant increases in obesity and hypertriglyceridemia. Consequently, risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome had accumulated among younger men. We revealed that hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and current smoking were independent risk factors for AMI.

The incidence rate for AMI increased significantly in men, especially younger men. Preventive care for risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, in addition to conventional risk factors, may be required in younger men.
