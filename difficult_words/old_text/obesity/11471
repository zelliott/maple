Previous studies have suggested that obesity enhances the inflammatory response, producing macromolecules involved in the induction and/or maintenance of increased erythrocyte aggregation. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the correlation between inflammation markers, erythrocyte adhesiveness/aggregation, and the degree of obesity and to assess phosphatidylserine expression on erythrocyte surface membrane of obese vs. nonobese individuals.

Erythrocyte adhesiveness/aggregation in the peripheral venous blood was evaluated by using a new biomarker, phosphatidylserine expression was assessed by means of flow cytometry, and markers of inflammation were measured in 65 subjects: 30 obese [body mass index (BMI) = 41 +/- 7.7 kg/m(2)] and 35 nonobese (BMI = 24 +/- 2.7 kg/m(2)) individuals. Pearson correlations and Student's t test were performed.

A highly significant difference was noted in the degree of erythrocyte adhesiveness/aggregation and markers of inflammation between the study groups. BMI correlated with erythrocyte adhesiveness/aggregation (r = 0.42, p = 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.42, p = 0.001), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (r = 0.55, p &<10(-4)), fibrinogen (r = 0.37, p = 0.004), and white blood cell count (r = 0.45, p &<10(-4)). The degree of erythrocyte adhesiveness/aggregation correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.5, p &<10(-4)), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (r = 0.56, p &<10(-4)), fibrinogen (r = 0.54, p &<10(-4)), and white blood cell count (r = 0.32, p = 0.01).

Our results suggest that obesity-related erythrocyte adhesiveness/aggregation is probably mediated through increased concentrations of adhesive macromolecules in the circulation and not necessarily through hyperlipidemia or phosphatidylserine exposure on erythrocyte's membrane.
