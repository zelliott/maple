The experimental literature documenting the effectiveness of relaxation training and related approaches, and the behavioral treatment of overweight, in the management of essential hypertension is briefly reviewed. In both cases the immediate outcome in terms of blood pressure lowering and the persistence of effects of therapy over time favor the use of these methods as adjuncts to the treatment of essential hypertension. Preliminary data from recent experimental work concerning the the psychological mechanisms involved in relaxation therapy and evidence for generalization of the effects to the work environment are also presented.
