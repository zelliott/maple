This systematic literature review applies the GRADE approach to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the duodenal-jejunal bypass liner (DJBL) for the treatment of (a) patients with obesity ≥ grade II (with comorbidities) and (b) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus + obesity ≥ grade I. We included ten studies with a total of 342 patients that primarily investigated a prototype of the DJBL. In high-grade obese patients, short-term excess weight loss was observed. For the remaining patient-relevant endpoints and patient populations, evidence was either not available or ambiguous. Complications (mostly minor) occurred in 64-100% of DJBL patients compared to 0-27% in the control groups. Gastrointestinal bleeding was observed in 4% of patients. We do not yet recommend the device for routine use.
