The incidence of obesity in the United States is at epidemic levels (Flegal, 1999). More than half of adults are overweight or obese, with an 80% increase in women with BMIs&> 40 (Grundy et al., 1999; Leermakers, Dunn, & Blair, 2000). Physical activity is a common strategy for weight loss, but activity levels in more than 60% of adults are not sufficient to provide appropriate health benefits (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2003). Women are usually less active than men (CDC, 2003; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2000). Many obese individuals engage in physical activity programs only to return to unhealthy behaviors. Walking is one of the most beneficial and easiest ways for obese women to increase their physical activity. This article reviews the literature on bone and joint benefits of walking for obese women. Information from this review is important for the future design of health-promotion interventions and physical activity programs for obese women.
