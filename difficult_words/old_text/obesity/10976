We have recently reported that dietary fish oil supplementation (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) led to a reduction in blood pressure (BP) and serum triglycerides (TG), in addition to the normalization of the hypercoagulable state in subjects with obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia without diabetes mellitus (OHD-DM). The aim of the present study was to explore the mechanism of this amelioration by comparing the previous results to those obtained from 19 subjects who, in addition to the conditions described above, also suffer from diabetes mellitus (OHD+DM) and proteinuria. In both the non-diabetic and diabetic groups, a similar reduction was observed in BP (from 158.7/80.8 to 146/72.9 mmHg, and from 157.6/83.2 to 141.9/75.6 mmHg, respectively, P&<.001) and TG levels (from 159.2 to 108.0 mg/dl and from 208.7 to 153.1 mg/dl, respectively, P&<.001). However, a favorable reduction in hemostasis parameters (platelet aggregation on extracellular matrix and (alpha2-antiplasmin) was only seen among the nondiabetic patients (from 12.1+/-4.9 to 4.2+/-3.2%, P&<.001). This difference may stem from a less efficient exchange between n-3 and n-6 PUFA in serum phospholipid of the OHD+DM patients. Overall, this 13-day fasting/refeeding method developed by us has proven to cause the rapid exchange of arachidonic acid for eicosapentaenoic acid. It appears to be an effective regimen for the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors (BP, TG and hemostatic variables) in OHD-DM patients and to a lesser extent in OHD+DM patients.
