In recent years, several groups have reported dominant inheritance of obesity conferred by missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R). Hence, MC4R is involved in the most common monogenic form of human obesity described so far.

In this context, we screened a Spanish population, composed of obese subjects and normal weight controls, for mutations in the MC4-R by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP).

Overall 313 individuals, 159 obese subjects (body mass index: BMI: 37.6 kg/m(2), 95% CI: 36.7-38.5 kg/m(2)) and 154 normal weight control subjects (BMI: 22.3 kg/m(2), 95% CI: 22.0-22.6 kg/m(2)) were screened for MC4-R mutations.

We detected a novel nonsense mutation at codon 16 of the MC4-R in an obese female (BMI: 30.0 kg/m(2)) and a previously described missense mutation (Val-253-Ile) located within the sixth trans-membrane domain of the MC4-R in a normal weight individual (BMI: 19.0 kg/m(2)). The polymorphism Val-103-Ile was detected in one obese individual, while four subjects (two cases and two controls) with the polymorphism Ile-251-Leu were found.

We have identified a novel nonsense mutation (Trp-16-Stop) that, based on previously described frameshift and nonsense mutations, most likely results in dominantly inherited obesity. Within this Spanish population, the frequency of the Ile-251-Leu polymorphism of the MC4R was similar in obese and control subjects (about 1.3%), while the polymorphism Val-103-Ile was only detected in an obese individual (0.6%).
