Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (M.E.D.) is a rare, congenital, developmental condition characterized by epiphyseal abnormalities. Salient features of this condition are discussed. A case history is presented of a patient with os trigonum and coexisting M.E.D. The importance of weight reduction and control of excessive pronatory forces is emphasized in patients with M.E.D., thus reducing chronic microtrauma to foot structures.
