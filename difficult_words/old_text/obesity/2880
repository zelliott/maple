Sucrose consumption is a controversial issue. Part of the difficulty arises because of inadequate knowledge about the actual consumption of populations, as well as individuals within a population. Data on the sucrose content of foods are lacking. This review presents information published in the 1970s on these topics as well as current research and thinking about possible relationships of sucrose consumption to dental caries, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and other disease conditions. Current attitudes toward recommendations concerning sugar consumption in the U.S. Dietary Goals are examined, as are data on the use of sugar as a fortification vehicle.
