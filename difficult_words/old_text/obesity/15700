Obesity is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disorders. The aim of the present study was to compare the indexes of arterial structure and function in women with simple obesity and healthy individuals. Twenty-two women with simple obesity (body mass index [BMI]: 33.6 +/- 2.9 kg/m(2), age: 29.7 +/- 6.2 years), and 34 healthy women were included in the study. Healthy subjects were divided into two subgroups according to their age (&<5 and&>45 years): Control A-16 young women (age &<5 years, BMI: 24.0 +/- 3.0 kg/m(2)), and Control B-18 older women (age&>45 years, BMI: 25.8 +/- 2.9 kg/m(2)). Noninvasive, high-resolution, vascular ultrasound was used to evaluate the endothelial-dependent vasodilatation: flow-mediated dilatation of brachial artery (FMD); the arterial structure: intima-media thickness (IMT) of common carotid artery (CCA); and the compliance parameters corresponding to structural changes in large arteries (PWV: pulse wave velocity; PP: pulse pressure; TAC: total arterial compliance; Ao C: aorta compliance, CCA C: CCA compliance, stiffness indexes). Endothelial-dependent vasodilatation as represented by FMD was comparable in the obese group (16.8% +/- 7.9%; median: 15.5%) and healthy subjects (Control A: 14.1% +/- 4.7%; median: 13.6%; Control B: 13.9% +/- 6.5%; median: 13.0%). The mean value of IMT was significantly increased (P &<0.05) in Control B group (0.67 +/- 0.07 mm) in comparison to both obese patients (0.58 +/- 0.09 mm) and Control A group (0.53 +/- 0.05 mm). The compliance parameters (PWV, AoC, CCA C, stiffness indexes) were impaired in obese patients and Control B patients as compared to Control A individuals. PWV and stiffness indexes were significantly increased, and the AoC, CCA C-diameter, CCA C-area were significantly decreased. Simple obesity constitutes an important risk factor accelerating arterial stiffness in women.
