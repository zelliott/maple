In a retrospective study a group of 80-year-old men (114) were compared with regard to their living habits with a group of men from the same firm (131) who had died before the age of 65. The aim of the study was to present factors which could possibly affect the limitation of life expectancy. By means of electronic data processing the findings of the investigation and historical data (family history, personal history, risk factors, physical activity, occupational and social status) were evaluated and possible correlations looked for. The cause of death was particularly included in the interpretation. The risk factors of greatest importance were: cigarette smoking, adiposity, little physical activity.
