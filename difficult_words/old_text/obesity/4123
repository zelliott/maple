This study investigated the effect of combined exercise training on indices of body composition, physical fitness and lipid profile in adolescents with mental retardation.

Thirty adolescents with mental retardation (total IQ, 45-70) received exercise training (n = 15) or no training (n = 15). Groups were matched for age, sex and mental retardation. Before and after the intervention period, indices of body composition, physical fitness and lipid profile were measured.

In comparison with the control group, weight, body mass index, waist and fat mass decreased significantly, while relative fat-free mass increased. The level of triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein decreased significantly, while high-density lipoprotein increased. Muscle strength, muscle fatigue resistance and sit-to-stand were ameliorated. PeakVO2/peak power decreased significantly. The distance covered in the 6-min walk test (6MWT) increased with 50 m.

In conclusion, combined exercise training has a positive effect on indices of obesity, physical fitness and lipid profile in adolescents with mental retardation.
