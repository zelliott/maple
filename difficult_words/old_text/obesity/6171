We investigate the effects of a 2-month weight-loss programme on plasma levels of adiponectin, leptin and resistin in obese adolescent boys.

Twenty-one obese adolescent boys (BMI = 30.8 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2)) completed the weight-loss programme including: 1/ either energy restriction (R), 2/ or individualized exercise training at the point of maximum lipid oxidation (Lipox(max)) (E), 3/ or energy restriction and training (RE). Body composition, lipid oxidation and plasma levels of adiponectin, leptin and resistin were measured before and after intervention.

Following the weight-loss programme, adolescents of the RE group showed an improvement of their body composition (p &<0.01), an increase in plasma adiponectin (+73.7%, p &<0.01) and a decrease in plasma leptin (-38.8%, p &<0.01) leading to an increase in adiponectine/leptin ratio (ALR, +144.4%, p &<0.01) higher than the R or E groups. E and RE groups only showed a similar significant increase in plasma resistin (p &<0.05) and a significant improvement of lipid oxidation rate at Lipox(max) (p &<0.01 and p &<0.001). In addition, in RE group, ALR is correlated with waist/hip and waist/height ratios, resistin level, homoeostasis mode assessment (HOMA-IR) index and Lipox(max).

In obese adolescents boys, moderate exercise training completed at Lipox(max) and combined with energy restriction improves their ability to oxidize lipids, which is associated with a normalization of their adiponectin, leptin and resistin levels resulting in an improved insulin sensitivity, as attested by a higher ALR and a lower HOMA-IR.
