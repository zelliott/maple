Hypertension rarely occurs in isolation, and many hypertensives have additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease in addition to elevated blood pressure. Each patient's cardiovascular disease risk profile should be determined individually, and the treatment approach tailored to each case. Cardiovascular disease risk factors and high blood pressure are closely linked, suggesting that the ideal treatment should not only lower blood pressure, but also effectively lower overall risk. This is likely to require more than one drug, and one of the most effective and safe combinations is that of an angiotensin receptor blocker with a diuretic. The completion of one of the most important trials undertaken to explore risk factors and anti-hypertensive treatment, the Valsartan long-term evaluation trial (VALUE), will certainly enhance understanding for the role of combination treatment in high-risk patients, as well as contribute to the design of rational treatments for blood pressure control.
