Insulin resistance is an early and major feature in the development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus(NIDDM). It is also associated with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity and cardiovascular disease. It is the clustor of the risk factors for atherosclerosis and recognized as 'insulin-resistance syndrome' (Syndrome X). Central (abdominal) obesity is much more strongly associated with insulin resistance than overall obesity. The increase of both the influx of free fatty acid to liver and the production of TNF-alpha in adipose tissue may play an important role in mechanism of insulin resistance associated with central obesity. Calorie restriction and weight loss improve insulin sensitivity in overweight humans. Exercise training also improves insulin sensitivity via increased oxidative enzymes, glucose transporters (GLUT4) and capillarity in muscle as well as by reducing abdominal fat. The new 'glitazones' (thiazolidinediones) is used clinically to improve insulin sensitivity.
