Obesity is very frequently found after renal transplantation (Tx). It may represent risk factor for development of atherosclerosis and chronic allograft nephropathy. In a prospective randomized metabolic study we monitored for a period of 12 months a total of 427 patients (pts) (M 228/F 199) aged 20-70 yrs after Tx. All patients were treated with cyclosporin A and prednisone at standard doses. We compared the findings of 118 pts with a body mass index (BMI)&> or = 30 (kg/m2, Group I) with data obtained from 309 pts with BMI &<30 (Group II) one year after Tx. The mean values of the analysed parameters were as follows (Gr I vs Gr II): total cholesterol (TC): 7.2 +/- 2.4 vs 6.1 +/- 2.0, triglycerides (TG) 3.8 +/- 1.6 vs 2.6 +/- 0.6; LDL-cholesterol 4.1 +/- 1.2 vs 3.0 +/- 0.7; fasting glycemia 8.0 +/- 3.2 vs 5.2 +/- 2.0 (all mmol/L, all p &<0.01); HDL-cholesterol/TG 0.28 +/- 0.07 vs 0.38 + 0.06, p &<0.025). The mean values of corrected Ccr, cyclosporine level, Lp(a) and proteinuria did not differ significantly. There were also no statistical differences in apo E isoforms. In conclusion, our data suggest hyperlipidemia-associated obesity should be treated effectively as a high-risk factor after Tx.
