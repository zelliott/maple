To pilot test a culturally adapted behavioral weight loss intervention in obese and overweight Latino adults.

Pilot study.

Latino community organization in Durham, North Carolina.

Overweight and obese, self-identified Latinos&> or =18 years old.

Intervention consisted of 20 weekly group sessions (90-120 minutes each) incorporating motivational interviewing techniques. The intervention goal was weight loss by adopting the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, increasing physical activity, and reducing caloric intake. The cultural adaptation included foods and physical activities commonly used in the Latino culture, using a Spanish-speaking interventionist, and conducting the intervention at a local Latino community organization.

Weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, dietary pattern, and physical activity were measured at baseline and at 20 weeks.

A total of 56 participants are included in the final analysis. The average weight loss was 5.1 lbs (95% CI -8.7 to -1.5; P = .006); and there was a reduction in BMI of 1.3 kg/m2 (95% CI -2.2 to -0.5; P =.002) at 20 weeks. Systolic blood pressure decreased by 2.6 mm Hg (95% CI -4.7 to -0.6; P = .013).

A culturally adapted behavioral intervention for the treatment of overweight and obesity is potentially effective in a diverse group of Latino adults.
