Treatment with second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) can increase the risk of patients with schizophrenia developing obesity, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes. Routine monitoring is recommended, but clinical practice suggests monitoring is not conducted at a rate necessary for these comorbidities. The aim was to audit what proportion of patients were having their weight, height, girth, body mass index, lipids and blood sugar levels monitored and recorded.

An audit of patients with schizophrenia, discharged from three psychiatric wards, was conducted. Two data sheets were recorded for every patient and inter-rater reliability was calculated. Data were then entered into SPSS and statistical significance calculated.

The sample consisted of 93 patients; SGAs were taken by 31% of admitted and 88% of discharged patients. Of these, 65% had their weight recorded, 61% height, 31% random blood sugar levels, 3% postprandial blood sugar levels, 2% glycosylated haemoglobin, and 7.5% cholesterol and triglycerides. Girth and BMI were not recorded. Abnormalities were detected in 29% of recorded BSL and 2% of recorded cholesterol.

Patients with schizophrenia on antipsychotics have an alarmingly low rate of monitoring of these common adverse effects and comorbidities. Clinicians need to be aware of this, so that they can improve their practice.
