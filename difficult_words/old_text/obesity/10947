Rats postnatally overnourished due to a reduced litter size become persistently overweight. A presumed pathophysiological mechanism consists of a change in the activity and responsiveness to neuropeptides of the neuronal system regulating feeding behavior. This study aimed to find differences in the action of neuropeptide Y, orexin-A and cholecystokinin on single unit activity of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus in brain slices of normal and postnatally overfed juvenile rats. NPY inhibited significantly more neurons (15 of 23) of obese than of normal rats (6 of 27; p &<0.01, chi2). Orexin-A and CCK-8S mainly activated the neurons without significant differences between the groups. In conclusion, the stronger inhibition by NPY of VMN neurons which signal satiety might contribute to increased feeding behavior in postnatally overfed rats.
