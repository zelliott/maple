Various cross-sectional studies have revealed a significant positive relationship between systemic oxidative stress and obesity-related indices such as body mass index (BMI, kg/mÂ²). However, little is known of the role of oxidative stress during adolescence. The aim of this study was to determine the association between obesity and serum reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) in adolescents.

A total of 595 healthy junior high school students from northern Japan were enrolled in the study. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring serum levels of ROM. Obesity indices included BMI and percentage body fat (PBF). The analyses were stratified by sex and controlled for age and menarche. Partial correlation coefficients and analysis of covariance were also analyzed.

In female students, ROM levels increased with increasing BMI and PBF. Therefore, ROM levels were significantly higher in the underweight group than in the BMI-classified overweight-obese (P &<0.001) and normal weight groups (P &<0.05). ROM levels were significantly higher in the high PBF group than in the underweight (P &<0.05) and normal groups (P &<0.001).

The results of this study show that, regardless of menarche, obesity indicators such as BMI and PBF are correlated with the level of oxidative stress in female adolescents.
