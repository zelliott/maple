Transanal TME is a new and important application for TAMIS. It allows for resection and mobilization of the rectum while preserving the quality of the mesorectal envelop. This new approach has gained considerable interest not only because of its minimally invasive nature, but because TAMIS-TME offers a solution to one of the most difficult problems in rectal cancer surgery: Specifically, access to the distal rectum in obese male patients with a narrow pelvis. Recently, transanal TME has become one of the most rapidly expanding areas in rectal cancer surgery. Interestingly, the origin and inception of this approach began decades ago. The evolution of transanal TME with a historical perspective is described.
