To develop age- and sex-specific waist circumference reference data for Canadian youth.

Cross-sectional population survey.

1981 Canada Fitness Survey.

Nationally representative sample of 3064 youth (1540 boys and 1524 girls) 11-18 y of age.

Waist circumference was measured with a flexible anthropometric tape.

Smoothed and weighted 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th waist circumference percentiles derived from LMS regression.

Waist circumference increases with age in both boys and girls, and boys have higher values of waist circumference than girls at every age and percentile level.

These reference data can be used to identify youth with an elevated risk of developing obesity-related disorders and can serve as a baseline for future studies of temporal trends in waist circumference.

This research was funded by the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario (Grant #T4946).
