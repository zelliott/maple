For a long time, adipose tissue was supposed to be inert with only a function of long-term energetic reserve. The obesity, abnormal accumulation of fat, for its part has always been considered the sole result of hyperphagia, itself secondary to a lack of willingness of the subject. This article focuses on the multiple aspects and functions of the different fatty tissues. One must distinguish brown adipose tissue (AT) and the white AT. This includes visceral fat and subcutaneous AT, which itself is divided into two sectors, a genetic fat and grease that we called ecological. The brown adipose tissue has essentially a function of thermogenesis. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), from a certain volume, behaves as true endocrine gland acting on glycemic and lipid function. In addition to its role of energy reserve, the sub cutaneous AT has a mechanical role of shock absorber and fabric slip. We will emphasize finally the genetic aspect still too misunderstood and underestimated that regulates the different functions of the adipose tissue.
