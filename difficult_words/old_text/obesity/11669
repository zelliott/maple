To determine the relative rates of glycogenesis and lipogenesis following administration of a test meal in lean and obese Zucker rats.

Nine-week-old lean and obese Zucker rats were fasted overnight, then tube-fed a test meal of balanced composition amounting to 16kJ (lean rats and one group of obese rats) or 24kJ (one group of obese rats) and containing 200 mg 1-(13)C glucose. Immediately after the meal the rats were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mCi of 3H2O and killed 1 h later.

Glycogenesis was calculated from the incorporation of 3H into liver glycogen divided by the specific activity of plasma water. Lipogenesis was calculated similarly from the incorporation of 3H into saponifiable lipids in liver and perirenal adipose tissue. The proportion of glycogen synthesized by the indirect pathway via pyruvate was determined from the ratio of 3H labelling at positions C6 and C2 in the glycogen glucose residues. Glycogen synthesis from glucose was determined from the ratio of 13C enrichment in liver glycogen to that in plasma glucose.

The rate of synthesis of glycogen was considerably lower in the livers of obese rats than those of lean controls, with the larger meal causing a small but significant increase in glycogenesis. The proportion of glycogen synthesized via pyruvate showed a non-significant increase in the obese rats, while the amount of glycogen synthesized from glucose was significantly decreased. Hepatic lipogenic rates were about five times higher in both groups of obese rats than the lean controls. In adipose tissue, lipogenesis per g tissue was slightly reduced in the obese rats, although there was clearly an increase in adipose tissue lipogenic activity per whole animal. The larger meal caused a greater rise in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations but did not affect lipogenic rates, although it did cause a greater suppression of lipolysis, as indicated by a lower plasma glycerol concentration.

Ingested carbohydrate is partitioned predominantly into hepatic fatty acid synthesis in obese Zucker rats. Hepatic glycogen synthesis is suppressed and comes mainly from precursors other than glucose. The suppression of hepatic glycogen synthesis may contribute to the increased energetic efficiency of obese Zucker rats.
