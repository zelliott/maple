National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines for the management of childhood obesity recommend active screening of children aged 2-18 years, and intervention for those with a body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) above the 85th percentile for age and gender. However, guidelines and BMI for age percentile charts are not well utilised in the general practice setting. In addition, there is a tendency for clinicians and parents to visually underestimate body mass in children.
