This study was performed to examine whether changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) metabolism indices after weight loss were related to the magnitude of weight regain. Nine men and ten premenopausal women whose body mass index ranged from 30 to 42 kg/m(2), 35-48 years old, were studied before and after a 15-week weight loss program, as well as at a 17-22-month follow-up period. Although body composition was evaluated at all study periods, abdominal and femoral SCAT-lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) activities, and α2- and β-adrenoceptors (ARs) were measured before and after weight loss, exclusively. Although the SCAT-LPL activity did not change after weight loss in men, it tended to decrease in the femoral depot of women (p = 0.06). SCAT-HSL activity remained unchanged after weight reduction in men, while the post-weight loss lipase activity tended to be higher in both regions of women (p = 0.06). Although the post-weight loss number of β-ARs was higher irrespective of the fat depot (0.001 &<p &<0.05), the number of α2-ARs was increased in the femoral (p &<0.05), but not in the abdominal SCAT (p = 0.08) after weight reduction, in men. Neither the α2- nor the β-AR density changed after weight reduction, in women. Abdominal SCAT-LPL activity after weight reduction was negatively related to weight regain indices, in women (-0.65 &<Rhô &<-0.75; 0.01 &<p &<0.05). Both the post-weight loss abdominal SCAT α2-AR density and the α2-/β-AR balance were positively associated with weight regain indices, in men (0.69 &<Rhô &<0.88; 0.01 &<p &<0.05). These results suggest that selected SCAT metabolism indices could predict failure to weight loss maintenance, in both genders.
