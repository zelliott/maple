The paper is concerned with a study of a response of lymphocytic Fc receptors (FcR) to modulators regulating their expression (prostaglandins E2 and F2, 2 X 10(-9) M, isoproterenol 10(-5), 10(-6) M) as compared to changes in the lymphocyte membrane lipid composition of patients with obesity of II-III degree with a high blood cholesterol level up to 9-10 nmol/l. Two groups were distinguished among obese patients: "areactive" in which lymphocytic FcR did not respond to modulators, and "reactive" in which FcR responded at least to one of 4 utilized modulators. Research into the lipid spectrum of lymphocytic membranes revealed a significant decrease in the concentration of nonesterified fatty acids in membranes of "areactive" lymphocytes to 4 +/- 0.6% (against the normal level of 8.9 +/- 0.7%). In order to make up completely for immunodeficiency in obesity, lipotropic agents and food rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids could be recommended.
