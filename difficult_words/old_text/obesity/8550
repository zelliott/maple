To assess the prevalence of dieting and investigate clusters of risk behaviors among adolescents.

Data were secured from a random sample of adolescents (4,636) and analyzed using bivariate methods and logistic regression.

From the survey sample, 19.2% adolescents were classified as extreme, 43.2% as moderate dieters, 37.2% as nondieters. Extreme dieters were more likely to use alcohol, cigarettes, and/or marijuana and to attempt suicide and less likely to practice vigorous exercise. Moderate dieters were less likely to use cigarettes, marijuana and more likely to engage in vigorous exercise, with differences across gender-race categories.

Results have relevance for developing multicomponent programs for adolescents.
