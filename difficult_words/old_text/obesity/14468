Levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) may provide independent information concerning cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore, possible correlates of HDL-C and apo A-I levels were studied in 2827 5- to 17-year-olds from a biracial community, and the possible differences in these relationships were assessed. The characteristics examined included sexual maturation, plasma levels of glucose and insulin, obesity, reported oral contraceptive use, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking. In addition, levels of endogenous sex hormones (testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone) were measured in 515 adolescent males. HDL-C and apo A-I levels showed different (p less than 0.001) relationships with both obesity and oral contraceptive use. Increases in subscapular skinfold thickness corresponded more closely to decreases in HDL-C, rather than apo A-I, levels; the relationship with HDL-C was probably mediated by triglyceride levels. In contrast, oral contraceptive use was associated with increases in mean levels of apo A-I (8 mg/dl, whites; 16 mg/dl, blacks), but with only very small changes in HDL-C. (High-estrogen oral contraceptives were related most closely to increases in levels of both HDL-C and apo A-I). Levels of both HDL-C and apo A-I were similarly related to sexual maturation and levels of testosterone (negatively in boys), cigarette smoking (negatively), and alcohol intake (positively). Since levels of apo A-I independently of HDL-C may indicate an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, characteristics related to apo A-I levels should be further examined.
