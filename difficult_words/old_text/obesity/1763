The increasing prevalence of pediatric obesity around the world has become an area of scientific interest because of public health concern. Although since early stages of the lifespan body weight might be heavily influenced by an individual's behavior, epidemiological research highlights the involvement of genetic influences contributing to variation in fat accumulation and thus body composition. Results from genome-wide association studies and candidate gene approaches have identified specific regions across the human genome influencing obesity-related phenotypes. Reviewing the scientific literature provides support to the belief that at the conceptual level scientists understand that genes and environments do not act independently, but rather synergistically, and that such interaction might be the responsible factor for differences within and among populations. However, there is still limited understanding of genetic and environmental factors influencing fat accumulation and deposition among different populations, which highlights the need for innovative experimental designs, improved body composition measures and appropriate statistical methodology.
