There are only few studies analyzing longitudinal effects of regular physical activity on the prevalence of obesity and other characteristics of metabolic syndrome. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of various training programs on the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in middle-aged men. Long-term effects of training (mean 17.5 years) have been compared in 305 men aged 30-59 years (mean 41.8) divided into three groups: sedentary (S) individuals (LTPA &<000 kcal/week), group with moderate (M) LTPA (LTPA between 1000-2000 kcal/week) and highly (H) active group (LTPA&> 2000 kcal/week). We analyzed also aerobic capacity influence on anthropometric and metabolic data. Mean values of body weight, BMI and body fat increased in all groups, however the values in H group are much more favorable as compared with sedentary and moderately active individuals. At final examination we diagnosed obesity (BMI&> or = 30.0 kg/m2) in 23.3% sedentary men, 20.0% of moderate activity and 12% of highly active group. Frequency of obesity increased above twofold in sedentary individuals (10.8 vs 23.3%). Consequently only H group was able to maintain BMI value about 25.0 and to increase significantly HDL (51.7 vs. 56.6 mg/dl) in the follow-up. Metabolic syndrome as defined by ATP III has been diagnosed in 26.6% of sedentary, 23.1% of moderate and only 8.4% of highly active middle-aged men.

the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome development in middle-aged men depends on leisure time physical activity volume and aerobic capacity. Training with exercise expenditure&> 2000 kcal/week which results in maintenance of good aerobic capacity level is a strong protective factor in development of obesity and metabolic syndrome in middle-aged men.
