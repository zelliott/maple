Two hypothalamic peptides, cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), recognized as anorexigenic neuropeptides to suppress the feeding behavior, were monitored in rats fed with a high-fat (HIF) diet for 14 weeks. While half of the rats developed obesity (diet-induced obese, DIO), some did not (diet resistant, DR). Compared to the DR rats and the control rats (fed with standard chow), DIO rats were accompanied by a markedly higher energy intake and a decrease in the number of neurons carrying alpha-MSH and CART peptide in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Failure of hypothalamic anorexigenic peptides CART and alpha-MSH to increase their content in response to HIF diet may play a key role for overly high energy consumption, resulting in obesity.
