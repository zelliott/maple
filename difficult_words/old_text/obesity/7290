Data are limited on the effects of controlled aerobic exercise programs (without weight loss) on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in children and adolescents.

To determine whether a controlled aerobic exercise program (without weight loss) improves peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity and affects glucose production (GPR), gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in sedentary lean and obese Hispanic adolescents.

Twenty-nine post-pubertal adolescents (14 lean: 15.1 +/- 0.3 y; 20.6 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2); 18.9+/-1.5% body fat and 15 obese: 15.6 +/- 0.4 y; 33.2 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2); 38.4 +/- 1.4% body fat) (mean +/- SE), completed a 12 wk aerobic exercise program (4 x 30 min/week at&>or=70% of VO(2) peak). Peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity and glucose kinetics were quantified using GCMS pre- and post-exercise.

No weight loss occurred. Lean and obese participants complied well with the program ( approximately 90% of the exercise sessions attended, resulting in approximately 15% increase in fitness in both groups). Peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity were higher in lean than obese adolescents but increased in both groups; peripheral insulin sensitivity by 35 +/- 14% (lean) (p &<0.05) and 59 +/- 19% (obese) (p &<0.01) and hepatic insulin sensitivity by 19 +/- 7% (lean) (p &<0.05) and 23 +/- 4% (obese) (p &<0.01). GPR, gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis did not differ between the groups. GPR decreased slightly, 3 +/- 1% (lean) (p &<0.05) and 4 +/- 1% (obese) (p &<0.01). Gluconeogenesis remained unchanged, while glycogenolysis decreased slightly in the obese group (p &<0.01).

This well accepted aerobic exercise program, without weight loss, is a promising strategy to improve peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity in lean and obese sedentary adolescents. The small decrease in GPR is probably of limited clinical relevance.
