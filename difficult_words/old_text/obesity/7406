Obesity (defined as body mass index (BMI) higher than 30), is a serious and global public health problem, associated with increased morbidity and mortality and it represents a risk factor for developing various somatic and psychiatric disorders. Combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is frequently associated with increased BMI which leads to overweight and obesity. We therefore evaluated BMI in the ethnically uniform Croatian male participants of the Caucasian origin, combat exposed veterans with or without PTSD, controlled for the effect of trauma, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and comorbid psychiatric disorders, and in age matched healthy control subjects. BMI did not differ significantly between veterans with or without PTSD and healthy control subjects, or when participants were subdivided according to the age groups, BMI categories, or the presence of psychiatric disorders. Limitation of the study might be a small number of veterans with or without PTSD. Similar BMI was found in Croatian male veterans with or without PTSD, and age matched healthy control subjects. The data provided evidence of overweight and obesity in large number of veterans but also in healthy control subjects, and indicated that public health organizations should develop more effective strategies to prevent overweight and obesity.
