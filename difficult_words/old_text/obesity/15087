Obesity is a global epidemic associated with multiple severe diseases. Several pharmacotherapies have been investigated including the melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) and its receptor 1. The development of MCHR1 antagonists are described with a specific perspective on different chemotypes investigated in efforts to overcome hERG liabilities while having orally active, potent and selective compounds with sufficient brain penetration. A chemometric comparison of ∼2000 diverse MCHR1 and ∼1000 diverse hERG ligands underline the structural similarities. A binding pocket analysis of a MCHR1 model and recent X-ray structures of GPCRs invoked in selectivity issues indicate a way to support future drug design.
