The purpose of this descriptive study was to seek directly from college-educated African American women factors which they perceived influenced their individual weight control behavior, and those that influenced African American women collectively. Face-to-face, in-depth interviews were conducted, primarily in their homes, with 36 African American women. Thirteen major categories were identified. Six factors that influenced the women's individual weight control behavior were emotions/feelings, beliefs, life events, self-control, discipline, and commitment. Perceived benefits of the behavior and perceived barriers to the behavior were influential in determining the attractiveness, the type, and the extent of the weight control behavior. Five factors related to the African American culture were identified and described by the women. Recognition of psychosocial determinants of weight control behavior may enable health professionals to design unique interventions relevant to African American women.
