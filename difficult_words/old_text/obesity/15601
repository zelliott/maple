Body mass index (BMI) is the most commonly used measure of obesity. Recently, some investigators have advocated direct measurement of adiposity rather than use of the BMI. This study was undertaken to determine the ability of BMI to predict body fat levels in three populations of West African heritage living in different environments. A total of 1,054 black men and women were examined in Nigeria, Jamaica, and the United States during 1994 and 1995. A standardized protocol was used to measure height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, and blood pressure at all sites; percentage of body fat was estimated using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Percentage of body fat and BMI were highly correlated within site- and sex-specific groups, and the resulting r2 ranged from 0.61 to 0.85. The relation was quadratic in all groups except Nigerian men, in whom it was linear. The regression coefficients were similar across sites, yet the mean body fat levels differed significantly (p &<0.001) as estimated by the intercept, making intersite comparison difficult. Compared with BMI, percentage of body fat was not a better predictor of blood pressure or waist or hip circumference.
