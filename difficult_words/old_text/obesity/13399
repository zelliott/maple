Maternal weight and height before pregnancy and weight gain during pregnancy were recorded for each of 109 mothers who were delivered of normal infants after gestations of 37 to 43 weeks. Infant parameters obtained included gestational age, birth weight, bilateral mid-arm circumference, and eight skin fold thickness measurements. The eight skin fold thicknesses were summed (SSFT) for each infant. Infants with SSFTs greater than 40 mm (N = 8) for the group were classified as "fatter" infants. All of the fatter infants were large for gestational age (LGA), but accounted for only one third of the LGA infants in the study. Birth weight, length, and cross-sectional mid-arm fat area were significantly increased in the fatter LGA group when compared to other LGA infants. Cross-sectional mid-arm muscle area was not significantly different for the fatter LGA infants compared to the other LGA group. Mothers were defined as obese or nonobese according to pregnant weight for height. Obese mothers had infants with significantly increased SSFTs when compared with infants of nonobese mothers. Mulitple regression analysis showed that both prepregnant weight for height and weight gain during pregnancy were associated with increased subcutaneous fat in the neonate. Weight gain during pregnancy was associated with increased neonatal fatness and length, while  prepregnant weight for height was associated with neonatal fatness independent of neonatal length.
