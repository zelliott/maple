Postprandial thermogenesis of 8 healthy males of normal body weight and 17 healthy obese subjects with a body weight gain of more than 10 kg per year was measured continuously by means of a respiratory chamber over 10 h after test meals of 1 and 2 MJ protein (casein) and 2 MJ carbohydrate (hydrolized starch). The total thermic response to all test meals was reduced by about 50% in the obese subjects. The thermic response was related to body weight, energy intake, resting metabolic rate and weight loss during restricted energy intake. The necessity for a careful characterization of the obese subjects in studies of thermogenesis and of efficiency of energy utilization in obesity is pointed out. It is suggested that thermic response to food can be considered as a suitable indicator for the distinction between people of different metabolic efficiency.
