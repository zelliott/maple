The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a simple educational program on the knowledge and practice of people with type 2 diabetes in relation to the foot at risk in Tehran, Iran.

One hundred and forty-eight people with type 2 diabetes underwent a structured interview using a 32-item designed questionnaire (DiFoKaPS-32) about their knowledge of foot care standards in diabetes and their personal foot care behaviours. Each participant in the study received a single 20 min education session individually. The mode of the intervention was face-to-face.

The applied educational intervention aimed at patients with type 2 diabetes has improved their knowledge and practice about diabetic foot care (P&<.0001 and P=0.011; Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test, respectively). Knowledge and practice scores were increased significantly after the education in the lean group (BMI &<or =25) rather than the obese ones.

In conclusion the findings of our study have shown that a simple face-to-face education is an effective and applied method to improve the knowledge about foot care. It has also shown that it could increase the motivation and change the behaviour of people with type 2 diabetes regarding their feet. In addition, the obese patients referring to a diabetic clinic need much more attentions and tighter care programs.
