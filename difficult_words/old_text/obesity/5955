Prospective data on the association between common mental disorders and obesity are scarce, and the impact of ageing on this association is poorly understood.

To examine the association between common mental disorders and obesity (body mass index&> or = 30 kg/m(2)) across the adult life course.

The participants, 6820 men and 3346 women, aged 35-55 were screened four times during a 19-year follow-up (the Whitehall II study). Each screening included measurements of mental disorders (the General Health Questionnaire), weight and height.

The excess risk of obesity in the presence of mental disorders increased with age (P = 0.004). The estimated proportion of people who were obese was 5.7% at age 40 both in the presence and absence of mental disorders, but the corresponding figures were 34.6% and 27.1% at age 70. The excess risk did not vary by gender or according to ethnic group or socioeconomic position.

The association between common mental disorders and obesity becomes stronger at older ages.
