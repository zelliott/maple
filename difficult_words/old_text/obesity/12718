Total blood and plasma free amino acids and plasma urea levels were studied in fed and 24 h fasted Zucker rats. In fed animals there were no differences between obese and lean rats in the overall essential and non essential blood free amino acids. However, starvation reduced blood amino acid levels in the obese animals compared to the lean group, mainly due to changes in the plasma compartment. The reduction of available amino acids from plasma in the obese rats during starvation affected most of the amino acids, including the branched chain amino acids, which showed higher levels in the fed situation than in lean rats. Of particular interest is the opposite response to starvation in lean and obese Zucker rats concerning the plasma ratio of tryptophan (Trp) to the large neutral amino acids (LNAA) which could be implicated in the alteration of food intake and energy expenditure characteristic of obesity.
