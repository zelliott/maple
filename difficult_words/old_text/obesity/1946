Controlling a child's eating habits is counterproductive. By allowing children to make decisions about what and how much to eat, parents empower children to self-regulate their eating. The parent's role is to offer a variety of healthful foods, oversee the planning and assembly of meals, and set the schedule for meals and snacks. The child's responsibility is to decide what, how much, and even whether to eat.
