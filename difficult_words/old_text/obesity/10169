To assess outcomes of robotic laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RLRP) in overweight and obese patients, defined as those with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 30 kg/m2 and greater than 30 kg/m2, respectively.

This was a nonrandomized study evaluating all of our RLRP patients. Patients were divided into three groups: BMI of 25 kg/m2 or less (group 1), BMI greater than 25 kg/m2 and less than 30 kg/m2 (group 2), and BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more (group 3). Patients were evaluated prospectively with the validated Rand 36-Item Health Survey (version 2) and with the University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index questionnaire.

Between February 2003 and November 2004, 150 RLRPs were performed at our center. Average follow-up was 8 months. Groups 1, 2, and 3 had 39, 65, and 46 patients, respectively. Average BMIs for all three groups were statistically different (P &<0.01). When compared with group 1, open conversion rates, hospital stay, positive margin, and complication rates were not statistically different for groups 2 or 3. Operative time (P &<0.004) and estimated blood loss (P &<0.03), however, were statistically greater for group 3 compared with group 1. Transfusion rate was highest in group 2 (P = 0.04 compared with group 1). Prostate weights were also statistically greater in groups 2 (P = 0.003) and 3 (P = 0.02) compared with group 1. Overall, BMI did not increase perioperative and postoperative morbidity.

Robotic laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is safe in overweight and obese patients and might be the surgical management of choice in this subset of patients. Further long-term follow-up with more patients is required to verify this initial observation.
