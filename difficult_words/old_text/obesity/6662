The current treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) focuses on alleviation of symptoms by increasing airway patency during sleep through positive airway pressure, oral appliances, changes in sleep position, weight loss, or surgical treatment. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is currently the treatment of choice and prevents upper airway obstruction, resulting in improved sleep architecture and daytime symptoms. Despite proven efficacy, adherence to CPAP treatment is still not efficient. The new methods of rehabilitation (exercise training programs, hypoglossal nerve stimulation) for patients with OSAS are currently modified. The aim of the present study was to present recent developments in the field of selected aspects of rehabilitation in patients with OSAS. Database search was focused on exercise training programs and electrostimulation of genioglossus muscle. The search for articles on the rehabilitation interventions for OSAS was performed using the PubMed database from 1966 to 2013. Most of the findings have shown beneficial effects of rehabilitation. In detail, we describe the recent developments and potential adverse effects of electrostimulation and physical exercises. According to the results of studies presented, the above therapy might support conventional treatment or may be an alternative for patients with poor compliance to CPAP therapy, mandibular advancement devices, or ineffective results of surgical procedures as well.
