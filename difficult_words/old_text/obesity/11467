Ninety-three males aged 10-21 years undertook the Bruininks-Oseretsky balance test and two computerized posturography tests to evaluate the effects of (a) previous forearm fracture and (b) high body weight on balance and postural sway. Body composition was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Fracture history did not affect balance measures. However, Bruininks-Oseretsky balance scores were negatively correlated with body weight, body mass index, percentage fat and total fat mass. Overweight subjects (n=25) had lower scores (P&<.05) than boys of healthy weight (n=47), supporting the view that overweight adolescents have poorer balance than those of healthy weight.
