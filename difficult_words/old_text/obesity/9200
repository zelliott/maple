Obesity is the sixth major risk factor for the overall burden of disease globally, and is associated with a constellation of metabolic derangements starting early in life. Features of metabolic syndrome (MS) were assessed among obese young individuals in the UAE. Of the 260 obese young people screened, 44% were found to have MS. Prevalence of MS was more among boys than girls and there was a significant association with a positive family history of obesity, diabetes or hypertension. Subjective report of psychological distress was found in 95%, and significant depressive symptoms were present among three-quarters of those with MS. The prevalence and magnitude of obesity and its sequelae including MS is increasing world wide, and newly modernized countries are particularly at risk. Child health professionals must be aware of this and attempts should be made for early identification and necessary intervention including attention to psychological issues.
