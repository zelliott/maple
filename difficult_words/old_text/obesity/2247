The antiobesity effects of Chinese black tea (Pu-erh tea) and of gallic acid (GA) were investigated using in vitro and in vivo assays. Chinese black tea extract (BTE) and GA inhibited pancreatic lipase activity in a dose-dependent manner in vitro; the IC(inhibitory concentration)(50) values were 101.6 and 9.2 Âµg/mL, respectively. Black tea extract (50, 100 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)) and GA (15, 45 mg/kg b.w.) significantly suppressed the elevation of blood triglyceride after oral administration of a corn oil emulsion (8 mL oil/kg b.w.) to male ddY mice. Moreover, the antiobesity effects of BTE and GA were also evaluated in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Female ddY mice were divided into seven groups; normal diet (ND) group, high fat diet (HFD) group, BTE (0.2% and 0.6% of diets) groups, and GA (0.007%, 0.02% and 0.1% of diets) groups; the experimental groups were fed the test diets for 12 weeks. The BTE 0.6% and GA 0.1% groups showed significant suppression of weight gain. The weight of parametrial adipose tissue was strongly correlated with the body weight. These results suggest that GA contributes to the antiobesity effect of BTE as an active constituent by inhibiting pancreatic lipase activity.
