Component fracture is a rare complication after knee replacement, especially in contemporary designs. We report the first case of a fractured femoral component in a cemented Oxford unicondylar knee prosthesis, 9 years after its implantation. Factors leading to this rare kind of component failure are discussed. Revision should be warranted in cases of unicondylar femoral component loosening, eliminating the risk of component fracture, especially in obese patients.
