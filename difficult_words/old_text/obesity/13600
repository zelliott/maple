Neural gastric electrical stimulation (NGES) could be a new technique for treating obesity. However, chronic animal experimentation exploring the efficacy of this therapy is lacking. In this study we investigated the utility of retrograde NGES in a chronic canine model. Nine mongrel dogs (26.8 +/- 5.2 kg) underwent laparoscopic implantation of 2-channel neurostimulator leads in the distal antrum. Five dogs formed a control group and four dogs underwent stimulation. Food intake and weight dynamics were regularly monitored during two separate research protocols, each comprising 2-week baseline, stimulation and washout periods. The stimulation voltage was constant in the first protocol and was ramped in the second. In the first protocol three out of the four stimulated dogs demonstrated significant decrease in food intake (P &<0.05). However, this materialized in a significant weight reduction in one dog only. In the second protocol, all stimulated dogs exhibited significant food intake and weight reduction (P &<0.05) compared to controls. Necropsies and histopathological analysis did not reveal any abnormalities in the stomach, the adjacent organs or around the implant. NGES could be a safe new technique for reducing food intake and weight and, therefore, it might be helpful for treating obesity.
