Obesity is often caused by an unhealthy lifestyle, which is a composite of various individual behaviors. Nurses may assist obese patients to lose weight and avoid chronic disease by identifying risky lifestyle behaviors and helping to develop improvement strategies. This article describes the nursing experience of the authors in caring for an obese patient who had made several unsuccessful attempts to reduce weight. An intervention approach was used to review the patient's lifestyle. Using self-regulation theory, the authors identified that the patient's fat-related daily behavior included: lack of exercise, high-fat diet, and daily snacks consumed even late at night. The authors also helped the patient discover the reasons underlying his fat- related behavior and his previous failed attempts to lose weight and to develop a feasible improved approach that considered such. After six weeks of care, the patient's body weight had reduced and body fat and body mass index had decreased with no relapse. The patient further lost significant weight and body fat during the three-month follow up period. The authors would like to share with nursing professionals this approach to weight loss, with the hope that this case study can contribute to medical efforts to help obese patients not only lose weight but also prevent chronic illnesses.
