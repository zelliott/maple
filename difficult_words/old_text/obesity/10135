The long-term effects of a 12- and 26-day residential weight control program on weight change were determined in 187 men and women, 1 to 5 years after treatment. Subjects completed a paper/pencil questionnaire assessing current diet, weight control techniques, exercise behaviors, behavior modification techniques, binge eating, and dieting behavior. General linear modeling was used to investigate the association between behaviors maintained posttreatment and current weight among subjects who demonstrated behaviors indicative of binge traits (BT) and nonbinge traits (NBT). Results indicate that dissimilar variables are predictive of weight change in the BT and NBT groups. Engaging in exercise behaviors and reduced attempts at dieting lead to greater weight loss in NBT individuals. The use of preplaning techniques was found to be indicative of greater weight loss in BT individuals. These findings suggest the importance of identifying individuals who indulge in binge-eating behaviors prior to intervention in order to deliver the appropriate treatment methods.
