During the last 4 years 2040 patients with myocardial infarction were admitted to the C.C.U. of the National Institute of Cardiology. Thirty five patient under 40 years of age were studied. Three had Rheumatic heart disease and in 32 the etiology of the myocardial infarction was probably coronary atherosclerosis. The 32 cases under 40 years of age were compared to a group of patients with myocardial infarction older than 40 years of age. A great predominance of myocardial infarction was found in young males which were heavy smokers. There were no significant differences with the presence of obesity and arterial hypertension. In the younger group, myocardial infarction were more frequent in those with intellectual activity and in taxi drivers. The early hospital course was better in the young group they did not have cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock and none died. However, in the long term follow up the younger group had more P.V.C. and ventricular tachycardia. The cardiography of the younger showed an important predominance of lesions in the left coronary artery. It is concluded that in young people, myocardial infarctions seems to occur primarily in smokers with stress in their Kind of living. These patients seem to have less complications in the early and long term courses. However, more cardiac rhythm disorders are present.
