To examine whether changes in different aspects of dietary restraint in obese patients with binge eating disorder (BED) participating in a treatment study predict outcomes.

Fifty obese patients with BED in a randomized controlled study of orlistat administered with cognitive-behavioral therapy, guided-self-help (CBTgsh) completed dietary restraint measures at baseline, during- and post-treatment, and three-month follow-up.

Change in the restraint scale of the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire did not predict binge abstinence or 5% weight loss. Increased flexible restraint subscale of the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) during treatment significantly predicted binge abstinence at post-treatment and three-month follow-up and 5% weight loss at post-treatment. Change in the rigid restraint subscale of the TFEQ predicted binge abstinence at post-treatment.

Our findings clarify further pathologic and adaptive aspects of restraint and suggest the importance of enhancing flexible restraint in order to improve both binge eating and weight loss outcomes.
