Patients who have bulimia nervosa and are overweight have received little attention in the medical literature. The authors identified 25 patients who weighed greater than or equal to 130% of their ideal body weight out of a series of 591 patients with bulimia nervosa. This subgroup was contrasted with a sample of 25 patients with bulimia nervosa who were 90% to 110% of their ideal body weight. Members of the overweight bulimia nervosa group were binge-eating and vomiting less frequently than the comparison group but were more likely to be abusing laxatives, and to report a history of self-injurious behavior and suicide attempt(s). Both groups reported frequent binge-eating.
