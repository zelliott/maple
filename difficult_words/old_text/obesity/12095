To verify whether there are relationships between vascular and hormonal responses to aerobic training in hypertensive persons, sedentary hypertensive patients were randomized to an aerobic training or a callisthenic exercise group. The patients' 24-hour blood pressure, arterial compliance, forearm blood flow, and hormonal profile were evaluated at baseline and after 3-month training protocols. Mean maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2) max) increased by 8% in the aerobic group (P&<001), while no change was observed in the control group. There was a decrease in insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, P=.039) and plasma cortisol (P=.006) in the aerobic group only, that also demonstrated an increase in forearm blood flow (P&<001) after training. No relationship was observed between change in blood pressure or change in body mass and other parameters. Aerobic training can promote a decrease in cardiovascular risk in hypertensive adults by improving vascular function and insulin resistance, despite no changes in ambulatory blood pressure after a 3-month intervention.
