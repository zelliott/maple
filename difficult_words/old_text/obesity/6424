The increase in body and white adipose tissue weights induced by a high-fat diet were prevented by treatment with the beta3-adrenergic agonist Trecadrine. Plasma insulin levels were slightly elevated in overweight rats, while a decrease was observed in Trecadrine-treated groups. Insulin-dependent glucose uptake was impaired in adipocytes of the overweight rats in relation to lean animals. The beta3-adrenergic agonist induced an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by adipocytes as compared to the nontreated animals. In fact, Trecadrine treatment was able to restore to control values the impairment in insulin-mediated glucose uptake induced by the cafeteria diet, suggesting that Trecadrine prevents the development of insulin resistance in overweight animals. Basal leptin secretion was increased in adipocytes of the overweight rats in relation to lean animals. Trecadrine treatment induced a decrease in basal leptin secretion compared to the untreated animals. Insulin-stimulated leptin secretion reached similar levels in adipocytes of the overweight rats as in lean animals. There was a trend for insulin-induced leptin secretion to be lower at 24 h in Trecadrine-treated rats, but it did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, adipocytes of diet-induced overweight animals have a higher basal leptin secretion, which is reduced by treatment with Trecadrine. However, neither the cafeteria diet nor the Trecadrine treatment significantly alters the ability of adipocytes to increase leptin secretion in response to insulin.
