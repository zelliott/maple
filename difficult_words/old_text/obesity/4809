Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a multifactorial disease involving inflammatory activity and endothelial dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the changes in lipoperoxidation, in immunological and biochemical parameters and nitric oxide metabolite (NOx) levels in MS patients. Fifty patients with MS (4 males/46 females) and 50 controls (3 males/47 females) were studied. Compared to control (Mann-Whitney test), MS patients presented higher serum levels (P &<0.05) of fibrinogen: 314 (185-489) vs 262 (188-314) mg/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP): 7.80 (1.10-46.50) vs 0.70 (0.16-5.20) mg/dL, interleukin-6: 3.96 (3.04-28.18) vs 3.33 (2.55-9.63) pg/mL, uric acid: 5.45 (3.15-9.65) vs 3.81 (2.70-5.90) mg/dL, and hydroperoxides: 20,689 (19,076-67,182) vs 18,636 (15,926-19,731) cpm. In contrast, they presented lower (P &<0.05) adiponectin: 7.11 (3.19-18.22) vs 12.31 (9.11-27.27) µg/mL, and NOx levels: 5.69 (2.36-8.18) vs 6.72 (5.14-12.43) µM. NOx was inversely associated (Spearman's rank correlation) with body mass index (r = -0.2858, P = 0.0191), insulin resistance determined by the homeostasis model assessment (r = -0.2530, P = 0.0315), CRP (r = -0.2843, P = 0.0171) and fibrinogen (r = -0.2464, P = 0.0413), and positively correlated with hydroperoxides (r = 0.2506, P = 0.0408). In conclusion, NOx levels are associated with obesity, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers. The high uric acid levels together with reactive oxygen species generation may be responsible for the reduced NO levels, which in turn lead to endothelial dysfunction. The elevated plasma chemiluminescence reflecting both increased plasma oxidation and reduced antioxidant capacity may play a role in the MS mechanism.
