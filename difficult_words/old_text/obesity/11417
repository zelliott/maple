The putative role played by insulin sensitizers in modulating adipose tissue lipolysis in the fasting state was evaluated in obese conscious Zucker rats treated with troglitazone or beta,beta'-tetramethylhexadecanedioic acid (MEDICA 16) and compared with nontreated lean and obese animals. The rates of appearance (R(a)) of glycerol and free fatty acid (FFA), primary intra-adipose reesterification, and secondary reuptake of plasma FFA in adipose fat were measured using constant infusion of stable isotope-labeled [(2)H(5)]glycerol, [2,2-(2)H(2)]palmitate, and radioactive [(3)H]palmitate. The overall lipolytic flux (R(a) glycerol) was increased 1.7- and 1.4-fold in obese animals treated with troglitazone or MEDICA 16, respectively, resulting in increased FFA export (R(a) FFA) in the troglitazone-treated rats. Primary intra-adipose reesterification of lipolysis-derived fatty acids was enhanced twofold by insulin sensitizers, whereas reesterification of plasma fatty acids was unaffected by either treatment. Despite the unchanged R(a) FFA in MEDICA 16 or the increased R(a) FFA induced by troglitazone, very low density lipoprotein production rates were robustly curtailed. Total adipose tissue reesterification, used as an estimate of glucose conversion to glyceride-glycerol, was increased 1.9-fold by treatment with the insulin sensitizers. Our results indicate that, in the fasting state, insulin sensitizers induce, in vivo, a significant activation rather than suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis together with stimulation of glucose conversion to glyceride-glycerol.
