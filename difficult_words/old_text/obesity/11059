Transmethylation modifies configuration and proceeds via formaldehyde. It has a significant role for example in epigenetic regulation. The whole methyl-pool can be evaluated by the measurement of bound formaldehyde.

The bound formaldehyde was measured in wheat, bean, beetroot, cabbage, broiler- and rabbit liver. The relationship between transmethylation and redox homeosthasis was studied in the liver of domestic animals, and in the rat model of fatty liver.

The diet of rats was enriched with cholesterol, sunflower oil and cholic acid. The bound formaldehyde was determined by overpressured layer chromatography. The hydrogen-donating ability was measured with 1.1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazylt free radical using spectrophotometric measurement.

Beans had the most bound formaldehyde. The liver of broilers possessed significantly elevated hydrogen-donating ability and transmethylation ability. Rats with severe fatty liver had significantly less bound formaldehyde and the hydrogen-donating ability tendentiously decreased.

These results draw attention to the diet, especially in obesity and obesity-related diseases.
