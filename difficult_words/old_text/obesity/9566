It is the scope of this review to summarize animal experimentation carried out to investigate the effects of changes in habitual physical activity on glucose tolerance. Various studies in normal rats and in obese Zucker rats have demonstrated that physical training of mild intensity can partially revert or prevent the development of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and skeletal muscle insulin insensitivity. The molecular basis for these phenomena remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, these observations strongly suggest the possibility to use physical exercise programmes in order to improve glucose tolerance in patients with maturity-onset type diabetes mellitus, especially if associated with obesity.
