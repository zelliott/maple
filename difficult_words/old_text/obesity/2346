Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials comparing laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) with open appendectomy (OA) show a reduction in wound infections associated with LA but a 3-fold increase in intra-abdominal abscess with LA. Surgical time and operation costs are higher with LA. The advantage of LA over OA is small. Although these patients have not been specifically analyzed in the report, the systematic review recommends the routine use of LA in young women and obese people. The purpose of this study is to determine if obese patients benefit in a shorter length of stay (LOS) by having LA versus OA surgery compared with their nonobese counterparts.

A retrospective chart review of 315 adult patients who have undergone appendectomies at Royal Columbian and Burnaby Hospitals between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Appendectomies performed in pregnant women combined with other surgeries and those converted to OA were excluded. Outcomes and the postoperative stay for obese and nonobese patients were assessed.

The LOS is shorter with LAs than with OAs (2.06 vs 4.13 days, P &<.05). The LOS, in obese patients, is much shorter with LAs than with OAs (1.69 vs 6.82 days, P &<.05). The variability in LOS is much higher in obese patients as compared with nonobese patients (standard deviation = 8.57 vs 2.67). The body mass index and the type of surgery contribute to a significant difference in LOS.

Obese patients who undergo LA have a decreased LOS as compared with obese patients who undergo OA for appendicitis. This is the first study showing specifically that LA benefits obese patients and the health care system.
