Proteins from 5- to 7-wk-old lean and obese Zucker rats were separated by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and two-dimensional SDS-isoelectric focusing-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Laser densitometry revealed an obesity-related decrease in the concentration of a 28-kDa cytosolic adipocyte protein, the most abundant protein in adipocytes from lean Zucker rats. Microsequencing revealed the identity of this protein to be carbonic anhydrase III (CA III). The identity and obesity-related decrease was further confirmed using isoform-specific antisera and CA III enzyme activity measurements made by 18O mass spectrometry. Immunoblotting studies also revealed that CA III is present in at least two charge isoforms in adipocytes. Our data indicate that lean Zucker rat adipocytes may represent the richest source of CA III in nature (24% of the cytosolic protein content). An obesity-related decrease in both the concentration and activity of CA III was observed in two lipogenic tissues, liver and white fat, but not in soleus muscle. Adipocyte CA III activity was no longer depressed when hyperinsulinemic obese rats were made insulin deficient by streptozotocin injection. This suggests that the obesity-related decrease in CA III may be related to the hyperinsulinemia as well as to the insulin hyperresponsiveness that adipocytes from obese Zucker rats of this age display.
