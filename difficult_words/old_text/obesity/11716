The immune system is closely integrated with the neuroendocrine system, and infection-induced increases in cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF have numerous effects on the central nervous system. These include stimulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as well as of leptin production. The increase in leptin causes loss of appetite, which may be deleterious for children who are living under conditions of poverty, have frequent infections and are often already undernourished. These cytokines may also be involved in problems of obesity, since they activate the HPA-axis and since TNF is produced by fat cells and can cause insulin resistance. The immune system originally developed for hunter-gatherers may not be well adapted to the pathology of poverty or that of excess.
