Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with psoriasis have a higher risk of developing certain metabolic disorders, particularly obesity. Psoriasis and obesity are linked through a common pathophysiological mechanism of chronic low-grade inflammation. Not only is obesity associated with a higher incidence of psoriasis and greater severity, but it also affects response to treatment. The dermatologic management of these patients must therefore take their overall metabolic situation into consideration. We present a review of the recent literature on this subject and practical recommendations on the management of this group of patients, including relevant additional tests and advice on diet and a healthy lifestyle.
