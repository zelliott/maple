As we enter the twenty-first century, the burden of chronic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and CVDs, is expected to increase dramatically. These diseases are a consequence of several factors that include an aging population,changes in demographic composition, and an excess of contemporary lifestyle. The prevention and control of overweight, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes pose special challenges for clinical and public heath practice as well as for basic, clinical, and population science research.
