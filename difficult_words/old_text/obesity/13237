To examine changes in modifiable health-risk behaviors of diabetic persons in the United States.

A cross-sectional study was conducted of noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 years or older, in states that participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 1995 and 2001. Changes in self-reported health-risk behaviors among persons with diabetes are examined for those years (5,218 in 1995 and 13,733 in 2001 for the core instrument; 3,227 in 1995 and 9,304 in 2001 for the diabetes module).

From 1995 to 2001, the percentage of persons with diabetes who were obese, had ever been told their blood pressure or blood cholesterol was high, or had their blood cholesterol checked in the past year increased significantly. Significant increases were also reported among diabetic persons who were former smokers, received an annual influenza vaccination, ever received a pneumococcal vaccination, performed daily self-monitoring of blood glucose, received annual foot examination, and received annual dilated eye exam.

Continued emphasis needs to be placed on a multirisk factor approach to prevent, delay, and reduce the complications of diabetes.
