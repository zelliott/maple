Body composition of 57 mentally retarded adults (25 women, 32 men) was assessed. Skinfold and girth measurements were collected to determine how accurately existing regression equations could predict percentage body fat for a retarded population when compared to hydrostatic weighing (criterion measure) at total lung capacity. No significant differences were found between five of the six regression equations evaluated for men and four of the six regression equations evaluated for women; however, three equations had the greatest predictability and were recommended for use in estimating the percentage body fat of retarded adults.
