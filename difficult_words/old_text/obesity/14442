Continuous respiratory exchange measurements were performed in nine obese and eight lean women for 1 h before, 3 h during, and 1 h after the intravenous administration of a nutrient mixture infused at twice the postabsorptive resting energy expenditure (REE). This experiment was conducted without or with beta-adrenergic blockade (iv propranolol). Propranolol administration did not change the postabsorptive REE [i.e., 1.03 +/- 0.07 before vs. 1.01 +/- 0.02 kcal/min after administration in lean women and 1.16 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.03 kcal/min (NS) in obese women]. The mean overall thermogenic response expressed as a percentage of the infused energy was similar in both groups and was not significantly blunted after propranolol infusion [6.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.9 +/- 0.6% in the lean women and 7.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 7.1 +/- 0.6% (NS) in the obese women]. During beta-adrenergic blockade the rate of lipid oxidation decreased in the lean group but was unchanged in the obese group and the glycemic response to nutrient administration was significantly higher in both groups than without propranolol. It is concluded that beta-adrenergic blockade has no effect on REE and on intravenous nutrient-induced thermogenesis in both lean and obese women.
