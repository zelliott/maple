The high gastric reduction operation has been performed on one hundred and nine obese patients over a sixteen-month period. Patient selection, preoperative care, operative technique and postoperative care are described. Our early results show that a satisfactory initial and continuing weight loss can be sustained for a twelve-month period with a low morbidity and mortality. Further follow-up of these patients is required before the ultimate place of this procedure is established.
