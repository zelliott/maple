To estimate the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and overweight in two populations of Alaska Natives and to compare the results with previous data.

Participants' heights, weights, and random plasma glucose levels were determined. Those with a glucose of greater than or equal to 6.72 mM received a follow-up glucose-tolerance test, interpreted by WHO criteria. Overweight was defined by National Center for Health Statistics criteria and also by criteria used in previous studies. The subjects were Eskimo and Athabascan residents greater than or equal to 40 yr of age in 15 villages in southwestern Alaska.

Diabetes prevalence was 4.7% for Eskimos and 10.0% for Indians. Among Eskimo men and women, the prevalence of overweight was 34 and 56%, respectively, among Indian men and women, it was 29 and 55%, respectively. Comparisons with past data indicate that the prevalence of diabetes has increased from 1.7% in 1962 for Eskimos and 1.8% in 1969 for Indians.

The prevalence of diabetes appears to have increased among Eskimos and Indians in Alaska. Overweight appears to be a significant problem in both groups.
