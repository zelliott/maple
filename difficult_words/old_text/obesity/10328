This study applied theory-based health behavior change constructs to childhood obesity prevention. Constructs such as goal setting, self-efficacy, and readiness for change were used within a rural community-based program designed to be developmentally appropriate for 6th graders. The project included 2 studies across 12 months. The 1st assessed the scope of the obesity problem within a 3-county area with key stakeholders in health and education. The 2nd implemented a pilot community intervention program within a rural middle school. Participants in the intervention included 65 middle-school students and the families of 25 of these students. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Changes from pre- to postintervention on relevant measures were statistically significant for families but not for students. Issues related to family versus individual behavior change are discussed, along with implications for managing behaviorally based activity and nutrition interventions within a rural community.
