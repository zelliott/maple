Tobacco smoking, lack of recreational physical activity, unbalanced diet, overweight and obesity are the major modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of smoking and the other lifestyle behaviors among economically active adults.

The study population consisted of 442 randomly selected economically active adults from the Lódź and Lublin districts, Poland. The prevalence and different possible combination of four major risk factors for chronic diseases was determined.

About 40% of men and 28% of women smoke at least one cigarette per day. Only 3.5% of men and 1.9% of women meet the recommended guidelines for four common health life style factors. Only about 2% of smokers obey the rules relating to other healthy behaviors. In women smoking cigarettes, the risk for not being physically active is twice as high as that in nonsmokers.

The prophylactic programs for healthy lifestyle behaviors should be addressed to all economically active individuals, taking into account their level of education, the type of work performed and income.
