Recombinant methionyl human leptin (r-metHuLeptin) was first used as a replacement therapy in patients bearing inactivating mutations in the leptin gene. In this indication, it was shown since 1999 to be very efficient in inducing a dramatic weight loss in rare children and adults with severe obesity due to the lack of leptin. These first clinical trials clearly showed that r-metHuLeptin acted centrally to reduce food intake, inducing loss of fat mass, and to correct metabolic alterations, immune and neuroendocrine defects. A few years later, r-metHuLeptin was also shown to reverse the metabolic complications associated with lipodystrophic syndromes, due to primary defects in fat storage, which induce leptin deficiency. The beneficial effects, which could be mediated by central and/or peripheral mechanisms, are thought to mainly involve the lowering effects of leptin on ectopic lipid storage, in particular in liver and muscles, reducing insulin resistance. Interestingly, r-metHuLeptin therapy also reversed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunctions associated with hypothalamic amenorrhea. However, if r-metHuLeptin treatment has been shown to be dramatically efficient in leptin-deficient states, its very limited effect in inducing weight loss in common obese patients revealed that, in patients with adequate leptin secretion, mechanisms of leptin resistance and leptin tolerance prevent r-metHuLeptin from inducing any additional effects. This review will present the current data about the effects of r-metHuLeptin therapy in humans, and discuss the recent perspectives of this therapy in new indications.
