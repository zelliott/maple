To assess the efficiency of an ambulatory weight management programme of pediatric obesity, including 1 gymnastic session per week, on body composition and physical fitness (max).

Fifteen adolescents participated in the 9-month intervention. BMI and fitness and physical activity assessed by a questionnaire were evaluated at baseline, and after intervention.

Prepubescent subjects (N=6): no significant change of BMI, body composition, nor max. Pubescent subjects: significant decrease of BMI, and z score BMI, and % fat mass, increase of fat free mass. Activity questionnaire: non-significant trend to decreased TV watching, significant increase in practice of physical activity during weekend.

A modest increase in physical practice, included in the dietary-behavioural management of adolescent obesity, is able to improve overweight and physical fitness.
