The relationship between adipose tissue distribution, androgen levels, and metabolic complications of obesity was studied in 20 hirsute and 20 nonhirsute obese premenopausal women. The group of hirsute women showed preferentially an upper body type of obesity as assessed by the waist-to-hip ratio (0.902 + 0.017 v 0.778 +/- 0.015, P less than .01). They had higher serum concentrations of total testosterone (100.4 + 11.7 v 48.8 +/- 4.5 ng/dL, P less than .01) and lower levels of serum sex-hormone-binding globulin (28.1 +/- 3.6 v 44.0 + 4.2 nmol/L, P less than .05) exhibiting an increased androgenic activity as compared to the nonhirsute women. Serum glucose and insulin levels after an oral glucose load were significantly higher in the hirsute women. In addition, the group of hirsute females has significantly higher fasting concentrations of total cholesterol (5.82 +/- 0.28 v 4.75 +/- 0.14 mmol/L, P less than .05) and triglycerides (2.51 +/- 0.38 v 1.14 +/- 0.10 mmol/L, P less than .01). The hirsute group also showed higher systolic (166.7 +/- 5.1 v 142.1 +/- 4.5 mm Hg, P less than .01) and diastolic (100.9 +/- 3.6 v 85.2 +/- 2.5 mm Hg, P less than .01) blood pressure values than the nonhirsute women. Analysis of correlation revealed that an increasing waist-to-hip ratio was accompanied by increasing testosterone levels (r = .39, P less than .05) and by decreasing sex-hormone-binding globulin levels (r = .37, P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
