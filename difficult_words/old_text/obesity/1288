A high intake of saturated fats and cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of developing and dying from coronary artery disease (CHD), particularly if other risk factors are present. However, although a reduction in the consumption of the amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the incidence of primary and secondary CHD in susceptible individuals, other dietary measures may also be important. These include an increased consumption of poly- and monounsaturated fatty acids, fresh fruit, fish and fibre.
