This study was to examine the effects of an exercise program for middle-aged obese women.

The exercise program combined folk dance and resistance training. The subjects group consisted of 85 middle-aged obese women between 40 and 60 years of age. Three 8 week sessions consisted of a 55-80% maximum heart rate (MHR) exercise for 60-90 minutes a day and 3 times a week from March to November, 2004. Data was collected through a pre- and post-exercise test before and after each session. Data was collected with Inbody, dynamometer and blood. This data was analyzed by descriptive statistics, and a paired t-test with an SPSS/PC (10.0 version) program.

There were significant positive changes in body weight, body fat mass, body mass index, percent body fat, muscle strength, muscle endurance, flexibility, and balance quality, but no significant positive changes in skeletal mass, fat free mass, percent abdominal fat (waist-hip ratio), visceral fat area, agility, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides.

This study showed that an exercise program has partially positive effects for middle-aged obese women. The results of this study show that exercise at community health centers should continue for middle-aged obese women's health.
