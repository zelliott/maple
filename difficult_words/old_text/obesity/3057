Both levels of total adenine nucleotides, ATP, AMP, ATP/ADP ratio and phosphate potential of cell and cytosol and the intensity of mitochondrial oxidation (fatty acid beta-oxidation in particular) and phosphorylation are elevated in the liver of db/db mice as compared with control. Presumably these alterations corresponding to the total activation of metabolic processes in db/db mice are mediated by hyperinsulinemia. Nicotinamide treatment (2.5 mg/100 g body weight, 14 days, i.m.) elicits further increase of ATP and total adenine nucleotide levels, cytosolic phosphate potential and activation of mitochondrial oxidation and phosphorylation. The findings obtained can be used for explanation of nicotinamide inhibition of gluconeogenesis, diacylglycerol and phosphoacylglycerol biosynthesis in the liver of db/db mice.
