The involvement of the CNS in pancreatic hormone release has been studied. 1.) It has been shown that one source of vagal efferent fibers capable of facilitating insulin secretion originated in the rostral half of the nucleus ambiguus. 2.) Acute lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus resulted in hyperinsulinaemia that could be abolished by acute vagotomy. 3.) Chronic lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus increased secretion of insulin and glucagon, and decreased secretion of somatostatin when the pancreas was subsequently isolated and perfused. These changes were attributed to altered cholinergic activity related to previous ventromedial hypothalamic lesions as they could be reversed toward normal by atropine infusion or mimicked by the cholinergic agonist, methacholine. 4.) Electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus in anaesthetized rats produced both an inhibitory component of insulin secretion, probably related to adrenergic stimulation, and a stimulatory component, probably due to the release into the blood of factor(s) that promote insulin secretion. 5.) The anatomical organization of brain of the genetically obese (ob/ob) mice is abnormal. These abnormalities could be involved in the endocrinological disturbances of these animals.
