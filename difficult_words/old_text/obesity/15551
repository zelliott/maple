To investigate the determinants of resting energy expenditure (REE) in obese non-diabetic Caucasian women.

A cross-sectional survey study before the beginning of a weight-reduction program.

141 obese, non-diabetic women of Caucasian origin (BMI 34.8 +/- 3.7 kg/m2, age 43.2 +/- 8.0 y, mean +/- s.d.).

Resting energy expenditure (an indirect calorimetry), body composition (a bioelectrical impedance), fat distribution (anthropometry) and heart rate (ECG) were determined after 12 h overnight fast and apolipoprotein E phenotype was examined.

In a linear multiple regression analysis fat-free mass, fat mass and age together with heart rate and waist-hip ratio emerged as significant determinants of REE. In the other regression model, also serum insulin emerged as a significant determinant of REE, in addition to fat-free mass, fat mass and age. There was no significant differences in REE among the different apolipoprotein E phenotype groups.

Besides fat-free mass, also fat mass, age, heart rate, waist-hip-ratio, and serum insulin level make a significant contribution to REE in obese women.
