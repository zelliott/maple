p63 plays an important role in several intracellular processes such as transcription activation and apoptosis. p63 has two N-terminal isoforms, TAp63 and ΔNp63. TAp63 isoform has p53-like functions, while ΔNp63 acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of the p53 family and is considered oncogenic. Although p63 and its isoforms are overexpressed in a wide variety of human malignancies such as cervical, head and neck, and lung cancer, their role in endometrial carcinoma has not been investigated.

We measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction the mRNA expression of TAp63 and ΔNp63 in a series of 20 endometrioid adenocarcinomas paired with adjacent normal tissue.

TAp63 isoform exhibited 1.8-fold overexpression in malignant samples, while ΔNp63 was 4.3-fold overexpressed in cancer specimens. Further analysis revealed that the ΔN/TA isoform ratio shifted from 0.5 in normal samples to 1.2 in tumor specimens. Statistical analysis also revealed an association of TAp63 expression with high body mass index (p = 0.034), late menopause (p = 0.020), and lower tumor grade (p = 0.034). ΔNp63 was also correlated with grade I/II tumors (p = 0.044).

These results indicate that both p63 isoforms and especially ΔNp63 play an important role in the development and progression of grade I/II endometrial adenocarcinoma, especially in obese and late-menopause women.
