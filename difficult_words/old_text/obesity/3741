It would be difficult to overstate the urgency that U.S. government and health officials have placed on the dangers posed by obesity. Given the increasing numbers of individuals being diagnosed as overweight and obese and the emphasis on the contribution of weight to health and disease, it is critical that all health professionals examine the validity of the claims being made. A thorough examination of the research literature does not support the claims that overweight and obesity are major causes of premature mortality, excess fat is pathological and a direct cause of disease, and weight loss is practical and beneficial to health for most individuals. The literature also does not provide any significant evidence-based support for current approaches to weight management. In fact, it suggests that these approaches may likely be doing more harm than good.
