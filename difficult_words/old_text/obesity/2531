Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), Leu, and the signaling pathways they regulate have been reported to either improve or worsen adiposity and insulin sensitivity. Therefore, it is unclear whether dietary supplementation of Leu would be beneficial. To help address this question, we examined the effect of adding Leu (150 mmol/L; Expt. 1 and Expt. 2) or BCAA (109 mmol/L of each; Expt. 3) to the drinking water on diet-induced obesity (induced with a 60-kJ% fat diet) in singly housed C57BL6/J male mice for at least 14 wk. Liquid and solid food intakes were evaluated weekly along with body weight. During the last few weeks, several blood samples were taken at different times for plasma glucose, total cholesterol, or Leu measurements. Metabolic rate by indirect calorimetry, locomotor activity by light beam breaking, body composition by H1-NMR, and insulin tolerance were also determined. Compared with control, supplementation did not affect body weight, food intake, oxygen consumption, locomotor activity, body composition, insulin tolerance, or total cholesterol. In fed mice, this method of Leu supplementation only increased plasma Leu by 76% when the supplemented group was compared with control. On the other hand, after overnight food deprivation, the plasma Leu did not differ between these 2 groups, even though the mice in the supplemented group had continuous access to Leu-containing water during the solid food deprivation. Taken together, the results do not provide evidence that either Leu or BCAA supplementation of drinking water ameliorates diet-induced obesity in mice, although it may improve glycemia.
