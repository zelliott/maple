The alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity in children in the United States and globally raises major concerns about its future adverse impact on public health. One outcome of this disturbing trend that is already evident is the rapidly increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes at all ages. This disease, once thought to be nonexistent in children, is increasing coincident with obesity. This article addresses the role that obesity plays in type 2 diabetes and also explores its effects on other types of diabetes that occur in childhood. The new challenges for physicians who formulate a differential diagnosis of diabetes in children are discussed. Also examined are modifications of traditional diabetes treatment that can be helpful in combating the insulin resistance associated with obesity and that use medications that are not traditionally used in this age group. Cases are presented to illustrate certain points. An underlying thesis suggests that specific classification may not be as important to the clinician as the understanding of pathophysiologic factors that contribute to hyperglycemia in individual patients. Recommendations are offered to the practitioner for diagnosing and treating the obese child or adolescent with diabetes.
