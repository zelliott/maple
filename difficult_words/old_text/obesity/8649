Celiprolol is a novel beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug that displays clinically favorable effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Because some other atypical beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs have been described to act as agonists on beta(3)-adrenoceptors, we aimed to investigate the effects of celiprolol on brown fat and beta(3)-adrenoceptors. Chronic treatment of obese fa/fa Zucker rats with celiprolol (50 mg/kg/day orally for 20 days) increased GDP binding to brown fat mitochondria by 1.5-fold, whereas beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist ZD7114 ((S)-4-[2-[(2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl)amino]ethoxy]-N-(2-methoxyet hyl )phenoxyacetamide, 3 mg/kg/day) increased the binding by 3.3-fold. Weight gain was reduced by 19% due to decreased water and food intakes in celiprolol-treated rats. Celiprolol did not activate lipolysis in rat adipocytes in vitro or stimulate human beta(3)-adrenoceptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells as measured with Cytosensor microphysiometer. Therefore, celiprolol does not seem to activate brown fat via beta(3)-adrenoceptors.
