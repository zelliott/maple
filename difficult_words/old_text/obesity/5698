A study of 120 patients with obesity allowed to distinguish mild, average and severe obesity grades depending on body fat mass. There was a direct correlation between the body fat mass and systolic, diastolic, pulse and average dynamic arterial pressure, the level of which rose with the increase of obesity. In mild and average obesity grades arterial pressure rose due to increase of cardiac ejection, in severe due to increase the peripheral vascular resistance.
