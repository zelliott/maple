Continuous positive energy imbalance leads to obesity, which increases the risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The hepatoprotective effect of ethyl pyruvate has been revealed in several studies. Therefore, we examined the effect of ethyl pyruvate supplementation on liver cell damage, metabolism, membrane fluidity, and oxidative stress markers in rats fed a high-fat diet. After 6-wk feeding of a control or high-fat diet, Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: control diet, control diet and ethyl pyruvate, high-fat diet, and high-fat diet and ethyl pyruvate. Ethyl pyruvate was administered as a 0.3% solution in drinking water, for the following 6 wk. Ethyl pyruvate intake attenuated the increase in activities of plasma transaminases and liver TNF-Î±. However, the supplementation was without effect in the lipid profiles, membrane fluidity or oxidative metabolism in liver induced by the high-fat diet. Our data confirm the potency of ethyl pyruvate against cell liver damage. Nevertheless, prolonged intake did not affect the development of a fatty liver.
