An 80-year-old female patient with arterial hypertension and slowly progressive deterioration of renal function was referred to our department for investigation of the renal arteries. Imaging of the renal arteries with ultrasound was inconclusive, due to obesity. Subsequently, imaging was performed with balanced turbo field echo which is a newly developed technique in our department. This new technique for the moment is still combined with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography. A therapeutic digital subtraction angiography was performed for stent placement.
