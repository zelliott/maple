We describe a technique for renal biopsy using laparoscopic guidance. Retroperitoneal laparoscopic dissection and exposure is facilitated by a simple balloon-expanding device made of a rubber glove tied around a catheter. Laparoscopic renal biopsy is associated with less morbidity than open renal biopsy and is ideal when percutaneous renal biopsy is contraindicated or is not feasible.
