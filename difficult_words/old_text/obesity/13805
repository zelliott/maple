To establish the relationship between exophthalmos and obesity.

A group of 19 obese patients (body mass index, BMI&>/=30 kg/m(2)) was compared with a control group of 45 nonobese individuals (26&> BMI&>/= 20 kg/m(2)). Both groups underwent Hertel's exophthalmometry, Goldmann applanation tonometry and measurement of the medial rectus muscle by echography.

Obese patients had higher Hertel values and enlarged medial rectus muscle diameter (p &<0.05). Indeed, bilateral exophthalmos was observed in 33% of obese subjects. However, this did not cause any ocular morbidity. In some cases the difference in intraocular pressure was enlarged but together with the exophthalmos not statistically significant.

Standard values for exophthalmometry and orbital echography may have to be adapted for obese individuals. In several cases the eye signs had a remarkable resemblance to patients with Graves' orbitopathy. So in each patient with bilateral exophthalmos and eye signs suspicious of Graves' orbitopathy obesity should be considered as a possible cause.
