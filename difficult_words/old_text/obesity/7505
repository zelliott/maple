One of the master regulators of adipogenesis and macrophage function is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). Here, we report that a deficiency of β-arrestin-1 expression affects PPARγ-mediated expression of lipid metabolic genes and inflammatory genes. Further mechanistic studies revealed that β-arrestin-1 interacts with PPARγ. β-Arrestin-1 suppressed the formation of a complex between PPARγ and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor-α through its direct interaction with PPARγ. The interaction of β-arrestin-1 with PPARγ repressed PPARγ/9-cis-retinoic acid receptor-α function but promoted PPARγ/nuclear receptor corepressor function in PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis and inflammatory gene expression. Consistent with these results, a deficiency of β-arrestin-1 binding to PPARγ abolished its suppression of PPARγ-dependent adipogenesis and inflammatory responses. These results indicate that the regulation of PPARγ by β-arrestin-1 is critical. Furthermore, in vivo expression of β-arrestin-1 (but not the binding-deficient mutant) significantly repressed adipogenesis, macrophage infiltration, and diet-induced obesity and improved glucose tolerance and systemic insulin sensitivity. Therefore, our findings not only reveal a molecular mechanism for the modulation of obesity by β-arrestin-1 but also suggest a potential tactical approach against obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.
