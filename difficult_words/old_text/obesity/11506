Body weight is among the most powerful predictors of bone status, and adipose tissue plays a substantial role in weight-related protective effects on bone. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relation between adipose tissue and bone may open up new perspectives for treatment. Leptin, which is known to regulate appetite and energy expenditures, may also contribute to mediate the effects of fat mass on bone. Although reported data are somewhat conflicting, there is some evidence that leptin may decrease bone formation via a central nervous effect and may stimulate both bone formation and bone resorption via direct peripheral effects on stromal precursor cells. The net result of these central and peripheral effects may depend on serum leptin levels and blood-brain barrier permeability, of which the first increase and the second decrease as obesity develops. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of these effects.
