The use of promotoras de salud is an increasingly widespread delivery approach for community-based health education and promotion programs targeting obesity-related lifestyle behaviors for Hispanic populations. Addressing a gap in the literature, this research examined the sustainability of promotora-led initiatives from the perspectives of those who plan, implement, and evaluate these programs. We conducted 24 in-depth interviews with program planners representing 22 promotora programs focused on Hispanic women's health in 10 states. Findings illustrated program planners' opinions regarding the components, logistics, and barriers to promotora program sustainability. Several participants challenged the notion of promotora program sustainability by reframing the issue as promoting individual promotoras' well-being and social mobility rather than maintaining their role in the program over time. Implications for community health planning, management, and policy include developing sustainability strategies during program planning stages and implementation of policies to more effectively integrate promotoras into existing health care systems at local, state, and national levels.
