Sarcopenia measured as appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), and central obesity measured as visceral fat area (VFA) may act synergistically to influence metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. However, several previous studies reported that metabolic risk is higher in non-sarcopenic obesity groups than in sarcopenic obesity groups because of the close relationship between muscle mass and body fat. We investigated the association of the ASM to VFA ratio, which we have termed the muscle-to-fat ratio (MFR), with metabolic syndrome and arterial stiffness.

This study was performed in 526 apparently healthy adults enrolled in the Korean Sarcopenic Obesity Study, an ongoing prospective observational cohort study. ASM was evaluated with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and VFA with computed tomography. Arterial stiffness was measured using brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV).

MFR was significantly associated with waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid profiles, glucose and baPWV. By multiple logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for metabolic syndrome was 5.43 (lowest versus highest tertile of MFR, 95% confidence interval, 2.56-13.34). Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that MFR was an independent determinant of baPWV (RÂ²=0.57).

MFR, a new index of sarcopenic obesity, showed an independent negative association with metabolic syndrome and arterial stiffness.
