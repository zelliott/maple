The present study includes 413 persons with overweight or obesity problems, with Body Mass Index (BMI) ranging from 26.7 to 40.2 kg/m2, who participated in a seven weeks weight reduction programme. All persons were given the opportunity either to follow a low-fat diet (1,200 kcal/d) alone or a low-fat diet combined with an exercise programme (1/2 hour walk every day). 240 persons decided to follow the full programme (diet and exercise) (group I), while 173 persons only dieted (group II). The results indicate that a combination of diet and modest exercise is superior to dieting alone when trying to achieve a reduction in weight where the major part of the weight loss is due to reduction of the fat deposits. Whether this will have an essential influence on the long-term results of different weight reduction programmes needs to be investigated in more detail.
