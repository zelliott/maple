To identify the risk factors of hypercholesterolemia among schoolchildren aged 7 to 10 years, Brazil.

A case-control study was conducted among 172 children matched by sex and age +/-3 months in Campinas, Brazil. Cases were defined as hypercholesterolemia when cholesterol (3)200 mg/dL and controls when cholesterol 140 and 170 mg/dL. Besides drawing a blood sample for cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass index and family history of cardiovascular diseases were documented. Data were analyzed through bivariate correlation using t-test for quantitative variables and Chi-square for family history of cardiovascular diseases. Odds ratio was used to estimate the risk of hypercholesterolemia.

On average, a cholesterol of 215 mg/dL for cases and 154 mg/dL for controls was found. The mean systolic blood pressure was 107 mmHg for cases and 106 mmHg for controls. The mean of diastolic blood pressure was 67 mmHg for cases and 68 mmHg for controls. The mean body mass index was 18.2 kg/m(2) in the case-group and 17.1 kg/m(2) in the control group. Bivariate analysis showed an association between hypercholesterolemia and body mass index (p=0.048). The odds ratio revealed obesity as a risk factor in this study population (OR=2.17; CI=1.05 to 4.45).

The results showed obesity as a risk factor for hypercholesterolemia.
