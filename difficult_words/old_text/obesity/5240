OM rats fed a high fat ration were heavier, fatter and had fat depots which weighed at least three times as much as those fed a low fat (grain) ration. S rats fed a high fat ration showed slight increase in fat depot weights and no increase in body weight or fat when compared to rats of the same strain fed grain. For both strains of rats fed either diet for 4, 10 or 20 wk following weaning, there was a lower percentage of TG in the inguinal depot than in the epididymal or perirenal-retroperitoneal fat depots. There was a tendency for rats fed a high fat ration to have a higher percentage of TG in adipose tissues than rats fed grain, but the differences were not significant as long as age, anatomical site and strain were constant. Strain and age had no significant effect on the percentage of TG in fat depots. The fatty acid composition of the fat depots was effected by ration, but not by age, strain or anatomical site of the fat depot.
