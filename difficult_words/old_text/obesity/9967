We analysed fasting serum insulin levels and its correlation with common internal medical diseases in 91 cases with obesity (BMI&> 24) and that in 76 nonobese cases. The mean fasting serum insulin level in obese group was higher significantly than that in nonobese group (P &<0.001). The incidences of hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, combined hyperlipidemia and serum low level of HDL-C in obese group were also higher significantly than that in nonobese group (P &<0.05 and &<0.01 respectively). The main cause of many medical diseases coexisted with obesity is hyperinsulinemia. We think that the first choice of therapy to this kind of diseases should be to reduce the body weight and to decrease the insulin resistance.
