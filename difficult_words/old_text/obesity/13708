Single 25 mg intravenous and 50 mg oral doses of trazodone were given to 43 healthy subjects, divided into young men and women (aged 18 to 40 years) and elderly men and women (aged 60 to 76 years). Among men, trazodone volume of distribution (Varea) was increased in elderly vs. young subjects (1.15 vs. 0.89 L/kg; P less than 0.05), and clearance decreased (1.65 vs. 2.31 ml/min/kg; P less than 0.05), thereby increasing elimination half-life (t1/2) in elderly men (8.2 vs. 4.7 hours; P less than 0.001). Varea in women was also increased in the elderly (1.5 vs. 1.27 L/kg; P less than 0.02), causing increased t1/2 (7.6 vs. 5.9 hours; P less than 0.05), but clearance was unrelated to age. Absolute bioavailability of oral trazodone averaged 70% to 90% and was unrelated to age or sex. In 23 obese subjects (mean weight 112 kg) vs. 23 matched control subjects of normal weight (mean 65 kg), Varea was greatly increased (162 vs. 67 L; 1.43 vs. 1.04 L/kg; P less than 0.001) and was highly correlated with body weight (r = 0.91). Clearance was unchanged between groups (146 vs. 136 ml/min), but the increased Varea caused prolonged t1/2 in obese subjects (13.3 vs. 5.9 hours; P less than 0.001). Reduced clearance of trazodone among elderly men may indicate a need for dosage reduction during chronic therapy. In obese individuals, choice of dosage during chronic treatment should be based on ideal rather than total body weight.
