Obesity has been associated with worse postoperative outcomes. No data are available regarding short-term results after liver resection (LR). The aim of this study was to analyse outcomes in obese patients (body mass index [BMI]&> 30 kg/m(2) ) undergoing LR.

85 consecutive obese patients undergoing LR between 1998 and 2008 were matched on a ratio of 1:2 with 170 non-obese patients. Matching criteria were diagnosis, ASA score, METAVIR fibrosis score, extent of LR, and Child-Pugh score in patients with cirrhosis.

Operative time, blood loss and blood transfusions were similar in the two groups. Mortality was 2.4% in both groups. Morbidity was significantly higher in the obese group (32.9% vs. 21.2%; P= 0.041). However, only grade II morbidity was increased in obese patients (14.1% vs. 1.8%; P &<0.001) and this was mainly related to abdominal wall complications (8.2% vs. 2.4%; P= 0.046). No differences were encountered in terms of grade III or IV morbidity. The same results were observed in major LR and cirrhotic patients. When patients were stratified by BMI (&<0, 20-25, 25-30 and&>30 kg/m(2) ), progressive increases in overall and infectious morbidity were observed (5.6%, 22.4%, 23.7%, 32.9%, and 5.6%, 11.8%, 14.5%, 18.8%, respectively). Rates of grade III and IV morbidity did not change.

Obese patients have increased postoperative morbidity after LR in comparison with non-obese patients, but this is mainly related to minor abdominal wall complications. Severe morbidity rates and mortality are similar to those in non-obese patients, even in cirrhosis or after major LR.
