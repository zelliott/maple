Heightened sympathetic nervous system activity, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hyperleptinemia contribute to obesity-related hypertension. However, the precise mechanism and sequence of events in this pathophysiologic event have not been clarified. This review concentrates on studies helping to clarify the mechanisms of blood pressure elevation associated with weight change, concentrating on the temporal changes in neuroendocrine factors that are known to control energy metabolism and blood pressure. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of obesity-related hypertension may help in prevention, treatment, and slowing of the cardiovascular complications of obesity.
