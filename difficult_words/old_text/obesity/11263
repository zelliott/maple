The present study aimed to investigate the regulation and involvement of miR-221 in the differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs). The relationships between miR-221 and pro-inflammatory markers and adipokines were also explored.

Eight adipose tissues were obtained from four obese (mean body mass index (BMI) =31.7 kg/m(2)) and four lean (mean BMI= 21.5 kg/m(2)) women. hASCs were induced to differentiate, and the related gene expression were measured in the hASC-differentiated adipocytes using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR).

During adipogenesis, miR-221 was significantly down-regulated; furthermore, miR-221 levels were lower in hASC-differentiated adipocytes from obese subjects than in the corresponding adipocytes from lean subjects. Higher TNF-Î± mRNA levels were associated with lower levels of miR-221. In addition, the miR-221 levels in the adipocytes were inversely correlated with BMI.

Our results support the link between miR-221 and obesity development as well as obesity related inflammatory status.
