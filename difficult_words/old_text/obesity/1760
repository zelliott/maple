Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified some common variants associated with obesity risk in European descents. However, their influences on obesity-related indices for the Chinese children at puberty are not widely clear yet. To address this question, we conducted a study that aims to examine effects of eight previously reported GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on four obesity-related indices in a sample of Chinese children aged 10-12 years.

Anthropometric indices were measured in 1688 children (10.8Â±0.4 years, boys=877, girls=811) from Shanghai Children's Sleep Project. Eight SNPs within the NEGR1, TMEM18, GNPDA2, MTCH2, SH2B1, FTO, MC4R and KCTD15 genes were genotyped using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Linear regression and genetic additive model were used to test for the association betweens SNPs and obesity-related indices (weight, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio and body fat).

Only two SNPs, rs6548238 (TMEM18) and rs9939609 (FTO), were associated with all obesity-related indices with P&<.05. After adjusting for multiple tests, rs9939609 is the only one significantly associated with the indices. SNPs, rs6548238 and rs9939609 explained 0.28% (P=0.03) and 0.54% (P=0.002) variance of BMI, respectively, that are almost two-fold of the previously GWAS-reported effects. In addition, rs6548238 was associated with four indices in boys, but not in girls. In contrast, rs9939609 showed a strong association only in girls. Six other SNPs, rs2815752 (NEGR1), rs10938397 (GNPDA2), rs10838738 (MTCH2), rs7498665 (SH2B1), rs17782313 (MC4R) and rs11084753 (KCTD15), were not associated with obesity (&>0.05).

Variants of TMEM18 and FTO are associated with obesity indices during puberty in Chinese children, but candidate SNPs of NEGR1, GNPDA2, MTCH2, SH2B1, MC4R and KCTD15 have no significant effects on obesity indices. The findings also suggest that obesity susceptibility genes may exert more obvious effects during children's puberty. In addition, gender differences may exist in various obesity-related genes.
