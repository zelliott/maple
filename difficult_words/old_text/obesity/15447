The objectives of the study were (1) to determine the prevalence of eating pathology in patients before bariatric surgery and at follow-up; (2) to assess the relationship of presurgical eating pathology to various measures of psychopathology; and (3) to assess the relationship between presurgical eating pathology and outcome.

One hundred sixteen patients were evaluated prior to surgery and at follow-up an average of 5.5 years after surgery.

Preoperative binge eating occurred in 52% of patients, 16% met criteria for binge eating disorder, and 10% had the night eating syndrome. All three forms of presurgical eating pathology were statistically associated with cognitive distortions. At follow-up, 33% of patients were vomiting at least weekly. There was no relationship between presurgical eating pathology and weight outcome or presence of vomiting at follow-up.

Although postoperative vomiting usually does not represent purge behavior, it may represent failed attempts to binge.
