In the last thirty years, sociocultural and political changes have profoundly affected the way of life of the Cree and Inuit of Northern Qu√©bec. Their health status profile has also changed. This study presents the main results of a health survey performed among the Cree and Inuit in 1982-1984 by a multidisciplinary team. Obesity, arterial hypertension, hyperuricemia and diabetes mellitus while almost unknown in the past, have now been added to the list of Cree and Inuit health problems. Crees have the highest risk for obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Hyperuricemia for unknown reasons seems more prevalent among the Inuit. Our findings suggest that further in-depth studies of chronic conditions in these communities are needed.
