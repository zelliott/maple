The incidence of children in the United States who are overweight or obese is increasing at an alarming rate, and many obesity-related complications are now being described in children. There appears to be no current pharmacologic treatment or surgical procedure that is both safe and effective for millions of obese children.

The complications of pediatric obesity are discussed, as well as current medical and surgical management of this disorder.
