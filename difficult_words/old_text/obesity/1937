In this naturalistic study employing intensive interviews and anthropometric measures, an educationally and economically diverse community-based sample of 40 African American and 40 Euro-American women described their lifetime experiences with weight management. Twenty types of weight loss methods were identified and grouped into one of three categories: lifestyle work, head work, and professional services. The most frequently used weight loss methods were from the lifestyle work category, with the leading methods identified as exercise on own and reduce high calorie and/or increase low calorie foods. African Americans and Euro-Americans overwhelmingly used similar weight loss methods, with the only significant difference occurring in the more frequent use of commercial diet products among the African American group. Methods from the head work category were used significantly more often by women with higher social status, while heavier women more frequently sought professional services to lose weight than thinner women. The Euro-American women engaged in weight loss methods for significantly longer periods of time and were found to weigh significantly less than the African American women. These findings suggest that the shorter duration of weight loss attempts may be a major factor contributing to the larger body size in African American women.
