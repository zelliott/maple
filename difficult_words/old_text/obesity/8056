The authors collected data with Countrywide Integrated Noncommunicable Diseases Intervention Programme (CINDI Programme) questionnaire, in Lódź an industrial city of Poland. One of the purposes of CINDI Programme was to evaluate the impact of socioeconomic status, lifestyle and stress on health status in elderly. Obesity is a very important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), some pulmonary, neoplasmatic and motoric system diseases. The main purpose of this paper was to examine the effect of income, education, lifestyle and stress on BMI (body mass index) and WHR (waist/hip ratio) in older population of Lódź (age 65 + years). The study was conducted according to WHO standards set for CINDI Programme. The surveys were directed at random samples and sent to 1461 men and women age 65. An overall response rate was 57.1%. We have found that lower educational level and low physical activity are the predictors of obesity in our population. We have observed an inverse correlation between smoking and BMI and WHR. Stress associated with the feeling of not being able to fulfil the demands of everyday life was a strong predictor of obesity in woman. Income, family status and food habits were not associated with obesity in elderly. As we gain new knowledge about older population, we may be able to more accurately and effectively target preventive services and help older adults make health decisions to reduce diseases' risk factors and increase their quality of life.
