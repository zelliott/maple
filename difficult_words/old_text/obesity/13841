Protein and lipid components of blood serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) responsible for their functional activity were studied before and after fat load in subjects with normal body mass and various types of obesity. Subjects with abdominal obesity compared with those with gluteo-femoral obesity and normal body mass initially had pronounced disturbances in components of HDL and their acceptor capacity. Fat load caused changes of HDL composition in all study groups. Postprandial effect in persons with normal body mass became obvious 6 hours after load while in those with excess mass it occurred earlier - 3 hours after fatty meal. In subjects with gluteo-femoral obesity this effect remained on the same level while in those with abdominal obesity it became more pronounced by hour 6. Contrary to subjects with normal body mass and gluteo-femoral obesity fat load induced changes of HDL components in persons with abdominal obesity were not associated with augmented acceptor capacity of HDL what could be considered as proatherogenic effect.
