The relationship between plasma insulin level and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was investigated by multiple linear regression procedure in 410 Chinese non-diabetics. The significant positive correlation between SBP and 2-hour plasma insulin (INS 2h) after 75g glucose load was found in the BMI (body mass index) 15.9-27.0 group (n = 287) after the adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking and plasma cholesterol (P = 0.01). However, this significant correlation was gradually diminished with the expansion of the BMI range, ie. P = 0.04 in the BMI 15.9-29.0 (n = 356) group, P = 0.07 in the BMI 15.9-31 (n = 389) group, and P = 0.12 in the BMI 15.9-33 (n = 402) group after the same adjustment of variables. Interestingly, the significant inverse correlation between insulin-BMI interaction term (product of BMI and insulin) and SBP was found (P = 0.04) in the presence of the significant positive correlation between 2-hour plasma insulin and SBP (P = 0.02) after adjustment of the above mentioned five factors in the whole group (BMI 15.9-42.2, n = 410). These results indicated that SBP is independently correlated with plasma insulin level in the studied population, and that the severer obesity may interfere the net effects of insulin on the elevating of blood pressure.
