Adipose tissue growth has been proposed to involve recruitment of new blood vessels. Here, we test the hypothesis that delivery of an angiogenesis inhibitor in mice may prevent diet-induced obesity, the most common type of obesity in humans. We show that systemic administration of a selective angiogenesis inhibitor, TNP-470 (AGM-1470), prevents obesity in high caloric diet-fed wt mice as well as in genetically leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Inhibition of obesity in mice by TNP-470 involves a reduction of vascularity in the adipose tissue. This therapeutic strategy appears to selectively affect the growth of adipose tissue as measured by the ratio between total fat and lean body mass. Interestingly, the treatment with TNP-470 results in decreased serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, insulin levels are reduced, which indicates increased insulin sensitivity, suggesting that angiogenesis inhibitors may prevent the development of type II diabetes. Our findings suggest that similarly to growth and organogenesis in other tissues, adipose tissue growth is dependent on angiogenesis. Our observations may have conceptual implications for the prevention of obesity and related disorders.
