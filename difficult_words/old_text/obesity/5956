Obesity prevalence is increasing worldwide, with inadequate nutrition and physical inactivity as the main risk factors. The objective was to evaluate the impact of a nutritional intervention and physical activity program on body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in adult women. This quasi-experimental study, lasting 12 months, enrolled 69 adult women that reported physical activity three times a week, besides receiving nutritional counseling and lectures on healthy living, evaluated at baseline and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Lower levels of physical activity and higher intake of high-risk foods were associated with a 2.28 cm increase in mean WC, has compared to higher physical activity and lower intake of high-risk foods (p &<0.01). Lower levels of physical activity associated with high intake of protective foods increased the mean BMI by 0.68 kg/m(2), as compared to higher physical activity and high intake of protective foods. The intervention was positively associated with the target parameters.
