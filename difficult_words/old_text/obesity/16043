Nutritional status and metabolic fuels are factors involved in the regulation of GH secretion and GH responses to GHRH. The effects of feeding on GHRH-induced GH release were studied in 13 normal women, 14 obese women, and 9 women with anorexia nervosa. GHRH-(1-44) (50 micrograms, iv) was administered at 0900 h after an overnight fast or at 1300 h after a normal meal at 0800 h, and at the same times 45 min after a 800-Cal meal on different days. The mean peak plasma GH responses to GHRH administered before a meal at 0900 h were 52.8 +/- 5.6 (+/- SE) micrograms/L in normal women, 8.2 +/- 1.3 micrograms/L in obese women, and 53.2 +/- 7.7 micrograms/L in anorexic women. When GHRH was administered before a meal at 1300 h, the mean peak plasma GH levels were lower than those at 0900 h; this reduction was -64.2% in normal women, -64.9% in obese women, and -55.8% in women with anorexia nervosa. After feeding, the plasma GH responses to GHRH were blunted in normal women at 0900 h (-60.9%) and 1300 h (-34.6%) compared with the fasting peak responses. In obese women the plasma GH response to GHRH after feeding was increased compared with that when these women had fasted (+60% at 0900 h and +406.9% at 1300 h). Finally, differential effects of feeding were present in anorexic women; the response was lower at 0900 h (-46.4%) and greater at 1300 h (+50.8%). We conclude that there is an ultradian variation in GHRH-stimulated GH secretion and that the responses differ according to nutritional status and body weight.
