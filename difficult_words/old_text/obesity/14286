The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of obesity and overweight among 3 year-old children, to identify risk factors for development of obesity and overweight and to examine parents' motivation for treatment.

A questionnaire was sent out to all 1799 parents living in the municipality of Aalborg with children turning 3 in 2002. Data on non-responders was collected from their general practitioners. Based on the questionnaire, the Body Mass Index at the 3 year-old child's health check-up and the prevalence of obesity/overweight were calculated and risk factors were elucidated.

Based on figures from 92% of the children examined, a total of 10.4% of the children were overweight or obese at the 3-year health check-up. Among the 46% who completed the questionnaire, we found high birth weight, obese mothers, and low social groups (unskilled workers or unemployed/disabled pensioners/students) to be risk factors for overweight or obesity at the age of 3 years, and a trend that non-Danish families had more obese children. A total of 94% of the participating parents of the overweight/obese children are positive towards an offer of intervention.

We found 10.4% overweight and obese 3 year-olds. The parents of these children are positive towards offers of intervention.
