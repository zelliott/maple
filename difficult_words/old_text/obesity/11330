Excessive increases in percentage body fat (%BF) according to sex may pose greater risks of chronic diseases.

To evaluate trends of body composition according to sexual maturation stage and body mass index (BMI) of adolescents.

Data about weight, height, lean mass, fat mass, %BF, BMI and sexual maturation of 1345 private school students (685 girls) aged from 7 to 18 years were collected in 2001 and compared with data of 1450 students (750 girls) collected in 2010 in Campinas, Brazil. Ï‡2-test, ANOVA and logistic regression were used for statistical analyses (p&<.05).

Obesity prevalence increased, and number of boys and girls with normal BMI (p=0.0183 and p=0.0041) decreased. Differences in the median values of the study variables according to time point and nutritional diagnosis were not significant, except for lean mass (p=0.0484) and height (p=0.0275) in B2 (Breast stage) and %BF (p=0.0324) in G5 (Genitalia stage).

Body composition did not change significantly, although overweight increased.
