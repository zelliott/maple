To determine whether leptin is involved in ovarian function.

Fasting serum samples were obtained from 20 women with normal menstrual cycles who were either obese or non-obese: 12 non-obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), 8 obese patients with PCOS, 10 patients with stress-related hypothalamic amenorrhea, and 8 patients with weight loss-related hypothalamic amenorrhea.

Serum leptin levels were strongly related to body mass index (BMI) in each group, but there was no difference in the mean serum leptin levels among the BMI-matched study groups. A significant difference in the mean serum leptin levels was found between the non-obese and obese control groups (P&<.001) and between the non-obese and obese PCOS groups (P&<.001).

These findings indicate that circulating leptin levels in women with normal menstrual cycles and those with ovarian dysfunction are strongly related to BMI. Leptin does not appear to be primarily involved in regulating ovarian function.
