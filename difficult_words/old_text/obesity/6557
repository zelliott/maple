Anthropometry was conducted, and incidence rate of certain diseases in the investigated subjects was recorded. Excessive body mass was revealed in 36.1%, among them obesity was diagnosed in 23.7%. The obesity incidence increases with aging and decreasing of physical load level. Obesity was more frequently observed among the urban women than among the rural, and it was less frequent among the urban than among the rural men.
