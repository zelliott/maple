Obese people with a high waist/hip ratio (W/H ratio) have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The present study was designed to separately analyze the importance of obesity and the regional fat distribution for the metabolic risk factors. Blood pressure, glucose tolerance, insulin, and plasma lipid levels were studied in lean and obese postmenopausal women with a high or low W/H ratio. The individuals within each group were carefully matched for age, lean body mass, and body fat. The risk factors associated with a high W/H ratio (elevated blood pressure, blood lipids, and glucose levels) were found in the obese but not in the lean women. Furthermore, lean women with a high W/H ratio tended to have a lower metabolic risk factor profile than obese women with a low W/H ratio. These findings document the importance of obesity in expressing the metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease associated with a high W/H ratio.
