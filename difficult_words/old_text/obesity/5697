A total of 482 patients (271 without any signs of cardiovascular diseases and 211 with angina pectoris) grouped in accordance with the degree of obesity were examined for central hemodynamics (CHD) by means of tetrapolar rheography. The most pronounced changes were recorded in patients with chronic coronary heart disease (CCHD) coupled with obesity, less pronounced in patients without obesity (the difference was significant). The same regularity was established in practically healthy persons: in those with obesity, the hemodynamic shifts significantly differed from the shifts seen in patients without obesity and appeared similar to the parameters of patients with CCHD. A noticeable correlation was established between the CHD parameters and Quetelet's index.
