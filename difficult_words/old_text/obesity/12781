A 32-year-old obese female was hospitalized with dyspnea. Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular dilatation. Chest X-ray film showed enlarged heart size and prominent pulmonary congestion. Simple obesity with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to cardiomyopathy of obesity was diagnosed according to the absence of obvious disease that caused obesity or CHF. After diet therapy and medication, subjective symptoms disappeared and body weight was reduced from 137 kg to 85 kg. Although few reports of cardiomyopathy of obesity have been reported in Japan, we propose the possibility that similar cases will be on the increase because Japanese dietary habits are now becoming more similar to those of Caucasians.
