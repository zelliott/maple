The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of overweight and obesity and the fat distribution pattern in Mbyá-Guaraní children and adults from Misiones, Argentina. Height, weight, and triceps and subscapular skinfolds were measured in 197 individuals aged 2-60 years. Body mass index (BMI), fat and muscle areas, and subscapular/tricipital index were calculated. All data were transformed to z-scores using US references (NHANES I and II). Overweight and obesity were defined as BMIs between the 85th-95th or above the 95th percentile, respectively. Compared to NHANES references, the Mbyá were shorter and lighter, although their BMI was slightly higher. There were no substantial differences in body composition (fat and muscle) between the Mbyá and the reference. Prevalences of overweight and obesity reached (on average) 16.2 and 14.7%, respectively, and were similar in both sexes. Stunting was higher in females than in males (49.6 vs. 33.3%). Sixty percent of overweight and obese subjects showed a centralized adiposity pattern, and 49% had a high risk for abdominal adiposity. The present results provide new evidence of a striking increase in obesity rates in Amerindians as a part of the process of nutritional transition. The contribution of each component of energy balance, physical activity, and lifestyle could play an important role in this observed tendency, justifying further research in these transitional populations.
