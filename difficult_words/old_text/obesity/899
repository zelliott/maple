Locus of control scales have been used to measure 'effectiveness' or personal control in patients with eating disorders. A locus of control of behaviour scale was used in a community sample of women with a spectrum of eating pathology from bulimia nervosa to chronic dieting as well as in a comparison group of non-dieters. This scale appeared to add nothing over and above general measures of psychopathology as assessed by the Clinical Interview Schedule and the Symptom Rating Test, or more specific measures such as the Eating Attitudes Test.
