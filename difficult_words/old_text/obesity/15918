Health Education Through Extension Leaders (HEEL) is one of the solutions the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture has created to address the problem of chronic disease in Kentucky. Building on the land grant model for education, outreach, and prevention, HEEL collaborates and partners with the academic health centers, area health education centers, the Center for Rural Health, the Kentucky Cancer Program, the Markey Cancer Center, the University of Kansas Wellness Program, and the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services to implement research-based preventive programs to the county extension agents across Kentucky. Extension agents are an instrumental bridge between the communities across Kentucky and the educational resources provided by the HEEL program.
