A total of 30 patients with alimentary obesity of the I-IV stage, aged from 18 to 40 years, were under study. No diseases of the digestive system were recorded in their anamnesis. Quantitative estimation of intragastric proteolysis (IP) was used for the study of the food action on the gastric secretory function. The protein substrate enclosed into a vinyl chloride tube was introduced into the gastric cavity, then it was removed, and the amount of the digested protein was estimated in micrograms/h. It has been established that the mean level of IP activity in obese patients is significantly higher than in healthy subjects with normal body mass. The investigations conducted have shown that there is a relationship between the IP changes under the action of food and its buffer effect estimated in vitro. The in vitro study of the influence of separate foods on the concentration of hydrogen ions in the acid gastric contents have shown that the buffer effect of the products studied as intensified as follows: tea, bread, milk, meat. The neutralizing effect of a combination of several foodstuffs is determined by the buffer properties of separate products included into the complex.
