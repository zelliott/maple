This article details two studies of the reliability and validity of three instruments to measure body image and suggestions for their use in interventions for weight control programs. Weight control programs often fail because there is no attempt to modify clients' negative body images; hence clients may regain weight to match incorrect images. Short, easily administered instruments, such as the Nash Body Image Scale, the Body Image Photo Technique, and the Body Shape Questionnaire used in these studies, are needed to evaluate clients' progress in weight control programs. Subjects were 120 women who were either satisfied or dissatisfied with their body image and weight. All subjects completed body image measures at the outset of the study and 43 subjects completed measures again to determine trait stability of body image at 1 year. Cronbach's alpha estimates provided evidence of reliability, with internal consistency coefficients ranging from .83 to .96. Validity of the measures was supported by significant correlations with scores on the Physical subscale of the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (r = .60 to .63) as well as by significant differences on the three measures between normal-weight and overweight groups (Nash: F = 28.03, p = .001; Photo: F = 11.58, p = .001). Body image was found to be stable over the 1-year period on the Nash Body Image Scale and the Body Image Photo Technique. These instruments can provide valuable information and potential intervention content for practitioners and researchers alike. The three body image instruments discussed were found to have sufficient reliability and validity to warrant their use in practice and research.
