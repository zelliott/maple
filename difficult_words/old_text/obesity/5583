1. Hypothalamic insulin (HI) is well known for its role in feeding regulation. In addition, its concentration is modified in response to meals. Recent studies suggest that brain insulin participates in memory processes, possibly through stimulation by glucose. 2. The present microdialysis study focused on local in vivo regulation of HI by glucose and on the effects of aging on HI, since aging is characterized by deterioration of memory, body weight regulation, and central glucose utilization. Glucose (8 mM) infused for 5 min increased extracellular HI levels rapidly, by 4.6-fold, and cerebellar insulin levels by 0.4-fold only, suggesting a specific area-dependent regulation of HI by glucose. Neither insulinemia nor glycemia were affected, suggesting a central mechanism. The same dose of glucose induced a modest (0.4-fold), delayed (45 min) increase in hypothalamic serotonin, suggesting that the effect of glucose on HI is independent of a previously defined local serotonin-induced insulin release. HI levels in old normal weight rats were half the levels of young rats. In genetically old obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats, HI concentration was 30% of that in young normal rats, suggesting a deterioration of HI availability when aging and obesity are combined. 3. The above results, in line with recent considerations on a potential role of central insulin in learning and memory, suggest particular effects of HI on feeding and memory and probably on a specific "memory for food."
