This investigation examined the psychometric characteristics of the Revised Restraint Scale and its two subscales (Weight Fluctuation, Concern for Dieting) in a university with a diverse student population. Subjects were 497 individuals (151 men, 346 women) ranging in age from 17 to 57 years (mean age = 21 years). Of the total sample, 70% were White (n = 348) and 22% were Black (n = 109). Results indicated significant between-groups differences on the total Restraint scores, with Whites scoring higher than Blacks, females scoring higher than males, and overweight individuals scoring higher than normal weight individuals. Similar results were found with both of the subscales. Despite the large number of between-groups differences observed, internal reliabilities of the total scale and the two subscales were similar and generally high within each of the categories surveyed. In general, however, lower reliabilities were observed for overweight subjects compared to normal weight subjects. The results of this study suggest that restraint status may vary as a function of individuals' demographic characteristics.
