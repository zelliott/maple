1477 employees (868 males and 609 females) were examined for cardiac risk factors. The risk factor frequency was tested in relation to the amount of physical activity. Men and women active in sports are less subject to over-weight, diabetes, high blood pressure, and pathological ECG changes than are physically inactive; males who participate in sports also smoke less. On the other hand, a connection between risk factors and different levels of physical activity on the job could not be established. The mutual relations between risk factors, physical activity, weight, and social level imply that the lower number of risk factors in those who participate in sports is due largely to their consciously healthy way of living.
