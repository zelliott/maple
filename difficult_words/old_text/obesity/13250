It is increasingly recognized that host factors can modulate the fibrogenic response in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Obesity, because of its prevalence, and diabetes, which seems to occur more frequently in patients infected by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), are often present in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Both conditions result in fatty liver, which in turn is associated with more severe liver damage, especially fibrosis or inflammation. Steatosis can either originate from associated metabolic alterations (insulin resistance resulting in metabolic steatosis) or from a direct cytopathic effect of the virus (genotype 3, resulting in viral steatosis). Metabolic steatosis seems to be a factor in resistance to antiviral therapy, whereas viral steatosis is reduced in sustained responders. Whether metabolic steatosis has a direct role in liver fibrosis progression or is only a surrogate marker of an underlying defect triggering fibrogenesis, such as insulin resistance, is a subject of debate. High serum glucose levels and diabetes have a strong and independent profibrogenic impact. Exciting new data are expanding our understanding of the mechanisms of steatogenesis in HCV infection and providing potential links between insulin resistance or hyperglycemic states and liver fibrogenesis.
