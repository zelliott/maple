The aim of this study was to examine whether overweight binge eaters demonstrate similar perceptions of family interactions and views of the self as do normal-weight bulimics. We compared 37 obese binge eaters and 37 normal-weight bulimics to 38 normal-weight non-bulimic controls, and 10 overweight nonbulimic controls on the Bulimia Test (BULIT). Profile of Mood States (POMS), Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) Short Form, which includes measure of hostility of family interactions and self-directed hostility; the Family Interaction Survey (FIS), and a measure of history of physical and sexual abuse and familial psychopathology. Both normal-weight bulimics and overweight binge eaters differed from nonbulimic controls across all measures of symptomatology, family functioning, history of abuse, familial psychopathology, and self-directed hostility. Normal-weight bulimics demonstrated significantly higher BULIT scores and self-directed hostility than did overweight binge eaters. Post hoc analysis showed that among binge eaters and bulimics, self-directed hostility accounted for a significant percentage of the variance of BULIT scores when controlling for the effects of age, BMI, family hostility, and mood. The possible role of self-directed hostility in the maintenance of bulimic symptomatology is discussed.
