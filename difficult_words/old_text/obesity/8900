The neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) was originally isolated from the pituitary of salmon, in which it causes skin paling. MCH is also found abundantly in mammalian neurons, and has been detected in the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta, brain regions that are at the center of feeding behavior. Acute central administration of MCH leads to a rapid and significant increase in food intake, while MCH expression changes in states of altered energy balance, such as fasting and obesity. Furthermore, MCH knockout mice tend toward hypophagia and leanness. In 1999, we and four other groups identified an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) as a specific receptor for MCH (MCH-1 receptor). Although a second MCH receptor (MCH-2 receptor) was isolated in humans, it was found to be non-functional or encode a non-functional pseudogene in non-human species, including rodents. The discovery of these MCH receptors permitted the launch of a broad array of drug screening efforts and three MCH-1 receptor antagonists were identified to reduce food intake and body weight. Interestingly, some antagonists unexpectedly produced evidence that blockade of these receptors has antidepressant and anxiolytic activities. The expressions of the MCH receptors, which have been implicated in regulating emotion, stress and motivation, make MCH an excellent candidate for integrating the various homeostatic stimuli necessary for maintaining the proper conditions of energy metabolism and other physiological functions. Finally, the speed at which MCH receptor studies have been undertaken exemplifies the impact that this deorphanized GPCR will have on setting the stage for more detailed physiological studies.
