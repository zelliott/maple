To evaluate the effect of risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) on urokinase receptor (uPAR) expression on monocytes.

A total of 106 patients were enrolled and divided into five risk-factor groups: sixteen with hypertension, twenty-four with dyslipidemia, eighteen with hypertension + obesity, eighteen with dyslipidemia + obesity and thirty with hypertension + dyslipidemia + obesity. Seventeen healthy volunteers were recruited as control group. Monocyte expression of uPAR and mean fluorescence intensity index (MFI Index) of uPAR were measured by flow cytometer (FACSCalibur).

No difference in monocyte uPAR expression was detected between hypertension and control group [(4.9 +/- 12.5)% vs. (7.7 +/- 10.3)%, P=0.74]. However, the uPAR expression was raised to (23.7 +/- 22.5)% in hyperlipidemia group, a 3.9- and a 2.1-fold increase compared with those in hypertension (P&<.01) and control group (P&<.05), respectively. When combined with obesity, uPAR expression was elevated further to (32.9 +/- 30.8)% in hypertension + obesity group, (37.4 +/- 31.4)% in dyslipidemia + obesity group and (23.8 +/- 20.5)% in hypertension + dyslipidemia + obesity group, all having statistical significance compared with control group or hypertension group (P&<.01). The results were the same when corrected by age, BMI and hs-CRP. uPAR MFI Index was increased from 0.78 +/- 0.86 in control group to 1.91 +/- 1.97 and 3.33 +/- 2.52 in dyslipidemia group and hypertension + obesity group, respectively, P&<.05. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between uPAR expression and FBG concentration in dyslipidemia group, r=0.72, P=0.04.

uPAR expression was elevated on monocytes in patients with risk factors for CAD. Dyslipidemia and obesity may contribute to the increase of uPAR expression.
