The prevalence of being at risk of overweight, overweight, pre-diabetes, and type 2 diabetes is increasing in the United States in youth. Primary care providers must understand how the emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes developed during the past several decades to accurately diagnose it in young patients. Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention interventions are needed to address the emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes in youth. Primary prevention involves delaying the development of type 2 diabetes by reducing the prevalence of overweight. Secondary prevention is aimed at preventing those with pre-diabetes from developing diabetes, and tertiary prevention is aimed at preventing the complications of type 2 diabetes.
