To determine whether or not impaired male sex behavior in obese male Zucker rats is accompanied by any anatomical alterations in a hypothalamic area implicated in the control of sex behavior, 6 lean and 5 obese male Zucker rats were studied behaviorally and anatomically at 14 months of age. Obese males showed markedly decreased male sex behavior relative to lean males, in spite of serum levels of testosterone and testicular weights comparable to those of lean rats. Obese rats had significant decreases in brain weight and volumes of sexually dimorphic nuclei per g of brain, relative to lean rats; volumes per g brain of other structures (paraventricular and suprachiasmatic nuclei) were not different between groups. It is suggested that an incomplete expression of sexually dimorphic features of the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus, due perhaps to an impaired process of perinatal brain androgenization, may contribute to decreased male sex behavior in adult obese rats.
