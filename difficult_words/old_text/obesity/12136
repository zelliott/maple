The incidence of diabetes mellitus by clinical type was determined for the community of Rochester, Minnesota, 1945-69. Overall adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were 8.4 for IDDM, 80.1 for obese NIDDM, 45.6 for nonobese NIDDM, and 3.6 for secondary diabetes, using our definitions. Strict use of National Diabetes Data Group criteria would have reduced the apparent incidence of all diabetes by about 20% through the deletion of NIDDM cases. The National Diabetes Data Group classification improved the clinical homogeneity of IDDM patients compared with "juvenile-onset" diabetes but had little effect on NIDDM relative to "maturity-onset" diabetes, since essentially the same patients were included in both groups. Separation of NIDDM into obese and nonobese subcategories accomplished little in the way of defining two more homogeneous subgroups.
