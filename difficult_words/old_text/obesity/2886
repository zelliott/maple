This retrospective study examined whether alternate day steroid therapy decreased the incidence or severity of side effects of prednisone without decreasing renal function. We conclude that alternate day steroid therapy is indicated in adult renal transplant recipients to treat steroid-induced diabetes, hypertension and minor prednisone side effects, but is not useful for obesity. Further, alternate day steroid therapy can be used safely without compromising renal function or graft survival.
