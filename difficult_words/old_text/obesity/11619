Serum C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR)/immunoreactive insulin (IRI) molar ratio was determined in 136 subjects without renal, hepatic and thyroid disorders, at fasting, and during the initial period of 75 g-oral glucose tolerance test. The subjects were divided into 4 groups based on their body weight and age; Group A, young (&<55 years) and normal body weight (body mass index [BMI, kg/m2] &<or = 25) subjects; Group B, young and overweight (BMI&> 25) subjects; Group C, aged &> or = 55 years) and normal body weight (BMI &<or = 25) subjects; Group D, aged and overweight subjects. Fasting CPR/IRI ratio and absolute CPR level negatively correlated in Groups B and D but not in A and C. After oral glucose load with elevation of insulin, CPR/IRI ratio invariably declined in all groups and significant negative correlation between CPR/IRI and CPR was found in Groups A, B and D but not in C. Slope of the regression lines obtained for correlation between CPR/IRI ratio and CPR were significantly steeper at fasting compared to the post-stimulation phase. CPR/IRI ratio is affected by hyperinsulinemia and oral glucose load but not by obesity alone. Assuming that CPR/IRI ratio reflects hepatic extraction of insulin, the insulin clearance at fasting is progressively reduced with increasing insulin secretion in overweight subjects: failure to detect such phenomenon in normal body weight subjects may be due to a narrower CPR range in this population. Insulin metabolism at fasting and during glucose stimulation is likely to be regulated by distinct factors.
