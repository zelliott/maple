We measured gene expression of paracrine regulators involved in adipocyte differentiation within the stromovascular fraction of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue from obese individuals with (n=30) and without (n=18) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite similar adiposity by design, subjects with T2DM had larger adipocytes (0.92+/-0.28 vs. 0.75+/-0.17 microl, p&<.05) than controls. Gene expression of the adipogenic marker aP2 was lower (0.35+/-0.16 vs. 0.58+/-0.27 arbitrary units, p&<.05) whereas the expression of matricellular peptidase, MMP2 was higher (1.65+/-0.17 vs. 1.27+/-0.21, p=0.02) in T2DM vs. controls. The gene expression levels between the aP2 and MMP2 were inversely correlated (r=-0.32, p=0.03). We conclude that early steps of adipogenesis may be impaired in T2DM independently of obesity due, in part, to an upregulation of the MMP2 transcription.
