Endothelial dysfunction and carotid intima-media thickeness (IMT) are currently considered key early events in atherogenesis and markers of arterial damage. We investigated whether endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) glutamate (Glu)298-aspartate (Asp) polymorphism may influence the vascular response to weight, as measured by BMI, in young, healthy individuals.

One hundred young (30.6 ± 5.9 years) healthy individuals, without concomitant traditional cardiovascular risk factors took part in the study. Brachial artery endothelial function was assessed by vascular response to reactive hyperemia [flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and sublingual nitroglycerin (GTN)-mediated dilation] using high-resolution ultrasound. Carotid IMT was also measured.

Participants were grouped as Glu-homozygotes (n = 38) and Asp-carriers (n = 62). On univariate analysis, a higher response to GTN was associated with lower brachial baseline diameter (P &<0.001) and increasing value of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.04) in Asp-carriers, but not in Glu-homozygotes. Higher FMD correlated with lower brachial baseline diameter (P &<0.001), BMI (P = 0.03) and SBP (P = 0.03) in the Asp-carriers, but not in Glu-homozygotes. Higher IMT showed a similar Asp-genotype-dependent association with higher BMI (P = 0.001), SBP (P = 0.006) and DBP (P = 0.001). In individuals with Asp-alleles, the multivariate analysis showed that BMI was the only independent predictor of IMT.

Weight is independently associated with impaired arterial structure in healthy and genetically predisposed young individuals. The allelic variation (Asp298) of the eNOS gene polymorphism makes individuals vulnerable to the impact of weight on the development of atherosclerosis.
