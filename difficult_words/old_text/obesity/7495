Gastroenterologists will likely play a critical role in the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities, as novel endoluminal approaches demonstrate their safety and efficacy over the coming years. Understanding the relative advantages and shortcomings of the endoscopic tools and procedures currently under investigation will provide the gastroenterologist with valuable insight into the future of endoscopic procedures for weight loss.

Endoscopic restrictive procedures, intestinal sleeves, and intragastric balloons have demonstrated short-term efficacy in inducing weight reduction and in reversing the comorbidities of obesity with an acceptable risk profile. Several endoscopic tools have also demonstrated effectiveness as revisional tools for reversing weight gain after bariatric surgery.

A plethora of endoscopic tools and procedures are under investigation for primary and revisional obesity management, and these may offer new weight loss options to a variety of different patient populations.
