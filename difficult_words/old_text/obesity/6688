The body mass index of 164 children (aged 4-18 years) attending four autism rehabilitation centers in Istanbul, Turkey, was determined and assessed using the BMI-for-age percentile charts by the World Health Organization (WHO). The mean intake of energy and nutrients of 115 children were calculated using three-day food records. The feeding assessment surveys filled in by the parents/caregivers indicated that the major feeding problem among children was food selectivity. The majority of the children were overweight or obese (58.5%). A total of 11% of children were found to be severely thin and thin. The calcium, zinc, vitamin B6 and folate intake of the majority of children were inadequate. The salt consumption in all age groups and cholesterol intake in normal, overweight and obese children were high.
