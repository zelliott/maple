To assess the effectiveness of a manual-based cognitive behavior therapy adapted to a group format in a sample of Brazilian obese subjects with binge-eating disorder.

In an open trial, 21 obese subjects with binge-eating disorder received a group cognitive-behavioral therapy program. Changes in binge-eating frequency, weight, body shape concerns, and depressive symptoms were compared between baseline and the end of the study.

The mean frequency of binge-eating episodes significantly decreased from baseline to post-treatment (p &<0.001), with a binge eating remission rate of 76.1% at the end of the trial. Depressive symptoms and body shape concern also improved (p &<0.001). In addition, weight loss was statistically and clinically significant.

The use of this adapted manual-based cognitive behavior therapy in this sample resulted in a marked improvement in binge-eating, weight, body shape concern, and depressive symptoms related to binge-eating disorder.
