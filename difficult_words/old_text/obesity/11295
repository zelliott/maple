Obesity is of importance among the risk factors predisposing for chronic venous disorders (CVD). Little is known how obesity affects the management of CVD. As the data concerning the treatments of CVD in the obese are incomplete, we performed an analysis of the different CVD therapies managements with respect to body mass index and the obesity.

We analyzed 9797 CVD patients from of a previous large national CVD survey, in regard to their Body Mass Index (BMI), CVD class and CVD therapies. Among them 2213 patients presented class I, 516 class II or morbid obesity.

BMI was significantly associated with the method of CVD therapy. Logistic regression showed that venoactive drugs are preferentially used except in class I obesity patients but also when therapy is managed by general practitioner. Logistic regression analysis showed that class II and morbid obesity is associated with more frequent prevalence of previous surgical procedures related to CVD (OR=2.62 with 95% confidence interval of [2.16-3.17]) and topical agent use, (OR=1.77, [1.38-2.25]) but with a significant decreased compliance with compression therapy (OR=0.74, [0.61 - 0.89]), regardless of the clinical course of the disease, and socio-demographic factors. While class I obesity increased the adherence with VADs.

The therapy of CVD is affected by body mass index. Class II and morbid obese CVD patients are less frequently compliant with compression therapy but are willing to accept surgical procedures and the use of topical agents.
