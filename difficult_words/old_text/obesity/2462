Eleven moderately obese middle-aged male outpatients with untreated mild hypertension reduced their sodium intake by about 120 mmol per day during 4-6 weeks. Diastolic blood pressure was then significantly reduced in comparison with a matched control group. The reduction of urinary sodium excretion was significantly correlated to the change in mean arterial pressure. Mean body mass showed a small significant decrease, although there were no significant changes in total body water or body fat as determined from measurements of 40K and tritiated water. Nor did mean extracellular water or plasma volume (Evan's blue) show any significant change. The decrease in urinary sodium excretion was associated with increases in plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone excretion, while a sympathetic nervous natriuretic index (urinary dopamine to noradrenaline excretion ratio) decreased. The low sodium diet period was followed by a period of energy reduction as well as sodium restriction for 15 weeks. Mean body mass was then reduced by about 8 kg. The systolic but not the diastolic blood pressure showed a significant decrease. The intraerythrocyte content of water, sodium and potassium did not change significantly during any of the diet periods. We conclude that moderate sodium restriction lowered the blood pressure and affected the renin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous system to retain sodium which might explain the constancy of the plasma volume.
