The metabolic syndrome is associated with low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size. The Taq1B-polymorphism in the cholesteryl ester-transfer protein (CETP)-gene influences HDL-C, CETP concentration, and LDL-size. We investigated the effect of the Taq1B-polymorphism on the risk of the metabolic syndrome in 1,503 participants (973 men, 530 women) of the Salzburg Atherosclerosis Prevention program in subjects at High Individual Risk study. CETP concentration was determined in a subgroup (n = 486) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 16.7% (18.5% in men, 13.5% in women). The Taq1B-polymorphism influenced significantly CETP concentrations, HDL-C levels, and LDL-size (P &<0.001 for all). The relative risk of the metabolic syndrome was reduced by 32% (odds ratio (OR) 0.68 (95% CI: 0.51-0.89), P = 0.005) in carriers of the B2 variant. This risk reduction persisted after adjustment for age and sex (OR 0.69 (0.53-0.92), P = 0.01) and after further adjustment for body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, insulin resistance (IR), HDL-C, and triglycerides (TGs) (OR 0.43 (0.26-0.72), P = 0.001). Furthermore, the risk reduction was more pronounced in men than in women. We conclude that CETP plays an important role in the metabolic syndrome, possibly involving novel functions of CETP.
