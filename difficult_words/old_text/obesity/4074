This paper quantifies the sex, location, and forefoot imbalances most frequently affected with an intermetatarsal neuroma. The authors also examine the relationship between patients' weights and neuroma development. This study reviews the hospital records of 97 patients undergoing surgical excision of an intermetatarsal neuroma. The article reveals that four-fifths of the patients are females and that two-thirds of the neuromas occur in the third intermetatarsal space, with the second affected about one-half as often. The study discovers that 85% of the patients are overweight; further, three-quarters of unilateral neuromas present with a forefoot varus imbalance whereas the majority of bilateral neuromas present with a flexible forefoot valgus.
