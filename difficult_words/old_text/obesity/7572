Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the USA. Consequently, there is an increasing number of obese diabetic patients who would otherwise be appropriate candidates for pancreas transplantation (PTx). This is a retrospective study of all PTx performed at Indiana University between 2003 and 2009 (n = 308) comparing recipients with body mass index (BMI) &<25, 25-29.9, and â‰¥30 kg/m(2) Data included recipient and donor demographics, seven and 90-d graft loss, one-yr pancreas, kidney (for SPK only) and patient survival, causes of graft loss and death, peak amylase and lipase, length of stay, readmissions, complications, HbA1C, and c-peptide. Of the 308 PTx, 100 (32%) were overweight and 42 (14%) were obese. Obese recipients were older and more likely to be men. Donor demographics were similar. There was no difference in seven-d or 90-d graft loss, one-yr pancreas, kidney or patient survival, cause of graft loss or death, 30-d peak amylase or lipase, HbA1C, or C-peptide. The incidence of post-transplant technical, immunological and infectious complications was similar except for an increased incidence of cytomegalovirus infection in the obese group. Two recipients returned to insulin therapy despite normal C-peptide levels. Although technically challenging, PTx can be successful in select obese recipients with similar results compared to normal BMI recipients.
