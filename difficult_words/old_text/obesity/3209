CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) peptides are neurotransmitters that have received much attention as mediators of feeding behavior and body-weight regulation in mammals. CART peptides and their mRNAs are found in many brain regions and in peripheral tissues that are involved in feeding, and many animal studies implicate CART as an inhibitor of feeding. Animal studies also demonstrate that CART expression is regulated by both leptin and glucocorticoids, two hormones known to be associated with the regulation of body weight. A recent study also links a mutation in the CART gene to obesity in humans. These peptides might become targets for drug development in the area of obesity.
