Disorders possibly associated with insulin resistance (IR) are hyperandrogenemia, hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles, central obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). It is known that PCOS is related to a high risk of endometrial hyperplasia after many years of estrogen stimulation from anovulation.

The purpose of the study was to estimate the thickness of the endometrium in women with IR without a diagnosis of PCOS and in women with PCOS without IR.

Three groups of women included in the study: 15 women diagnosed as IR without PCOS, 16 women diagnosed as PCOS without IR and 20 women used as controls matched for age and body mass index (BMI) with the previous patients. Thickness of the endometrium was estimated in all cases with a transvaginal ultrasound in three consecutive measures during a cycle.

The mean thickness of the endometrium was statistically higher in the PCOS group (11.1mm), and in the IR group (9.6mm), compared with the control group (6.2mm) (F=13.1, p&<.001).

It is concluded that both in women diagnosed as having insulin resistance without PCOS, and in women with PCOS without insulin resistance, the ultrasonographically estimated thickness of the endometrium is relatively high and a closer follow-up of these women is required in order to detect those in risk to develop hyperplasia and/or atypia.
