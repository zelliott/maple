Previous results have shown that mice lacking in the group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b) are resistant to obesity and diabetes induced by feeding a diabetogenic high-fat/high-carbohydrate diet. This study examined the potential of using the Pla2g1b inhibitor methyl indoxam as therapy to suppress diet-induced obesity and diabetes.

Male C57BL/6 mice were fed the diabetogenic diet with or without methyl indoxam supplementation. Body weight gain, fasting plasma glucose levels, glucose tolerance and postprandial lysophospholipid absorption were compared.

Wild-type C57BL/6 mice fed the diabetogenic diet without Pla2g1b inhibitor showed 31 and 69% body weight gain after 4 and 10 weeks respectively. These animals also showed elevated plasma glucose levels and were glucose intolerant. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice fed the diabetogenic diet with 90 mg.kg(-1) of methyl indoxam gained only 5% body weight after 10 weeks. These animals were also euglycaemic and displayed normal glucose excursion rates in glucose tolerance test. Methyl indoxam suppression of diet-induced body weight gain and glucose intolerance was correlated with the inhibition of Pla2g1b-mediated postprandial lysophospholipid absorption.

These results show that oral supplementation of a diabetogenic diet with the Pla2g1b inhibitor methyl indoxam effectively suppresses diet-induced obesity and diabetes in mice. This suggests that Pla2g1b inhibition may be a potentially effective oral therapeutic option for treatment of obesity and diabetes.
