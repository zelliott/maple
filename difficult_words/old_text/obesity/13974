That obesity is associated with insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus is well accepted. Overloading of white adipose tissue beyond its storage capacity leads to lipid disorders in non-adipose tissues, namely skeletal and cardiac muscles, pancreas, and liver, effects that are often mediated through increased non-esterified fatty acid fluxes. This in turn leads to a tissue-specific disordered insulin response and increased lipid deposition and lipotoxicity, coupled to abnormal plasma metabolic and (or) lipoprotein profiles. Thus, the importance of functional adipocytes is crucial, as highlighted by the disorders seen in both "too much" (obesity) and "too little" (lipodystrophy) white adipose tissue. However, beyond its capacity for fat storage, white adipose tissue is now well recognised as an endocrine tissue producing multiple hormones whose plasma levels are altered in obese, insulin-resistant, and diabetic subjects. The consequence of these hormonal alterations with respect to both glucose and lipid metabolism in insulin target tissues is just beginning to be understood. The present review will focus on a number of these hormones: acylation-stimulating protein, leptin, adiponectin, tumour necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and resistin, defining their changes induced in obesity and diabetes mellitus and highlighting their functional properties that may protect or worsen lipid metabolism.
