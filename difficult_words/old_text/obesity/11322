Obesity-induced inflammation is associated with numerous pathologies and is an independent risk factor of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The prevalence of CKD is escalating and current therapeutic strategies are seriously lacking in efficacy, and immunomodulation has been suggested as a potential new therapeutic approach. Indeed, specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), such as lipoxins (LXs), resolvins and protectins, have demonstrated protection in adipose inflammation, restoring insulin sensitivity and adiponectin production, while modulating leukocyte infiltration and promoting resolution in visceral adipose tissue. Furthermore, SPMs display direct renoprotective effect. Thus we review current evidence of immunomodulation as a potential strategy to subvert obesity-related CKD.
