An approach for "resisting patients" to treatments and weight loss programme is proposed. Patient's resistance is a sign of vitality, a source of information for the health care provider and an invitation to question the nature of therapeutic relationship. Resistance can constitute a "block road" which the health care provider may not be able to avoid unless initiating a process of changes based on reciprocal responsibilities and implications. Towards a patient resisting to change, it is appropriate to understand how he resists, to what and, perhaps to whom. Practical proposals to "do and to be with a resisting patient" can be applied by health care providers taking care of patients suffering from binge eating disorders and obesity.
