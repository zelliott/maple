Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) can dramatically ameliorate type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in morbidly obese patients. However, there is little evidence supporting the effectiveness of LRYGB in low body mass index (BMI) patients. The study was designed to evaluate the safety and results of LRYGB for achieving T2DM remission in patients with BMI in the range of 25-35 kg/m(2).

Twenty-two patients (two men and 20 women) with T2DM underwent LRYGB. Data on patient demographics, BMI, co-morbidities, and details of diabetes mellitus, including disease duration, family history, medication use, and remission, were prospectively collected and analyzed.

The mean age was 47 years (range, 28-63 years), mean BMI was 30.81 (range, 25.00-34.80 kg/m(2)), and mean duration of T2DM onset was 6.57 years (range, 1-20 years). Sixteen (72.27%) patients had a family history of T2DM. There was no mortality, but two (9%) patients experienced complications: an early gastrojejunostomy hemorrhage and frequent loose stools that required revision surgery. At 12 months, 14 (63.6%) patients showed T2DM remission, six (27.3%) showed glycemic control, and two (9.1%) showed improvement. The group achieving remission had a higher BMI (p = 0.001), younger age (p = 0.002), and shorter duration of diabetes (p = 0.001). These three factors may be predictors of diabetes resolution at 12 months.

Early intervention in low-BMI patients yields better remission rates because age, BMI, and duration of T2DM predict glycemic outcomes.
