The indications and regimens of spontaneous respiration with positive pressure at the end of expiration (SR with PPEE) in patients with morbid obesity are not established. The individual selection of resistance at expiration is necessary. In 53 patients, the selected resistance at expiration has proved to be the optimal, contributing to significant improvement of parameters of pulmonary ventilation without deterioration of hemodynamic indices. An inverse dependence of the values of optimal resistance at expiration and excess in ideal body mass was established. By multiplying the values mentioned, the K coefficient is obtained equal to 530.3 + 7.66. In patients over 60, K was 400.3 +/- 11.52. The use of a nomogram (in numerical and graphic versions) to dose resistance at expiration in patients with concomitant morbid obesity contributed to significant improvement of the indices of pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange without disorders in hemodynamics after seances of SR with PPEE.
