The importance of genetic influences on obesity has been emphasized recently. We conducted matched co-twin analyses of 250 pairs of White, male, monozygotic twins from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Twin Study. Entirely in the absence of genetic influences, obesity was significantly associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures; one-hour, post-load glucose; total, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol; and triglycerides among these 42-55 year old men. Similar results were obtained in longitudinal analyses of weight change during adulthood (from mean age of 20 to mean age of 48 years) and risk factor status at middle-age. These results indicate that behaviors and environmental exposures that occur later in life are responsible, at least in part, for the associations between adult obesity and cardiovascular disease risk, supporting the appropriateness of weight reduction efforts during adulthood.
