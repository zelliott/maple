In recent years more attention is paid to the role of body weight change and cardiovascular disease risk. The aim of the study was to evaluate correlation between body weight change and risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and selected cardiovascular disease risk in middle-aged male during long-term surveillance. The study was conducted among group of healthy male volunteers (n=189) aged 30-49 years at baseline. Prevalence of disease due to cardiovascular causes was ascertained in study participants during an average follow-up of 17.7 +/- 4.4 years. Changes in weight were classified in three categories: stable weight (+/- 5 kg), weight gain &>5 kg) or weight loss &>5 kg). Logistic regression analysis was performed to study the correlation between weight change and Relative Risk (RR) of cardiovascular disease in the examined subjects. All analyses were adjusted for age, smoking and level of leisure-time physical activity. In this study 48.4% men maintained weight, 5.9% lowered weight and 45.7% gained weight. Ischaemic heart disease was diagnosed in 12.2% of men, including non fatal myocardial infarction in 5.3%, hypertension in 40.7%, and hyperchoesterolaemia in 62.4%, respectively. Among participants with weight gain of more than 5 kg total cardiovascular disease risk was 4 times higher (adjusted RR=4.07, 95% CI, 1.33-12.44), ischaemic heart disease 3 times higher (adjusted RR=3.27, 95% CI, 1.17-9.17), and hypercholesterolaemia 2 times higher (adjusted RR=2.15, 95% CI, 1.09-4.24) in comparison with those with stable weight. This study results suggests that maintaining stable weight during adulthood can be effective strategy for lowering cardiovascular disease risk.
