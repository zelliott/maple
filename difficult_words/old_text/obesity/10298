The metabolic syndrome is a public health concern because its prevalence is increasing in the United States, and it is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We discuss epidemiologic trends in and causes of the metabolic syndrome. The relationships among the cardiometabolic risk factors that contribute to the metabolic syndrome-obesity, insulin resistance, proinflammatory and prothrombotic states, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and hypertension-and between these risk factors and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are explained. Currently available interventions to modify these risk factors and the importance of preventive strategies and early detection efforts are also addressed.
