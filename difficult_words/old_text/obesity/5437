Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic with ever increasing incidence and public health problems in both developing and developed countries.

The objective of the study is to investigate the incidence of obesity among patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome attending infertility clinic and the effect on treatment outcome.

Two hundred and seventy women with polycystic ovarian syndrome attending the infertility clinic were evaluated clinically, biochemically, and laparoscopically. They were stratified according to their body mass index (BMI) as follows: normal weight: 18-24; overweight: 25-29, obese:30-34, and grossly obese:&> or = 35. Therapy included induction of ovulation with clomiphene citrate and gonadotrophins. The patients were followed up through during induction of ovulation and pregnancy.

There were ethnic differences in mean BMI. Significantly more obese women had oligomenorrhoea (p&<.01) and anovulation (p&<.01) than women with normal weight. Obesity adversely affected the outcome of ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate and gonadotrophins; 79% of women with BMI 18-24 ovulated at 6 months compared to 15.3% in those with BMI 30-34 (p&<.001) and 11.8% in women with BMI&> or = 35 (p&<.001). The pregnancy rate and outcome were also adversely affected by obesity.

Obesity has a negative impact on the outcome of treatment of infertility. Weight reduction programme should be an essential component of infertility management.
