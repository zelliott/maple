To analyse the association between childhood overweight and obesity and the density and proximity of fast food outlets in relation to the child's residential postcode.

This was an observational study using individual level height/weight data and geographic information systems methodology.

Leeds in West Yorkshire, UK. This area consists of 476 lower super-output areas.

Children aged 3-14 years who lived within the Leeds metropolitan boundaries (n=33,594).

The number of fast food outlets per area and the distance to the nearest fast food outlet from the child's home address. The weight status of the child: overweight, obese or neither.

27.1% of the children were overweight or obese with 12.6% classified as obese. There is a significant positive correlation (p&<.001) between density of fast food outlets and higher deprivation. A higher density of fast food outlets was significantly associated (p=0.02) with the child being obese (or overweight/obese) in the generalised estimating equation model which also included sex, age and deprivation. No significant association between distance to the nearest fast food outlet and overweight or obese status was found.

There is a positive relationship between the density of fast food outlets per area and the obesity status of children in Leeds. There is also a significant association between fast food outlet density and areas of higher deprivation.
