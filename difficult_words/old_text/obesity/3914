The psychometric properties of the Pediatric Inventory for Parents, a measure of chronic disease-related parental stress, were examined in a sample of 72 children and adolescents who are overweight. The correlations between disease-related parental stress and general parenting stress, parental and child anxiety and children's behavioral and psychological maladjustment were examined. The results demonstrated excellent internal consistency and modest correlations with a measure of general parenting stress. Significant and positive relations of medium to large effect sizes between disease-related parenting stress and internalizing and externalizing maladjustment were found. Internalizing and externalizing behavior moderated the relations between disease-related parenting stress and parental distress. Recommendations for use of the Pediatric Inventory for Parents in clinical settings and future research directions are discussed.
