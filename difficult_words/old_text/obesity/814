The prevalence of obesity and overweight children of all ages is increasing. There are many factors that can lead to obesity in children, all of which must be considered and understood before an effective strategy can be implemented to tackle the problem. Evidence from the Health Development Agency recommends the focus of research should be redirected to look at the effectiveness of prevention and management strategies rather than the generation of statistics confirming the existence of the problem.
