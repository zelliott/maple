Obesity has an overall negative impact on fertility, affecting both women and men. Not only are obese individuals more likely to experience infertility, they are less likely to benefit from fertility treatment. Moreover, achieving pregnancy may place obese women at high risk for serious complications. It is important that obese individuals understand the effects that their obesity can have on reproductive function.
