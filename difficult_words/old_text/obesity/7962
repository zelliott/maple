Rhesus monkeys have been used as models to study obesity and disease. The aim of this study was to define body mass indices for underweight and obesity in rhesus monkeys. Longitudinal data collected over 8-14 years from 40 male and 26 female rhesus monkeys were analyzed. Body weight, insulin sensitivity index, and disposition index were regressed against percent body fat (%BF). A minimal %BF beyond which further loss of body weight resulted in loss of lean mass was determined to be 11.5% in older males, 8% in adult females, and 9% in younger adult males. Insulin sensitivity index and disposition index reached minimum values at 23% fat in older males, 18% in adult females, and 21% in younger adult males, indicating obesity. The estimated reference range for %BF was 9%-23% in male and 8%-18% in female monkeys, corresponding to body mass indices of 32-44 kg/m(2) for male and 27-35 kg/m(2) for female monkeys.
