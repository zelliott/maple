Collapsible pharyngeal airway size is determined by interaction between structural properties of the pharyngeal airway and neural regulation of the pharyngeal dilating muscles. Obesity seems to have two distinct mechanical influences on the pharyngeal airway collapsibility. First, obesity increases soft tissue surrounding the pharyngeal airway within limited maxillomandible enclosure occupying and narrowing its space (pharyngeal anatomical imbalance). Second, obesity, particularly central obesity, increases visceral fat volume decreasing lung volume. Pharyngeal wall collapsibility is increased by the lung volume reduction, possibly through decreased longitudinal tracheal traction (lung volume hypothesis). Neural compensation for functioning structural abnormalities operating during wakefulness is lost during sleep, leading to pharyngeal obstruction. Instability of the negative feedback of the respiratory system may accelerate cycling of pharyngeal closure and opening. Improvement of the pharyngeal anatomical imbalance and maintenance of lung volume are the keys for safe perioperative airway managements of obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
