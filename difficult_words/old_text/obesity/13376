The influence of exercise on forearm muscle metabolism was examined in 9 healthy subjects, in 16 diabetics and in 4 obese subjects during complete starvation. During exercise glucose uptake rose 7-8 fold in the controls. However, no increase of glucose uptake was observed in the other groups studied. Moreover, a glucose production from the working muscle took place in about 40 percent of both the diabetic patients and the starved obese subjects. The nonutilization of glucose during physical work in the diabetic like states was accompanied by a significantly diminished lactate output. The arterial concentration of FFA, glycerol beta-HOB and Acac was markedly elevated in the starved obese patients. The FFA-uptake at rest and during exercise, however, was not different from results of controls. Whereas an effux of beta-HOB has been observed during exercise, Acac uptake was increased in these patients. It is suggested that in maturity onset and starvation diabetes glycolysis is inhibited.
