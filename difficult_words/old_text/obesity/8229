We examined the relationship between plasma adipokine concentrations and ultrasound measures of vascular health in 100 HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy. Leptin was positively correlated with flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery and negatively with carotid intima-media thickness. These relationships were independent of traditional risk factors and trunk fat in women but not men. Neither adiponectin nor resistin was associated with either measure of vascular health.
