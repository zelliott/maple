To evaluate the effect of pomegranate juice on insulin secretion and sensitivity in patients with obesity.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out in 20 obese, adult volunteer subjects. After random allocation of the intervention, 10 patients received 120 ml of pomegranate juice or placebo while in a fasted state for 1 month. Glucose, uric acid, creatinine, lipid profile, and insulin were measured at baseline, and glucose and insulin were also measured at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. The area under the curve of glucose and insulin, total insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity was calculated.

There was a significant increase in weight, body mass index, and fat mass in the placebo group after the intervention. Insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were not modified with administration of pomegranate juice. There was a significant difference in changes from baseline in fat mass between groups (1.1 ± 1.1% vs. -1.4 ± 3.0%, p = 0.010; placebo and pomegranate groups, respectively).

Pomegranate juice administration for 1 month did not modify insulin secretion and sensitivity in patients with obesity; however, the natural evolution to increased weight and adiposity was halted.
