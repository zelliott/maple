It is well known that obesity occurs in women with climacteric disorders. The aim of this study was to examine whether caffeine prevents obesity and bone loss in ovariectomized rats (ovx). Eight-week-old female Wistar rat were assigned to 4 groups: a sham-operated group fed the control diet (CE-2); an ovx-c group fed the control diet; an ovx-caf 0.15% group fed the control diet containing 1.5 g/kg of caffeine; and an ovx-caf 0.3% group fed the control diet containing 3 g/kg of caffeine. Body weights at 2-9 weeks and the final parametrail adipose tissue weights were significantly lower in the ovx-caf 0.3% group than in the ovx-c group. Food intakes were significantly lower in the ovx-caf 0.3% group than in the ovx-c group. After 9 weeks, the rats were killed and adipose tissues were sampled immediately. Basal lipolysis was increased in the ovx-caf 0.3% group fed the control diet containing 3 g/kg of caffeine than in the ovx-c group fed the control diet. The relative content of calcium (g/100 g body weight) in the ovx-caf 0.3% group was significantly increased compared with that in the ovx-c group. These results show a new possible role for caffeine in the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases.
