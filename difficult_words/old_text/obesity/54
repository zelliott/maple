The insulin response to a 75 g oral glucose load was studied in 26 indian patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 26 controls matched for age, sex and weight. There were no significant differences between the mean insulin responses and incremental insulin areas between the patients with IGT and controls. However, when the patients were divided into obese and non-obese subgroups and their mean insulin levels compared, the obese patients with IGT had significantly higher insulin levels at 120 minutes than the obese controls.
