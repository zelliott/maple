The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a combination of aerobic exercise and hypocaloric diet on body composition, cardiovascular function and some cardiovascular risk factors in obese patients. Ten subjects, (8 women 2 men X age 30 years and 138% of ideal body weight) volunteered as participants. The program lasted 12 weeks and consisted of a hypocaloric diet (1257 kcal/day) and 3-5 days/week supervised sessions of aerobic exercise (65-90% maximal heart rate and/or 50-80% of maximal oxygen uptake). The program resulted in a significant mean decrease in body weight of 7.7 kg. for the group (P less than or equal to 0.05). Mean (+/- EE) relative body fat significantly decreased from 35.9 +/- 2 to 31.6 +/- 2%. Interestingly, the decrease in relative body fat was solely accounted for by a significant decrease in fat weight, as body free of fat remained constant. Cardiovascular function as evidenced by oxygen uptake, increased 11.3%. Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell significantly from 131/90 +/- 8/9 to 115/76 +/- 2/1 mmHg. Total cholesterol significantly dropped from a mean value of 247 +/- 24 to 183 +/- 20 mg/100 ml (P less than 0.05). Triglycerides significantly decreased from 212 +/- 32 to 45 +/- 10 mg/100 ml (P less than 0.05). It was concluded that a combination of aerobic exercise and hypocaloric diet can favorably improve body composition, cardiovascular function and cardiovascular risk factors.
