To provide a meta-analyisis on whether obesity could be a prognostic indicator on the severity, development of complications and mortality of acute pancreatitis (AP).

Eligible articles were retrieved using electronic databases. Clinical studies evaluating the association between obesity and disease course of patients with AP were included. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated and pooled using RevMan 4.2.8.

In all, 12 clinical studies with a total of 1483 patients were included in the analysis. Obese patients had a significantly increased risk of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP; RR=2.20, 95% CI 1.82-2.66, P&<.05), local complication (RR=2.68, 95% CI 2.09-3.43, P&<.05), systemic complication (RR=2.14, 95% CI 1.42-3.21, P&<.05) and in-hospital mortality (RR=2.59, 95% CI 1.66-4.03, P&<.05) compared with non-obese patients.

Obesity is a definite risk factor of morbidity and in-hospital mortality for AP and may serve as a prognostic indicator.
