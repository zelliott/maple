Recent studies have shown colestimide, a bile acid-binding resin, to also exert a glucose-lowering effect via amelioration of insulin resistance. To evaluate the effects of colestimide on glucose metabolism and to elucidate the underlying mechanism, we conducted a 6-month, open-label pilot study on 43 type 2 diabetic patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 25). The subjects were randomized to either treatment with colestimide 4g/day (T group, n=23) or continuation of their current therapy (C group, n=20). In the T group patients, mean HbA1c and fasting glucose improved markedly (from 7.71 ± 0.32% to 6.97 ± 0.20%; from 147.4 ± 7.3mg/dL to 127.0 ± 5.0mg/dL, respectively), while obesity-related parameters, i.e. body weight, waist circumference, and visceral fat and subcutaneous fat as determined by umbilical slice abdominal CT, showed no significant changes. Fractionation analyses of serum bile acids revealed significantly increased cholic acids (CA) and decreased chenodeoxycholic acids (CDCA) in the T group patients. However, no correlation was observed between these changes and ΔHbA1c. According to logistic regression analysis, baseline HbA1c was the only variable predicting the decrease of HbA1c &>0.5%) among sex, age, BMI, total cholesterol, ΔCA and ΔCDCA. The index of insulin resistance, i.e. HOMA-R, did not improve, and the index of β cell function, i.e. HOMA-β, actually increased significantly. These results suggests that, in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, the mechanism underlying improved glycemic control with colestimide treatment involves enhanced β cell activity rather than improved insulin resistance.
