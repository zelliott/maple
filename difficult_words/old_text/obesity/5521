We investigate the effectiveness of a community-based lifestyle-modification program for reducing blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in sedentary Japanese middle-aged women. Among an initial cohort of 210 middle-aged sedentary women, 195 subjects completed a community-based 12-week lifestyle-modification program for reducing cardiovascular risk factors. Blood pressure, body weight and the serum lipid profile were measured both at baseline and at the end of the 12-week lifestyle-modification program. The program consisted of mild aerobic exercise and a mild hypocaloric diet. After the 12-week program, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced, especially in subjects who were hypertensive at baseline. Desirable changes in body weight and the serum lipid profile were also found after the 12-week program. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that, in obese subjects, the decrease in systolic blood pressure was correlated with both the initial systolic blood pressure and the change in estimated maximum oxygen consumption. In addition, the decrease in diastolic blood pressure was correlated with the initial diastolic blood pressure and the change in body weight. On the other hand, in non-obese subjects, the decrease in blood pressure was correlated with the initial blood pressure and the change in salt intake. A community-based lifestyle-modification program that consisted of mild aerobic exercise and a mild hypocaloric diet was considered to be practically effective for reducing multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Individuals who already have one or more mild cardiovascular risk factors still could be good candidates for a community-based lifestyle-modification program.
