Hypertension, coronary heart diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus are often present in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The aim of the study was to estimate the serum leptin concentration and sympathetic activity in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and in control group.

51 persons (F6, M45) were included into the study. The control group (GK) consisted of 15 snoring person (15 M) in the age x = 44.19 +/- 14.60, study group (GB) consisted of 36 patients with OSA (6F, 30M) in the age 5 1.47 +/- 8.95 years.

Leptin was measured by RIA methods using the HUMAN LEPTIN RIA KIT (LINCO Research, Inc).: adrenaline and noradrenaline were measured in the serum by HPLC methods (BIO-RAD).

The serum concentrations of leptin (ng/mL), adrenaline and noradrenaline (pg/mL) in patients with OSA compared with control group were respectively 15.55 +/- 11.26 : 61.2 +/- 27.4: 523.2 +/- 165.1 vs 10.34+/- 6.86 : 47.7 +/- 27.3: 447.9 +/- 102.6. There was positive significant correlation between leptin concentration and BMI (r = 0,34) and serum leptin and adrenalin concentration (r = 0,34). The serum leptin concentration was significantly higher in the female group. In the male group there was tendency to increase leptin concentration together with degree of OSA grade estimated by AHI and AHI &<0 leptin concentration 12.23+/- 6.96 ng/mL vs AH&>50 and leptin concentration 13.35 +/- 3.54ng/ml.

1. In the group of patients with OSA the serum concentrations of leptin, adrenaline and noradrenaline were higher then in control group. 2. There are positive statistical significant correlation between serum leptin levels and BMI and serum adrenaline concentration in the study group. 3. The serum leptin concentration was higher in the female group. 4. There was tendency to increased leptin concentration in the study group together with degree of OSA grade estimated by AHI. 5. Our results confirm correlation between leptin and sympathetic activity and their influences on obesity and degree of OSA grade in studied group.
