Levels of pituitary growth hormone (GH) messenger RNA (mRNA) were compared in groups of genetically obese (fa/fa) and lean (Fa/-) littermate male Zucker rats at four different ages, 3, 5, 9, and 11 weeks, in order to determine the earliest age at which a difference between the two groups could be detected. No difference was seen in three-week-old animals. Five weeks of age was the earliest time at which the level of GH mRNA was significantly decreased in the obese rats; this decrease was present at all subsequent ages. Mean serum growth hormone levels were lower in obese animals at all ages, but the differences were not statistically significant because of the large individual variation associated with the pulsatile nature of GH release. The earliest occurrence of differences in GH mRNA level is later than some of the obesity associated abnormalities present in adipose tissue. The earliest time of the GH mRNA differences can be associated with the time when decreased protein deposition is initially seen in the obese rats. Because of this association, decreased GH mRNA may enhance the development of obesity.
