There is growing evidence for an implication of the CB1 receptor subtype of the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of eating and fat deposition. To further define the physiological role of these receptors in the control of energy balance, we characterized the phenotype of CB1 receptor knockout (CB1(-/-)) mice maintained on an obesity-prone regimen or on a standard chow.

CB1(-/-) male mice were compared to wild-type animals (CB1(+/+) male mice) in two feeding paradigms: (1) with a standard laboratory regimen (3.5 kcal/g, 14.5% of energy as fat) and (2) on a free-choice paradigm consisting of offering both the standard laboratory chow and a high-fat diet (HFD) (4.9 kcal/g, 49% of energy as fat).

When maintained on the standard diet, CB1(-/-) mice are lean. At the age of 20 weeks, their body weight and adiposity are, respectively, 24 and 60% lower than that of CB1(+/+) mice. They are slightly hypophagic, but when expressed as percent of body weight, their relative energy intake is similar to that of the wild-type animals. Furthermore, inactivation of CB1 receptors reduces plasma insulin and leptin levels, and enhances the response to intracerebroventricular leptin injection. The free-choice paradigm shows that the preference for a high-fat highly palatable chow is slightly delayed in onset but maintained in CB1(-/-) mice. However, loading CB1(-/-) mice with this obesity-prone diet does not result in development of obesity. Knockout mice do not display hyperphagia or reduction of their relative energy intake in contrast to CB1(+/+) mice, and their feeding efficiency remains low. These data suggest an improved energetic metabolism with the high-fat regimen. Furthermore, the insulin resistance normally occurring in HFD-fed mice is not present in CB1(-/-) mice.

These results provide evidence that the stimulation of CB1 receptors is a key component in the development of diet-induced obesity, and that these receptors and their endogenous ligands are implicated not only in feeding control but also in peripheral metabolic regulations. The lack of effect of SR141716, a selective CB1 receptor antagonist, in CB1(-/-) mice further supports this hypothesis, as this compound was previously shown to display potent anti-obesity properties in diet-induced obese C57BL/6 mice.
