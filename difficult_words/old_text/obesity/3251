The relationship between obesity and the use of health-care services was assessed in the population between 50 and 69 in England in 1998, where such analysis had not yet been done.

All data was obtained from the Health Survey for England (HSE), a cross-sectional survey that collected information about the health of a sample of the British population in 1998. Analysis was limited to the 4,102 men and women between 50-69 years with a valid body mass index (BMI)&>18.5 kg/m(2). BMI was analysed in relation to use of 4 types of health-care service, and the odds ratio (OR) for use of each of these services was determined for obese people (BMI&> or =30 kg/m(2)), compared with normal-weight individuals (BMI 18.5-25).

There was an association between obesity status and use of outpatient services in a 12-month period (adjusted 0R 1.25; 95% CI, 1.03-1.51) and with&> or =2 medical prescriptions (adjusted OR 1.86; 95% CI, 1.51-2.29). No significant relationship was found between obesity and physician (GP) visits or with use of inpatient and/or day-patient services.

Although obesity did not lead to increases in use in all 4 health-care measures assessed as it has in some other countries, it does lead to some increases in health-care utilization in England and appears to impose an additional burden on health-care services. With the rising rates of obesity and its co-morbidities, there may be larger stresses on the health-care system in England if efforts to reduce obesity are not put into effect.
