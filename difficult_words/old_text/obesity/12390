The aim of the present study is to examine the differences in fat and carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation during walking and running between normal-weight and overweight/obese young adult men.

19 healthy, normal-weight (age = 21.9 ± 0.7 years, BMI = 22.6 ± 0.4 kg, n = 10) and overweight (age = 21.4 ± 0.6 years, BMI = 31.6 ± 1.1, n = 9) young men volunteered to participate in this study. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance. Maximal oxygen uptake and maximal fat oxidation rate were determined with indirect calorimetry by using an incremental exercise test on a motor-driven treadmill. The participants' individual preferred transition speeds between walking and running were determined. Indirect calorimetry was used to calculate fat and CHO oxidation during the resting, walking and running tests.

Maximal fat oxidation rates during the graded exercise test were not significantly different between the groups. Changes in CHO and fat oxidation in the resting, walking and running tests were similar in the normal-weight and overweight groups.

The study results suggest that with regard to changes in CHO and fat oxidation, normal-weight and overweight/obese individuals have similar responses to walking and running at preferred speeds, despite significant differences in oxygen uptake during activity and body composition.
