The development of obesity consists of 3 distinct processes: differentiation of new adipocytes from precursor preadipocytic cells, formation of mature adipocytes, and excess accumulation of lipids in the adipocytes resulting in cell enlargement. This review aims to discuss the possible role of metallothionein (MT) in adipose tissue in the development of obesity. MT is induced in adipose tissue during the development of obesity. In addition, MT plays a preventive role against obesity in female mice. Although the detailed mechanism is presently unknown, one of the factors involved is the mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST/Peg1), adipocyte enlargement factor. MT has a potential to prevent obesity-related diseases, at least in part, through suppression of disease-induced generation of superoxide and endoplasmic reticulum stress and associated damage. Studies on the development of a MT inducer will encourage potential clinical use for obesity- related diseases.
