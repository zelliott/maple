There are substantial variations in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and outcomes among women. We sought to determine geographic variation in risk factor prevalence in a contemporary sample of U.S. women.

Using 2008-2009 Sister to Sister (STS) free heart screening data from 17 U.S. cities, we compared rates of obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m(2)), hypertension (HTN ≥140/90 mm Hg), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C &<0 mg/dL), and hyperglycemia (≥126 mg/dL) with national rates.

In 18,892 women (mean age 49.8 ± 14.3 years, 37% black, 32% white, 14% Hispanic), compared to overall STS rates, significantly higher rates were observed for obesity in Baltimore (42.4%), Atlanta (40.0%), Dallas (37.9%), and Jacksonville (36.0%); for HTN in Atlanta (43.9%), Baltimore (42.5%), and New York (39.1%); for hyperglycemia in Jacksonville (20.3%), Philadelphia (18.1%), and Tampa (17.8%); and for HDL-C &<0 mg/dL in Phoenix (37.4%), Dallas (26.5%), and Jacksonville (18.1%). Compared to national American Heart Association (AHA) 2010 update rates, most STS cities had higher rates of hyperglycemia and low HDL-C.

In a large, community-based sample of women nationwide, this comprehensive analysis shows remarkable geographic variation in risk factors, which provides opportunities to improve and reduce a woman's CVD risk. Further investigation is required to understand the reasons behind such variation, which will provide insight toward tailoring preventive interventions to narrow gaps in CVD risk reduction in women.
