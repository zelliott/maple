Resting energy expenditure (REE), and body composition, as fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass, were determined in seven obese adolescents before and after weight loss of a mean 13.5 kg on an approximately 800 kcal/d (3349 kJ), high protein reducing diet regimen. Ideal body weight decreased from 166% to 142% in 8 weeks. There were no significant changes in total body potassium (TBK), extracellular water (ECW), intracellular water (ICW) or total body water (TBW) with weight loss. The REE (kcal/d) fell from 2034 +/- 392 (8514 +/- 1641 kJ) to 1762 +/- 453 (7376 +/- 1896 kJ) with weight loss (P &<0.05). However, when the REE was expressed as kcal/body weight there was no difference between before and after weight loss, 21.4 +/- 2.8 (90 +/- 21 kJ) and 21.6 +/- 4.5 (90 +/- 19 kJ). Similarly, when REE was examined in relation to FFM (kcal/kg) before and after weight loss, there were also no significant differences: 34.6 +/- 5.1 (145 +/- 21 kJ) and 32.1 +/- 7.9 (134 +/- 33 kJ).
