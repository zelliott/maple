This study reviews the clinical and radiographic results of 207 consecutive noncemented Tricon-M (Smith & Nephew Inc, Memphis, Tenn) total knee replacements (TKRs) in 189 patients. The patella was surfaced in 119 cases, and mean follow-up was 8 years (range: 4-10 years). At final follow-up, mean Hospital for Special Surgery score improved 45 points in 187 cases. Survivorship, with failure defined as the need for revision, was 98% at 4 years, 97% at 7 years, 94% at 8 years, and 90% at 10 years. Twenty-one (11.3%) patients went on to revision. Results for overweight and obese patients did not differ significantly from normal-weight patients. The noncemented Tricon-M TKR prosthesis yields acceptable results; however, patella surfacing and the use of a tibial polyethylene insert&> or = 12 mm thick are recommended.
