Long-term potentiation in sympathetic ganglia (gLTP) is similar to LTP of the hippocampal area CA1 in that its expression involves similar changes in signaling molecules. We have shown previously that the stress-prone, hypertensive obese Zucker rats (OZR) expressed gLTP in sympathetic ganglia and that high blood pressure was reduced by treatment with 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. In the present study, we present additional electrophysiological evidence for the pre-expression of gLTP in sympathetic ganglia from OZR indicated by failure of repetitive stimulation to express gLTP in isolated superior cervical ganglia (SCG) and inhibition of baseline ganglionic transmission by a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist. We have also investigated the role of key signaling molecules in the expression of gLTP in the hypertensive OZR. Immunoblot analysis showed a significant increase in the levels of phosphorylated (P-)CaMKII and protein kinase C gamma (PKCgamma) in SCG from OZR. The ratio of P-CaMKII to the total CaMKII was markedly increased in OZR ganglia, suggesting increased phosphorylation of this molecule. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in the levels of calcineurin in ganglia. Furthermore, the neural nitric oxide synthase and hemeoxygenase II, which are essential for the expression of gLTP, were significantly elevated in OZR ganglia. The present findings confirm that ganglia from OZR have expressed gLTP and that synaptic plasticity in sympathetic ganglia may involve a molecular cascade similar to that of LTP of the brain hippocampal area CA1.
