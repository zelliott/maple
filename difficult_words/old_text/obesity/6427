Several studies have shown the association between obesity and hypertension. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of obesity-related hypertension remain unknown. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that obesity is associated with enhanced sympathetic nervous activity. Thus, sympathetic nerve activation seems to play a major role in obesity-associated hypertension. However, the factors responsible for this sympathoactivation have not been identified. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that promotes weight loss by reducing appetite and food intake and by increasing energy expenditure through sympathetic stimulation to brown adipose tissue. Leptin also produces sympathoactivation to kidneys, hindlimb, and adrenal glands, indicating that the obesity-associated increase in sympathetic nerve activity could be due in part to these sympathetic effects of leptin. However, obesity is associated with leptin resistance, since high circulating levels of leptin were observed in obese subjects. Recent evidences indicate that this leptin resistance could be selective with preservation of sympathetic effects despite the loss of metabolic action of leptin. This suggests divergent central pathways underlying metabolic and sympathetic effects of leptin. Several neuropeptides have emerged as potent candidate mediators of leptin action in the central nervous system, including the melanocortin system, neuropeptide Y, and cortico-trophin releasing factor. A detailed understanding of the multitude and complexity of integrated neuronal circuits and neuropeptide-containing pathways in leptin action will help in understanding the pathogenesis of obesity and related disorders.
