Using experimental models of various disease states, the ability of the isolated perfused working rat heart to withstand and recover from a period of severe ischemia was investigated. The results revealed that the coexistence of a diabetic state, obesity, or left ventricular hypertrophy increased the susceptibility of the hearts to ischemic damage and reduced the rate or the extent of postischemic recovery. In contrast, hearts obtained from moderately hypertensive rats exhibited a greater resistance to, and a superior recovery from, ischemia than did hearts obtained from normotensive controls.
