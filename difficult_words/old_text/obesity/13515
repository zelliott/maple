To assess ethnic variations in the distribution of obesity and the associated biochemical, metabolic abnormalities in young women of reproductive age.

Baseline anthropometric, biochemical and endocrine parameters were compared between 30 South Asian (SA) and 41 Caucasian (CA) women attending a fertility clinic.

The CA were significantly more obese (BMI&> 30 kg/m2) than the SA (p = 0.001); however, there was no difference in waist circumference. The SA were significantly more hyperinsulinemic (p = 0.04) and had lower levels of plasma high density lipoprotein-c (p = 0.02) than the CA. Metabolic abnormalities increased in the SA with a BMI&> 25 kg/m2, and the group showed a 4.6-fold greater prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) than did the CA.

SAs have a higher prevalence of MS than CAs, and the risk is even higher in the SA polycystic ovary syndrome subgroup. MS criteria need to be redefined in terms of obesity in SA, and the role of community-based preventive measures in young women needs to be emphasized.
