Insulin requirements, C-peptide levels, and serum lipids have been assessed in 12 obese, insulin-requiring (greater than 60 U/day) patients with type II diabetes mellitus, in a randomized crossover fashion with two treatment regimens: NPH alone and combined NPH and tolazamide, over a period of 3 months each, with maintenance of weight and glycemic control (HgA1, 2hpp and mean 24h glucose profile) at comparable levels. Serum cholesterol improved in both groups compared to their respective baseline values (p less than 0.05). In addition, serum triglyceride was lower (p less than 0.05) in the combined therapy as compared with NPH alone therapy. Insulin requirements were decreased by 23% (p less than 0.002) in the combined therapy group, without significant change in weight, glycemic control, or C-peptide levels. However, C-peptide increments in the combined therapy group were significantly higher than the baseline by 70% (p less than 0.02). NPH plus tolazamide therapy as compared with NPH alone lowers insulin requirement in obese, type II diabetic women without significant alteration in glycemic control, possibly by an increased tissue sensitivity to insulin, and decreases serum triglyceride levels.
