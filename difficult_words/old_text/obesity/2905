The treatment of obesity must be primarily conservative. In suitable cases, a surgical operation may logically supplement it. Indications for operation: Localised accumulation of fat, generalised adiposity resistant to therapy, overstretched, flabby areas of skin and soft parts after radical conservative weight reduction or pregnancy, and esthetic considerations. The plastic surgical possibilities of "dermolipectomy" are pointed out, with typical examples.
