The study provides information on the nutritional status of 8- to 10-year-old primary schoolchildren in urban areas of Jakarta and Bogor, Indonesia, based on anthropometric indicators. It compares the use of the anthropometric indicators weight-for-age Z score, height-for-age Z score, weight-for-height Z score, and body mass index (BMI) to assess thinness (underweight and wasted) and overweight in children. A total of 1,367 children were examined. The nutritional status of the 8- to 10-year urban schoolchildren was better than that of urban children under 5 years old. The prevalence of underweight among urban schoolchildren ranged from 7.4% (girls) to 12.95% (boys), while underweight among urban children under 5 years old in 1998 was 29.7%. Meanwhile, the prevalence of overweight (BMI&> 85th percentile) ranged from 15.3% (girls) to 17.8% (boys). There were more overweight children in the private schools than in the public schools. On average, private schoolchildren, of all ages and both sexes, were heavier and taller than public schoolchildren. The BMI indicator for "thinness" and "wasting", using the NHANES reference, indicates a false positive result. For detecting overweight in children aged 8 to 10 years, BMI is comparable to the other indices, weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height.
