The salivation patterns of a group of nine obese and a group of 14 non-obese subjects were studied. Palatable food was presented and salivary responses were measured under two different conditions. In one condition, the subjects expected to eat, and in the other condition did not expect to eat. It was hypothesized that the obese group would exhibit a salivation pattern different from the non-obese group, and that this salivation pattern would be unrelated to whether or not eating was permitted. This hypothesis was not confirmed; no differences were found between the two groups. These findings conflict with those of earlier investigators and possible reasons for this are discussed.
