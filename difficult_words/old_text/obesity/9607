Taking into consideration regulative aspects and perceptible interrelations with pressor and depressor systems some typical alterations of the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in patients with essential arterial hypertension are summarized. An increased hormone-induced lipolysis is associated with impaired carbohydrate tolerance. Glucose-stimulated insulin response is enhanced in hypertensives, even if glucose tolerance is normal. In subjects with essential hypertension the percentage of linoleic acid in serum triglycerides is augmented, but decreased in subcutaneous adipose tissue. The fat cell volume is not different from that in normotensive probands. The mostly mild disturbances of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are already evident in early stages of essential hypertension and indicate syndrome-like interrelations which should be analysed systematically and which are of fundamental significance for the causal proof of primarily preventive strategies for the reduction of the cardiovascular risk.
