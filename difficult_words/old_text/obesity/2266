The traditional obesity treatments have proven to be ineffective in the long-term. The presence of eating disorders frequently explains this phenomena. Eating educational and behavioral aspects must be addressed in a practical way so that patients could gradually become aware of their behavior towards food as well as internal sensations associated with hunger, satiety, craving and pleasure. Finally, the link between emotions and compulsive eating behaviors during and between meals is an essential aspect that the general practitioner can help the patient to understand. A specialized psychological treatment can then be considered when the patient shows sufficient motivation and consciousness.
