Medical records of patients seen at the Lom√© Teaching Hospital rheumatology clinic (Togo) were studied retrospectively to determine the prevalence and topographic patterns of osteoarthritis. Among the 2626 patients seen over a three-year period, 232 had appendicular osteoarthritis. Distribution of affected joints was as follows: knee, 212 patients (83% female, 17% male); hip, 17 patients with primary osteoarthritis; scapulohumeral joint, 2 patients; and fingers, 1 patient. At the knee, the lesions involved the medial femorotibial compartment in 114 patients, the lateral femorotibial compartment in 54 patients and the patellofemoral compartment in 44 patients. Mean age at onset of femorotibial osteoarthritis was 50 years. Among females with femorotibial osteoarthritis, 70% were obese and 90% had varus or valgus deformities. This study confirms that in black Africa the high prevalence of femorotibial osteoarthritis contrasts with the low prevalence of primary osteoarthritis of the hip and of osteoarthritis of the fingers. Female sex, obesity, and varus or valgus deformities are the main risk factors for femorotibial osteoarthritis in black Africa.
