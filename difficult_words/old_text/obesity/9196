Obesity is associated with infiltration of white adipose tissue (WAT) by macrophages, which contributes to the development of insulin resistance. In this issue of the JCI, Kosteli and colleagues demonstrate that weight loss is unexpectedly also associated with rapid, albeit transient, recruitment of macrophages to WAT and that this appears to be related to lipolysis.
