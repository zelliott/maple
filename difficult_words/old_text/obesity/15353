We have recently shown that the hypothalamic neuropeptide CART (cocaine-amphetamine-regulated-transcript) is a leptin dependent endogenous satiety factor in the rat. In the present study we confirm and extend our previous observations by showing that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administered CART(42-89) dose-dependently inhibits 3-h food intake in food restricted rats with a lowest effective dose of 0.5 microgram. CART also potently inhibits NPY-induced food intake in satiated rats as well as nighttime food intake in free feeding animals. To identify brain areas potentially involved in mediating the anorectic effects of CART, the temporal expression pattern of the immediate early gene c-fos was examined in the central nervous system by immunohistochemistry in rats receiving recombinant CART. Compared to vehicle, CART induced c-Fos expression in several hypothalamic and brainstem structures implicated in the central control of food intake. In the hypothalamus, high numbers of c-Fos immunoreactive (-ir) cells were observed in the medial parvocellular part of the paraventricular nucleus and in the posterior part of the dorsomedial nucleus. Lower numbers of c-Fos positive nuclei were found in the supraoptic and arcuate nuclei. A relatively high number of c-Fos-ir cells was found in the central nucleus of the amygdala. In the brainstem, c-Fos-positive nuclei were found in the parabrachial nucleus, and in the nucleus of the solitary tract. Notably both the area postrema and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus were virtually devoid of c-Fos-ir cells. The present experiments suggest that CART peptide exerts its inhibitory effects on appetite by activating hypothalamic and brainstem neurones implicated in the central control of feeding behaviour and metabolism.
