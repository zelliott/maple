To assess QoL of obese patients in the Brazilian public healthcare system, before and after bariatric surgery, and to determine the appropriateness of the Moorehead-Ardelt Questionnaire II (M-A-QoLQII) compared with the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).

Forty-one severe obese patients in a waiting-list, and 84 patients who underwent bariatric surgery were included. Correlations were tested and reliability determined by the Cronbach's coefficient.

BMI differed between the pre- and post-surgery groups (52.3 ± 8.3 kg/m(2) vs. 32.5 ± 6.4 kg/m(2), p &<0.001). The latter showed better scores in the SF-36 domains than in the pre-surgery. SF-36 and M-A-QoLQII categories were correlated (r = 0.53, 0.49 and 0.47, for vitality, mental health, and general health domains, p &<0.001). In the logistic regression, age, previous BMI, and loss of excess weight were associated with functional capacity.

The outcomes of bariatric surgery obtained in a Brazilian public healthcare center were successful. M-A-QoLII represents a useful tool to assess surgery outcomes, including QoL.
