We have recently reported an impaired growth hormone (GH) response to a single i.v. bolus dose of growth hormone releasing factor (1 microgram/kg body weight) in obese women. We have now investigated whether the i.v. administration of low dose GHRF(1-29)NH2 (0.33 microgram/kg/h) by 15 min pulsed injections for 3 h followed by an i.v. bolus (1 microgram/kg) to four normal weight women and six obese women results in an enhancement of GH release. In the control women low dose GHRF, given either as a single 10 microgram injection or in pulses of equivalent total dosage, produced a GH response identical to that seen after a single bolus of 60 micrograms (mean peak GH low dose 30 +/- 2 mU/l, peak GH large dose 30 +/- 0.5 mU/l). In the obese women GH release was significantly less than the controls after low doses of GHRF (P less than 0.01) and the peak was delayed compared to that following a single large bolus dose (peak GH 7 +/- 1.2 mU/l). However, three of the obese women who previously showed no response to a large dose of GHRF did release GH after low dose pulsed injections. The final bolus of GHRF after 3 h of pulsed injections did not elicit any additional GH release in the subjects irrespective of body weight. We conclude that obesity may be characterized by impaired GH release to i.v. GHRF. The finding that some obese women do not respond to a single large dose injection of GHRF but do release GH after low dose pulsed injections supports the hypothesis of a hypothalamic disorder in these women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
