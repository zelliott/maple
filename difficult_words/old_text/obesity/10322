Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common in obese patients. The implications of obesity in the etiology, management and outcomes in treatment for GERD have become increasingly important due to an epidemic of obesity. The increasing prevalence of patients with both obesity and GERD merits evaluation of the appropriate surgical intervention for GERD and its symptoms. With the additional advantages of weight loss and resolution of weight-related morbidity (including GERD) bariatric procedures should be the procedure of choice in patients with medically complicated obesity. Patients in lower obesity classes with body mass indices (BMI) of 30-35 kg/m2 without other substantive weight-related comorbidity should prompt consideration of both fundoplication and bariatric procedures, tailoring the best approach based on the specific patient and future implications. Patients classified as overweight but not obese (BMI &<30) are likely best treated with fundoplication; however, no randomized trials comparing fundoplication with the current antireflux bariatric procedures exist.
