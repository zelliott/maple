Altered dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) activity during the progression of late-stage type 2 diabetes was measured in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats. Compared with OLETF rats subjected to 30% food restriction, food-satiated OLETF rats exhibited spontaneous hyperphagic obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and increased plasma DPP4 activity during the early phase of the experiment (up to âˆ¼30 wk). Subsequently, their plasma DPP4 activity as well as their body weight, body fat, and plasma insulin concentration declined to control levels during the late phase, resulting in excessive polyuria, proteinuria, dyslipidemia, pancreatic islet atrophy, hypoinsulinemia, and diabetes, which changed from insulin-resistant diabetes to hypoinsulinemic diabetes secondary to progressive islet insufficiency, and their fasting blood glucose level remained high. Since plasma DPP4 activity demonstrated significant positive correlations with body weight and the fasting plasma insulin level but not with the fasting blood glucose level during the late stage of diabetes, body fat and fasting plasma insulin levels may be useful factors for predicting the control of plasma DPP4 activity. In contrast, pancreatic DPP4 activity was significantly increased, and the expression of pancreatic insulin was significantly reduced in late-stage diabetic OLETF rats, suggesting that a relationship exists between the activation of pancreatic DPP4 and insulin depletion in pancreatic islet atrophy. In conclusion, it is suggested that plasma DPP4 activity changes in accordance with the progression of hyperinsulinemic obesity and pancreatic islet atrophy. DPP4 activity may play an important role in insulin homeostasis.
