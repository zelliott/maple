We established depressive symptoms prevalence in 100 patients recommended to our obesity clinic and we started antidepressant treatment in 41 of them. It has been noted that administration of SSRI leads to weight reduction after 6 months, but is followed by a weight increase later. Our experience shows that 12 months long administration of bupropion and tianeptine leads to continuous weight loss. Antidepressant administration leads to an increase in pharmacotherapy adherence, which is significantly higher than in diet and psychotherapy alone. In diabetics, antidepressants reduce glucose levels, too. Their influence on weight and diabetes compensation is, however, smaller than in "classic" anti-obesity drugs, sibutramine and orlistat.
