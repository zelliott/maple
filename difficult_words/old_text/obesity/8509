A short review of the metabolic cardiovascular risk syndrome (MCVS) is given. Traditionally, cardiovascular risk has been associated with three so-called "main" risk factors; hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and smoking. In addition, the association between diabetes and cardiovascular disease has been known for many years in clinical medicine. Primarily, these risk factors have been regarded separately as independent factors, although epidemiological studies showed intercorrelations between them. However, it is now well accepted that relatively few at-risk individuals have only one risk factor, and in many cases a whole "symphony" of factors play together to create what we might call an individuals' risk profile. As an example, very often essential hypertension has been regarded as a disease in itself, which can be successfully treated just by lowering the blood pressure by drugs. When such a strategy obviously failed, the association of elevated blood pressure with dyslipoproteinemia and impaired glucose tolerance attracted more attention, particularly when it was realized that many antihypertensive drugs affected risk in MCVS in a possible negative way. The most important etiologic factor of MCVS is (besides genetics) an excessive caloric intake compared to what the individual spends in physical activity. In the clinical setting, the most important findings of MCVS are central obesity, dyslipoproteinemia with low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, hypertension, reduced insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, and increased thrombogenicity. The reduced insulin sensitivity leads to a compensatory increase in beta-cell insulin production, and thereby hyperinsulinemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
