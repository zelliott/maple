Few measurement instruments for children's eating behaviors and beliefs have been specifically validated for African-American children. Validation within this population is important because of potential cultural and ethnic influences. Objectives were to evaluate established and newly developed or adapted dietary psychosocial measures in a sample of 303 preadolescent African-American girls and their caregivers. Acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha&> or = 0.70) was found for measures of girls' self-efficacy for healthy eating, outcome expectancies for healthy eating, positive family support for healthy eating and household availability of low-fat food and fruit, juice and vegetables (FJV). Evidence for concurrent validity was found with significant associations between self-efficacy for healthy eating and lower intake of energy (r = -0.17) and fat grams (r = -0.16). Greater FJV availability was associated with greater FJV intake (r = 0.14) and lower body mass index (BMI) in girls (r = -0.12). Positive family support for healthy eating was associated with higher BMI in girls (r = 0.41). These results contribute to the development of scales to evaluate prevention interventions related to dietary intake in African-American children.
