Obesity-associated severe asthma is a distinct phenotype characterised by resistance to standard asthma therapies. Bariatric surgery appears to be a viable alternative for those who have failed trials of traditional weight loss methods. However, anaesthetic and surgical risks are potential barriers. We describe three patients with treatment-resistant obesity-associated severe asthma who underwent bariatric surgery without complications due to the multidisciplinary perioperative planning and care involved in these complex cases. All three patients showed improvements in asthma control and reduction in maintenance medication use post-surgery.
