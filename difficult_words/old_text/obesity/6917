To choose an appropriate therapeutic treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) depends on accurately diagnosing the underlying problems that lead to the disease. Evaluating local anatomical problems is critical. New techniques, such as imaging, permit us to do this more effectively. Appreciating the involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) in a fully developed syndrome is also important. Abnormal stimulation of the autonomic nervous system can be evaluated easily with a Holter ECG. Recognizing that OSAS is a multi-faceted problem whose various symptoms interact and aggravate one another helps to explain why treatments may not be immediately effective.
