We assessed the nutritional status of 302 menstruating women living in three urban, semi-rural and rural areas of eastern Algeria. The anthropometric data and the biochemical measurements (serum levels of total proteins, albumin, transferrin and prealbumin) have shown the absence of protein malnutrition and the evidence of problems of overweight, whatever the criterion used (body mass index or relative weight). There were no differences according to the residence. Anemia (defined by WHO references) was observed in 28% of urban women, 19% of semi-rural women and in 32% of rural women. Iron deficiency (defined by the association of serum ferritin level of 12 micrograms/l or less and transferrin saturation less than 15%) was observed in 29, 27 and 22% of the cases, respectively. Folate deficiency (defined by concentration of red blood cell folates of less than 100 micrograms/l) was observed in 48, 45 and 22% of cases, respectively. Finally, 81% of anemia were associated with biochemical evidence of iron and/or folate deficiency.
