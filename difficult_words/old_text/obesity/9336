The aim of this study was to evaluate parents' ability to perceive the weight status of their children.

This cross-sectional study was performed on 5 (n = 310) and 11-year-old (n = 296) children. The height, weight and waist circumference were measured. Body mass index (BMI, kg/mÂ²) was calculated. The International Obesity Task Force criteria and the British cut-off points were used to classify BMI and waist circumference. Parents filled out a questionnaire concerning their perception of the weight class of their child. The parents and the 11-year-old children estimated their own weight class. For analysis, the measured and perceived weight classes were divided into two categories; normal weight (including underweight) and overweight or obese. To measure the agreement cross-tabulation with Cohen's Kappa was used. Explanatory variables associated with misclassification of overweight children as normal weight were examined by logistic regression modelling.

The prevalence of overweight (including obese) was 17.4% and 21.6% in 5- and 11-year-old children in this study. Only a few parents misclassified their normal weight children as overweight. By contrast, a majority of parents to the 5-year-old children and about half of the parents to the 11-year-old children misclassified them as normal weight. Using waist circumference for body size classification did not improve parents' performance. Mothers performed best when estimating own weight class.

A majority of parents fail to recognize overweight or obesity in their 5- and 11-year-old children. The underestimation of overweight may impair the motivation of the parents to adopt weight control.
