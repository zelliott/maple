To investigate liver enzymes in a cohort of women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and controls divided according to body mass index (BMI) and their association with features of the syndrome.

Eighty-three PCOS women and 64 healthy women were studied. Patients and controls were subdivided into two groups, a lean subgroup (BMI &<5kg/m(2)) and an overweight/obese subgroup (BMI&>25kg/m(2)). Clinical history, height and weight were obtained and metabolic and hormonal parameters were determined.

Serum fasting insulin, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, triglycerides and total cholesterol were significantly higher (p&<.05) in women with PCOS compared to controls. No significant difference in serum liver enzymes levels between PCOS women and controls was detected. However, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (17.7 vs. 14.1 U/L, p&<.05) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gammaGT) (17.9 vs. 13.4 U/L, p&<.05) were significantly higher in overweight/obese PCOS women compared with overweight/obese controls. In overweight/obese PCOS patients and controls, ALT levels were positively correlated with free androgen index (FAI) (r=0.25 p&<.05) and total testosterone levels (r=0.33 p&<.01).

The finding of elevated liver enzymes in overweight/obese PCOS women raises the question of screening for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in this group.
