The present studies were designed to clarify the contribution of the liver to the development of hyperglycemia in Wistar fatty rats. The hepatic activities of insulin-inducible enzymes involved in glycolysis (glucokinase; GK and pyruvate kinase) and lipogenesis (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), were higher in fatty rats than in lean rats at 4 and 8 weeks of age because of the higher insulin levels in the former. Thereafter, the GK activities of fatty rats decreased slightly in spite of severe hyperinsulinemia, and did not differ from those of lean rats. In addition, fatty rats had higher levels of insulin-suppressible gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase. These findings indicate that the hepatic enzymes of fatty rats are resistant to insulin. This postulation was supported by the fact that the hepatic enzyme activities of fatty rats showed a lower response to changes in plasma insulin levels produced by fasting and refeeding. The G6Pase/GK ratio, which indicates net glucose handling in the liver, increased in fatty rats and decreased in lean rats with advancing age, suggesting that hepatic glucose production in fatty rats becomes dominant with advancing age. The changes in hepatic glycolytic intermediates supported this suggestion; the glycolytic steps both from glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and from phospho-enolpyruvate to pyruvate in fatty rats were accelerated at 5 weeks of age, but suppressed at 12 weeks of age. These results indicate that insulin resistance in the hepatic enzyme regulation may contribute to the development of hyperglycemia in Wistar fatty rats.
