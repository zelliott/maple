Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease frequently associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. In recent years, alterations in the hemostatic system have been added to these dysfunctions. We analyzed some of these alterations in coagulation and fibrinolysis in obese children (6 to 9 years old) of both sexes. We studied 61 obese children (mean body mass index [BMI], 22.35 kg/m2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 21.82 to 22.87) and 70 non-obese children (mean BMI, 16.58 kg/m2; 95% CI, 16.24 to 16.93) as a control group. The obese subjects presented significantly elevated values for insulin (P &<.001), tissue-plasminogen activator ([t-PA] P &<.001), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ([PAI-1] P &<.001), and fibrinogen (P &<.001) with respect to the control group. We found no significant differences in the concentration of glucose and fragment 1 + 2 of prothrombin (F1 + 2). In the obese subjects, insulin, PAI-1, and F1 + 2 were positively correlated with the BMI. On the other hand, t-PA was correlated with insulin and PAI-1 but not with the BMI. Therefore, in the obese children, there was an increment of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
