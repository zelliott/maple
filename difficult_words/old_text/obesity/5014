To assess the effect of obesity on blood pressure measurement the authors obtained simultaneous oscillometric and intraarterial systolic and diastolic blood pressures on 188 lean, overweight, class I/II obese, and class III obese subjects. Oscillometric arm cuff/bladder size was selected in accordance with standard guidelines. Oscillometry significantly underestimated systolic and significantly overestimated diastolic blood pressures in each of the 4 weight groups studied. The differences between oscillometric and intraarterial systolic and diastolic pressures were not significantly different among lean, overweight, class I/II obese, and class III obese subjects. Thus, obesity per se does not influence the accuracy of blood pressure measurement. However, oscillometric blood pressure measurement is associated with significant error when compared to intraarterial blood pressure.
