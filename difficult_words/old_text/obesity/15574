The results of a 1-year posttreatment follow-up of 93 obese women diagnosed as having binge eating disorder (BED) and treated with group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) followed by weight loss treatment are described. The group as a whole maintained both reductions in binge eating and abstinence rates fairly well. However, they regained the weight lost during treatment. Those who stopped binge eating during CBT maintained a weight loss of 4.0 kg over the follow-up period. In contrast, those who continued to binge gained 3.6 kg. Twenty-six percent of those abstinent after CBT met criteria for BED at follow-up and had gained weight, whereas the remaining 74% had lost weight. Stopping binge eating appears critical to sustained weight loss in BED.
