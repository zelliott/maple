Adiponectin concentrations exhibit strong cross-sectional relationships with obesity, inflammation, and diabetes. Adiponectin concentrations have been extensively evaluated as epidemiologic markers of diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk. In the present review we will provide an overview of these epidemiologic relationships as the backdrop for an evaluation of the clinical applications of adiponectin measurements. These include using adiponectin as an indicator of need for preventive or therapeutic intervention, as a predictor of response to therapy, and as a marker of therapeutic effectiveness. These efforts are laying the groundwork for the transition of adiponectin measurements from the laboratory to the clinic.
