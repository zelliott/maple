Change in dietary-fat behaviors was assessed in 95 African-American women in a culturally adapted weight-management program using the SisterTalk Food Habits Questionnaire. The hypothesis was that there would be no practical difference in ability to track dietary-fat behaviors related to weight change when using only 30 items from the SisterTalk Food Habits Questionnaire (about fat consumption frequency) compared to using all 91 items from the SisterTalk Food Habits Questionnaire (30 items plus additional details about behaviors). SisterTalk Food Habits Questionnaire responses use a scale of 1 to 4; higher numbers imply higher fat consumption. After an average of 18 months (n=49), a pre- to postintervention decrease in SisterTalk Food Habits Questionnaire score was observed using 91 items (-0.35) or 30 items (-0.28) (both P&<.001). Correlations between SisterTalk Food Habits Questionnaire change and change in body mass index were similar using 91 or 30 items (0.36 and 0.35, respectively, both P&<.05). Thirty questions measuring consumption frequency may provide adequate information about dietary-fat behavior changes associated with weight loss.
