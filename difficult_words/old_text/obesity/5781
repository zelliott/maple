Suture and staple-based endoluminal devices for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and obesity have failed to demonstrate long-term efficacy.

To demonstrate the feasibility of mucosal excision and full-thickness suture apposition of the excision beds to create sufficient scar tissue formation at the gastroesophageal junction for the intraluminal treatment of GERD or obesity.

Survival animal experiments.

Seven mongrel dogs. Interventions. Under general endotracheal anesthesia, a Barostat test was performed on 4 dogs. A mucosal excision device was introduced through the esophagus into the proximal stomach. Two to 4 mucosal excisions were performed on all dogs at or just below the gastroesophageal junction and the mucosal pieces were removed. After hemostasis, an intraluminal suturing instrument was introduced and either 2 or 4 sutures were placed through the excision beds to bring them into apposition. These were tied and the suture strands cut. All dogs were survived for 2 months. End-term endoscopies were performed, and a repeat Barostat procedure was performed on the animals undergoing an antireflux procedure. After euthanasia the stomachs were explanted, examined, photographed, and sectioned for histologic examination.

All dogs survived without complication. In the 4 GERD dogs, the Barostat studies demonstrated a significant decrease in gastroesophageal junction compliance. In the 3 dogs undergoing the obesity procedure, the gastric outlet apposition to a 6-mm endoscope was satisfactory with full insufflation and the desired scarring was seen on histologic examination.

It is possible to create adequate gastroesophageal junction scarring for the treatment of GERD and obesity. A clinical pilot study will be initiated.
