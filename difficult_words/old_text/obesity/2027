To analyze problems with inserting, maintaining and removing a laryngeal mask in children, as well as to assess the possible involvement of certain factors (experience with the laryngeal mask, type of anesthesia, duration of surgery, type of surgery, obesity, etc.) in favoring the development of complications. One hundred eighty-nine children undergoing a variety of surgical procedures under general anesthesia were studied; patients with full stomachs and/or a history of hiatus hernia were excluded. The agent used for anesthetic induction and the method of ventilation were chosen by the anesthesiologist responsible for each case. Variables monitored in all patients were continuous ECG, heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, capnography, pulse oximetry, airways pressure and respiratory rate. Values were recorded at five times: before induction (T1), immediately after induction (T2), after placement of the laryngeal mask (T3), before removing the laryngeal mask (T4) and after removing the laryngeal mask (T5). Correct insertion was achieved on the first try in 85%. The remaining 15% required 2 or more tries. There were no cases in which a tracheal tube or face mask were required. We found no correlation between type or duration of surgery and the occurrence of complications. Complications were more frequent when the laryngeal mask was placed by inexperienced personnel, when inhalational anesthetics were used for induction and maintenance, and when a No. 1 laryngeal mask was used. Adequate ventilation was provided for the patients who required it with an airways pressure between 8 and 18 cmH2O, arterial oxygen saturation over 98% and end-expiratory CO2 pressure under 35 mmHg. Cardiovascular repercussions were slight and hemodynamic stability was good.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
