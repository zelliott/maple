To improve the quality of evaluation of abnormal anthropological status through a detailed analysis of physical development and setting standards for the Slavic population of the region's children conducted population-based study involving 582 school children using cluster sampling method for selecting a level of accuracy of 95 %. Through the detailed anthropometry it was revealed that physical development of Kharkov region adolescents mainly harmonious and corresponds to median values for the WHO charts. Percentage of accelerated adolescents significantly greater than delayed ones. Prevalence of overweight and obesity it's about (15,00 +/- 2,96) % of the total population. Differences in the body composition are recorded reliably after 14 years. Weight gain in boys develops mainly stepwise at the expense of muscle mass with a physiological abdominal fat tissue predisposition, and in the girls both from muscle and fat mass with the advantage of fat with its gynoid predisposition. According to our data, waist to hip ratio reflects gender dependence of the fat predisposition and the waist to height ratio the abdominal one. The results can be used as a preliminary standard for further studies.
