Recent advances in understanding the relation of risk factors to coronary artery disease (CAD) have initiated a change in the approach to managing the hypertensive patient. Reduction of elevated blood pressure still remains a major therapeutic priority. However, the risk of cardiovascular morbidity is also related to hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia, hyperfibrinogenemia and obesity; all aggravate the risk of CAD in the patient with high blood pressure. Life-style is also important: cigarette smoking, high alcohol consumption and lack of physical exercise all predispose to precocious atheromatous CAD. Thus, the most favorable prognosis in terms of reducing CAD risk is accomplished by reducing elevated systemic arterial pressure while simultaneously improving all other risk factors. The method by which blood pressure is lowered is an important consideration. The ancillary metabolic activities of antihypertensive drugs now available differ widely. Diuretics and beta blockers, for example, have potentially adverse metabolic effects, whereas agents such as selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitors appear to beneficially affect several metabolic cofactors influencing the CAD risk profile. The impact of such drug-induced metabolic changes on overall prognosis of the hypertensive patient remains to be clarified. In the absence of other contraindications, however, it is sensible to use drugs that do not increase the metabolic predilection to precocious CAD.
