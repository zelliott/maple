Insulin resistance is a metabolic disorder in which target cells fail to respond to normal levels of circulating insulin. Insulin resistance has been associated with presence of acanthosis nigricans and acrochordons. It is known that early diagnosis and early initial treatment are of paramount importance to prevent a series of future complications. These dermatoses may represent an easily identifiable sign of insulin resistance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes.
