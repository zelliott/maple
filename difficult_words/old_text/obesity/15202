To investigate the correlates of physician-patient discussions about body weight, healthy diet, and physical activity.

Subjects were 635 adults (≥65 years; mean 72.8 years) who had an increased body mass index (BMI≥25 kg/m2) and participated in a self-administered community survey. Logistic regression analyses were performed.

While approximately half of study participants reported having discussed healthy diets (51%) and physical activity (52%) with their physician, only 42% of those who were overweight or obese reported being recognized as such by their physician. Being moderately or severely obese, more chronic conditions, and more frequent physician visits increased the likelihood of being recognized as overweight or obese and reporting lifestyle discussions.

The health care provider is important in recognizing older patient's weight problems and discussing practical lifestyle changes. Tools for more proactive screening and implementation of follow-up behavioral counseling can help the health care providers better address obesity prevention in clinical practice.
