The lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) is a signaling mediator with wide-ranging biological effects. In this paper, we report that disruption of mGsta4, a gene encoding the 4-HNE-conjugating enzyme mGSTA4-4, causes increased 4-HNE tissue levels and is accompanied by age-dependent development of obesity which precedes the onset of insulin resistance in 129/sv mice. In contrast, mGsta4 null animals in the C57BL/6 genetic background have normal 4-HNE levels and remain lean, indicating a role of 4-HNE in triggering or maintaining obesity. In mGsta4 null 129/sv mice, the expression of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) transcript is enhanced several-fold with a concomitant increase in the tissue level of malonyl-CoA. Also, mitochondrial aconitase is partially inhibited, and tissue citrate levels are increased. Accumulation of citrate could lead to allosteric activation of ACC, further augmenting malonyl-CoA levels. Aconitase may be inhibited by 4-HNE or by peroxynitrite generated by macrophages which are enriched in white adipose tissue of middle-aged mGsta4 null 129/sv mice and, upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation, produce more reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide than macrophages from wild-type mice. Excessive malonyl-CoA synthesized by the more abundant and/or allosterically activated ACC in mGsta4 null mice leads to fat accumulation by the well-known mechanisms of promoting fatty acid synthesis and inhibiting fatty acid beta-oxidation. Our findings complement the recent report that obesity causes both a loss of mGSTA4-4 and an increase in the level of 4-HNE [Grimsrud, P. A., et al. (2007) Mol. Cell. Proteomics 6, 624-637]. The two reciprocal processes are likely to establish a positive feedback loop that would promote and perpetuate the obese state.
