Increased focus on the potential negative side effects of steroid usage in pediatric transplantation has led to steroid minimization or steroid-free transplantation. In this study, we report results after complete steroid avoidance in renal transplantation in the period 1994-2009. We evaluate the effects of complete steroid avoidance on allograft function, BMI, and linear growth. The majority of transplanted children were induced with antithymocyte globulin and immunosuppressed with a calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil. Steroids were given only when rejection occurred or due to comorbidities. Anthropometric data were collected from 65 transplantations in 60 children. Patient survival was 93%; graft survival was 81% after five yr (N = 42) and 63% after 10 yr (N = 16). Acute rejection within the first year of transplantation was 9%. The distribution of the children's BMI before transplantation was normal; the mean BMI-SDS was 0.21 before transplantation, and this value remained stable during the next five yr. Post-transplantation the children demonstrated significant improved growth as the mean height-SDS increased significantly from -1.7 to -1.1. Catch-up growth was most pronounced in the youngest (&<six yr). Steroid-free immunosuppression in pediatric renal transplantation is safe and protects against steroid-induced obesity and short stature.
