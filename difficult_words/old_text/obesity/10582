We assessed the effect of epinephrine on human monocytes. Monocytes were isolated from 16 healthy obese and 10 lean healthy subjects. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Obese subjects were subdivided into 2 sub-groups, insulin sensitive (IS) and insulin resistant (IR). Monocyte properties [attachment to laminin 1, migration through laminin 1, oxidized-low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) phagocytosis] were assessed pre- and post-stimulation in vitro with epinephrine. Experiments were repeated after incubation with a Na(+)/H( +) exchanger-1 inhibitor (NHE-1) (cariporide). Epinephrine increased monocyte attachment to laminin in lean and obese IR subjects through involvement of NHE-1, PKC, NO synthase, NADPH oxidase and actin polymerization. In contrast, epinephrine did not affect monocyte migration. Epinephrine increased oxLDL phagocytosis in all groups studied. Incubation with cariporide attenuated oxLDL phagocytosis. Epinephrine induces monocyte dysfunction which may be atherogenic.
