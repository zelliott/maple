The prevalence of obesity is increasing in the developed and developing world. It is an independent risk factor for heart failure. Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction has been demonstrated to be a strong predictor of heart failure. In the present study we aimed to assess the impact of body weight on LV diastolic function.

The study was conducted on 2,228 participants (1,424 women, 804 men with a mean age of 49). Traditional and tissue Doppler echocardiographic examination were performed in all of the participants. The demographic and echocardiographic data were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent predictors of association of LV diastolic function. The study sample was divided into four groups: group 1 (body mass index [BMI] &<25.0 kg/m(2) ), group 2 (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)), group 3 (BMI ≥ 30-39.9 kg/m(2)), and group 4 (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2)).

Septal E was significantly lower in groups 2 and 3 compared to group 1 (P = 0.003). Septal A and septal A' were significantly higher whereas septal E' and lateral E' were significantly lower in the groups 2, 3, and 4 compared to the normal weight group (P &<0.001). Lateral A', deceleration time, and ejection time were significantly higher in obese when compared to the normal weight (P = 0.025, P &<0.001, and P = 0.009, respectively). The E/E' ratio was significantly higher in groups 2, 3, and 4 compared to the group 1 (P &<0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, BMI (OR = 1.060 [95% CI = 1.040 and 1.080]; P &<0.001), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were independent predictors of LV diastolic dysfunction.

BMI is an independent predictor of LV diastolic dysfunction along with age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.
