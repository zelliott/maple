In the offspring of gestational or long-term diabetic mothers the following findings were obtained: (1) Immunoreactive plasma insulin levels on the first day of life were weakly correlated to the thickness of the skin-fold at the neck on the third day of life (n = 82; r = 0.27; P less than 0.05). (2) A significant correlation was found between the plasma insulin levels at birth and the basal as well as the maximal plasma insulin values after glucose loading (1.75 g/kg b. wt.) at 2 years of age (for basal values: n = 25; r = 0.53; P less than 0.01; and for maximal values: n = 21; r = 0.63; P less than 0.01). (3) A highly significant correlation was even observed between the thickness of the neck-fold at 3 days of age and the fasting plasma insulin levels at 3-8 years of age (n = 26; r = 0.61; P less than 0.001). These findings suggest that perinatal hyperinsulinism and perinatal obesity, induced by maternal hyperglycaemia and/or overnutrition during pregnancy, are risk factors for persistent hyperinsulinaemia predisposing to diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease in later life.
