After ilioinguinal radical lymph node dissection (RLND), the therapy for lymph fistulas constitutes a challenge. Risk factors for the genesis of lymph fistulas have not been sufficiently evaluated. We investigated possible factors that could influence the development of lymph fistulas in patients suffering from malignant melanoma after iloinguinal RLND.

The analysis was related to patients with intransit and lymphonodal metastasised malignant melanoma of the lower limb, who underwent RLND and isolated limb perfusion (ILP). Prospective data acquisition from patients undergoing ilioinguinal RLND and ILP in a one-step approach was performed. The association of lymph fistulas to risk factors was calculated using chi-squared, linear-by-linear test and ROC curves. As possible risk factors we investigated the presence of prior surgery and diabetes mellitus type II in the medical history, chemotherapeutics, patient age and the body mass index (BMI).

Postoperative lymph fistula occurred in 11 of 108 patients (10.2%). A significant association to lymph fistulas was found in BMI (30.2Â± 7.0 kg/m (2), p&<.02). Other parameters, such as prior surgery (82% vs. 71%), diabetes mellitus type II (9% vs. 11.7%), chemotherapeutics and patient age (mean 67.8 vs. 62.4 years) showed no influence.

Our results indicate that the incidence of lymph fistulas after RLND and ILP of malignant melanoma of the lower limb was associated with an increased BMI. Thus, for the prevention of lymph fistulae, an initially alternative wound-closure dressing like vacuum assisted closure (V.A.C.) dressing could be of clinical relevance for obese patients.
