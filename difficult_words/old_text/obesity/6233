131I-hippuran nephrography conducted in 80 patients aged 26-53 with I and II degree obesity has revealed changes in the excretory phase (36.9 per cent of the patients with I degree obesity) and secretory and excretory and some vascular and metabolic abnormalities were registered in 79.4 per cent of those with II degree obesity. Weight gain had an adverse effect on the condition of such patients. Isotope nephrography enables one to study risk factors (arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus).
