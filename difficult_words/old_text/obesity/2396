Left ventricular hypertrophy is an adaptive structural cardiac response to the afterload imposed by the hypertensive (and other pressure overload) diseases. As such, it maintains a stable cardiac performance until further adaptation is no longer possible, and then cardiac failure supervenes. Offsetting this "beneficial" effect is a distinct risk demonstrated epidemiologically by a greater number of cardiovascular morbid and mortal events, more severe ischemic disease, cardiac dysrhythmias, and sudden death. The precise mechanisms are just beginning to be elucidated. Other new and intriguing areas related to ventricular hypertrophy include its regression with certain forms of pharmacologic therapy and not others. This problem is also being investigated further at this time.
