The aim of the study was to answer the question if there are any abnormalities in the function of left heart ventricle and in its mass in children and adolescents with hypertension and obesity and positive family history of cardiovascular diseases.

The study group consisted of 70 children and adolescents aged 11-19 yrs. They were divided into: group A--patients with hypertension (n=17) group B--patients with hypertension and positive family history of hypertension (n=16), group C--patients with hypertension, obesity and positive family history of hypertension (n=19). Control group consisted of 18 healthy children. Left ventricle heart mass and systolic-diastolic function were assessed with use of ultrasonographic method on Hewlett Packard Sonos 4500.

In 35 (50%) of the studied patients we confirmed hypertension in the family. In children with hypertension and positive family history we found statistically higher left ventricle mass (p&<.05), higher ratio E/A (p&<.001), shorter deceleration time of wave E (p&<.05) in comparison to control group. In the group of children with hypertension, positive family history and additionally obesity we found longer isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) (p&<.05) and EF (p&<.05) in comparison to control group.

1. Children and adolescents with hypertension and positive family history of hypertension revealed to have higher left ventricle heart mass and diminished parameters of systolic-diastolic function of left ventricle. 2. Normotensive children of hypertensive parents and children with hypertension should be taken into particular medical health care by pediatricians or general practitioners.
