This paper is a study of 117 patients with endstage renal failure, treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) over periods of 1-56 months. The study has shown CAPD to be an effective form of dialysis with a number of advantages over intermittent peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis (better control of salt and water status, hypertension and anemia, steady state biochemistry and greater ease of self-dialysis). Peritoneal clearance and ultrafiltration have remained adequate in all but a few patients. Hypoproteinemia, poor nutrition, obesity and abdominal herniae have been problems in a small percentage of patients. Hyperlipidemia has developed in half the patients but improved with diet. Peritonitis remains the major barrier to the more widespread use of CAPD, although its incidence can be considerably reduced by use of better connectors, bacterial filters and choice of patients.
