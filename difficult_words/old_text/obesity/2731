It has been proposed that fetal exposure to environmental stressors, such as undernutrition, during critical periods of development may lead to adaptations that permanently change the structure and function of the body. These adaptations may be important for immediate survival during fetal development, but can predispose to disease in later life. We designed a pilot study investigating the effect of fetal undernutrition on the obesity-related peptides adiponectin, ghrelin, leptin and resistin levels in rat. We also wanted to explore changes in lipid and insulin metabolism. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to three dietary treatment groups on day 4 of gestation. The control group was fed ad libitum and the food-restricted rats received either 75% or 50% of ad libitum food intake until parturition. Serum levels of obesity-related peptides as well as lipid and insulin levels were measured from 1-month-old pups. Serum resistin concentrations were higher in both food-restricted groups and serum adiponectin concentration was lower in the 50% food-restricted group compared to the control group. Serum total cholesterol levels were significantly higher in both food-restricted groups. These results indicate that undernutrition during fetal development may lead to unfavorable changes in obesity-related peptide hormones as well as evoking adverse changes in serum cholesterol levels. The observed changes may predispose to insulin resistance and significantly increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in later life.
