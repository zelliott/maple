Caloric restriction (CR) and metabolic glucoprivation affect spontaneous physical activity (SPA), but it's unknown whether these treatments similarly affect SPA in selectively bred obesity-prone (OP) and -resistant (OR) rats. OR rats have greater basal SPA and are more responsive to treatments that modulate SPA, such as orexin A administration. We hypothesized that OR rats would be more sensitive to other treatments modulating SPA. To test this, continuous 24-h SPA was measured before and during acute (24 h) and chronic (8 wk) CR in OR, OP, and Sprague-Dawley rats. Pharmacological glucoprivation was produced by injection of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), and SPA was measured 5 h postinjection. Acute CR increased SPA in all groups; however, the effect was dependent on the index of SPA and time interval during the 24-h time period. In contrast to OR rats, chronic CR increased distance traveled, ambulatory episodes, and time spent in ambulation and stereotypy during the time interval preceding anticipation of food in OP and Sprague-Dawley rats. Although the effects of 2-DG treatment on SPA were minimal, OR rats had significantly greater SPA than OP and Sprague-Dawley rats independent of treatment. That chronic CR failed to result in significant changes in SPA in OR rats suggests that these rats may be especially unresponsive to treatments modulating feeding. This insensitivity coupled with elevated basal SPA levels may in part mediate phenotypic traits of lean rats.
