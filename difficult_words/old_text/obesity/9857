These contribute to preponderance of musculoskeletal co-morbidities among obese patients. Critical peri-operative issues which include increased cardiopulmonary risks, issues of special equipment, instrumentation, surgical approach, patients' positioning and adjustments in medication should be acknowledged and meticulously addressed in operative management of orthopaedic conditions in obese patients. Surgeries in obese patients are fraught with operative challenges and post-operative complications than in the non-obese and a good knowledge of the critical issues in surgical management of obese patients is necessary to facilitate decision making as well as rendering of effective and efficient orthopaedic care.
