The aim of the study was to assess the body fat (BF) composition in hemodialysis (HD) patients using anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and investigate relationships between BIA-determined BF composition and nutritional parameters in different weight groupings.

Cross-sectional study.

A tertiary-care university hospital.

164 HD patients (M/F: 89/75, mean age: 48.4 +/- 15.8 years, mean HD duration: 58.2 +/- 42.6 months) were divided into three groups according to body mass index (BMI): normal weight (NW: BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (OW: BMI 25-29.9), obese (OB, BMI&> or = 30). Biochemical parameters and BF composition using anthropometry and foot-to-foot BIA were compared between three groups.

Ninety-six (59%) patients were NW, 40 (24%) were OW, and 28 (17%) were OB. Average mean skinfold thickness (p = 0.005), mid-arm circumference (p = 0.001), BF% (p = 0.001), and fat-free mass (FFM) (p = 0.03) were all significantly greater in the OB group than in the NW group. Compared to the NW patients, the OB group had significantly higher serum levels of glucose (p = 0.03), total cholesterol (p = 0.02), and triglycerides (p = 0.02), but significantly lower serum albumin (p = 0.05) and blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.05). The OB group also had significantly higher white blood cell count (p = 0.002) and serum CRP (p = 0.001) than the NW group.

The results suggest that BIA-determined BF composition is correlated with body mass index. In addition, obesity is associated with elevated CRP and white blood cell count and lower serum albumin level in HD patients.
