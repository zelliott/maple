Body fat distribution is a biological risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. There are known genetic factors influencing body fat distribution, but variation in this characteristic is also attributable to human behavioural and socioeconomic variables such as social class. Bj√∂rntorp has proposed that these associations may be due to a series of physiological responses to psychosocial stress, most prominently chronic stimulation of the adrenal-cortical system. This system is known to affect body fat distribution. Elsewhere we have shown that general socioeconomic status is related to body fat distribution in men and women of the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) of the United States. In this paper we explore the relationship with those behavioural variables available from the HHANES which could hypothetically serve as indicators of psychosocial stress: smoking, drinking and depression. For both sexes in all Hispanic ethnic groups except Puerto Rican men, as socioeconomic status declined, subcutaneous fat became more centrally distributed. This relationship continued to be significant after controlling for the behavioural variables. A positive relationship was also found between smoking and central body fat distribution which was independent of socioeconomic status. This relationship was statistically significant for all subsamples except Cuban-American women. No consistent relationships were found between body fat distribution, drinking and depression. The data support the hypothesis that body fat distribution may be linked to the social stress of low socioeconomic status, independent of the behavioural factors tested.
