The present study investigates the possible associations between coronary heart disease and histological prostate carcinoma in autopsy material.

The material of our study, were 116 men between 55 years and 98 years of age, who died in the period of August 2002-January 2005. The initial segment of the aorta and the prostate glands of all cadavers were removed while the initial 30 mm of the left and right coronary arteries and the peripheral zone of the prostate gland underwent pathologic examination.

Of all subjects examined 71.8% had pathological findings suggesting advanced coronary heart disease. Twenty out of 116 cadavers were found with histological carcinoma in their prostate specimen. Among subjects positive for prostate cancer, 12 had died of cardiovascular diseases, while 16 had macroscopic evidence of advanced coronary artery obstructive disease, a finding that was confirmed on pathologic examination. Although most of the subjects had atheromatous lesions on the coronary arteries, the percentage of men with prostate cancer, which had advanced atheromatosis, was greater when compared to those of subjects without prostate cancer. The relation between the coronary artery obstructive disease severity and the presence of latent prostate cancer was statistically significant (P = 0.02). No statistically significant correlation was obtained between body mass index and the presence of prostate cancer.

Our results indicate that there could be an association between coronary artery obstructive disease and prostate cancer, however due to the relatively low sample further studies are needed in order to confirm such findings.
