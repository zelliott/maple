Uptake of long-chain fatty acids plays pivotal roles in metabolic homeostasis and human physiology. Uptake rates must be controlled in an organ-specific fashion to balance storage with metabolic needs during transitions between fasted and fed states. Many obesity-associated diseases, such as insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, cardiac lipotoxicity, and hepatic steatosis, are thought to be driven by the overflow of fatty acids from adipose stores and the subsequent ectopic accumulation of lipids resulting in apoptosis, ER stress, and inactivation of the insulin receptor signaling cascade. Thus, it is of critical importance to understand the components that regulate the flux of fatty acid between the different organ systems. Cellular uptake of fatty acids by key metabolic organs, including the intestine, adipose tissue, muscle, heart, and liver, has been shown to be protein mediated and various unique combinations of fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs/SLC27A1-6) are expressed by all of these tissues. Here we review our current understanding of how FATPs can contribute to normal physiology and how FATP mutations as well as hypo- and hypermorphic changes contribute to disorders ranging from cardiac lipotoxicity to hepatosteatosis and ichthyosis. Ultimately, our increasing knowledge of FATP biology has the potential to lead to the development of new diagnostic tools and treatment options for some of the most pervasive chronic human disorders.
