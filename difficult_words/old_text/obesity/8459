This article describes the impact of non-pharmacological interventions--salt restriction, weight control, alcohol consumption, exercise, and potassium supplementation--on the effects of drug treatment of hypertension, and their potential to reduce the patient's drug requirements. Although consensus on all aspects of such interventions has not yet been reached, the evidence that these approaches may reduce the need for drugs is considered satisfactory.
