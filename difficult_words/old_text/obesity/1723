This report presents a preliminary study investigating the effects of large-volume liposuction on the parameters that determine type 2 diabetes. The study enrolled 31 patients with a body mass index (BMI) exceeding 30 kg/m(2) over a 1-year period. All the liposuction procedures were performed with the patient under local anesthesia using ketamine/valium sedation. Pre- and postoperative blood pressure, fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), weight, and BMI were evaluated for 16 of the 30 patients who returned for a follow-up visit 3 to 12 months postoperatively. The average aspirate was 8,455 ml without dermolipectomy and 5,795 ml with dermolipectomy. The data reveal a trend of improvement in blood sugar levels associated with weight loss that helps the patients. The average blood sugar level dropped 18% in our return patients, and the average weight loss was 9.2%. The average drop in BMI was 6.2%, and HbA1C showed a decrease of 2.3%. The patients with the best weight loss had the best reduction in blood sugar level and blood pressure. No transfers to the hospital and no thromboebolism occurred for any of the 31 patients. One dehiscence, two wound infections, and three seromas were reported. The authors hypothesize that large-volume liposuction in their series may have motivated some to diet, which could be explored in a larger series with control groups. Liposuction alone did not improve obesity but helped to motivate some of the patients to lose weight. These patients had the best results.
