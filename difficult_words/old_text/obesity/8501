The authors revealed during dispensarization of pregnant women suffering from essential hypertension that the disease is relatively frequently associated with some metabolic disorders, i. e. obesity, gestational diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. They draw attention to a similarity with Reaven's syndrome in non-pregnant women. The authors recommend to screen for diabetes all obese pregnant women and those with hypertension to detect an impaired glucose metabolism and prevent foetopathies in neonates of thus affected mothers. The authors consider obesity one of the subsidiary criteria in the differential diagnosis of essential hypertension and preeclampsia.
