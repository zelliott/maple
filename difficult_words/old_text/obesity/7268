High levels of oxidative stress were reported in obesity-linked type 2 diabetes and were associated with elevated formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Many studies have focused on the effect of antioxidants on vascular and circulating cells such as macrophages. However, despite the major role of adipocytes in the etiology of diabetes, little is known about the effect of natural antioxidants on adipocyte response to oxidative stress. The present study reports the differential protective effects of plant nutrients toward adipose cells subjected to oxidative stress. Caffeic acid, quercetin, L: -ascorbic acid, and alpha-tocopherol were tested on SW872 liposarcoma cells subjected to a free radical generator or to AGEs. Proliferation, viability, free radical formation, and superoxide dismutase expression were assessed in treated cells. Caffeic acid and quercetin appeared as the most potent antioxidant nutrients. Our findings clearly show a novel antioxidant role for caffeic acid and quercetin at the adipose tissue level. These new data confirm the beneficial role of phytotherapy as an interesting alternative mean for the development of novel therapeutical and nutritional strategy to prevent metabolic disorders inherent to obesity-linked diabetes.
