The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between insulin sensitivity and lower body muscle strength in overweight and obese sedentary postmenopausal women. The design of the study was cross-sectional. The study population consisted of 82 non-diabetic overweight and obese sedentary postmenopausal women (age: 58.2 +/- 5.1 y; body mass index (BMI): 32.4 +/- 4.6 kg.m-2). Subjects were classified by dividing the entire cohort into quartiles based on relative insulin sensitivity expressed per kilograms of lean body mass (LBM) (Q1, &<10.3, vs. Q2, 10.3-12.4, vs. Q3, 12.5-14.0, vs. Q4,&>14.0 mg.min-1.kg LBM-1). We measured insulin sensitivity (using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique), body composition (using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), visceral fat and muscle attenuation (using computed tomography), and a lower-body muscle strength index expressed as weight lifted in kilograms per kilogram of LBM (kg.kg LBM-1) (using weight-training equipment). A positive and significant relationship was observed between insulin sensitivity and the muscle strength index (r = 0.37; p &<0.001). Moreover, a moderate but significant correlation was observed between the muscle strength index and muscle attenuation (r = 0.22; p &<0.05). Finally, the muscle strength index was significantly higher in the Q4 group compared with the Q2 and Q1 groups, respectively (3.78 +/- 1.13 vs. 2.99 +/- 0.77 and 2.93 +/- 0.91 kg.kg LBM-1; p &<0.05). Insulin sensitivity is positively associated with lower-body muscle strength in overweight and obese sedentary postmenopausal women.
