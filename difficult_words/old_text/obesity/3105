A total of 196 children aged 5 to 14 (156 of them with obesity, 40 healthy children) were investigated. The immune status of children with various clinicogenetic types of obesity was characterized by the reduction of the number of T-lymphocytes and their function, change in the ratio of T-lymphocyte subpopulations, an increase in the level of 0-lymphocytes, dysimmunoglobulinemia resulting from an increase in IgA concentration and a decrease in the IgG level, an increase in CIC concentration. Hyperinsulinemia and a rise of the blood level of C-peptide were revealed. Insulin inhibited rosette formation with sheep erythrocytes. A study of the effect of insulin on LBTR permitted a conclusion of insulin stimulation of immature lymphocytes and lymphocyte sensitization of obese children to insulin. Immune deviations were most probably determined by direct or metabolic-associated effects of insulin. The investigation opens up opportunities for the development of appropriate effective therapy.
