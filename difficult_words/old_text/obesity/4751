Metabolic syndrome is a clinical term which encompasses obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, as well as an increased risk of the development of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cardiovascular disorders in early adulthood. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is increasing and directly related to the obesity rate among children. The aim of the research was to compare the established definition of the criteria for diagnosing metabolic syndrome in a sample group consisting of overweight and obese children in Vojvodina.

The research was performed as a cross study analysis of 206 examinees. In terms of the sample group (25% children and 75% adolescents), 74% were obese and 26% overweight according to the body mass index (BMI). Two sets of criteria for diagnosing metabolic syndrome were applied in the sample of adolescents: the criteria for adults, specifically adapted for children, and the criteria defined by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) for children and adolescents. The research included the analysis of the following criteria: BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, glycemia and insulinemia during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

By applying the specific criteria for diagnosing the metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents on the whole sample, it was established that the metabolic syndrome was present in 41% of the examinees, while the application of the criteria defined by the IDF confirmed the diagnosis in 22% of the examinees. An analysis of the metabolic syndrome risk fac- tors established that among the defined specific criteria the most frequent factors present were elevated BMI and the pathological results of the OGTT, while the least frequent was low HDL cholesterol. Among the criteria listed by the IDF, the most frequent metabolic syndrome factors were waist circumference and increased blood pressure, while the least frequent was elevated fasting glucose.

Metabolic syndrome in overweight and obese children in Vojvodina was diagnosed much more often when the specific criteria for children and adolescents were applied than it was the case when the criteria defined by the International Diabetes Federation were applied.
