It is possible that many of the conflicting findings concerning obesity and cardiovascular disease may be the result of the heterogeneous nature of obesity, adn that only certain subgroups of the obese are at increased risk. Over the last several decades, much attention has focused on the distribution of body fat as an important characteristic in the metabolic and clinical alterations associated with obesity. Several studies have shown that a relative excess of adipose tissue in the upper body, abdominal region, or at various truncal sites is associated with an increased risk of disease; furthermore, these associations are independent of the general level of obesity. This article presents a brief historical overview of the idea of body fat distribution, the measurement techniques that have been used, and the complications associated with an adverse distribution of body fat distribution; particular emphasis is given to studies that have examined fat patterning in early life. Although most investigators recognize that body fat distribution is important in the development of cardiovascular disease, several questions remain.
