Nurses' work is known to be stressful, and many nurses work shifts. Both stress and shift work are factors that can influence how and what nurses eat and may increase nurses' risk for weight gain and obesity. This literature review summarizes the evidence regarding the prevalence of obesity and overweight among nurses who work shifts and examine associations between stress and the eating behaviors of these nurses. The conclusion provides some implications for occupational health nurses who promote wellness for their employees.
