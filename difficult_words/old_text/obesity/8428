To determine the relation between the circadian rhythm of ingestive behavior and the progression of obesity in Zucker rats, ingestion and ambulation were analyzed at four different developmental stages. The obese rats were disrupted gradually in nocturnal patterns of feeding, drinking, and ambulation with the progression of obesity, although the lean littermates maintained the patterns during whole test periods. Analysis of autocorrelogram revealed that circadian rhythms of those behaviors remained throughout the whole test periods. Least-squares spectrum ascertained the following. 1) The obese made advance shift of acrophases in feeding and drinking circadian cycles, but not in ambulation. 2) Amplitudes in those behavioral measures decreased with the progression of obesity. 3) Mesor in the obese feeding was not affected, although that in the lean feeding decreased. The findings indicate that disruption of the light-dark cycle in ingestion of the obese was not due to disappearance of circadian rhythm but to transformation by both decreased amplitude and advance shift of the circadian cycle.
