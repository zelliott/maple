Substantial evidence from epidemiological data supports a link between obesity and hypertension. However, the relationship between the two disorders is not straightforward and most likely represents an interaction of demographic, genetic, hormonal, renal, and hemodynamic factors. Age, race, and sex also modulate the strength of the association between obesity and hypertension. Hyperinsulinemia, which is characteristic of obesity, can contribute to the probability of developing hypertension by activating the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and by causing sodium retention. The pressor effect of insulin in obesity may be further enhanced by the observation that its vasodilator action can be blunted in obese subjects. Preliminary data have shown that leptin, whose levels are increased in most obese individuals, can contribute to hypertension in obesity through its effects on insulin, SNS, and sodium excretion. The kidney may also have a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension in obesity. Abnormal renal sodium handling coupled with structural changes in the kidney of an obese patient can raise blood pressure. In addition, obesity is associated with distinct cardiovascular hemodynamic alterations and development of eccentric myocardial hypertrophy. Most of these obesity-associated abnormalities, as well as hypertension itself, can be reversed by weight loss. Furthermore, weight loss can prevent, or at least delay, the development of hypertension in patients with high-normal blood pressure. Weight reduction should be the first-line treatment in every obese hypertensive patient. However, the majority of patients will need pharmacologic intervention in conjunction with weight loss. Selection of antihypertensive agents in the overweight patient should take into account the mechanisms leading to hypertension and the metabolic abnormalities that characterize the obese patient.
