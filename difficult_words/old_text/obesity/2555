Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has shown a number of biologically beneficial effects, including prevention of obesity. The purpose of this study was to test effects of dietary supplementation of 0.5% trans-10,cis-12 CLA in a high fat diet in neuronal basic helix-loop-helix 2 knock-out animals (N2KO), which is a unique animal model representing adult-onset inactivity-related obesity. Eight wild-type (WT) and eight N2KO female mice were fed either 0.5% trans-10,cis-12 CLA-containing diet or control diet (with 20% soybean oil diet) for 12 weeks. Body weights, food intake, adipose tissue weights, body compositions, and blood parameters were analyzed. Overall, N2KO animals had greater body weights, food intake, adipose tissue weights, and body fat compared to WT animals. CLA supplementation decreased overall body weights and total fat, and the effect of dietary CLA on adipose tissue reduction was greater in N2KO than in WT mice. Serum leptin and triglyceride levels were reduced by CLA in both N2KO and WT animals compared to control animals, while there was no effect by CLA on serum cholesterol. The effect of CLA to lower fat mass, increase lean body mass, and lower serum leptin and triglycerides in sedentary mice supports the possibility of using CLA to prevent or alleviate ailments associated with obesity.
