Weight- and behavior-control issues are major concerns for parents of a child with Prader-Willi syndrome. However, limited information is available on how families implement the necessary dietary restrictions and the effects of the strategies. This study identified the advice a group of families received regarding weight management, the nutrition concerns they faced and how they coped with these concerns, and the effectiveness of their coping strategies. A 2-step survey methodology was used. Survey 1 identified the strategies parents used to cope with the feeding issues typically presented by children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Survey 2 evaluated the frequency with which these coping strategies were used and their effectiveness. Respondents also provided information on why strategies were not effective. Surveys were mailed to 496 parents/guardians of children (aged 25 years or younger) with Prader-Willi syndrome. A total of 293 (64%) responded. Advice given to families centered on general weight management and dietary guidance. Difficulties centered around coping with food-related behaviors. Coping strategies varied; what worked for 1 family did not necessarly work for another. Participants indicated a desire to share experiences and a need for specific strategies to cope with feeding-behavior difficulties. A few basic behavior-management strategies, including successful use of incentives, responding to misbehavior, rewarding compliance with an exercise program, and modifying the behavior management when indicated, are briefly reviewed.
