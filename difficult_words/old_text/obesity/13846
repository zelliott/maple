Nine novel sugar transporter-like proteins have been discovered in the past 5 years. The mRNA for three of these, the glucose transporters (GLUT) GLUT8, GLUT11 and GLUT12, have been detected in human skeletal muscle. In the present study, we examined the pattern of expression and localization of the GLUT isoforms 8, 11 and 12 in human skeletal muscle using an immunohistochemical approach. Biopsies of human skeletal muscle from sedentary or trained healthy adults, from fetal muscle (24 weeks of gestation), from obese type-2 diabetic subjects, and from patients suffering from polymyositis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were studied. GLUT8 and 12 immunoreactivity was below detection level in both developing and adult muscle fibres. GLUT11 immunoreactivity, however, was present in slow-twitch muscle fibres, but not in fast twitch fibres. Since, in contrast, GLUT4 was expressed in all investigated muscle fibres, the pattern of expression of GLUT11 differs from that of GLUT4, suggesting a specialized function for GLUT11 with a regulation independent from that of GLUT4. Obesity, type-2 diabetes, training, conditions of de- and reinnervation (ALS) and regeneration (polymyositis) failed to induce GLUT8 or -12 expression. Likewise, the fibre type-dependent pattern of GLUT11 immunoreactivity was unaltered. However, some slow muscle fibres lose their GLUT11 immunoreactivity under regeneration. Our results indicate that GLUT11 immunoreactivity, in contrast to that of GLUT4, is expressed exclusively in slow-twitch muscle fibres and is unaffected by physiological and pathophysiological conditions except in primary myopathy. GLUT8 and GLUT12 do not appear to be of importance in human muscle under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
