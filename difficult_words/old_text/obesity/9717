The objective of this study was to investigate how weight-loss program would alter the proteome of the serum of Beagle dogs. For this purpose, serum samples from 5 Beagle dogs, before and after weight loss, were analyzed using 2-dimensional electrophoresis. Protein profiles of all samples were obtained, divided into 2 classes (obese and lean), and compared using specific 2-dimensional software, giving a total of 144 spot matches. Statistical analysis revealed 3 spot matches whose expressions were modulated in response to weight loss: 2 protein spots were upregulated and 1 protein spot was downregulated in the obese state in comparison with the lean state of the dogs. Mass spectrometric identification of differentially regulated spots revealed that these protein spots corresponded to retinol-binding protein 4, clusterin precursor, and Î±-1 antitrypsin, respectively, which could be considered potential markers of obesity and obesity-related disease processes in dogs.
