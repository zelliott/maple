The phenotypic variability among PCOS could be due to differences in insulin patterns. Hyperinsulinemia commonly accompanies Diabetes Mellitus (DM), obesity, hypertension and CAD, though, to a variable degree. We speculate that a family history of these diseases could differentially affect the phenotype of PCOS.

To study the effect of DM/CAD/HT and obesity on the phenotype of PCOS.

PCOS patients and age matched controls were enquired for a family background of DM, hypertension, CAD and obesity among parents and grandparents. Regression modelling was employed to examine predictors of obesity and first symptom in PCOS patients.

There were 88 PCOS women and 77 age-matched controls (46 lean, 31 obese). A high prevalence of DM, CAD, obesity and hypertension was observed among parents and grandparents of women with PCOS compared to controls. Hypertension and CAD manifested more in father's side of family. BMI of PCOS subjects was significantly related to parental DM and obesity after correcting for age. First symptom of weight gain was significantly associated with number of parents with DM (p = 0.02) and first symptom of irregular periods was associated with number of parents with hypertension (p = 0.06).

A family background of DM/HT and obesity diseases affects the phenotype of PCOS.
