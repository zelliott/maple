We have concurrently investigated oxidant stress, glucose tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin responses in the obese Zucker rat, a widely used model of insulin resistance. The plasma level of the lipid peroxidation product 8-epi-prostaglandin F2alpha, a sensitive in vivo marker of oxidant stress, was elevated approximately 5-fold in 13-week old obese relative to age-matched, insulin-sensitive lean Zucker rats. Supplementation of the diet with vitamin E (as (+)-alpha-tocopherol acetate, 0.5% w/w) for 4 weeks, reduced plasma 8-epi-prostaglandin F2alpha and concomitantly reversed glucose-stimulated hyperinsulinaemia in the obese Zucker rat without worsening glucose tolerance. We therefore provide evidence of oxidant stress, measured as elevated plasma 8-epi-prostaglandin F2alpha, for the first time in the obese Zucker rat which now provides a rationale for the beneficial effects of antioxidants on insulin action previously reported in this model of insulin resistance.
