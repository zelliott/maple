The purpose of this study was to determine the 2-year impact of a worksite-based diabetes prevention program. Thirty-seven pre-diabetic and previously undiagnosed diabetic employees participating in a 12-month worksite diabetes prevention program were included. Weight, body mass index, waist circumference, oral glucose tolerance testing, fasting insulin, blood lipids, and aerobic fitness had improved significantly after 6 months. Much of this improvement continued through 12 months. One year following the intervention, oral glucose tolerance and aerobic fitness had improved significantly. Of the 22 employees remaining in the study through 24 months, more than half had normal results on glucose tolerance testing. Worksite diabetes prevention programs may reduce blood glucose below pre-diabetic and diabetic levels. Improvements in diabetes risk factors persisted for at least 2 years in most of these employees.
