Clinicians in both the developed and also the newer industrial economies in the Asia-Pacific region will encounter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with increasing frequency. Although the region has been a significant contributor to the current state of knowledge, the spectrum of NAFLD, its severity and the potential for significant future morbidity and health costs are not widely recognized. Lifestyle changes, the epidemic of childhood and adult obesity and type 2 diabetes sweeping the Asia-Pacific represent the key substrates for the rising prevalence of NAFLD. Physicians in all disciplines need to be aware of clinical clues to the presence of NAFLD in the absence of other liver disease and in those with chronic viral hepatitis and they should be able to identify subsets at risk for liver-related morbidity. Given the scope of the problem, efforts should focus primarily on preventing or ameliorating the impact of risk factors; the key one is insulin resistance and its associates of diabetes and central obesity. Pharmacotherapy may play a role in selected individuals. A regional agenda for case definition, future study and public health initiatives is urgently required.
