DNA microarray is an important discovery technology that allows the analysis of the expression of thousands of genes at a time. Data from DNA microarrays elucidate fundamental biological processes through discovery of differential expression of genes not previously known or predicted to be involved in a particular process. In the ovary and other hormone-responsive tissues, the technology can be used to examine the effects of gene mutations, pharmaceutical agents, disease, hormones, developmental changes, or changes in gene expression related to aging.
