The authors report the hormonologic characteristics of 20 obese and hirsute women meeting the criteria for adrenaltype hyperandrogenism, suppressible by dexamethasone, without hyperprolactinemia and without any late developing partial enzyme block appearance. The laboratory profile of these women differed from that of a group of women with type 1 polycystic ovaries syndrome. In this same group obese women in whom LH/FSH ratio was below 1, there was evidence under baseline conditions of a moderate increase in testosterone and delta 4-androstenedione in relation to increased plasma levels of DHA and SDHA, plasma delta 4 and delta 5-androgen levels falling precipitalely during the dexamethasone suppression test. The ACTH stimulation test revealed greater reactivity for 17 hydroxy-pregnenolone (p &<0.001) and less for 21-deoxycortisol than in the control group of normal women (p &<0.01). The essentially adrenal origin of plasma hyperandrogenism in certain cases of obesity is discussed. Insulin could increase adrenal sensitivity to ACTH and its possible action in vivo on the activity of adrenal enzymes requires clarification. The accumulation of certain androgens in the adrenal cortex could also be responsible for dysregulation of 3 beta ol-dehydrogenase and 11-hydroxylase.
