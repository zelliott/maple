To investigate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma 2 (PPAR gamma 2) polymorphism and its association with obesity or diabetes in Chinese population.

Normal weight group(91) and overweight and obese group(140) were included in this study, according to BMI. 103 subjects had normal glucose tolerance, 50 had impaired glucose tolerance, and 78 had diabetes mellitus, according to WHO Criteria for Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus. We evaluated these subjects for the Pro12Ala mutation in the PPAR gene using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism.

Allele frequencies of Pro12Ala mutation of PPAR gamma 2 in overweight and obese subjects (qA = 3.93%) were not significantly different from those in normal weight group (qA = 3.85%, P&> 0.05). Both in overweight and obese group and normal weight group, the genotype of PA(AA) had lower plasma resistin as compared with the genotype of PP(P &<0.05). Allele frequencies of Pro12Ala were not different among Chinese subjects with normal glucose tolerance (qA = 3.88%), those with impaired glucose tolerance (qA = 4.00%), and those with diabetes mellitus (qA = 3.85%, P&> 0.05). In these three groups, the genotype of PA(AA) had lower plasma resistin as compared with the genotype of PP, only in impaired glucose tolerance group the difference was not significant (P&> 0.05).

The Pro12Ala mutation in PPAR gamma 2 was not associated with either diabetes or obesity. The PPAR gamma 2 Ala allele may be involved in the expression of resistin and insulin sensitivity.
