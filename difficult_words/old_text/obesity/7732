To evaluate the differences of oxidative stress level between obesity-prone rats and obesity-resistant rats.

Male Wistar rats were divided into control group (10 rats) fed with basal diet and high fat group (30 rats) fed with high-fat diet for 6 weeks. Ten rats in obesity-prone (OP) group and obesity-resistant (OR) group were selected from the high-fat diet group according to the gain of body weight. All rats were killed by the end of 13th week. Serum SOD, MDA, GSH-Px, blood lipids and fatty acids were detected by standard methods.

SOD was lower in OP rats than that in OR rats and control rats. GSH-Px was lower in OP rats than that in OR rats. MDA was higher in OP rats than that in control rats. The energy intake, body fat content, FBG, serum lipids, serum insulin, ISI and free fatty acids in OP rats were significantly different from those in OR rats, but there were no differences between OR and control rats.

Compared with OR rats, the oxidative stress responses were increased and the antioxidant capacities were decreased in OP rats after 13 weeks of experiment.
