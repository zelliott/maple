Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional regulatory peptide that is produced and secreted by various types of cells. The production and the secretion of AM have been demonstrated in cultured adipocytes and adipose tissues. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and lipopolysaccharide are strong stimulators for AM expression in adipocytes. Furthermore, AM expression in the adipose tissue is increased in obesity, and plasma concentrations of AM are increased in obese subjects. One possible (patho)physiological role of AM secreted by adipose tissue may be actions against complications of the metabolic syndrome characterized by obesity, type 2 diabetic mellitus and hypertension, via its antioxidant and potent vasodilator effects. These findings indicate that AM is a new member of the adipokine family.
