We investigated the distribution of abdominal fat accumulation in obese children to know whether a clustering of coronary risk factors was demonstrated in visceral fat obesity as reported in adults. The relative indicator of intra-abdominal fat accumulation was obtained from computed tomography scans at the umbilicus level in 36 obese subjects (24 males, 12 females). There was no visceral fat obesity in this study by reported criteria. All metabolic variables except triglyceride did not correlate significantly with intra-abdominal fat accumulation. We conclude that visceral fat obesity is a rare status and has no close relationship to coronary risk factors in childhood.
