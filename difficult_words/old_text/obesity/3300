The findings of the consumer-analytical survey of family nutrition in factory workers from seven firms out of six settlements in Vojvodina, and the laboratory analyses of the factory-supplemental nutrition of these workers were compared to the structure of their illnesses. There is a marked prominence of obesity with an incomparably higher frequency than with all other diseases (31.34%). The analysis proves that obesity is a direct consequence of hyperenergetical family and communal feeding with exceptionally high masses of fat, especially that of animal origin. Elevated blood pressure is also of high frequency. Diabetes, with 0.64% of total illnesses shows a considerably lower frequency than the one which was commonly established in the last few years by activities on its early detection in Vojvodina, which the authors attribute to the fact that only manifest patients under therapy are noted.
