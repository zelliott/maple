In this feasibility study, we conducted a meta-analysis of health inequalities, especially around issues of nutrition and exercise, in correctional institutions compared to the community. The project explored the extent to which the inequalities found in the health of people in the community are mirrored by inequalities found in prison. Existing data were examined to assess what light they might shed on existing health inequalities, with emphasis on lifestyle issues that contribute to obesity. The project raised questions about the sources of health inequalities and how they could be reduced. Specifically, the study compared the diet and exercise lifestyles of prisoners versus the community to examine whether they correlate with the frequency of obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the two populations.
