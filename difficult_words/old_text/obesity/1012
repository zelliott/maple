To identify possible risk factors affecting the acquisition of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and to investigate whether the incidence of infection is higher among obese and overweight verus normal-weight young adults in Greece.

Serum was obtained from 224 young male Navy recruits (mean age, 22.84 years) during their induction into the Hellenic Navy. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect Hp-specific IgG serum antibodies, as well as gastroscopy with biopsy, were used to identify the infected individuals. A structured questionnaire was filled out for each subject regarding environmental conditions, socioeconomic conditions, dietary habits, and data related to their personal and family health history.

H. pylori positivity rate was 27.23%. Univariate analysis recognized that the number of siblings in the same bedroom was significantly higher among Hp-positive than Hp-negative individuals. Logistic regression analysis showed that sharing the same bedroom with more than one sibling during childhood and consumption of fast food are independent predictors of Hp acquisition. The presence of obesity (body mass index&> or =25 kg/m2) remained unrelated to the Hp status of the individuals.

These data suggest that the risk of Hp infection does not increase in overweight young persons. Sharing the same bedroom with more than one sibling during childhood is an important determinant in acquiring Hp infection. Increased fast food consumption could be an important source of the infection outside of the home.
