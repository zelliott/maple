Overweight and obesity as well as associated metabolic disorders belong to the most important risk factors. During the exhibition 'Heureka' in Zurich data on body weight and size as well as on other clinical and biochemical parameters were collected by a questionnaire. Age- and gender-specific prevalence rates were calculated. Between 10 and 41% of the visitors showed a body-mass index of&> or = 25 kg/m2, as a function of age and gender -0.7 to 6.2% showed a body-mass index of&> or = 30 kg/m2. The most important increase in body weight was found in the age groups between 20 and 40 years. The presented epidemiologic data show that overweight is common in Switzerland, too. Prevention of overweight is still one of the most rational medical strategies and should be intensified in the age group between 20 and 40.
