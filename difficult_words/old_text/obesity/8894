We studied the effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) activation on serum concentrations and tissue expression of resistin, adiponectin, and adiponectin receptor-1 and -2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) mRNA in normal mice and mice with insulin resistance induced by lipogenic, simple-carbohydrate diet (LD). Sixteen weeks of LD feeding induced obesity with liver steatosis and increased insulin levels but did not significantly affect circulating adiponectin or resistin. Treatment with PPAR-alpha agonist fenofibrate decreased body weight and fat pad weight and ameliorated liver steatosis in LD-fed mice with concomitant reduction in blood glucose, free fatty acid, triglyceride, serum insulin levels, and homeostasis model assessment index values. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp demonstrated the development of whole-body and liver insulin resistance in LD-fed mice, which were both normalized by fenofibrate. Fenofibrate treatment markedly increased circulating resistin levels on both diets and adiponectin levels in chow-fed mice only. Fat adiponectin mRNA expression was not affected by fenofibrate treatment. Resistin mRNA expression increased in subcutaneous but not gonadal fat after fenofibrate treatment. In addition to fat, a significant amount of adiponectin mRNA was also expressed in the muscle. This expression markedly increased after fenofibrate treatment in chow- but not in LD-fed mice. Adipose tissue expression of AdipoR1 mRNA was significantly reduced in LD-fed mice and increased after fenofibrate treatment. In conclusion, PPAR-alpha activation ameliorated the development of insulin resistance in LD-fed mice despite a major increase in serum resistin levels. This effect could be partially explained by increased AdipoR1 expression in adipose tissue after fenofibrate treatment.
