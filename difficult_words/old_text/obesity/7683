Spinout or dislocation is a complication of mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty. We have observed this complication in 7 of 1255 cruciate-retaining mobile-bearing total knees (0.56%). Patient factors associated with a spinout included female sex, obesity, and preoperative valgus deformity. Operative treatment was generally successful, but significant complications occurred in 3 of the 7 patients.
