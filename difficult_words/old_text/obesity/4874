Epidemiological studies show an increased prevalence of osteoarthritis of the knee and hand with increased body mass index [BMI]. Osteoarthritis of the hip joint is not related to BMI. The connection between obesity and osteoarthritis cannot exclusively be explained by genetic factors or by the accumulation of tear and wear. Overweight occurs prior to knee joint degeneration, not as a result of diminished activity due to joint degeneration. Weight control seems to be an influential tool in the prophylaxis of overweight-specific joint degeneration.
