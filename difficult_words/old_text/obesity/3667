Patients with severe mental illness have higher prevalences of cardiovascular risk factors (CRF). The objective is to determine whether interventions to modify lifestyles in these patients reduce anthropometric and analytical parameters related to CRF in comparison to routine clinical practice. Systematic review of controlled clinical trials with lifestyle intervention in Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO and CINALH. Change in body mass index, waist circumference, cholesterol, triglycerides and blood sugar. Meta-analyses were performed using random effects models to estimate the weighted mean difference. Heterogeneity was determined using i(2) statistical and subgroups analyses. 26 studies were selected. Lifestyle interventions decrease anthropometric and analytical parameters at 3 months follow up. At 6 and 12 months, the differences between the intervention and control groups were maintained, although with less precision. More studies with larger samples and long-term follow-up are needed.
