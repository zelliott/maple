1. Groups of lean and obese-diabetic (NIDDM) congenic male SHR/Nutl parallel-cp rats were fed a nutritionally adequate, high carbohydrate diet ad libitum with or without the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor miglitol (150 mg/kg diet) from 8 until 15 weeks of age, and key glycemic parameters were monitored throughout the study. 2. Miglitol treatment resulted in clinical improvement toward normal in percent glycosylated hemoglobin, glycemic and insulinogenic responses to an oral glucose tolerance, and in liver glucokinase activity, in concert with modest decreases in weight gain in obese rats. 3. These observations are consistent with improved insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues following miglitol treatment, and indicate that this drug may be a useful adjunct to diet in the treatment of obesity, NIDDM, and possibly other disorders of carbohydrate metabolism.
