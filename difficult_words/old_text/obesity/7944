To determine the ability of air displacement plethysmography (ADP) to predict visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume in children.

Fifty-five (33 boys/22 girls) white children 13 to 14 years old were studied. Anthropometric measures were collected for body mass, stature, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage was estimated from triceps and subscapular skinfolds, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and ADP. VAT volume was determined using magnetic resonance imaging, using a multiple slice protocol at levels L1 to L5.

Boys had significantly (p &<or = 0.05) less VAT volume than girls [645.1 (360.5) cm(3) vs. 1035.8 (717.3) cm(3)]. ADP explained the greatest proportion of the variance in VAT volume compared with the other anthropometric measures. Multiple regression analysis indicated that VAT volume was best predicted by ADP body fat percentage in boys [r(2) = 0.81, SE of the estimate (SEE) = 160.1, SEE coefficient of variation = 25%] and by WHR and BMI in girls (r(2) = 0.80, SEE = 337.71, SEE coefficient of variation = 33%).

Compared with the other anthropometric measures, ADP explains the greatest proportion of the variance in VAT volume in children 13 to 14 years old. For boys, ADP is the tool of choice to predict VAT volume, yet using the more simply collected measures of BMI and WHR is recommended for girls. However, large SE of the estimates remained, suggesting that if precision is needed, there is no surrogate for direct imaging of VAT.
