Obesity has been calculated traditionally by body mass index, but measuring waist circumference might be a more accurate way of identifying people at risk of cardiovascular disease. Excess visceral fat predisposes to several diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The total cost to the NHS of obesity in 2001 was pounds sterling 2.5 billion. Waist circumference correlates well with visceral fat content.
