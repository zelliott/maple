The aim of this study was to compare hip bone strength indices in obese, overweight, and normal-weight adolescent girls using hip structure analysis (HSA). This study included 64 postmenarcheal adolescent girls (14 obese, 21 overweight, and 29 normal weight). The 3 groups (obese, overweight, and normal weight) were matched for maturity (years since menarche). Body composition and bone mineral density (BMD) of whole body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). To evaluate hip bone strength, DXA scans were analyzed at the femoral neck (FN) at its narrow neck (NN) region, the intertrochanteric (IT), and the femoral shaft (FS) by the HSA program. Cross-sectional area and section modulus were measured from hip BMD profiles. Total hip BMD and FN BMD were significantly higher in obese and overweight girls in comparison with normal-weight girls (p &<0.05). However, after adjusting for weight, using a one-way analysis of covariance, there were no significant differences among the 3 groups regarding HSA variables. This study suggests that in obese and overweight adolescent girls, axial strength and bending strength indices of the NN, IT, and FS are adapted to the increased body weight.
