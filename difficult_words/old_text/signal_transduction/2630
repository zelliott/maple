1. The present study describes effects of extracellular ATP (ATPe) on plasma membrane potential and cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in rat Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells in suspension were stimulated with ATPe and other nucleotides and ionic changes were monitored utilizing the fluorescent dyes bis-oxonol and fura-2/AM. ATPe induced a prompt plasma membrane depolarization which was dependent on Na+ influx from the extracellular medium, since it was abolished by omission of extracellular Na+. Depolarization was independent of [Ca2+]i rise as it also occurred in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and after intracellular Ca2+ stores were discharged with thapsigargin. ATPe also stimulated a rapid and biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i: a prompt spike was followed by a prolonged sustained plateau. The initial spike was dependent on Ca2+ release from intracellular stores since it was also present when cells were incubated in EGTA-supplemented Ca(2+)-free medium and was abolished by pretreatment with ionomycin and thapsigargin, agents that discharge intracellular Ca2+ stores. The sustained phase was dependent on Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium as it was abolished when cells were incubated in EGTA-supplemented Ca(2+)-free medium. Ca2+ influx was due to activation of voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs) since it was abolished by the VOCC inhibitors verapamil and nifedipine or incubation in sucrose medium, an experimental condition which precludes plasma membrane depolarization by ATPe. 2. ATPe-induced rises in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and plasma membrane depolarization were reduced by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, suggesting that ATPe-activated transduction mechanisms are in part under the control of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins. These data show that Sertoli cells possess P2-purinergic receptor subtypes coupled to influx of Na+ and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and provide evidence for an activation of different pathways by extracellular ATPe. Activation of these receptors induces Na+ influx that causes a rapid plasma membrane depolarization. Furthermore, ATPe also triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx from extracellular space via dihydropyridine-sensitive VOCCs.
