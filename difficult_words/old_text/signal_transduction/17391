Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) are key mediators in coupling cell surface receptors, such as the B-cell receptor (BCR), to downstream signaling events affecting diverse biological functions. There is therefore tremendous interest in the development of pharmacological inhibitors targeting the SYK-BTK axis for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and hematological malignancies. A good pharmacodynamic (PD) assay, ideally a blood-based assay that measures proximal events, is warranted for evaluation of such inhibitors. In platelets, collagen-induced activation of membrane glycoprotein GPVI is dependent on the SYK-BTK axis. Here, we report the development of a novel immunoassay that uses the dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescent immunoassay (DELFIA) to measure GPVI-mediated phosphorylation of phospholipase C γ2 (PLCγ2), a direct substrate of SYK and BTK, in platelets. The assay was validated using SYK or BTK inhibitors and generated IC50 correlated with those from the BCR-induced B-cell activation assay. Furthermore, this assay showed good stability and uniformity over a period of 24 h in different donors. Interestingly, compound IC50 values using blood from patients with rheumatoid arthritis were slightly higher compared with those produced using samples from healthy donors. This novel platelet PLCγ2 phosphorylation-based immunoassay should serve as a promising PD assay for preclinical and clinical development of inhibitors targeting the SYK-BTK axis.
