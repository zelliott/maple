Lineage-committed stem and progenitor cells are currently targeted by a handful of medicines, mainly to treat conditions involving the immune and hematopoietic systems. Knowledge of new stem and progenitor cell populations in the body is accumulating at a rapid pace and a new era of targeting resident stem cell populations for therapeutic ends is coming into focus. Small-molecule regulators of body-resident stem and progenitor cell assess are now a reality both in the clinic and as promising new drugs in the development pipeline. This review will explore the current state of the art with an emphasis on emerging concepts and experimental systems in the therapeutic regulation of endogenous stem and progenitor cell populations.
