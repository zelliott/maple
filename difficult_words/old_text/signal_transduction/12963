Ischemia-induced acute renal failure (ARF) is a relatively common disorder with major morbidity and mortality. To study global gene expression during ARF, 6-week-old C57BL/6 male mice underwent 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia followed by reperfusion [I/R] or sham operation. Oligonucleotide microarrays [Affymetrix] with approximately 10,000 genes, 6,643 of which were present in mouse kidney, were used to analyze mRNA expression for up to 4 days following I/R. Fifty-two genes at day 1 and 40 at day 4 were up-regulated more than 4-fold [400%]. Seventy genes at day 1 and 30 genes at day 4 were down-regulated to under 0.25-fold from baseline [25%]. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR confirmed changes in expression for 8 genes of interest. Most of the induced transcripts are involved in cell structure, extracellular matrix, intracellular calcium binding, and cell division/differentiation. Our data identified several novel genes that may be important in renal repair after ischemia.
