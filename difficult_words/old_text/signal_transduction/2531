We have evaluated the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and Ca2+ influx in ligand-stimulated internalization of the c-Kit receptor. The wild type (wt) c-Kit receptor and YF719, a mutant receptor in which the SH2-mediated binding site for the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase is disrupted, were expressed in DA-1 cells. YF719 internalized with similar kinetics as wt c-Kit although the receptor remained localized close to the plasma membrane. However, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, or in the presence of the competitive Ca2+ influx blocker Ni2+, the YF719 mutant failed to internalize. Failure to internalize in the absence of Ca2+ was also observed for the wt c-Kit receptor in cells that were pretreated with the PI3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Following stimulation with ligand, clathrin heavy chains were found to co-immunoprecipitate with c-Kit. However, under conditions in which PI3-kinase activity is inhibited and Ca2+ influx is blocked, clathrin failed to co-immunoprecipitate with c-Kit. Our results demonstrate that both Ca2+ influx and PI3-kinase activity influence c-Kit endocytosis, and inhibition of these two signals disrupts the earliest stages of ligand-mediated internalization.
