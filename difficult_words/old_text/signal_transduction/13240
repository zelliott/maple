We showed previously that activated Ras, but not Raf, causes transformation of RIE-1 epithelial cells, demonstrating the importance of Raf-independent pathways in mediating Ras transformation. To assess the mechanism by which Raf-independent effector signaling pathways contribute to Ras-mediated transformation, we recently utilized representational difference analysis to identify genes expressed in a deregulated fashion by activated Ras but not Raf. One gene identified in these analyses encodes for alpha-tropomyosin. Therefore, we evaluated the mechanism by which Ras causes the downregulation of tropomyosin expression. By using RIE-1 cells that harbor inducible expression of activated H-Ras(12V), we determined that the downregulation of tropomyosin expression correlated with the onset of morphological transformation. We found that the reversal of Ras transformation caused by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation corresponded to a restoration of tropomyosin expression. Inhibition of p38 activity in Raf-expressing RIE-1 cells caused both morphological transformation and loss of tropomyosin expression. Thus, a reduction in tropomyosin expression correlated strictly with morphological transformation of RIE-1 cells. However, forced overexpression of tropomyosin in Ras-transformed cells did not reverse morphological or growth transformation, a finding consistent with the possibility that multiple changes in gene expression contribute to Ras transformation. We also determined that tropomyosin expression was low in two human tumor cell lines, DLD-1 and HT1080, that harbor endogenous mutated alleles of ras, but high in transformation-impaired, derivative cell lines in which the mutant ras allele has been genetically deleted. Finally, treatment with azadeoxycytidine restored tropomyosin expression in Ras-transformed RIE-1, HT1080, and DLD-1 cells, suggesting a role for DNA methylation in downregulating tropomyosin expression.
