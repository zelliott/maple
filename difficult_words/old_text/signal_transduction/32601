Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, transformation, and tumor development. We provide evidence for a direct link between NF-kappaB activity and cell cycle regulation. NF-kappaB was found to stimulate transcription of cyclin D1, a key regulator of G1 checkpoint control. Two NF-kappaB binding sites in the human cyclin D1 promoter conferred activation by NF-kappaB as well as by growth factors. Both levels and kinetics of cyclin D1 expression during G1 phase were controlled by NF-kappaB. Moreover, inhibition of NF-kappaB caused a pronounced reduction of serum-induced cyclin D1-associated kinase activity and resulted in delayed phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. Furthermore, NF-kappaB promotes G1-to-S-phase transition in mouse embryonal fibroblasts and in T47D mammary carcinoma cells. Impaired cell cycle progression of T47D cells expressing an NF-kappaB superrepressor (IkappaBalphaDeltaN) could be rescued by ectopic expression of cyclin D1. Thus, NF-kappaB contributes to cell cycle progression, and one of its targets might be cyclin D1.
