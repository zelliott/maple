To investigate the inhibitory effect of danshensu on the activation of JNK signaling in rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) induced by IL-1beta.

The proliferation of primary rat HSCs treated with different concentration of Danshensu was checked by MTT colorimetric assay. The expression and phosphorylation of JNK and P-JNK was detected by western blotting. Synthesis and secretion of collagen I were detected by the quantitative immunocytochemical assay and ELISA.

Danshensu inhibited the proliferation of HSCs in a dose-dependent manner. At the concentration of 0.0625 to 0.25 mmol/L, Danshensu significantly repressed the proliferation of HSC induced by IL-1beta (P < 0.05). Synthesis and secretion of Type I collagen was significantly decreased 24 hours after 0.25 mmol/L Danshensu treatment (P < 0.01). The phosphorylation of JNK induced by IL-1beta was significantly inhibited by Danshensu treatment (P < 0.05), however, the expression of JNK was not regulated by Danshensu.

Danshensu represses the activation and proliferation of HSCs, and inhibits the synthesis and secretion of Type I collagen, possibly via the repression of the JNK signal transduction.
