Several human breast cancer cell lines have been shown to contain mutational activation of Ras oncogenes. The goal of this review is to clarify the physiology and biochemical pathways of Ras family oncogenes in order to understand thoroughly the mechanisms behind Ras gene mutations. Ras genes are involved in the early stages of mammary oncogenesis through augmented expression of the normal p21 protein. Recognition of the mechanisms resulting in aberrant expression of Ras, as well as unveiling the influence of the Ras family gene activation in the Ras signaling pathway, should have a major impact on clarifying the oncogenetic process, possibly offering candidate therapy and prevention strategies.
