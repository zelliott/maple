Wnts are intercellular growth and differentiation factors that regulate several key developmental steps, such as gastrulation, neurulation, and organogenesis, including the development of the midbrain, central nervous system, kidney, and limbs. Wnts are also needed for a normal development of the reproductive system. Deficiency of Wnt-4, -5a, and -7a, for example, results in sex reversal, infertility, and/or malformation of the internal and external genitals. Here we focus on the importance of Wnts in the female reproductive system.
