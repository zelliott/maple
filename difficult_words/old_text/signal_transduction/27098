Guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) mediate the transduction of signals from cell-surface receptors to intracellular effector enzymes. G protein alpha-subunits are routinely identified (and partially characterized) on the basis of their susceptibility to NAD(+)-dependent ADP-ribosylation NAD(+)-dependent ADP-ribosylation catalysed by cholera and/or pertussis toxins. Analysis of purified tegumental brush border plasma membrane from Hymenolepis diminuta by relevant methodologies has revealed the presence of a 42 kDa putative G protein alpha-subunit that is susceptible to ADP-ribosylation by both cholera and pertussis toxins. This polypeptide shows no definite resemblance to any of the four major mammalian G protein classes on the basis of M(r) and toxin-susceptibility. These results provide evidence for the existence of a tegumental G protein-linked signal transduction system in H. diminuta.
