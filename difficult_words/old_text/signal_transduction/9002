Several studies have implicated the renin angiotensin system in the cardiac hypertrophy induced by thyroid hormone. However, whether Angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) is critically required to the development of T3-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as well as whether the intracellular mechanisms that are triggered by AT1R are able to contribute to this hypertrophy model is unknown. To address these questions, we employed a selective small interfering RNA (siRNA, 50 nM) or an AT1R blocker (Losartan, 1 microM) to evaluate the specific role of this receptor in primary cultures of neonatal cardiomyocytes submitted to T3 (10 nM) treatment. The cardiomyocytes transfected with the AT1R siRNA presented reduced mRNA (90%, P < 0.001) and protein (70%, P < 0.001) expression of AT1R. The AT1R silencing and the AT1R blockade totally prevented the T3-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, as evidenced by lower mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic factor (66%, P < 0.01) and skeletal alpha-actin (170%, P < 0.01) as well as by reduction in protein synthesis (85%, P < 0.001). The cardiomyocytes treated with T3 demonstrated a rapid activation of Akt/GSK-3beta/mTOR signaling pathway, which was completely inhibited by the use of PI3K inhibitors (LY294002, 10 microM and Wortmannin, 200 nM). In addition, we demonstrated that the AT1R mediated the T3-induced activation of Akt/GSK-3beta/mTOR signaling pathway, since the AT1R silencing and the AT1R blockade attenuated or totally prevented the activation of this signaling pathway. We also reported that local Angiotensin I/II (Ang I/II) levels (120%, P < 0.05) and the AT1R expression (180%, P < 0.05) were rapidly increased by T3 treatment. These data demonstrate for the first time that the AT1R is a critical mediator to the T3-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as well as to the activation of Akt/GSK-3beta/mTOR signaling pathway. These results represent a new insight into the mechanism of T3-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, indicating that the Ang I/II-AT1R-Akt/GSK-3beta/mTOR pathway corresponds to a potential mediator of the trophic effect exerted by T3 in cardiomyocytes.
