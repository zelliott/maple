The complete, entirely artificial, signal-transduction process was realized with a pair of tailored transmembrane units that were equipped with receptor- and reactive sites at both amphiphilic ends. Thus, docking of the primary messenger, transmission of the signal, and release of the secondary messenger could all be imitated in a single experimental setup. The system imitates the signaling principle of receptor tyrosine kinases and employs bisphosphonate head-groups for oligoamine-recognition and a pair of thiol nucleophiles and pyridine disulfide tail-groups for intravesicle S(N)2 displacement. This system operates in a unidirectional fashion, does not suffer from intervesicle competition, and is highly sensitive towards the lipid composition of the membrane and the nature of the primary messenger.
