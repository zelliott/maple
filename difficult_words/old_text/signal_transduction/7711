Gibberellins (GAs) are a large family of tetracyclic, diterpenoid plant hormones that induce a wide range of plant growth responses. It has been postulated that plants have two types of GA receptors, including soluble and membrane-bound forms. Recently, it was determined that the rice GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) gene encodes an unknown protein with similarity to the hormone-sensitive lipases that has high affinity only for biologically active GAs. Moreover, GID1 binds to SLR1, a repressor of GA signaling, in a GA-dependent manner in yeast cells. Based on these observations, it has been concluded that GID1 is a soluble receptor mediating GA signaling in rice. More recently, Arabidopsis thaliana was found to have three GID1 homologs, AtGID1a, b, and c, all of which bind GA and interact with the five Arabidopsis DELLA proteins.
