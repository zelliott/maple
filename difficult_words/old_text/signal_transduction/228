Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) inhibits the growth of tumor cells and is a known inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kappaB), which is constitutively active in cholangiocarcinoma (CCH) cells. We evaluated the effects of CAPE on CCH growth both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity was confirmed in nuclear extracts treated with CAPE at 50, 40 and 20 microM. CAPE decreases the expression of NF-kappaB1 (p50) and RelA (p65). CAPE decreased the growth of a number of CCH cells but not normal cholangiocytes. Cell cycle decrease was seen by a decrease in PCNA protein expression and the number of BrdU-positive cells treated with CAPE at 20 microM compared to vehicle. Inhibition of growth and increased cell cycle arrest of Mz-ChA-1 cells by CAPE were coupled with increased apoptosis. Bax expression was increased, whereas Bcl-2 was decreased in cells treated with CAPE compared to vehicle. In vivo studies were performed in BALB/c nude (nu/nu) mice implanted subcutaneously with Mz-ChA-1 cells and treated with daily IP injections of DMSO or CAPE (10 mg/kg body weight in DMSO) for 77 days. Tumor growth was decreased and tumor latency was increased 2-fold in CAPE compared to vehicle-treated nude mice. In tumor samples, decreased CCH growth by CAPE was coupled with increased apoptosis. CAPE both in vivo and in vitro decreases the growth of CCH cells by increasing apoptosis. These results demonstrate that CAPE might be an important therapeutic tool in the treatment of CCH.
