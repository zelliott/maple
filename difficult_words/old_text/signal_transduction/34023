To explore the involvement of p38 and ERK signal transduction pathways in UVB-induced cell apoptosis.

HaCat cells were exposed to UVB irradiation for 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 min, respectively, after which the cell survival was assessed using MTT assay, and the cell apoptosis observed under fluorescent microscope with Hoechst staining. Western blotting was used to examine the possible signal transduction pathway involved in the cell apoptosis following the exposures.

For the same incubation time following the exposure, the cell survival rate decreased gradually with the increase of UVB irradiation dose. At a fixed UVB irradiation dose, prolonged cell incubation following the exposure resulted in decreased cell survival rate, which, however, began to increase after the minimum rate was reached. At different UVB doses, cell exposure for 5 min caused the highest cell apoptosis rate, which peaked at 12 h during the post-irradiation incubation. The expressions of p38 and p53 were significantly decreased while p44/42 expression remained unchanged in the exposed cells.

UVB irradiation can induce growth inhibition and apoptosis of HaCat cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and p38 pathway other than ERK pathway is probably involved in UVB-induced cell apoptosis.
