The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of signaling molecules regulates many developmental processes in a range of organisms from worms to humans. Understanding the mechanisms by which they exert their repertoire of effects has required identification of the components of signaling pathways that they control. Roberts and Derynck focus on this aspect of TGF-beta biology in their review of a recent Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) meeting on TGF-beta signaling and development and summarize current signaling paradigms and future prospects in TGF-beta signaling from the cell surface to the nucleus.
