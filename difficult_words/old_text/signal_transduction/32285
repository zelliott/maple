The capacity to regenerate damaged tissue and appendages is lost to some extent in higher vertebrates such as mammals, which form a scar tissue at the expenses of tissue reconstitution and functionality. Whereas this process can protect from further damage and elicit fast healing, it can lead to functional deterioration in organs such as the heart. Based on the analyses performed in the last years, stem cell therapies may not be sufficient to induce cardiac regeneration and additional approaches are required to overcome scar formation. Among these, the immune cells and their humoral response have become a key parameter in regenerative processes. In this review, we will describe the recent findings on the possible therapeutical use of progenitor and immune cells to rescue a damaged heart.
