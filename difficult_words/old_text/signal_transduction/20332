The estrogen receptor (ER) signaling and the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling are implicated in lung cancer progression. Here, we sought to investigate whether estrogen regulated the IGF-1R signaling in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the underlying mechanisms. We examined and analyzed the correlation of the expression of aromatase (Arom), ERβ, ERα, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and IGF-1R in NSCLC. Tissue-microarray and immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue specimens from 162 NSCLC patients and 38 patients with benign pulmonary lesions showed that Arom, ERβ, IGF-1, and IGF-1R were overexpressed while ERα was not expressed in NSCLC. Furthermore, ERβ expression was positively correlated with that of Arom, IGF-1, and IGF-1R (r=0.554, 0.649, 0.496, respectively, P values are equal to 0.000), while Arom expression was positively associated with that of IGF-1 and IGF-1R (r=0.657, 0.714, respectively, P values are equal to 0.000). Additionally, ERβ, IGF-1, and phospho-IGF-1R, but not ERα, were expressed in A549 cells. Immunoblotting assays showed that A549 cells treated with E2 showed significantly higher IGF-1 and p-IGF-1R levels than those receiving the combination treatment of 17β-estradiol (E2) and fulvestrant (Ful, ER antagonist) (P=0.042, 0.002, respectively) or controls (P values are equal to 0.000). The MTT assays further revealed that E2 and IGF-1 synergistically promoted A549 cell proliferation. Together, our study provides the first direct evidence for an interaction between ER and IGF-1R in lung cancer. We showed that estrogen upregulated the IGF-1R signaling through ERβ in lung cancer tissues and A549 cells. These findings shed further light on the mechanisms whereby estrogen promotes lung cancer and highlight the ER and IGF-1R signaling pathways as promising targets for combinational therapy for lung cancer.
