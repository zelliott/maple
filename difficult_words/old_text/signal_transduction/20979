An interaction with the Ras proto-oncogene product is a requirement for Raf-1 activation in many signaling cascades. The significance of this interaction is demonstrated by the fact that a mutation preventing the Ras-Raf interaction severely impairs the function of both mammalian (Raf-1) and Drosophila (D-Raf) Raf proteins. In D-Raf, however, dominant intragenic mutations have been identified that suppress the effect of the Ras-binding site (RBS) mutation. To address the mechanism by which these mutations restore Raf signaling, we have introduced the suppressor mutations into the analogous residues of mammalian Raf-1. Here, we show that rather than compensating for the RBS mutation by restoring the Ras-Raf-1 interaction, the suppressor mutations increase the enzymatic and biological activity of Raf-1, allowing Raf-1 to signal in the absence of Ras binding. Surprisingly, we find that while one of the suppressor mutations (P181L) increases the basal kinase activity of Raf-1, it also abolishes the ability of wild-type Raf-1 to become activated by Ras. This mutation occurs in the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of Raf-1 and demonstrates the importance of this region for a productive Ras-Raf interaction. Finally, we present evidence that the most activating suppressor mutation (G498S) increases Raf-1 activity by introducing a novel phosphorylation site into the L12 activation loop of the Raf-1 kinase domain.
