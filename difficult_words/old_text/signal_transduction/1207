The sensing of extracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](o)) and modulation of cellular processes associated with acute or sustained changes in [Ca(2+)](o) are cell-type specific and mediated by the calcium sensing receptor (CaR). [Ca(2+)](o) signalling requires protein kinase C (PKC), but the identity and role of PKC isoforms in CaR-mediated responses remain unclear. Here we show that high [Ca(2+)](o) activated PKC-alpha and PKC- in parathyroid cells and in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells overexpressing the CaR (HEK-CaR) and that this response correlated with the CaR-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2. Activation of ERK1/2 by acute high [Ca(2+)](o) required influx of Ca(2+)through Ni(2+)-sensitive Ca(2+)channels and phosphatidylinositol-dependent phospholipase C-beta activity. Inhibition of PKC by co-expression of dominant-negative (DN) mutants of PKC-alpha or - with the CaR attenuated sustained ERK1/2 activation. Overexpression of a PKC phosphorylation site (T888A) mutant CaR in HEK293 cells showed that this site was important for ERK1/2 activation at high [Ca(2+)](o). Activation of ERK1/2 by high [Ca(2+)](o) was not necessary for the [Ca(2+)](o)-regulated secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in dispersed bovine parathyroid cells. These data suggest that the CaR-mediated [Ca(2+)](o) signal leading to regulated PTH secretion that requires diacylglycerol-responsive PKC isoforms is not mediated via the ERK pathway.
