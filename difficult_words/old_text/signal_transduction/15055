Conservation of steroid hormone action outside the nucleus occurs from plants that make brassinosteroids to higher metazoans (primates). In plants, steroid hormone action occurs when the brassinosteroids bind a membrane tyrosine kinase receptor. Ligated receptors for all sex steroids exist at the plasma membrane and rapidly signal through G proteins to second messengers including calcium, cAMP and cGMP, activating proximal and more distal kinases. These signal cascades impact many functions of steroid hormones, responsible for the biological actions of these molecules. Support also exists for membrane-localized receptors of other members of the steroid superfamily, responding to glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D. The nature of these receptors is in some cases unclear. Steroid receptors also exist in discrete cytoplasmic organelles, most notably the mitochondria, although the functions of these receptors are poorly understood. In this review, I highlight the essential elements of the membrane oestrogen receptor alpha, noting where conserved aspects exist for other steroid receptors.
