Neointimal inflammation and angiogenesis are important contributors of progression and destabilization of the atherosclerotic plaque. While the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors VEGF-R1 (Flt-1) and VEGF-R2 (Flk-1) in this process has clearly been defined, expression of the VEGF-R3 (Flt-4) has only been documented on lymphatic and tumor endothelium. This study examined Flt-4 expression in human atherosclerotic plaque and explored its implications for atherosclerotic disease.

Carotid artery thrombendartherectomy specimens from 10 patients with unstable plaque were stained for Flt-4 and its specific growth factors VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) stained positive for VEGF-C and -D, but not for Flt-4. Interestingly, macrophages within inflammatory perivascular regions coexpressed Flt-4, VEGF-C and VEGF-D. In vitro studies confirmed the expression of Flt-4, VEGF-C and VEGF-D in human monocytes and cultured macrophages. Treatment of macrophages with VEGF-D induced apoptosis as determined by annexin V staining, by immunoblotting of activated caspase 3, and by the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax as well as by DNA fragmentation. Immunohistochemical studies of advanced human carotid atherosclerotic plaque confirmed the coexpression of Flt-4 with activated caspase 3 and TUNEL staining in macrophages, indicating an ongoing apoptotic process.

Human monocytes/macrophages express VEGF-C and -D and their receptor Flt-4 in vitro and in vivo within advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Flt-4, in turn, mediates monocyte/macrophage apoptosis and may this way alter plaque stability.
