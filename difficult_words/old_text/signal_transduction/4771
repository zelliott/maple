Doublecortin (DCX) is a microtubule-associated protein that is specifically expressed in neuronal cells. Genetic mutation of DCX causes lissencephaly disease. Although the abnormal cortical lamination in lissencephaly is thought to be attributable to neuronal cell migration defects, the regulatory mechanisms governing interactions between DCX and cytoskeleton in the migration of neuronal progenitor cells remain obscure. In this study we found that the G(s) and protein kinase A (PKA) signal elicited by pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide promotes neuronal progenitor cells migration. Stimulation of G(s)-PKA signaling prevented microtubule bundling and induced the dissociation of DCX from microtubules in cells. PKA phosphorylated DCX at Ser-47, and the phospho-mimicking mutant DCX-S47E promoted cell migration. Activation of PKA and DCX-S47E induced lamellipodium formation. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and DCX-S47E stimulated the activation of Rac1, and DCX-S47E interacted with Asef2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1. Our data reveal a dual reciprocal role for DCX phosphorylation in the regulation of microtubule and actin dynamics that is indispensable for proper brain lamination.
