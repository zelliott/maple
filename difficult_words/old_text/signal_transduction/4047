When a hair cell is stimulated by positive deflection of its hair bundle, increased tension in gating springs opens transduction channels, permitting cations to enter stereocilia and depolarize the cell. Ca2+ is thought to be required in mechanoelectrical transduction, for exposure of hair bundles to Ca2+ chelators eliminates responsiveness by disrupting tip links, filamentous interstereociliary connections that probably are the gating springs. Ca2+ also participates in adaptation to stimuli by controlling the activity of a molecular motor that sets gating-spring tension. Using a flexible glass fiber to measure hair-bundle stiffness, we investigated the effect of Ca2+ concentration on stiffness before and after the disruption of gating springs. The stiffness of intact hair bundles depended nonmonotonically on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration; the maximal stiffness of approximately 1200 microN.m-1 occurred when bundles were bathed in solutions containing 250 microM Ca2+, approximately the concentration found in frog endolymph. For cells exposed to solutions with sufficient chelator capacity to reduce the Ca2+ concentration below approximately 100 nM, hair-bundle stiffness fell to approximately 200 microN.m-1 and no longer exhibited Ca2+-dependent changes. Because cells so treated lost mechanoelectrical transduction, we attribute the reduction in bundle stiffness to tip-link disruption. The results indicate that gating springs are not linearly elastic; instead, they stiffen with increased strain, which rises with adaptation-motor activity at the physiological extracellular Ca2+ concentration.
