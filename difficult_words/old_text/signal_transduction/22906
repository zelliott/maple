Members of the expanding family of Bcl-2-like proteins have emerged as important regulators of programmed cell death, and recent studies have unearthed numerous mechanisms for regulating the function of these death agonists and antagonists. In addition to the transcriptional control of gene expression, these mechanisms include posttranslational events such as phosphorylation, proteolysis, and the induction of conformational changes, which may either activate or inactivate these molecules. Interaction with homologous and nonhomologous proteins and specific subcellular targeting of Bcl-2-like proteins are other means of fine-tuning the cellular response to noxious stimuli. Recently, considerable attention has turned to the regulation of so-called BH3-only molecules, which appear to act as stress sensors that relay signals to other pro- or antiapoptotic family members. We discuss how the regulation of these apoptosis regulators may control the ultimate fate of the cell.
