A polyHis-tagged bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor (pHis-BKR) cDNA was constructed and expressed in COS-7 cells. The pHis-BKR is suitable for both immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-polyHis antibodies and can be easily purified using Ni-NTA columns. Immunochemical detection revealed a molecular mass of approximately 66 kDa. The pHis-BKR is capable of mediating BK-induced stimulation of inositol phosphate formation as well as of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. Compared with the wild-type receptor (WT-BKR) the tagged receptor showed a slightly enhanced affinity towards BK but a reduced expression level. Despite these modified pharmacological properties the pHis-tagged BKR may be a useful tool for studying BKR modifications and signaling.
