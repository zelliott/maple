The primary mechanism of regulation of smooth muscle contraction involves the phosphorylation of myosin catalyzed by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase. However, additional mechanisms, both Ca(2+)-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent, can modulate the contractile state of smooth muscle. Protein kinase C was first implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction with the observation that phorbol esters induce slowly developing, sustained contractions. Protein kinase C occurs in at least four Ca(2+)-dependent (alpha, beta I, beta II, and gamma) and four Ca(2+)-independent (delta, epsilon, zeta, and eta) isoenzymes. Only the alpha, beta, epsilon, and zeta isoenzymes have been identified in smooth muscle. Both classes of isoenzymes have been implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. However, the physiologically important protein substrates of protein kinase C have not yet been identified. Specific isoenzymes may be activated by different contractile agonists, and individual isoenzymes exhibit some degree of substrate specificity. Prolonged activation of protein kinase C can result in its proteolysis to the constitutively active catalytic fragment protein kinase M, which would dissociate from the sarcolemma and phosphorylate proteins such as myosin that are inaccessible to membrane-bound protein kinase C. Protein kinase M induces relaxation of demembranated smooth muscle fibers contracted at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations. We suggest that protein kinase C plays two distinct roles in regulating smooth muscle contractility. Stimuli triggering phosphoinositide turnover or phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis induce translocation of protein kinase C (probably specific isoenzymes) to the sarcolemma, phosphorylation of protein, and a slow contraction. Prolonged association of the kinase with the membrane may lead to proteolysis and release into the cytosol of protein kinase M, resulting in myosin phosphorylation and relaxation.
