The chloride conductance that arises from the stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors has been shown to be carried by a cardiac isoform of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channels. This brief review will focus first upon the cellular signal transduction system for the activation of this type of Cl- channels and then its regulation by catecholamines, muscarinic agonists, endothelin-1 and angiotensin-II. Both in physiological and pathological conditions, the complex interaction of these agonists modulates the Cl- conductance, which is potentially arrhythmogenic by shortening the action potential duration and inducing the depolarization.
