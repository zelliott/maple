Early studies have shown that the abuse of alcohol, central stimulants, and opiates such as heroin destroys brain cells, reducing attention span and memory. However, new research has suggested that there may be a way to regain some of the lost attention and recall. It has recently been shown that brain cells targeted for early death by continued opiate use can be salvaged by injections of synthetic human growth hormone (GH). GH is a polypeptide hormone, normally secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, which stimulates cell growth and controls body metabolism. Recombinant human GH is currently used in replacement therapy to alleviate the symptoms of adults and children with GH deficiency syndrome. The recent observation that GH can reverse morphine-induced cell damage could open the door to new ways of treating and preventing damage from the abuse of opiates in addicts and also of treating cell damage induced by alcohol and central stimulants. This article reviews current knowledge of the somatotrophic axis, including GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), in the brain and also discusses the potential use of GH/IGF-1 as agents for treatment of brain pathology in addictive diseases.
