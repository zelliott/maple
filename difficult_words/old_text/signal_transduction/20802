MDCK (epithelial cells from the dog kidney) plated at confluence, establish tight junctions in 12-15 hours through a process that requires protein synthesis, formation of a ring of actin filaments in close contact with the lateral membrane of the cells, calmodulin, and a Ca(2+)-dependent exocytic fusion of tight junction (TJ)-associated components. Monolayers incubated in the absence Ca2+ make no TJs. Yet, if Ca2+ is added under these circumstances, TJs are made with a faster kinetics. Ca2+ is needed mainly at a site located on the outer side of the cell membrane, where it activates uvomorulin and triggers the participation of the cellular components mentioned above, via G-proteins associated with phospholipase C and protein kinase C. In principle, the sites of all these molecules and mechanisms involved in junction formation may be where a variety of agents (hormones, drugs, metabolites) act to produce epithelia with a transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) ranging from 10 to 10,000 omega.cm2. This range may be also due to a variety of substances found in serum and in urine, that increase the TER in a reversible and dose-dependent manner.
