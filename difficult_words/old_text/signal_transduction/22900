Almost three decades have passed since actin-cytoskeleton (acto-myosin complex) was first discovered in non-muscle cells. A combination of cell biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology has revealed the structure and function of many actin-binding proteins and their physiological role in the regulation of cell motility, shape, growth, and malignant transformation. As molecular oncologists, we would like to review how the function of actin-cytoskeleton is regulated through Ras/Rho family GTPases- or phosphoinosites-mediated signaling pathways, and how malignant transformation is controlled by actin/phosphoinositides-binding proteins or drugs that block Rho/Rac/CDC42 GTPases-mediated signaling pathways.
