delta-Catenin is upregulated in human carcinomas. However, little is known about the potential transcriptional factors that regulate delta-catenin expression in cancer. Using a human delta-catenin reporter system, we have screened several nuclear signaling modulators to test whether they can affect delta-catenin transcription. Among beta-catenin/LEF-1, Notch1, and E2F1, E2F1 dramatically increased delta-catenin-luciferase activities while beta-catenin/LEF-1 induced only a marginal increase. Rb suppressed the upregulation of delta-catenin-luciferase activities induced by E2F1 but did not interact with delta-catenin. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses in 4 different prostate cancer cell lines revealed that regulation of delta-catenin expression is controlled mainly at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, the effects of E2F1 on delta-catenin expression were observed only in human cancer cells expressing abundant endogenous delta-catenin. These studies identify E2F1 as a positive transcriptional regulator for delta-catenin, but further suggest the presence of strong negative regulator(s) for delta-catenin in prostate cancer cells with minimal endogenous delta-catenin expression.
