Regulation of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is crucial to regulate extracellular matrix (ECM) proteolysis which is important in metastasis. This study investigated the mechanism(s) by which three flavonoid-enriched fractions from lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) down-regulate MMP activity in DU145 human prostate cancer cells. Metalloproteinase activity was evaluated from cells exposed to "crude," anthocyanin-enriched (AN) and proanthocyanidin-enriched (PAC) fractions. Differential down-regulation of MMPs was observed. The activity of the endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) from these cells was also evaluated. Increases in TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 activity were observed in response to these fractions. The possible involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways in the flavonoid-mediated decreases in MMP activity was observed. These findings indicate that blueberry flavonoids may use multiple mechanisms in down-regulating MMP activity in these cells.
