The effects of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) on the proliferation and differentiation of ovarian granulosa cells were studied in cultured human and porcine granulosa cells. IGF-II significantly increased basal progesterone secretion in granulosa cells at concentrations of 1-100 ng/ml. A stimulatory effect was also observed in gonadotropin-stimulated porcine granulosa cells treated with IGF-II. The secretion of estradiol by basal and gonadotropin-stimulated porcine granulosa cells was also significantly increased by adding IGF-II. IGF-II led to dose-dependent increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and in the number of granulosa cells. To further characterize the cellular mechanisms underlying the stimulatory effects of IGF-II on the proliferation and differentiation of granulosa cells, we investigated the intermediary roles of cyclic AMP and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Treatment with 100 ng/ml IGF-II produced a significant increase in the basal accumulation of cyclic AMP in porcine granulosa cells. However, no change of [Ca2+]i by IGF-II was noted. IGF-II produced effects in accumulation that were similar to those of IGF-I. Our findings suggest that IGF-II may be a general stimulator in the proliferation and differentiation of granulosa cells, and that cyclic AMP may be a second messenger for the effects of IGF-II in ovarian granulosa cells.
