Lipid nitration has been observed during oxidative/nitrative stress conditions generating a variety of biomolecules capable of modulating cellular responses. This concept has grown as a result of studies with nitro-derivatives of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids containing a nitroalkene group (nitro-fatty acids). This review focuses on the interactions of nitro-fatty acids with members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) family. These nuclear receptors belong to a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, which serve as sensors of lipophilic molecules and regulate the expression of a set of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Here we discuss how nitro-fatty acids bind and activate PPARs, including the current knowledge of the molecular interactions and cell signaling events involved as well as their therapeutic potential associated with chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders.
