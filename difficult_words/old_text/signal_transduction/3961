During neuronal migration to the developing cerebral cortex, neurons regulate radial glial cell function and radial glial cells, in turn, support neuronal cell migration and differentiation. To study how migrating neurons and radial glial cells influence each others' function in the developing cerebral cortex, we examined the role of glial growth factor (a soluble form of neuregulin), in neuron-radial glial interactions. Here, we show that GGF is expressed by migrating cortical neurons and promotes their migration along radial glial fibers. Concurrently, GGF also promotes the maintenance and elongation of radial glial cells, which are essential for guiding neuronal migration to the cortex. In the absence of GGF signaling via erbB2 receptors, radial glial development is abnormal. Furthermore, GGF's regulation of radial glial development is mediated in part by brain lipid-binding protein (BLBP), a neuronally induced, radial glial molecule, previously shown to be essential for the establishment and maintenance of radial glial fiber system. The ability of GGF to influence both neuronal migration and radial glial development in a mutually dependent manner suggests that it functions as a mediator of interactions between migrating neurons and radial glial cells in the developing cerebral cortex.
