Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an upstream activator of innate immunity that regulates subsequent adaptive responses. It was previously shown that in macrophages, MIF binds to a complex of CD74 and CD44, resulting in initiation of a signaling pathway. In the current study, we investigated the role of MIF in B cell survival. We show that in B lymphocytes, MIF initiates a signaling cascade that involves Syk and Akt, leading to NF-kappaB activation, proliferation, and survival in a CD74- and CD44-dependent manner. Thus, MIF regulates the adaptive immune response by maintaining the mature B cell population.
