Through its association with two distinct protein complexes, target of rapamycin (TOR) complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2), the kinase TOR coordinates cellular growth with cell cycles, growth factors, and nutrients. The interconnected TOR signaling network participates in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions, such as aging, stem cell renewal, cell specification, and carcinogenesis; therefore, understanding the details of this system may yield new ways to promote longer, healthier living. This issue provides an overview of research on TOR signaling that has emerged since the issue Science Signaling devoted to this topic in 2009.
