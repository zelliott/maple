Young neurons polarize by specializing axons and dendrites from immature neurites. After synapse formations, they transmit electrical activity along the axon-dendrite axis, thereby working as functional units of the neural circuits. This axon-dendrite asymmetry is referred to as neuronal polarity. Although a great number of cell biological studies in vitro had been performed, little was known about the molecular events that establish the polarity. In the last several years, rapid advancement in molecular and genetic studies has unraveled the multiple signaling pathways. This paper summarizes current perspectives on the cell and molecular biological mechanisms of the neuronal polarization, to clarify future directions in this growing research field.
