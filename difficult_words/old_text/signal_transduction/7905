DOC-2 (differentially expressed in ovarian carcinoma) is involved in Ras-, beta-integrin-, PKC-, and transforming growth factor-beta-mediated cell signaling. These pathways are implicated in the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins during progression of hypertrophy to heart failure; however, the role of DOC-2 in cardiac pathophysiology has never been examined. This study was undertaken to 1) analyze DOC-2 expression in primary cultures of cardiac fibroblasts and cardiac myocytes and in the heart following different types of hemodynamic overloads and 2) examine its role in growth factor-mediated ERK activation and collagen production. Pressure overload and volume overload were induced for 10 wk in Sprague-Dawley rats by aortic constriction and by aortocaval shunt, respectively. ANG II (0.3 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) was infused for 2 wk. Results showed that, compared with myocytes, DOC-2 was found abundantly expressed in cardiac fibroblasts. Treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with ANG II and TPA resulted in increased expression of DOC-2. Overexpression of DOC-2 in cardiac fibroblasts led to inhibition of hypertrophy agonist-stimulated ERK activation and collagen expression. An inverse correlation between collagen and DOC-2 was observed in in vivo models of cardiac hypertrophy; in pressure overload and after ANG II infusion, increased collagen mRNA correlated with reduced DOC-2 levels, whereas in volume overload increased DOC-2 levels were accompanied by unchanged collagen mRNA. These data for the first time describe expression of DOC-2 in the heart and demonstrate its modulation by growth-promoting agents in cultured cardiac fibroblasts and in in vivo models of heart hypertrophy. Results suggest a role of DOC-2 in cardiac remodeling involving collagen expression during chronic hemodynamic overload.
