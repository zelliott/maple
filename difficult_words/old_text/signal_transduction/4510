IL-30, the p28 subunit of IL-27, interacts with EBV-induced gene 3 to form IL-27, which modulates both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses during autoimmune or infectious disease. It also acts as a natural antagonist of gp130, thereby attenuating the signals of other gp130-associated cytokines. IL-30 regulation via LPS has been reported by others, but the intercellular communication that induces IL-30 expression is unknown. In this study, we show that treatment with anti-CD3/CD28 Abs plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides induces robust expression of IL-30, whereas either treatment alone induces only low expression of IL-30. This observation in vitro mirrors the murine model in which administration of CpG under inflammatory conditions in vivo induces IL-30 expression. This robust induction of IL-30 occurs through the coordination of helper CD4(+) T cells and innate immune cells (e.g., macrophages) and, to a lesser degree, B cells via the CD40/CD154 signaling pathway. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism that integrates signaling pathways from T cells and macrophages at the cellular level to induce IL-30 expression.
