Originally implicated in the regulation of survival, proliferation and differentiation of haematopoietic cells, the JAK-STAT pathway has also been linked to developmental processes, growth control and maintenance of homeostasis in a variety of other cells and tissues. Although it remains a complex system, its relative simplicity and the availability of molecular data makes it particularly attractive for modelling approaches. In this review, we will focus on JAK-STAT signalling in the context of cancer and present efforts to investigate signalling dynamics with the help of mathematical models. We describe the modelling workflow that realises a systems biology approach and give an example for interferon-Î³ signalling in pancreatic stellate cells.
