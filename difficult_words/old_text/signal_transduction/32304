The mechanisms that regulate the T(H)9 subset of helper T cells and diseases mediated by T(H)9 cells remain poorly defined. Here we found that the costimulatory receptor OX40 was a powerful inducer of T(H)9 cells in vitro and T(H)9 cell-dependent airway inflammation in vivo. In polarizing conditions based on transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), ligation of OX40 inhibited the production of induced regulatory T cells and the T(H)17 subset of helper T cells and diverted CD4(+)Foxp3(-) T cells to a T(H)9 phenotype. Mechanistically, OX40 activated the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, which triggered induction of the kinase NIK in CD4(+) T cells and the noncanonical transcription factor NF-κB pathway; this subsequently led to the generation of T(H)9 cells. Thus, our study identifies a previously unknown mechanism for the induction of T(H)9 cells and may have important clinical implications in allergic inflammation.
