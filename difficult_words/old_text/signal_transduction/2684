Using subtype-selective agonists and antagonists, and antibodies directed against phosphatidylinositol and G-proteins, it has been shown in single myocytes of rat portal vein that both alpha 1A- and alpha 2A-adrenoceptors modulate Ca2+ channels through two distinct transduction pathways. alpha 1A-adrenoceptors couple with a Gq/G11 protein to activate a phospholipase C (PLC) which hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). InsP3 releases intracellular stored Ca2+ as evidenced by microspectrofluorimetry with Fura-2. The large and transient increase in [Ca2+]i activates chloride channels leading to a membrane depolarization that opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. In addition, DAG activates transiently protein kinase C (PKC) which increases the opening probability of Ca2+ channels through a phosphorylation-dependent process. alpha 2A-adrenoceptors do not induce Ca2+ release from intracellular stores but promote sustained Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The coupling involves a Gi-protein and activation of PKC by DAG. These two transduction pathways may be involved in the physiological action of noradrenaline in vascular smooth muscles.
