Although embryonic patterning and early development of the nervous system have been studied for decades, our understanding of how signals instruct ectodermal derivatives to acquire specific identities has only recently started to form a coherent picture. In this mini-review, we summarize recent findings and models of how a handful of well-known secreted signals influence progenitor cells in successive binary decisions to adopt various cell type specific differentiation programs.
