NYGGF4, also known as phosphotyrosine interaction domain containing 1(PID1), is a recently discovered gene which is involved in obesity-related insulin resistance (IR) and mitochondrial dysfunction. We aimed to further elucidate the effects and mechanisms underlying NYGGF4-induced IR by investigating the effect of overexpressing mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which is essential for mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication, on NYGGF4-induced IR and mitochondrial abnormalities in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Overexpression of TFAM increased the mitochondrial copy number and ATP content in both control 3T3-L1 adipocytes and NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was enhanced in NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes and reduced in TFAM-overexpressing adipocytes; co-overexpression of TFAM significantly attenuated ROS production in NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes. However, overexpression of TFAM did not affect the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) in control 3T3-L1 adipocytes or NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes. In addition, co-overexpression of TFAM-enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by increasing Glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the PM in NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes. Overexpression of NYGGF4 significantly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and serine phosphorylation of Akt, whereas overexpression of TFAM strongly induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt in NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes. This study demonstrates that NYGGF4 plays a role in IR by impairing mitochondrial function, and that overexpression of TFAM can restore mitochondrial function to normal levels in NYGGF4-overexpressing adipocytes via activation of the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
