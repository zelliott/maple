To elucidate the signal transduction mechanisms in the turtle vomeronasal receptor neurons, the effects of forskolin, changes in mucosal Ca2+ concentrations and ruthenium red on the responses of the accessory olfactory bulb to general odorants were examined. Forskolin elicited a large response, suggesting that there are cAMP-gated channels in the vomeronasal neurons. On the other hand, the dependence of the responses to general odorants on Ca2+ concentrations was different from that of the response to forskolin. A large response to an odorant (n-amyl acetate) appeared after the cAMP-mediated pathway was fully desensitized by application of 50 microM forskolin. These results suggest that the cAMP-mediated pathway does not contribute significantly to generation of the response to general odorants. A concentration of 50 microM ruthenium red significantly reduced the responses to n-amyl acetate alone and after 50 microM forskolin desensitization, suggesting that the inositol triphosphate-mediated pathway contributes partly to generation of the responses to general odorants in the vomeronasal neurons.
