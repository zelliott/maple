Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), which generally stimulates the growth of mesenchymally derived cells but inhibits the growth of epithelial cells, has been proposed as a possible target for cancer therapy. However, concerns have been raised that whereas inhibition of TGF-beta signaling could be efficacious for lesions in which TGF-beta promotes tumor development and/or progression, systemic pharmacologic blockade of this signaling pathway could also promote the growth of epithelial lesions.

We examined the effect of a TGF-beta inhibitor on mesenchymal (leiomyoma) and epithelial (renal cell carcinoma) tumors in Eker rats, which are genetically predisposed to develop these tumors with a high frequency.

Blockade of TGF-beta signaling with the ALK5/type I TGF-beta R kinase inhibitor, SB-525334, was efficacious for uterine leiomyoma; significantly decreasing tumor incidence and multiplicity, and reducing the size of these mesenchymal tumors. However, SB-525334 was also mitogenic and antiapoptotic for epithelial cells in the kidney and exacerbated the growth of epithelial lesions present in the kidneys of these animals.

Although pharmacologic inhibition of TGF-beta signaling with SB-525334 may be efficacious for mesenchymal tumors, inhibition of this signaling pathway seems to promote the development of epithelial tumors.
