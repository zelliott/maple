Bulbospinal serotonergic neurons and two physiological classes of bulbospinal nonserotonergic cells interact to modulate pain transmission. Recent studies have begun to elaborate targets of descending pain modulation other than the well-studied flexion withdrawal pathways. Site-specific, naloxone-sensitive placebo analgesia, which is hard to reconcile with current models of descending pain modulation, presents an exciting challenge to the field.
