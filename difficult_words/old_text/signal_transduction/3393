Morphogens induce biological diversity by operating in a dose-dependent manner. Here we review recent evidences indicating that microRNAs (miRNAs) are ideally suited to serve the morphogen cause. miRNAs regulate the establishment of morphogen gradients, including TGFÎ², Wnt and other growth factors by acting on their secretion, distribution and clearance. miRNA are also critical in receiving cells, establishing context-dependency and threshold responses. Moreover, miRNAs contributes to gene networks that transform the graded activity of a morphogen into robust cell fate decisions. Finally, we discuss in the perspective section the implication of the new ceRNA hypothesis for morphogen biology.
