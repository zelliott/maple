An imbalance in the matrix metalloproteinases/tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (MMPs/TIMPs) contributes to atherosclerotic plaque destabilization and rupture. Here we determined whether oxysterols accumulating in advanced atherosclerotic lesions play a role in plaque destabilization. In human promonocytic U937 cells, we investigated the effects of an oxysterol mixture of composition similar to that in advanced human carotid plaques on the expression and synthesis of MMP-9 and its endogenous inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. A marked increment of MMP-9 gene expression, but not of its inhibitors, was observed by real-time RT-PCR; MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was also found increased by gel zymography. Consistently, a net increment of MMP-9 protein level was also observed by immunoblotting. Using antioxidants or specific inhibitors or siRNAs, we demonstrated that the oxysterol mixture induces MMP-9 expression through: (i) overproduction of reactive oxygen species, probably by NADPH-oxidase and mitochondria; (ii) up-regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways via protein kinase C; and (iii) up-regulation of activator protein-1- and nuclear factor-ÎºB-DNA binding. These results suggest, for the first time, that oxysterols accumulating in advanced atherosclerotic lesions significantly contribute to plaque vulnerability by promoting MMP-9/TIMP-1/2 imbalance in phagocytic cells.
