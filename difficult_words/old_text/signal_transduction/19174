Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are key regulators of cell fate decisions during embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis. BMPs signal through a coordinated assembly of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors to induce Smad1/5/8 plus non-Smad pathways, such as MAPK and Akt. The recent discovery of BMP receptor inhibitors opened new avenues to study specific BMP signalling and to delineate this effect from TGF-Î² and Activin signalling. Here we present comprehensive and quantitative analyses on both canonical and non-Smad mediated BMP signalling under Dorsomorphin (DM) and LDN-193189 (LDN) treatment conditions. We demonstrate for the first time, that both compounds affect not only the Smad but also the non-Smad signalling pathways induced by either BMP2, BMP6 or GDF5. The activation of p38, ERK1/2 and Akt in C2C12 cells was inhibited by DM and LDN. In addition "off-target" effects on all branches of BMP non-Smad signalling are presented. From this we conclude that the inhibition of BMP receptors by DM and more efficiently by LDN-193189 affects all known BMP induced signalling cascades.
