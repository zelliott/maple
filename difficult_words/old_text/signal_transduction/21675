The chromosomal translocation t(7;9) in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) results in deregulated expression of a truncated, activated form of Notch 1 (TAN1) under the control of the T-cell receptor-beta (TCRB) locus. Although TAN1 efficiently induces T-ALL in mouse models, t(7;9) is present in less than 1% of human T-ALL cases. The recent discovery of novel activating mutations in NOTCH1 in more than 50% of human T-ALL samples has made it clear that Notch 1 is far more important in human T-ALL pathogenesis than previously suspected.
