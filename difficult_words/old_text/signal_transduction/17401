Vapreotide, a synthetic analog of somatostatin, has analgesic activity most likely mediated through the blockade of neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R), the substance P (SP)-preferring receptor. The ability of vapreotide to interfere with other biological effects of SP has yet to be investigated.

We studied the ability of vapreotide to antagonize NK1R in three different cell types: immortalized U373MG human astrocytoma cells, human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and a human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293. Both U373MG and MDM express endogenous NK1R while HEK293 cells, which normally do not express NK1R, are stably transformed to express human NK1R (HEK293-NK1R).

Vapreotide attenuates SP-triggered intracellular calcium increases and nuclear factor-ÎºB activation in a dose-dependent manner. Vapreotide also inhibits SP-induced interleukin-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 production in HEK293-NK1R and U373MG cell lines. Vapreotide inhibits HIV-1 infection of human MDM in vitro, an effect that is reversible by SP pretreatment.

Our findings indicate that vapreotide has NK1R antagonist activity and may have a potential application as a therapeutic intervention in HIV-1 infection.
