To investigate the role of multigenic variation in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) involving the rRNA processing gene WD repeat domain 36 (WDR36).

We examined the heat shock protein 70/90 (HSP70/90)-organizing co-chaperone stress-induced-phosphoprotein 1 (STI1) as a potential co-modifying gene in glaucoma patients found to harbor WDR36 amino acid variation. The STI1 gene was sequenced and its POAG-associated amino acid variant K434R, as well as the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) P173T, were tested for functional defects in a yeast model system previously used to characterize WDR36 variants (using the homologous yeast gene U3 protein 21 [UTP21]).

A POAG patient heterozygous for the WDR36 variant L25P was discovered to also carry the STI1 variant K434R in a heterozygous state. Variant K434R, located at an evolutionarily-conserved site, was not found in a pool of clinically-examined individuals lacking WDR36 variation which included 55 normal controls and 20 patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG). STI1 (K434R) and the homologous yeast variant K470R were able to rescue yeast growth-inhibition by the HSP90-inhibitor radicicol. Double mutant haploid strains expressing human STI1 (K434R) and recombinant yeast UTP21 variants did not have significantly different levels of 18S rRNA from the corresponding hSTI1 (WT) strains. However, specific double mutant K434R strains exhibited significantly slower culture growth at 37 °C. Double mutant P173T strains also displayed altered growth rates at 37 °C.

STI1 variation does not play a significant direct role in the genetics of POAG. However, as previously found for the STI1 null allele, non-synonymous variants of human STI1 confer growth dysregulation in the context of specific yeast UTP21 mutations and heat stress. Based on the genetic association of two co-heterozygous STI1 and WDR36 variants in a POAG patient and the functional analyses performed in a model system for basic eukaryotic cellular processes, these experiments point to a conserved molecular pathway involving STI1 and WDR36.
