The tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL fusion proteins plays an important role in the pathogenesis of leukemia that is for the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1). Because nuclear c-ABL is regulated during the cell cycle through a specific interaction with the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), the possible interaction of BCR-ABL with pRB in Ph1-positive cell lines was investigated. P145 c-ABL as well as P190 and P210 BCR-ABL proteins interacted with pRB. Furthermore, c-ABL and BCR-ABL associated with both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of pRB. These findings suggest that BCR-ABL interferes with pRB function and thereby regulates cell growth.
