Cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1) is a recently described cytokine sharing many biological properties with those reported previously for leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In the present study we show that CT-1 binds to the KB epidermoid cancer cell surface through a tripartite receptor complex which includes the gp130 signal transducing protein, LIF receptor beta (LIFR beta) and a third component displaying a molecular weight of 80 kDa. CT-1 activates gp130 and LIFR beta transducing components, as attested by analysing their tyrosine phosphorylation level. The activation process is relayed to the nucleus by the recruitment of the STAT3 transcription factor. Analysis of KB cell line culture supernatants after CT-1 treatment indicates that CT-1 stimulates the production of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This stimulation of IL-6 production by CT-1 is associated with an increase in intracellular levels of IL-6 mRNA. This study suggests that at least in some pathological situations CT-1 might represent an immunomodulator regulating cytokine-induced gene products.
