Some plants respond to infection by pathogens with both localized and systemic resistance responses. These prevent the spread of the disease-causing organism and reduce the severity of a subsequent infection. Recent evidence suggests that systemic increases in the host's salicylic acid levels act as a signal for the activation of at least some of these induced defenses.
