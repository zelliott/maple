Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) regulates cell migration and invasion by pericellular proteolysis and signal transduction events. We characterized the mechanisms by which uPA regulates matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) function in THP-1 monocytes.

In THP-1 monocytes, MMP9 production induced by urokinase was completely inhibited by the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, but not by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, SB202190. A dominant negative MEK1 adenovirus also blocked MMP9 expression. The effect of urokinase was completely suppressed by genistein and by herbimycin A indicating that tyrosine kinase(s) are required for MMP9 production. Bisindolylmaleimide, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, did not decrease MMP9 expression suggesting that PKC activation is not required. Key roles for cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and eicosanoid production were shown by complete inhibition with methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (an inhibitor of cytosolic PLA2), and indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor), with no effect of monoalide, a secretory PLA2 inhibitor. uPA stimulated phosphorylation of cytosolic PLA2.

Induction of MMP9 by uPA in THP-1 monocytes is via a pathway involving MEK1-ERK1/2-mediated activation of cytosolic PLA2 and eicosanoid generation. These data suggest important roles for eicosanoids in monocyte migration induced by uPA and MMP9.
