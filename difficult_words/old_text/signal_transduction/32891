Fus3p and Kss1p act at the end of a conserved signaling cascade that mediates numerous cellular responses for mating. To determine the role of Fus3p in different outputs, we isolated and characterized a series of partial-function fus3 point mutants for their ability to phosphorylate a substrate (Ste7p), activate Ste12p, undergo G1 arrest, form shmoos, select partners, mate, and recover. All the mutations lie in residues that are conserved among MAP kinases and are predicted to affect either enzyme activity or binding to Ste7p or substrates. The data argue that Fus3p regulates the various outputs assayed through the phosphorylation of multiple substrates. Different levels of Fus3p function are required for individual outputs, with the most function required for shmoo formation, the terminal output. The ability of Fus3p to promote shmoo formation strongly correlates with its ability to promote G1 arrest, suggesting that the two events are coupled. Fus3p promotes recovery through a mechanism that is distinct from its ability to promote G1 arrest and may involve a mechanism that does not require kinase activity. Moreover, catalytically inactive Fus3p inhibits the ability of active Fus3p to activate Ste12p and hastens recovery without blocking G1 arrest or shmoo formation. These results raise the possibility that in the absence of sustained activation of Fus3p, catalytically inactive Fus3p blocks further differentiation by restoring mitotic growth. Finally, suppression analysis argues that Kss1p contributes to the overall pheromone response in a wild-type strain, but that Fus3p is the critical kinase for all of the outputs tested.
