Recognition that Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs) are direct Ras effectors and that Ral G-protein activation is a direct consequence of Ras activation has spurred focused efforts to establish the contribution of RalGEF/Ral signaling to oncogenic transformation. Here, we provide a broad-strokes overview of the mechanistic organization of the RalGEF/Ral signaling network, evaluate the evidence for participation of this network in tumorigenic regulatory milieus, consider targeting strategies, and discuss the challenges to and opportunities for clinical development of these targeting strategies.
