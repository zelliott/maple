Midazolam is widely used as a sedative and anesthetic induction agent. The aim of this study was to systematically examine the inhibitory mechanisms of midazolam in platelet aggregation.

The inhibitory mechanisms of midazolam in platelet aggregation were explored by means of analysis of the platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex, phosphoinositide breakdown, intracellular Ca+2 mobilization, measurement of membrane fluidity, thromboxane B2 formation, and protein kinase C activity.

In this study, midazolam dose-dependently (6-26 microm) inhibited platelet aggregation in human platelets stimulated by agonists. Midazolam also dose-dependently inhibited phosphoinositide breakdown and intracellular Ca+2 mobilization in human platelets stimulated by collagen. Midazolam (6-26 mum) significantly inhibited thromboxane A2 formation stimulated by collagen in human platelets. Moreover, midazolam (15 and 26 mum) dose-dependently decreased the fluorescence of platelet membranes tagged with diphenylhexatriene. Rapid phosphorylation of a platelet protein of Mr 47,000 (P47), a marker of protein kinase C activation, was triggered by collagen (2 microg/ml). This phosphorylation was markedly inhibited by midazolam (26 microm).

These results indicate that the antiplatelet activity of midazolam may be involved in the following pathways: the effects of midazolam may initially be caused by induction of conformational changes in platelet membrane, leading to a change in the activity of phospholipase C, and subsequent inhibition of phosphoinositide breakdown and thromboxane A2 formation, thereby leading to inhibition of both intracellular Ca+2 mobilization and phosphorylation of P47 protein.
