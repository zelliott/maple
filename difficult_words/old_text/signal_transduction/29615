Recent studies in lymphohemopoietic cells show that transferrin (Tf), a pivotal component of iron transport and metabolism, also exerts cytoprotective functions. We show here in a murine model that Tf interferes with Fas-mediated hepatocyte death and liver failure. The mechanism involves the downregulation of apoptosis via BID, cytochrome c, caspase-3 and caspase-9, and upregulation of antiapoptotic signals via Bcl-xL. The results obtained with iron-saturated Tf, Apo-Tf and the iron-chelator salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone indicate that the observed antiapoptotic effect of Tf was not mediated by iron alone. In conclusion, the data suggest that Tf has broader functions than previously recognized and may serve as a cytoprotective agent.
