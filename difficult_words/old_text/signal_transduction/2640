The interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) consists of three subunits, the IL-2R alpha, IL-2R beta c, and IL-2R gamma c chains. Two Janus family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), Jak1 and Jak3, were shown to associate with IL-2R beta c and IL-2R gamma c, respectively, and their PTK activities are increased after IL-2 stimulation. A Jak3 mutant with truncation of the C-terminal PTK domain lacks its intrinsic kinase activity but can still associate with IL-2R gamma c. In a hematopoietic cell line, F7, that responds to either IL-2 or IL-3, overexpression of this Jak3 mutant results in selective inhibition of the IL-2-induced activation of Jak1/Jak3 PTKs and of cell proliferation. Of the three target nuclear protooncogenes of the IL-2 signaling, c-fos and c-myc genes, but not the bcl-2 gene, were found to be impaired. On the other hand, overexpression of the dominant negative form of the IL-2R gamma c chain, which lacks most of its cytoplasmic domain, in F7 cells resulted in the inhibition of all three protooncogenes. These results provide a further molecular basis for the critical role of Jak3 in IL-2 signaling and also suggest a Jak PTK-independent signaling pathway(s) for the bcl-2 gene induction by IL-2R.
