The post-receptorial mechanisms of the analgesic action of amitriptyline and clomipramine, two tricyclic antidepressants, were investigated in the mouse hot plate test by using an antisense strategy. Mice were injected i.c.v. with antisense oligonucleotides (aODN), complementary to the sequence of the mRNA sequence of the alpha-subunit of Gi1, Gi2 and Gi3-proteins, 18-24 h prior to the hot plate test. Treatment with aODN against Gi1alpha, Gi2alpha and Gi3alpha dose-dependently reduced the analgesia induced by both amitriptyline (15 mg/kg s.c.) and clomipramine (25 mg/kg s.c.). This antagonistic effect disappeared 7 days after the end of the i.c.v. treatment, indicating the absence of irreversible damage or toxicity. Treatment with aODN against Gi1alpha, Gi2alpha and Gi3alpha, at the active doses, did not modify the animals' pain threshold, indicating the absence of any hyperalgesic effect. Amitriptyline, clomipramine and the aODN employed, at the maximal effective doses, did not produce any alteration of motor coordination of the mice, as revealed by rotarod experiments, and spontaneous motility, as revealed by the Animex apparatus. These results indicate that amitriptyline and clomipramine induce their analgesic effect by activating all three subtypes of the Gi-proteins.
