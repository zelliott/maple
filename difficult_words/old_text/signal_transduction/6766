Chronic diabetic complications affect multiple organ systems and lead to significant morbidity and mortality in the diabetic population. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a major etiologic factor causing heart failure. Dysfunction of both vascular endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes contributes in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Hyperglycemia has been identified as the key determinant in the development of several chronic diabetic complications. Hyperglycemia leads to oxidative stress and several other abnormalities causing changes in cellular signaling. These diabetes-mediated biochemical anomalies show cross-interaction and complex interplay. Such changes also cause alteration of transcriptional and post-transcriptional machinery causing altered production of vasoactive and cardioactive factors. In this review, we will highlight some of the important signaling changes leading to diabetic cardiomyopathy and discuss possible potential therapeutic remedies.
