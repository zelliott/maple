In plants, the two-component systems (TCSs) play important roles in regulating diverse biological processes, including responses to environmental stress stimuli. Within the soybean genome, the TCSs consist of at least 21 histidine kinases, 13 authentic and pseudo-phosphotransfers and 18 type-A, 15 type-B, 3 type-C and 11 pseudo-response regulator proteins. Structural and phylogenetic analyses of soybean TCS members with their Arabidopsis and rice counterparts revealed similar architecture of their TCSs. We identified a large number of closely homologous soybean TCS genes, which likely resulted from genome duplication. Additionally, we analysed tissue-specific expression profiles of those TCS genes, whose data are available from public resources. To predict the putative regulatory functions of soybean TCS members, with special emphasis on stress-responsive functions, we performed comparative analyses from all the TCS members of soybean, Arabidopsis and rice and coupled these data with annotations of known abiotic stress-responsive cis-elements in the promoter region of each soybean TCS gene. Our study provides insights into the architecture and a solid foundation for further functional characterization of soybean TCS elements. In addition, we provide a new resource for studying the conservation and divergence among the TCSs within plant species and/or between plants and other organisms.
