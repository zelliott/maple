Ceramide, which is an integral component of the sphingomyelin signaling pathway, can attenuate voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (VGCC) activity in a number of cell types. The aim of the present study was to determine whether ceramide can also modulate VGCC activity, and as a consequence nicotinic receptor-dependent Ca(2+) signaling and catecholamine secretion, in rat adrenal chromaffin cells. Short-term C(6)-ceramide (CER) treatment dose-dependently inhibited nicotine (NIC)-induced peak intracellular Ca(2+) transients. Sphingomyelinase elicited similar responses, whereas the inactive ceramide analog C(2)-dihydroceramide had no effect on NIC-induced Ca(2+) transients. CER suppressed KCl- and NIC-induced Ca(2+) transients to a similar extent, suggesting that the voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel was a primary site of inhibition. In direct support of this concept, whole-cell patch-clamp analysis demonstrated that CER and sphingomyelinase significantly reduced peak Ca(2+) currents. Pretreatment with staurosporine significantly attenuated CER-dependent inhibition of both NIC-induced Ca(2+) transients and peak Ca(2+) current, suggesting that the effects of CER are mediated at least in part by protein kinase C. Consistent with suppressed Ca(2+) signaling, CER also significantly inhibited NIC-induced catecholamine secretion measured at the single-cell level by carbon fiber amperometry. This effect of CER was also significantly attenuated by pretreatment with staurosporine These data demonstrate that the sphingomyelin signaling pathway can modulate nicotinic receptor-dependent Ca(2+) signaling and catecholamine secretion in rat chromaffin cells.
