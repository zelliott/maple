The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase was studied in slices of guinea-pig cerebral cortex under normal and depolarizing conditions. Carbachol (1 mM) inhibited basal and isoproterenol (50 microM)-stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation by 20% and 25%, respectively, in normal Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer solution (KRB). High-K+ medium (42 mM K+) increased cAMP accumulation to 330% of the basal level and abolished the inhibitory effect of carbachol. It also abolished the effect of morphine, an agonist of opioid receptors. Low-Ca2+ KRB or the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine, counteracted the effect of high K+ and restored the inhibitory effect of carbachol on the cAMP level. Pretreatment of slices with W-7 or trifluoperazine, two calmodulin antagonists, had the same effect as low Ca2+ or nifedipine on high-K(+)-stimulated cAMP accumulation and caused reappearance of the inhibitory effects of carbachol and morphine. On the contrary, H-7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, and neomycin, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, had no significant effect on high-K(+)-induced phenomena and did not restore the effect of carbachol. These data suggest that the Ca2(+)-calmodulin system activated by membrane depolarization regulates the cAMP level directly and also by affecting the receptor-mediated process in nerve cells.
