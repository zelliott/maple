Recent evidence suggests that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent signaling contributes to liver cell proliferation, as well as to apoptotic liver cell death, and represents an important regulator of hepatic regeneration. This article summarizes recent findings on the molecular mechanisms involved in EGFR-mediated cell proliferation and apoptosis. The emphasis is on the interplay between EGFR and CD95 (Fas, APO-1) death receptor-signaling, which is determined by the signaling context and liver cell type investigated.
