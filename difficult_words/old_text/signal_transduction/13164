Serotonin is implicated in the regulation of complex sensory, motor, affective, and cognitive functions. However, the biochemical mechanisms whereby this neurotransmitter exerts its actions remain largely unknown. DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of molecular weight 32,000) is a phosphoprotein that has primarily been characterized in relation to dopaminergic neurotransmission. Here we report that serotonin regulates DARPP-32 phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo. Stimulation of 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT4 and 5-HT6 receptors causes an increased phosphorylation state at Thr34-DARPP-32, the protein kinase A site, and a decreased phosphorylation state at Thr75-DARPP-32, the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 site. Furthermore, stimulation of 5-HT2 receptors increases the phosphorylation state of Ser137-DARPP-32, the casein kinase-1 site. Behavioral and gene transcriptional effects induced by compounds that selectively release serotonin were greatly reduced in DARPP-32 knockout mice. Our data indicate that DARPP-32 is essential not only for dopaminergic but also for serotonergic neurotransmission.
