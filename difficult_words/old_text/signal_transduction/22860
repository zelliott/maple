Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous chronic and acute inflammatory conditions. We have previously shown that mouse Sertoli cells respond to TNF-alpha by increasing interleukin-6 production and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression (1). In this cell type TNF-alpha activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways p42/p44 MAPK, JNK/SAPK, and p38, the last of which is responsible for interleukin-6 production (1). To determine which MAPK signaling pathway is required for TNF-alpha induction of ICAM-1 expression, we have utilized the protein kinase inhibitor dimethylaminopurine, demonstrating that treatment of Sertoli cells with such compound significantly reduced ICAM-1 expression and JNK/SAPK activation. Moreover, dimethylaminopurine treatment increased the expression of MAPK phosphatase-2, providing a possible mechanism of action of this compound. By using agonist antibodies to p55 and to p75 TNF-alpha receptors and both human and mouse TNF-alpha, we demonstrate that both TNF receptors are expressed and that only the p55 receptor is involved in ICAM-1 expression. The p55 receptor activates all of the three pathways, whereas p75 failed to activate any of the MAPKs. Altogether our results demonstrate that TNF-alpha up-regulates ICAM-1 expression through the activation of the JNK/SAPK transduction pathway mediated by the p55 receptor.
