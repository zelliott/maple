It is generally known that the decision to use anti-estrogen therapy is based on the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast cancers. Recent studies have shown that androgen receptor (AR) is frequently expressed in ER-, PR- breast cancer and plays an important role in the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, AR can increase the global expression of microRNAs, post-transcriptional gene regulators that play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the functions and relations of AR, related miRNAs and target proteins in ER-, PR-, AR+ breast cancer. The results showed that androgen-induced AR activating signal directly upregulates let-7a expression, downregulates CMYC and KRAS protein expression, and inhibits cell proliferation in ER-, PR-, AR+ breast cancer cells. Overexpression of let-7a inhibits cell proliferation and downregulates CMYC and KRAS protein expression, whereas inhibition of let-7a expression by specific antisense oligonucleo-tides increases cell growth and upregulates CMYC and KRAS protein expression. We performed in situ hybridization for let-7a and immunohistochemical staining for CMYC and KRAS using sequential sections obtained from surgically-resected breast cancer tissues and observed an inverse correlation between the staining pattern of let-7a and its target proteins. Androgen-induced AR activating signal upregulates let-7a that targets CMYC and KRAS and contributes to ER-, PR-, AR+ breast cancer pathogenesis. Elucidation of this pathway will help develop new therapies.
