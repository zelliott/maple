High density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are inversely proportional to the risk of coronary heart disease. HDL mediates various anti-atherogenic pathways including reverse cholesterol transport from cells of the arterial wall to the liver and steroidogenic tissues. In addition HDL activates various intracellular signaling events that confer atheroprotection. The HDL receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) has been implicated directly and indirectly in HDL induced signaling. The aim of this review is to summarize the role of SR-BI in HDL induced signaling in the vasculature.
