Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a malignant tumour with quite high cancer specific mortality, and it still lacks stable and reliable markers for NSCLC's prognosis. Platelet derived grow factor (PDGF) and PDGFR has been considered to be involved in the process of cell proliferation, migration, metastasis and epithelial mesenchymal transition of cancer cell through various intracellular signal pathways. Pathology analysis showed that PDGF pathway mainly stimulates the proliferation of NSCLC tumour stroma through paracrine pattern, and some reaseach found that PDGF pathway directly promotes some NSCLC cell's proliferation. The expression of PDGF and PDGFR within NSCLC tissue correlates with status of lymphatic metastasis and patients' prognosis. In clinical treatment of NSCLC, the great effect of PDGF pathway in angiogenesis and promoting distribution of chemotherapy by inhibition of PDGF should not be neglected. As an important pro-angiogenesis pathway, functions of PDGF in radiotherapy is dicovered by more and more fundamental research. This review focuses on the progress of PDGF pathway in NSCLC and aims to provide some new ideas for clinical and fundamental researchers.
