Size is a fundamental attribute impacting cellular design, fitness, and function. Size homeostasis requires a doubling of cell mass with each division. In yeast, division is delayed until a critical size has been achieved. In metazoans, cell cycles can be actively coupled to growth, but in certain cell types extracellular signals may independently induce growth and division. Despite a long history of study, the fascinating mechanisms that control cell size have resisted molecular genetic insight. Recently, genetic screens in Drosophila and functional genomics approaches in yeast have macheted into the thicket of cell size control.
