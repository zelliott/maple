The molecular determinants which dictate survival and apoptosis/anoikis in human intestinal crypt cells remain to be fully understood. To this effect, the roles of beta1 integrin/Fak/Src signaling to the PI3-K/Akt-1, MEK/Erk, and p38 pathways, were investigated. The regulation of six Bcl-2 homologs (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-X(L), Bax, Bak, Bad) was likewise analyzed. We report that: (1) Anoikis causes a down-activation of Fak, Src, Akt-1 and Erk1/2, a loss of Fak-Src association, and a sustained/enhanced activation of p38beta, which is required as apoptosis/anoikis driver; (2) PI3-K/Akt-1 up-regulates the expression of Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1, down-regulates Bax and Bak, drives Bad phosphorylation (both serine112/136 residues) and antagonizes p38beta activation; (3) MEK/Erk up-regulates Bcl-2, drives Bad phosphorylation (serine112 residue), but does not antagonize p38bactivation; (4) PI3-K/Akt-1 is required for survival, whereas MEK/Erk is not; (5) Src acts as a cornerstone in the engagement of both pathways by beta1 integrins/Fak, and is crucial for survival; and (6) beta1 integrins/Fak and/or Src regulate Bcl-2 homologs as both PI3-K/Atk-1 and MEK/Erk combined. Hence, beta1 integrin/Fak/Src signaling translates into integrated mediating functions of p38beta activation and regulation of Bcl-2 homologs by PI3-K/Akt-1 and MEK/Erk, consequently determining their requirement (or not) for survival.
