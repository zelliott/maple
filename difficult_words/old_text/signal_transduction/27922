4-Hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (HNE) is a biologically active aldehydic end product of oxidative decomposition of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids of membrane phospholipids, a process referred to as lipid peroxidation. HNE has been detected in several experimental and clinical conditions in which oxidative stress has been reported to occur and several authors have suggested that HNE and related 4-hydroxy-2,3-alkenals (HAKs) of different chain length may act not only as toxic and mutagenic mediators of oxidative stress-related injury but also as biological signals in normal and pathological conditions. In this paper we will review the literature supporting the concept that HNE and HAKs may act as signal molecules able to modulate biological events such as chemotaxis, signal transduction, gene expression, cell proliferation and cell differentiation.
