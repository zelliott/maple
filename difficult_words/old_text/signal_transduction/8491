To investigate the expression of PTEN in carcinogenesis and development of colon carcinoma and to reveal their correlation with the PI3K/AKT pathway.

The expressions of PTEN and p-AKT were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blotting in 32 specimens from patients with colon carcinoma.

The positive rate of p-PTEN was significantly lower in colon carcinoma (31.25%) than that in normal control tissues (96.87%, P<0.01), and the positive rate of p-AKT was significantly higher in colon carcinoma (87.5%) than that in normal control tissues (15.62%, P<0.01), and expression level of PTEN and p-AKT were related to histological differentiation, distant invasion, lymph node metastasis and Duke's stage (P<0.05). A negative correlation was observed between the expression of PTEN and p-AKT proteins. (r=-0.872, P<0.01).

The over-expression of AKT accompanied by the loss of PTEN involves carcinogenesis and development of colon carcinoma.
