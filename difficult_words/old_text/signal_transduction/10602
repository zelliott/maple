The cardiovascular system plays a critical role in vertebrate development and homeostasis. Vascular development is a highly organized sequence of events that requires the correct spatial and temporal expression of specific sets of genes leading to the development of a primary vascular network. There have been intensive efforts to determine the molecular mechanisms regulating vascular growth and development, and much of the rationale for this has stemmed from the increasing clinical importance and therapeutic potential of modulating vascular formation during various disease states.
