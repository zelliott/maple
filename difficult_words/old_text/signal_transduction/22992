To clarify the contribution of peripheral trigeminal input to the control of pecking behavior we examined head and jaw movement kinematics and peck localization in pigeons with surgical section of trigeminal nerves providing somatosensory input to the beak. Conditioning procedures were used to bring the pecking/grasping components of pecking under the control of a visual target. Conditioned head and jaw movements were monitored 'on-line' using movement transducers and terminal peck location was recorded using 'touch-screen' technology. The periodic delivery of a food reinforcer provided repeated opportunities to monitor the kinematics of ingestive pecks. Deafferentation produced deficits in mandibulation during ingestive pecking and in the coordination of head and jaw movements during conditioned pecking. These results are attributed to disruptions in trigeminal feedback and feedforward mechanisms, respectively. In contrast with previous studies, deafferentation did not impair the precision of peck localization. Possible reasons for the absence of localization deficits are presented. The results are discussed in relation to the role of peripheral inputs in the control of prehensile movements.
