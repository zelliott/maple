Plants have evolved highly complex sensory mechanisms to monitor their surroundings and adapt their growth and development to the prevailing environmental conditions. The integration of information from multiple environmental cues enables the co-ordination of development with favourable seasonal conditions and, ultimately, determines plant form. Light signals, perceived via the phytochrome, cryptochrome and phototropin photoreceptor families, are especially important environmental signals. Redundancy of function among phytochromes and their interaction with blue light photoreceptors enhance sensitivity to light signals, facilitating the accurate detection of, and response to, environmental fluctuations. In this review, current understanding of Arabidopsis phytochrome functions will be summarized, in particular, the interactions among the phytochromes and the integration of light signals with directional and temperature sensing mechanisms.
