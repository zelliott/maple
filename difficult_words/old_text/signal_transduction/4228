A molecular-genetic approach has been taken to identify genes involved in olfactory transduction in Drosophila melanogaster. Two independent lines of research led to the finding that the dominant Scutoid (Sco) mutation causes a diminished extracellular electroantennogram response to the odorants ethyl acetate (EtAC) and acetone (AC). Sco flies showed about 4- and 2.5-fold reduced responses to EtAC and AC, respectively, compared to Canton-S wild-type and sibling control flies lacking the Sco mutation when electroantennogram recordings were made from the proximal anterior third antennal segment. The responses to five other odors from three different chemical classes were unaltered. The maximum response to either EtAC or AC was decreased with no change in apparent affinity. Responses to short-chain (but not long-chain) acetate esters and ketones were dramatically affected at all antennal locations tested. Only in the proximal quadrants were responses to ethyl acetoacetate also reduced. Most Sco revertants tested had a normal olfactory response; duplications of the region including no-ocelli partially suppress the Sco bristle as well as olfactory phenotypes. Sco adults had an impaired behavioral response to EtAC but not to banana or propionate. There was no effect of the mutation on larval chemosensory behavior or extracellularly recorded adult compound eye and ocellar visual responses. These findings suggest the involvement of Sco in an olfactory pathway in adults which is specific for short-chain acetate esters and ketones.
