Recent studies of isolated muscle membrane have enabled induction and monitoring of rapid Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)5 in vitro by a variety of methods. On the other hand, various proteins that may be directly or indirectly involved in the Ca2+ release mechanism have begun to be unveiled. In this mini-review, we attempt to deduce the molecular mechanism by which Ca2+ release is induced, regulated, and performed, by combining the updated information of the Ca2+ release kinetics with the accumulated knowledge about the key molecular components.
