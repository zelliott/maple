The CBP [CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein)-binding protein]/p300 acetyltransferases function as transcriptional co-activators and play critical roles in cell differentiation and proliferation. Accumulating evidence shows that alterations of the CBP/p300 protein levels are linked to human tumours. In the present study, we show that the levels of the CBP/p300 co-activators are decreased dramatically by continuous PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) and Ras signalling pathway activation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. This effect occurs by reducing the expression levels of the CBP/p300 genes. In addition, CBP and p300 are degraded by the 26 S proteasome pathway leading to an overall decrease in the levels of the CBP/p300 proteins. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Mdm2 (murine double minute 2), in the presence of active H-Ras or N-Ras, induces CBP/p300 degradation in NIH 3T3 cells. These findings support a novel mechanism for modulating other signalling transduction pathways that require these common co-activators.
