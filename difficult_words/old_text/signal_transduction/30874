We previously showed that S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, a nitric oxide donor, decreased the levels and functions of G(i)alpha proteins by formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). The present studies were undertaken to investigate whether ONOO(-) can modulate the expression of G(i)alpha protein and associated adenylyl cyclase signaling in VSMC. Treatment of A-10 and aortic VSMC with ONOO(-) for 24 h decreased the expression of G(i)alpha-2 and G(i)alpha-3, but not G(s)alpha, protein in a concentration-dependent manner; expression was restored toward control levels by (111)Mn-tetralis(benzoic acid porphyrin) and uric acid, but not by 1H[1,2,4]oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ) and KT-5823. cGMP levels were increased by approximately 50% and 150% by 0.1 and 0.5 mM ONOO(-), respectively, and attenuated toward control levels by ODQ. In addition, 0.5 mM ONOO(-) attenuated the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by ANG II and C-type atrial natriuretic peptide (C-ANP(4-23)), as well as the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity by GTPgammaS, whereas, the G(s)-mediated stimulations were augmented. In addition, 0.5 mM ONOO(-) decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase and enhanced JNK phosphorylation but did not affect AKT1/3 phosphorylation. These results suggest that ONOO(-) decreased the expression of G(i) proteins and associated functions in VSMC through a cGMP-independent mechanism and may involve the MAP kinase signaling pathway.
