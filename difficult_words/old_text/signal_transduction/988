1. Considerable evidence indicates that calcium plays a critical role in apoptosis. We have previously shown that benidipine, a vasodilatory calcium channel blocker, attenuates postischemia myocardial apoptosis. The present study was designed to determine the mechanisms by which benidipine exerts its antiapoptotic effect. 2. Adult male rats were subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Rats were randomized to receive either vehicle or benidipine (10 microg x kg(-1), i.v.) 10 min before reperfusion. 3. Compared with rats receiving vehicle, those rats treated with benidipine had reduced postischemic myocardial apoptosis as evidenced by decreased TUNEL-positive staining (8.4+/-1.2 vs 15.3+/-1.3%, P<0.01) and caspase-3 activity (1.94+/-0.25 vs 3.43+/-0.29, P<0.01). 4. Benidipine treatment significantly reduced mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation, but had no effect on caspase-8 activation, suggesting that benidipine exerts its antiapoptotic effect by inhibiting the mitochondrial-mediated, but not death receptor-mediated, apoptotic pathway. 4. 5. Benidipine treatment not only increased the maximal activity of ERK1/2 at 10 min after reperfusion, but also prolonged the duration of ERK1/2 activation. Benidipine treatment had no significant effect on other apoptotic regulating molecules, such as p38 MAPK. 6. Taken together, our present study demonstrated for the first time the differential regulation of a calcium channel blocker. Benidipine tilted the balance between ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK toward an antiapoptotic state, decreased mitochondrial cytochrome c release, reduced caspase-9 activation, and attenuated subsequent caspase-3 activation and postischemic myocardial apoptosis.
