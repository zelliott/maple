We have earlier found that freshwater pond snails Helisoma trivolvis and Lymnaea stagnalis, when reared under conditions of starvation, release chemical signals that reversibly suppress larval development of conspecific embryos. Here, we report that (i) these signals are not strictly conspecific and affect also embryos of a closely related species, which occupies a similar environmental niche; (ii) besides the development of embryos, the signals also affect the release of main motor programs, such as locomotion, feeding, and cardiac activity; (iii) action of the signals is bidirectional: they retard the development and release of motor programs at the early larval stages (trochophore to veliger) and accelerate them at later stages (late veliger to hatching). A possible adaptive significance of the described phenomena is discussed.
