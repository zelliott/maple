Peroxiredoxins are important hydroperoxide detoxification enzymes, yet have only come to the fore in recent years relative to the other major players in peroxide detoxification, heme-containing catalases and peroxidases and glutathione peroxidases. These cysteine-dependent peroxidases exhibit high reactivity with hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrite and play major roles not only in peroxide defense, but also in regulating peroxide-mediated cell signaling. This overview focuses on important peroxiredoxin features that have emerged over the past several decades with an emphasis on catalytic mechanism, regulation, and biological function.
