Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are widely expressed in the innate and adaptive immune system. They initiate host defense against endogenous and exogenous pathogens containing conserved pathogen associated molecular patterns. TLRs are critical bridges between the innate and adaptive immunity, especially the cellular immunity mediated by T cells. Emerging evidence indicated that B cells express almost all subtypes of TLRs. TLRs play critical role not only in regulation of proliferation, maturation and function of B cells, but also in pathogenesis of diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Targeting TLRs of B cells is a promising therapeutic strategy for these disorders.
