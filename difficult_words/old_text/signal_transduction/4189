Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced inhibition of surfactant synthesis seems to participate in the pathogenesis of the adult respiratory distress syndrome.

To examine the ability of human type II pneumocytes to produce nitric oxide (NO) in the presence of TNF-alpha and, in addition, to explore the role of this radical in the transduction of the cytokine signal.

Multiple organ donors were the source of lung tissue specimens. Type II pneumocytes were isolated by enzymatic digestion, adherence separation of macrophages, and gradient purification. After 24-hour preculture, cells were cultured for 24 hours in the presence or absence of TNF-alpha (100 ng/mL), sodium nitroprusside (100 mumol/L), N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (NAME) (1 mmol/L), methylene blue (10 mumol/L),8-bromo-3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) (1 mmol/L), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (0.1 mumol/L), indomethacin (30 mumol/L), and combinations. The NO release to the medium and cGMP and PGE2 contents of the cells were measured.

The incorporation of 14C-labeled glucose (D-[U-14C]glucose) into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol was selectively inhibited either by 8-Br-cGMP or in the presence of TNF-alpha, PGE2, or nitroprusside, all of which caused an increase in the intracellular levels of cGMP. The inhibitory effect of TNF-alpha was partially reverted by indomethacin, NAME, N-monomethyl arginine, or methylene blue. The inhibitory effect of PGE2 was partially reverted by NAME, while that of nitroprusside was reverted by methylene blue, but not by indomethacin. Tumor necrosis factor alpha induced an increase in PGE2 (4.31 +/- 0.27 vs 1.65 +/- 0.17-pg/microgram protein, n = 10, P < .01) and cGMP (0.238 +/- 0.012 vs 0.109 +/- 0.014-pmol/microgram protein, n = 10, P < .01) cell content and in the NO release to the medium (3.10 +/- 0.14 vs 1.19 +/- 0.11-nmol/microgram protein, n = 10, P < .01). The basal NO release to the medium was also increased in the presence of PGE2. The NAME, which blocked NO generation and cGMP increase, did not affect PGE2 production in response to TNF-alpha. However, indomethacin, which blocked PGE2 production, also blunted NO generation and cGMP increase.

The NO generation, secondary to PGE2 production, seems responsible for the TNF-alpha-induced inhibition of phosphatidylcholine synthesis by human type II pneumocytes. Nitric oxide seems to exert this effect through activation of guanylyl cyclase.
