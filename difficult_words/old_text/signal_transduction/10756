Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a pivotal transcription factor composed of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta subunits, plays a major role in tumor progression by activating a number of genes critically involved in adaptation to hypoxia. HIF-1 is also induced by several carcinogenic metals. Vanadate, an environmental toxic metal, is considered as a potent inducer of tumors in animals and is reported to activate HIF-1 activity. However, the involved mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study, we have examined the biochemical mechanisms of the vanadate-induced HIF-1 activation in cancer cells by primarily focusing on the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which plays an essential role as an energy sensor under ATP-deprived conditions. We demonstrate that AMPK was rapidly activated in response to vanadate in DU145 human prostate carcinoma, and that its activation preceded HIF-1alpha expression. Under this condition, inhibition of AMPK by a pharmacological and molecular approach dramatically abolished the vanadate-induced HIF-1alpha expression as well as HIF-1-mediated physiological responses. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling was also involved in vanadate-induced HIF-1alpha expression, but it was independent of AMPK signaling pathway. Moreover, we demonstrate a role of reactive oxygen species as an upstream signal for these two pathways. These results suggest that AMPK is a novel and critical component of HIF-1 regulation, further implying its involvement in vanadate-induced carcinogenesis.
