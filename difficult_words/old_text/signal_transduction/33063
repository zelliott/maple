The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) initiates signal transduction by activating multiple cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). Considerable progress in the field of TCR signal transduction has been made in three areas recently: first, in understanding the structure and function of the PTK ZAP-70; second, in the elucidation of the function of the substrates and pathways downstream of the PTKs; and third, in the identification of molecules that negatively regulate TCR signalling.
