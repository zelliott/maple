The transcription factors NFAT and AP-1 have been shown to be essential for inducible interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression in activated T cells. NFAT has been previously reported to bind to two sites in the IL-2 promoter: in association with AP-1 at the distal antigen response element at -280 and at -135. On the basis of DNase I footprinting with recombinant NFAT and AP-1 proteins, gel shift assays, and transfection experiments, we have identified three additional NFAT sites in the IL-2 promoter. Strikingly, all five NFAT sites are essential for the full induction of promoter activity in response to T-cell receptor stimulation. Four of the five NFAT sites are part of composite elements able to bind AP-1 in association with NFAT. These sites display a diverse range of cooperativity and interdependency on NFAT and AP-1 proteins for binding. One of the NFAT sites directly overlaps the CD28-responsive element. We present evidence that CD28 inducibility is conferred by the AP-1 component in NFAT-AP-1 composite elements. These findings provide further insight into the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the IL-2 promoter.
