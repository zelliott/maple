Our microRNA expression signature of renal cell carcinoma revealed that miR-218 expression was significantly decreased in cancer tissues, suggesting that miR-218 is a candidate tumor suppressor. We investigated the functional significance of miR-218 in cancer cells and identified what are to our knowledge novel miR-218 mediated cancer pathways in renal cell carcinoma.

Gain of function studies using mature miR-218 were performed to investigate cell proliferation, migration and invasion in the A498 and 786-O renal cell carcinoma cell lines. To identify miR-218 mediated molecular pathways and responsible genes in renal cell carcinoma, we used gene expression and in silico database analyses. Loss of function assays were performed to investigate the functional significance of miR-218 target genes.

Restoration of mature miR-218 significantly inhibited RCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Gene expression studies and luciferase reporter assays showed that CAV2 involved in the focal adhesion pathway was directly regulated by miR-218. A silencing study of CAV2 revealed significant inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion. CAV2 mRNA and protein expression was significantly up-regulated in renal cell carcinoma clinical specimens.

Loss of tumor suppressive miR-218 enhances cancer cell migration and invasion through dysregulation of the focal adhesion pathway, especially CAV2 as an oncogenic function in renal cell carcinoma. Tumor suppressive microRNA mediated cancer pathways and responsible genes provide new insights into the potential mechanisms of renal cell carcinoma oncogenesis and metastasis.
