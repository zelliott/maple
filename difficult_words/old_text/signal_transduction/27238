To elucidate the signal transduction pathway from external stimuli to nuclear gene expression in mechanical stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy, we examined the time course of activation of protein kinases such as Raf-1 kinase (Raf-1), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK), MAP kinases (MAPKs) and 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90rsk) in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Mechanical stretch rapidly activated Raf-1 and its maximal activation was observed at 1-2 min after stretch. The activity of MAPKK was also increased by stretch, with a peak at 5 min after stretch. In addition, MAPKs and p90rsk were maximally activated at 8 min and at 10-30 min after stretch, respectively. Next, the relationship between mechanical stress-induced hypertrophy and the cardiac renin-angiotensin system was investigated. When the stretch-conditioned culture medium was transferred to the culture dish of non-stretched cardiac myocytes, the medium activated MAPK activity slightly but significantly, and the activation was completely blocked by the type 1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist, CV-11974. However, activation of Raf-1 and MAPKs provoked by stretching cardiomyocytes was only partially suppressed by pretreatment with CV-11974. These results suggest that mechanical stress activates the protein kinase cascade of phosphorylation in cardiac myocytes in the order of Raf-1, MAPKK, MAPKs and p90rsk, and that angiotensin II, which is secreted from stretched myocytes, activates a part of these protein kinases.
