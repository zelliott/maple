We investigated the inhibition of apoptosis and proliferation of poorly differentiated AGS gastric cancer cells by epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), to establish target genes for regulation by EGCG. The proliferation and apoptosis of AGS gastric cancer cells treated with EGCG were observed by cell counting kit (CCK)-8 and flow cytometry. Differential gene expression in AGS cells treated with EGCG was screened by gene expression microarrays. Id1 gene and protein expression were determined by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. The effect of Id1 on EGCG-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of AGS cells was verified with RNAi. The proliferation and apoptosis of AGS cells treated with siRNAâ€‘Id1 was observed by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. EGCG significantly promoted apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of AGS cells. The Id1 gene was differentially expressed in AGS cells treated with EGCG, and Id1 mRNA and protein were downregulated in AGS cells treated with EGCG, confirmed by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Id1 mRNA and protein were also downregulated in AGS cells treated with siRNA-Id1. The apoptosis and proliferation of AGS cells treated with siRNA-Id1 were similar to those in cells treated with EGCG. EGCG induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of poorly differentiated AGS gastric cancer cells, and Id1 may be one of the target genes regulated by EGCG in cancer inhibition.
