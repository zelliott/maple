The triple co-localisation of peptidergic material immunoreactive to antisera raised against allatostatins of the Y/FXFGL-NH2 type, Manduca sexta allatostatin (Mas-AS), and allatotropin has been demonstrated in a single pair of anterodorsal neurones in the frontal ganglion of the tomato moth, Lacanobia oleracea (Noctuidae). Another pair of posterior neurones contain only Y/FXFGL-NH2-type allatostatin immunoreactivity. The neurites of all four cells trifurcate, and axons project to the brain in the frontal connectives and to the foregut in the recurrent nerve. Axons from the anterior neurones, within the recurrent nerve, have prominent lateral branches supplying muscles of the crop, and axons from both anterior and posterior cells show profuse branching and terminal arborisations in the region of the stomodeal valve. The brain contributes Y/FXFGL-NH2-immunoreactive material, but not allatotropin or Mas-AS, to the recurrent nerve via NCC 1+2 and NCC 3. All three peptides have a reversible effect on the spontaneous (peristaltic) contractions of the foregut (crop) in vitro. Thus, both types of allatostatin are inhibitory at 10(-12) to 10(-7) M, whereas allatotropin is strongly myostimulatory at 10(-14) M. This is the first demonstration of the gut myoinhibitory effects of Mas-AS and, taken together with the effects of Y/FXFGL-NH2-type allatostatins and allatotropin, reveals a different functional aspect to that normally attributed to these three peptides, i.e. control of juvenile hormone synthesis by the corpus allatum.
