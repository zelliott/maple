Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine-threonine kinases that transmit signals from cell surface receptors. To determine if distinct PKC isozymes transmit proliferative and/or apoptotic signals in colon cancer cells, we examined the effects of 3 PKC agonists, phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA), ingenol 3,20-dibenzoate (IDB), and bistratene A, and a selective PKC inhibitor, GF 109203X, on proliferation, apoptosis, and activation of individual PKC isozymes in 5 colon cancer cell lines.

Effects were assayed by a formazan-based colorimetric assay, [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, fluorescent nuclear staining, annexin V binding, DNA fragmentation assay, and immunoblotting of cytoplasmic and membrane fractions for PKC isozymes.

Two cell lines, SNU-C1 and SNU-C4, showed proliferative responses to PMA (0.1-1 nmol/L) and IDB (10-1000 nmol/L) and marked apoptotic responses to PMA (>5 nmol/L) and bistratene A (>1 micromol/L). GF 109203X blocked proliferative and apoptotic effects of PMA with distinct IC(50)s. Proliferative concentrations of PMA and IDB caused translocation of PKCepsilon alone, whereas apoptotic concentrations of PMA and bistratene A induced translocation of PKCdelta.

Activation of PKCepsilon and PKCdelta triggers proliferative and apoptotic signals, respectively, in SNU-C4 colon cancer cells. These 2 isozymes may play important opposing roles in normal homeostasis and neoplastic transformation of the colorectal epithelium.
