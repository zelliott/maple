We have previously demonstrated the presence of active epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its involvement in sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction; however, the mechanism of EGFR activation was not clear. We show here that the sperm EGFR can be transactivated by angiotensin II or by lysophosphatydic acid, two ligands which activate specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), or by directly activating protein kinase A using 8Br-cAMP. This transactivation occurs in noncapacitated sperm and is mediated by PKA, SRC and a metalloproteinase. We also show that the EGFR is activated in sperm incubated under in vitro capacitation conditions, without any added ligand, but not in bicarbonate-deficient medium or when PKA is blocked. Despite the fact that EGFR is activated in capacitated sperm, this state is not sufficient to induce the acrosome reaction. We conclude that the EGFR is stimulated during capacitation via PKA activation, while further activation of the EGFR in capacitated sperm is required in order to induce the acrosome reaction. The acrosome reaction can be induced by GPCR via the transactivation of the EGFR by a signaling pathway involving PKA, SRC and metalloproteinase and the EGFR down-stream effectors PI3K, PLC and PKC.
