Stimulation of secretion in guinea pig parotid gland lobules by either isoproterenol or carbachol is associated with a removal of acyl groups from the acyl-CoA pool and their incorporation into diacylglycerols and triglycerides (SÃ¶ling, H. D., Machado-De Domenech, E., Kleineke, J., and Fest, W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16786-16792). This is associated with an increased incorporation of glycerol into diacylglycerol. These changes occur during the first 20-30 s of stimulation. We can show now that these changes are associated with a significant increase in the activities of lysophosphatidate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol kinase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase which reaches a maximum during the first 60 s after stimulation. In vitro experiments with isolated parotid microsomes, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and with purified protein phosphatases indicate that the activation of enzyme activities in intact parotid gland cells results from protein phosphorylation. The two protein kinases seem to activate the three enzymes by phosphorylating the same site(s). Protein kinase C was almost ineffective. Glycerol kinase, glycerolphosphate acyltransferase, phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, CTP:phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase, and phosphatidylinositol synthase remained unchanged in the intact cell as well as during incubation with protein kinases in vitro. Lysophosphatidate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol kinase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase can be activated by the two protein kinases also in microsomes from guinea pig cerebellum. It seems, therefore, that the regulation leading to rapid changes of enzyme activities during signal transmission in parotid acinar cells could be operative also in other cell types.
