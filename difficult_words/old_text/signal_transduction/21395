The family of estrogen receptor-related receptors (ERRs) is a subfamily of the orphan nuclear receptors, which is closely related to the estrogen receptor (ER) family. Research on ERRs has shown that the ERR family share target genes, co-regulators and promoters with the ER family. ERRs seem to interfere with the classic ER-mediated estrogen responsive signaling in various ways. Moreover, ERRs have been reported to be prognostic biomarkers in breast, ovarian and colorectal cancer. ERRs should be considered as additional factors in the evaluation of gynecological tumors. Since ERRs have an important influence on the overall estrogenic response, they are of clinical importance in gynecological cancer, but also regarding women's general health.
