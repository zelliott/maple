We have previously demonstrated that agonists increase microvascular permeability through a phospholipase C-nitric oxide synthase-guanylate cyclase cascade. The aim of this study was to further investigate the downstream end of the signaling pathway with a focus on myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. The apparent permeability coefficient to albumin was measured in isolated coronary venules. Under control conditions, the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside, as well as the guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activator 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, increased venular permeability two- to threefold. Similarly, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate significantly elevated permeability. Inhibition of MLC phosphorylation with ML-7 significantly attenuated the hyperpermeability responses to the agonists. Furthermore, ML-7 dose dependently reduced basal venular permeability. Consistently, inhibition of dephosphorylation with the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin dramatically increased basal permeability. These results suggest that 1) PKG and PKC play an important signaling role in the regulation of endothelial barrier function and 2) MLC phosphorylation contributes to basal and agonist-stimulated microvascular permeability.
