Cell adhesion molecules mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesions, and coordination between these molecules is essential for tissue formation and morphogenesis. Crosstalk between integrins and cadherins may result from a physical response to integrin-mediated adhesion, complex cell differentiation processes, or direct signaling pathways linking the two adhesion systems. Nectins have recently been shown to regulate the organization of cadherins into adherens junctions and the formation of tight junctions by several processes. Furthermore, protocadherins can interact with extracellular matrix proteins or function by regulating classical cadherins.
