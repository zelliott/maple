Microarray analysis offers a powerful tool for studying the mechanisms of cellular transformation, although the correlation between mRNA and protein expression is largely unknown. In this study, a microarray analysis was performed to compare transcription in response to overexpression of the ErbB-2 receptor tyrosine kinase in a model mammary luminal epithelial cell system, and in response to the ErbB-specific growth factor heregulin beta1. We sought to validate mRNA changes by monitoring changes at the protein level using a parallel proteomics strategy, and report a surprisingly high correlation between transcription and translation for the subset of genes studied. We further characterised the identified targets and relate differential expression to changes in the biological properties of ErbB-2-overexpressing cells. We found differential regulation of several key cell cycle modulators, including cyclin D2, and downregulation of a large number of interferon-inducible genes, consistent with increased proliferation of the ErbB-2-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, differential expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix modelling and cellular adhesion was linked to altered adhesion of these cells. Finally, we provide evidence for enhanced autocrine activation of MAPK signalling and the AP-1 transcription complex. Together, we have identified changes that are likely to drive proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of ErbB-2- overexpressing cancer cells.
