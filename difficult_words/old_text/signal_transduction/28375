FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) is a homolog of caspase-8 that lacks catalytic activity and has been shown to be important in protecting endothelial cells from apoptosis. The serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB was recently reported to promote FLIP expression in endothelial and tumor cells. Here we examined the role of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a, a downstream target of Akt, in controlling FLIP regulation in endothelial cells. FOXO3a nuclear translocation was regulated by Akt in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Transduction of a nonphosphorylatable, constitutively active mutant of FOXO3a (TM-FOXO3a) led to the down-regulation of FLIP levels. Transduction with TM-FOXO3a also increased caspase-8 activity and promoted apoptosis in endothelial cells. Conversely, transduction of a dominant-negative mutant of FOXO3a up-regulated FLIP levels and protected endothelial cells from apoptosis under serum deprivation conditions. Restoration of intracellular FLIP blocked caspase-8 activation and inhibited apoptosis in TM-FOXO3a-transduced cells. These data suggest that FOXO3a is a downstream target of Akt in endothelial cells that can promote apoptosis via FLIP down-regulation and activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
