MAP kinases are among the most ancient signal transduction pathways and are widely used throughout evolution in many physiological processes. In mammalian species, MAP kinases are involved in all aspects of immune responses, from the initiation phase of innate immunity, to activation of adaptive immunity, and to cell death when immune function is complete. In this review, we summarize recent progress in understanding the function and regulation of MAP kinase pathways in these phases of immune responses.
