Streptococcus gordonii and Veillonella atypica, two early-colonizing members of the dental plaque biofilm, participate in a relationship that results in increased transcription of the S. gordonii gene amyB, encoding an alpha-amylase. We show that the transcription factor CcpA is required for this interspecies interaction.
