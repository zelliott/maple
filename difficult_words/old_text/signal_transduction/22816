The activity of the stress-responsive sigma factor, sigma(E), is induced by the extracytoplasmic accumulation of misfolded or unfolded protein. The inner membrane protein RseA is the central regulatory molecule in this signal transduction cascade and acts as a sigma(E)-specific anti-sigma factor. Here we show that sigma(E) activity is primarily determined by the ratio of RseA to sigma(E). RseA is rapidly degraded in response to extracytoplasmic stress, leading to an increase in the free pool of sigma(E) and initiation of the stress response. We present evidence that the putative inner membrane serine protease, DegS, is responsible for this regulated degradation of RseA.
