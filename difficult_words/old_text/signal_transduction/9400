Human malignant pleural mesothelioma (hMPM) is an aggressive asbestos-associated cancer, the incidence of which is increasing and which, despite progress in diagnosis and therapy, continues to have a poor prognosis. Asbestos fibers induce aberrant cell signaling, leading to proto-oncogene activation and chemoresistance. In this review, we discuss the evolution of pharmacological management of hMPM up to the most recent advances. Monotherapy with single cytotoxic drugs achieves modest objective response rates, seldom reaching 30%. However, combination regimens using novel drugs and standard molecules are showing gradually improving responses and clinical benefits. Phase II/III studies have identified pemetrexed, a multitarget folate pathway inhibitor in combination with platinum derivatives, and the cisplatin/gemcitabine association as front-line chemotherapy for hMPM. Detailed knowledge of molecular mechanisms of signal transduction and neoangiogenesis in hMPM should aid in the design and screening of other promising compounds such as more efficacious receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
