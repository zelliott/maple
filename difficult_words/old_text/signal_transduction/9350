The nuclear Dbf2-realted (NDR) family members are highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinases that function in concert with the Hippo signalling pathway to play crucial roles in regulation of cell proliferation and survival in non-neuronal cells. Recent studies employing a range of animal models have implicated NDR kinases as regulators of multiple aspects of development in post-mitotic neurons including progenitor proliferation, fate specification and circuit formation, all of which are crucial for neuronal functions. This review summarizes the recent advances in our understanding of the neuronal functions of NDR kinases and discusses their association with neuronal diseases.
