Activating mutations of the Ca(2+)-sensing receptor (CaR) gene cause autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism. Functional expression studies have been reported for several mutations, but have produced conflicting results. Thus, the mechanism by which these mutations activate the receptor is unclear. We describe here a new family with autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism. The mother and three daughters experienced muscle spasms and/or seizures from early childhood. They were treated with oral calcium and vitamin D analogs, and all four patients developed hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and renal insufficiency. In this family, we identified a heterozygous missense mutation (F612S) involving the extracellular region of the CaR. The mutation cosegregated with disease. It was not present in 50 normal control individuals. We used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce this mutation into the CaR cDNA, and then expressed the mutant receptor in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. In these cells, the accumulation of inositol phosphates was measured as a function of extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Compared with the wild-type receptor, the mutant receptor showed a left-shift in the concentration-response curve and an increase in the maximal response to high Ca2+ concentration. These effects did not appear to be mediated by changes in levels of receptor expression, as judged by ELISA, or by changes in receptor glycosylation, as judged by Western analysis. We conclude that this CaR mutation causes hypoparathyroidism by a dual increase in receptor sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ and maximal signal transduction capacity.
