The contraction of skeletal muscle is regulated by calcium binding to troponin C (TnC). TnC consists of two spatially independent domains, each of which contains two metal ion binding sites. Calcium binding to the regulatory sites of the N-terminal domain triggers muscle contraction by a series of conformational changes. Site-directed mutagenesis offers a means of elucidating the links in this signal path between TnC and actin-myosin crossbridges. Such mapping is possible if the mutants shift the equilibrium between 'on' and 'off' states of the regulatory complex while maintaining the coupling between calcium binding and tension development. Candidate amino-acid residues for yielding this information would be in positions remote from the calcium-binding sites and from the site of development of tension. Analysis of the crystal structure of TnC and of the model of the calcium-activated molecule has enabled us to identify two such residues: Glu 57 and Glu 88. In separate experiments we have replaced each of these residues by lysines. The resulting reduction in calcium affinity indicates that these residues have a long-range effect on calcium binding. This result may reflect the formation of a salt bridge between positions 57 and 88 that is not present in the native molecule. Moreover, the level of tension recovery when the mutants are incorporated into muscle suggests that the interaction between TnC and other muscle components has also been altered. Thus, these residues may participate in the contraction signal transmission.
