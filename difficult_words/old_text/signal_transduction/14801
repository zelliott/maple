Silibinin is a natural flavonoid antioxidant with anti-hepatotoxic properties and pleiotropic anticancer capabilities. We tested the hypothesis that silibinin inhibits cellular invasiveness by down-regulating the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)-dependent c-Jun/activator protein-1 (AP-1) induction, which leads to inhibition of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expressions in human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells. We found that silibinin decreased cell adhesion and invasiveness, as well as inhibited u-PA and MMP-2 expressions. Silibinin reduced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, but had no effects on the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) 1/2, p38 and Akt. Silibinin suppressed AP-1-binding activity and c-Jun levels and its phosphorylation without changes of c-Fos and Ets-1 levels. Silibinin also inhibited interleukin-6-induced ERK 1/2 and c-Jun phosphorylation, and cell invasiveness. Thus, silibinin may possess an anti-metastatic activity in MG-63 cells.
