We have examined the possible involvements of pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein (Gp) and protein kinase C (PKC) in the mitogenic signaling pathways of various growth factors by the use of PT-pretreated and/or 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-pretreated mouse fibroblasts. Effects of PT pretreatment (inactivation of PT-sensitive Gp) and TPA pretreatment (depletion of PKC) on mitogen-induced DNA synthesis varied significantly and systematically in response to growth factors: mitogenic responses of cells to thrombin, bombesin, and bradykinin were almost completely abolished both in PT- and TPA-pretreated cells; responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and vanadate were reduced to approximately 50% both in PT- and TPA-pretreated cells compared with native cells; response to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was not affected in PT-pretreated cells but was inhibited to some extent in TPA-pretreated cells. Thus, growth factors examined have been classified into three groups with regard to the involvements of PT-sensitive Gp and PKC in their signal transduction pathways. Binding of each growth factor to its receptor was not affected significantly by pretreatment of cells with PT or TPA. Inhibitory effects of PT and TPA pretreatment on each mitogen-induced DNA synthesis were not additive, suggesting that the functions of PT-sensitive Gp and PKC lie on an identical signal transduction pathway. Although all three groups of mitogens activated PKC, signaling of each growth factor depends to a varying extent on the function of PKC. Our results indicate that a single peptide growth factor such as EGF, PDGF, or bFGF acts through multiple signaling pathways to induce cell proliferation.
