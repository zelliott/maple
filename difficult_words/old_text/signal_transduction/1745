GABA neurones in the preoptic area (POA) are critical for oestradiol (E2)-dependent surge release of luteinizing hormone (LH); however, it is not clear which population(s) of POA GABA neurones is involved. The goals of the present studies were: (i) to determine whether E2 regulates GABA neurones similarly in two subdivisions of the POA that play a role in LH surge release, the rostral POA region that contains the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (rPOA/OVLT), and the region containing the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) and (ii) to determine whether GABA neurones in either or both regions exhibit temporal changes consistent with a role in the regulation of LH surge release. To accomplish these goals, we measured glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and 67 mRNA levels at several time points in ovariectomized (OVX), E2-treated OVX rats exhibiting LH surge release, and in E2-treated OVX rats in which LH surge release was blocked by prior administration of progesterone (P4). Our findings demonstrate that, despite their close proximity, GABA neurones in the AVPV/MPN region are regulated differently from those in the rPOA/OVLT. Only neurones in the AVPV/MPN region show temporal changes in GAD 67 mRNA expression that appear to be linked to positive-feedback effects of E2 on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and LH release. Our findings also indicate that a morning rise and an afternoon fall in GAD 67 mRNA levels marks two E2-dependent signals required for LHRH and LH surge release. Finally, our results suggest that there are distinct E2-induced signals to the rPOA/OVLT and AVPV/MPN regions and that these signals differentially regulate GAD 65 and 67 gene expression.
