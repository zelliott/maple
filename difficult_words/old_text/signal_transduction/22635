The t(1;19) translocation of pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) produces E2a-Pbx1, a chimeric oncoprotein containing the transactivation domains of E2a joined to the homeodomain protein, Pbx1. E2a-Pbx1 causes T cell and myeloid leukemia in mice, blocks differentiation of cultured myeloid progenitors, and transforms fibroblasts through a mechanism accompanied by aberrant expression of tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated genes. Here we investigate whether aberrant gene expression also occurs specifically in the t(1;19)-containing subset of pre-B cell ALL in man. Two new genes, EB-1 and EB-2, as well as Caldesmon were transcriptionally activated in each of seven t(1;19) cell lines. EB-1 expression was extremely low in marrow from patients having pre-B ALL not associated with the t(1;19), and elevated more than 100-fold in marrow from patients with pre-B ALL associated with the t(1;19). Normal EB-1 expression was strong in brain and testis, the same tissues exhibiting the highest levels of PBX1 expression. EB-1 encodes a signaling protein containing a phosphotyrosine binding domain homologous to that of dNumb developmental regulators and two SAM domains homologous to those in the C-terminal tail of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases. We conclude that aberrant expression of tissue-specific genes is a characteristic of t(1;19) pre-B ALL, as was previously found in fibroblasts transformed by E2a-Pbx1. Potentially, EB-1 overexpression could interfere with normal signaling controlling proliferation or differentiation.
