Membrane lipid rafts (LRs) have been demonstrated to be importantly involved in transmembrane signaling in a variety of mammalian cells. Many receptors can be aggregated within the LR clusters to form signaling platforms. Currently, LRs were reported to be clustered to aggregate, recruit, and assemble NADPH oxidase subunits and related proteins in various cells in response to various stimuli, forming redox signaling platforms. These LR signaling platforms may play important roles in the regulation of cellular activity and cell function, and also in the development of cell dysfunction or injury associated with various pathological stimuli. This LRs clustering-mediated mechanism is considered to take a center stage in redox signaling associated with death receptors. In this chapter, some basic methods and procedures for characterization of LR-redox signaling platforms formation and for determination of the function of these signaling platforms are described in detail, which include identification of LR-redox signaling platforms in cell membrane by using fluorescent or confocal microscopy of LR-redox signaling platforms and fluorescent resonance energy transfer analysis, isolation of LR-redox signaling platforms by flotation of detergent-resistant membranes, and function measurement of LR-redox signaling platforms by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. It is expected that information provided here will help readers to design necessary experiments in their studies on LR signaling platforms and redox regulation of cell function.
