Human erythrocytes are endowed with ATP release pathways and metabotropic and ionotropic purinoceptors. This review summarizes the pivotal function of purinergic signaling in erythrocyte control of vascular tone, in hemolytic septicemia, and in malaria. In malaria, the intraerythrocytic parasite exploits the purinergic signaling of its host to adapt the erythrocyte to its requirements.
