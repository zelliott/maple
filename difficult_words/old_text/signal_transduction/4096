We have recently identified a novel ligand of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family termed VEGF-related protein (VRP), which specifically binds to the FLT4 receptor. To characterize the signaling events after VRP engagement of its cognate receptor in hematopoietic cells, a population of human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, termed HEL-JW, expressing high levels of FLT4 receptor was isolated. Stimulation of HEL-JW cells with VRP alone and in combination with the c-kit ligand/stem cell factor increased cell growth. VRP induced tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins, including the FLT4 receptor. Further characterization of these tyrosine phosphorylated molecules revealed that Shc, Grb2, and SOS form a complex with the activated FLT4 receptor. HEL-JW cells also expressed RAFTK, a recently identified member of the focal adhesion kinase family. RAFTK was phosphorylated and activated upon VRP treatment, and there was an enhanced association of this kinase with the adaptor protein Grb2. Furthermore, the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), involved in growth activation and shown to mediate RAFTK signaling in other cell types, was activated by VRP stimulation. We also observed that VRP treatment of HEL-JW cells resulted in the phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein paxillin. This treatment resulted in an increased association of paxillin with RAFTK, which was mediated by the C-terminal region of RAFTK. These studies indicate that VRP stimulation induced the formation of a signaling complex at its activated receptor as well as activation of RAFTK. VRP-mediated activation of RAFTK may facilitate signal transduction to the cytoskeleton and downstream to the JNK pathway in FLT4-expressing blood cells.
