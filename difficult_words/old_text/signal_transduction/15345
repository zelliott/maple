Recent studies demonstrate the critical role of the extracellular matrix in the organization of parenchymal cells in the heart. Thus, an understanding of the modes of regulation of matrix production by cardiac myofibroblasts is essential. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling is transduced through the canonical Smad pathway, and the involvement of this pathway in matrix synthesis and other processes requires precise control. Inhibition of Smad signaling may be achieved at the receptor level through the targeting of the TGF-beta type I receptors with an inhibitory Smad7/Smurf2 complex, or at the transcriptional level through c-Ski/receptor-Smad/co-mediator Smad4 interactions. Conversely, Arkadia protein intensifies TGF-beta-induced effects by marking c-Ski and inhibitory Smad7 for destruction. The study of these TGF-beta mediators is essential for future treatment of fibrotic disease, and this review highlights recent relevant findings that may impact our understanding of cardiac fibrosis.
