Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are important signal transduction pathways that control pivotal cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, gene regulation, and motility. MAPK pathways consist of a relay of consecutive phosphorylation events exerted by MAPK kinase kinases, MAPK kinases, and MAPKs. Conventional MAPKs are characterized by a conserved Thr-X-Tyr motif in the activation loop of the kinase domain, while atypical MAPKs lack this motif and do not seem to be organized into the classical three-tiered kinase cascade. One functional group of conventional and atypical MAPK substrates consists of protein kinases known as MAPK-activated protein kinases. Eleven mammalian MAPK-activated protein kinases have been identified, and they are divided into five subgroups: the ribosomal-S6-kinases RSK1-4, the MAPK-interacting kinases MNK1 and 2, the mitogen- and stress-activated kinases MSK1 and 2, the MAPK-activated protein kinases MK2 and 3, and the MAPK-activated protein kinase MK5 (also referred to as PRAK). MK5/PRAK is the only MAPK-activated protein kinase that is a substrate for both conventional and atypical MAPK, while all other MAPKAPKs are exclusively phosphorylated by conventional MAPKs. This review focuses on the structure, activation, substrates, functions, and possible implications of MK5/PRAK in malignant and nonmalignant diseases.
