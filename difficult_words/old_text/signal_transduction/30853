MAPK signaling is required for retinoic acid (RA)-triggered G(0) cell cycle arrest and cell differentiation, but the mechanism is not well defined. In this study, RA is found to cause MAPK activation with sustained association of RAF to MEK or ERK, leading to a MAPK-dependent accumulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and binding to CDK2 blocking G(1)/S transition. BLR1, a chemokine receptor, was found to function as a critical component of RA-triggered MAPK signaling. Unlike wild-type parental cells, RA-treated BLR1 knock-out cells failed to show RAF and consequential MEK and ERK phosphorylation, failed to accumulate CDK inhibitors that control G(1)/S transition, and failed to differentiate and arrest in response to RA, whereas ectopically overexpressing BLR1 enhanced MAPK signaling and caused accelerated RA-induced differentiation and arrest. Ectopic overexpression of RAF enhanced BLR1 expression in response to RA, whereas inhibition of RAF or MEK by inhibitors or knockdown of RAF by short interfering RNA diminished RA-induced BLR1 expression and attenuated differentiation and growth arrest. Ectopic expression of the RAF CR3, the catalytically active domain, in the BLR1 knock-out restored RA-induced MAPK activation and the ability to differentiate and arrest, indicating that RAF effects MAPK signaling by BLR1 to propel differentiation/arrest. Taken together, RA induces cell differentiation and growth arrest through activation of a novel MAPK pathway with BLR1 as a critical component in a positive feedback mechanism that may contribute to the prolonged MAPK signaling propelling RA-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation.
