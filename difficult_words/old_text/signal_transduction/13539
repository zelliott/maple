The influence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] on adenylate cyclase responsiveness in cultured osteoblastic cells was studied using a human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2. 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment had no effect on cell growth, cell protein and alkaline phosphatase activity. 1,25(OH)2D3 did not alter the basal production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in intact cells, but the cAMP formation in response to parathyroid hormone (PTH), isoproterenol (ISO) and cholera toxin was attenuated by 1,25(OH)2D3. The response to forskolin, however, was unaffected by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. Islet activating protein failed to modify these 1,25(OH)2D3 effect. In cell free experiments, 1,25(OH)2D3 showed similar effect--that is, PTH and ISO-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were attenuated, but forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase was unaffected. 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment had no effect on the kinetics of PTH binding to PTH receptor and on the ADP ribosylation of GTP stimulatory binding protein (Gs) in SaOS-2 cells. According to these results, 1,25(OH)2D3 appeared to change the coupling of Gs with adenylate cyclase, but does not affect receptor, Gs and adenylate cyclase themselves, nor GTP inhibitory binding protein.
