Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has been reported to stimulate melanotroph secretion, and PACAP-like immunoreactivity and expression of PACAP type I receptor messenger RNA have been identified in the pituitary pars intermedia (PI). The present study showed that PACAP messenger RNA is also expressed in the PI. To examine the mechanism of PACAP action in the PI, cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and ionic currents were measured in acutely dissociated rat melanotrophs. In about 40% of the melanotrophs studied, PACAP induced an increase in [Ca2+]i, which was suppressed by extracellular Ca2+ removal; extracellular Na+ replacement; the blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels, nicardipine; or the secreto-inhibitory neurotransmitter, dopamine. The PACAP-induced [Ca2+]i increase was mimicked by activators of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC), Sp-diastereomer of cAMP and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, and was reduced by inhibitors of PKA and PKC, Rp-diastereomer of cAMP and staurosporine. Patch-clamp analysis revealed that PACAP caused inward currents with a reversal potential of -0.8 mV and facilitated voltage-dependent Ba2+ currents. It further revealed that PACAP-induced inward currents were mimicked by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol and inhibited by staurosporine, and that Sp-diastereomer of cAMP facilitated Ba2+ currents. These results suggest that PACAP potentiates Ca2+ entry mechanisms of rat melanotrophs by activation of nonselective cation channels via PKC and facilitation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels via PKA.
