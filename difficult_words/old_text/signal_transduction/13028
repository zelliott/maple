The Euresco/EMBL sponsored meeting on 'Membrane Dynamics in Endocytosis' took place on 6--11 October in Tomar, Portugal. Here we report on the 5 full days of exciting talks and active poster sessions that covered topics ranging from the mechanisms of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the regulation of phagocytosis, caveolae dynamics and function, the role of lipids in regulating endocytic transport, the formation of and sorting into and out of multivesicular bodies, new links between the actin cytoskeleton and vesicular transport, and emerging roles for endocytic trafficking in signal transduction and development.
