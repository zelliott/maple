Many aspects of the signaling mechanisms involved in the initiation of hepatic regeneration are under current investigation. Nevertheless, the actual mechanisms switching liver regeneration on and off are still unknown. Hemodynamic changes in the liver following partial hepatectomy have been suggested to be a primary stimulus in triggering liver regeneration. Most of the new knowledge about the impact of hemodynamic changes on liver regeneration is both conceptually important and directly relevant to clinical problems.

The purpose of this review is therefore to exclusively address the hemodynamic signal driving the liver regeneration process.
