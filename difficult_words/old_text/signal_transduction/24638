The human immune system contains T and B lymphocytes which respond in an antigen-specific manner to foreign antigens. These foreign antigens are recognized by multimeric receptors expressed on the cell surface of T and B lymphocytes. The subunits that make up the T and B cell receptor complexes have been identified, but their stoichiometries and positions in the complex remain to be resolved. Elucidation of the quaternary structures is necessary to understand the molecular basis of signal transduction events which follow antigen recognition and will contribute to the design of drugs that can modulate T and B cell responses. Here, I will discuss recent insights into the quaternary structures of the TCR and BCR and the striking similarities between the two, both in the structures of the subunits and in the overall quaternary structures. In addition, the intracellular assembly processes of these receptor complexes will be discussed, as well as the recent realization that these processes appear to be mediated by house-keeping proteins that transiently bind to partial TCR and BCR complexes. Similar to the role of BiP which mediates assembly processes of B cell immunoglobulins, a recently identified intracellular protein of 90 kD, called IP90, appears to play a role in TCR and BCR assembly processes. Analyses of the IP90 protein might contribute not only insight into the folding and assembly processes in lymphocytes, but also into those of newly synthesized proteins in many different cell types.
