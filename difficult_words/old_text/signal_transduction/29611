Investigations on the effects of eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitors on the hemocyte microaggregation and prophenoloxidase (proPO)-activating system in the hemolymph, parasitemia and mortality of Rhodnius prolixus infected with Trypanosoma rangeli were performed. Hemocoelic injection of live T. rangeli epimastigotes into fifth-instar larvae of R. prolixus that previously fed on blood containing an inhibitor of phospholipase A(2) (dexamethasone), a specific inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase pathway (indomethacin), and a non-selective lipoxygenase inhibitor (NDGA) (i) reduced the hemocyte microaggregation, (ii) attenuated the proPO system in the hemolymph and (iii) enhanced parasitemia and mortality induced by the parasite challenge in these insects. The effects obtained by dexamethasone administered orally were counteracted by inoculation of the insects with arachidonic acid. We suggest that the infectivity of T. rangeli can be increased by interference with the R. prolixus immune system. This is the first demonstration that the triatomine's immune responses to a parasite infection are modulated by a physiological system that includes eicosanoid biosynthesis.
