Size regulation is a crucial feature in many biological systems, with misregulation leading to dysplasia or hyperplasia. The recent discovery of counting factor (CF) in Dictyostelium discoideum will lead to a greater understanding of how the system regulates the size of a group of cells. In this paper we mathematically model the known effects of CF using two different models: a cellular automata model and a discrete continuum hybrid model. With the use of these models we are able to understand how modulation of adhesion and motile forces by CF can facilitate stream breakup. In addition, the modelling suggests a new possible mechanism for stream breakup involving the frequency of cell reorientation.
