Syndecans, transmembrane proteoglycans, play an important role in cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions, as well as modulators in receptor activation. These functions are partly non-specific and related to the heparan sulfate chains attached to the ectodomain, and partly specific due to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the core protein. In hemopoietic cells syndecan-1 is expressed only in B cells at certain differentiation stages (pre-B and plasma cells). In lymphoproliferative conditions this selective expression is retained in myelomas/plasmacytomas and other lymphoplasmacytic NHL subtypes, and primary effusional lymphomas. It is probably gained in B-CLL, and lost in other NHLs of pre- or post-follicular origin. It is concluded from these empiric results that the expression of syndecan is essential for some NHLs, probably ensuring the required connections to the microenvironment. From a diagnostic point of view, syndecan-1 is a very useful phenotypic marker to indentify cells with plasmacytic differentiation. The importance of syndecan expression in CLL and Hodgkin's lymphoma still requires further studies.
