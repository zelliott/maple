The G alpha q protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway, which includes diacylglycerol (DAG) and protein kinase C (PKC), plays a critical role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (HF). It has been reported that the expression of a constitutively active mutant of the G protein alpha q subunit in the hearts of transgenic mice (G alpha q-TG) induces cardiac hypertrophy and lethal HF. DAG kinase (DGK) catalyzes DAG and controls its cellular levels, thus acting as a regulator of GPCR signaling. It has been found that transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of DGK zeta (DGK zeta-TG) inhibit GPCR agonist-induced activation of the DAG-PKC signaling and subsequent cardiac hypertrophy, so this study tested the hypothesis that DGK zeta could rescue G alpha q-TG mice from developing HF.

Double transgenic mice (G alpha q/DGK zeta-TG) with cardiac-specific overexpression of both DGK zeta and G alpha q were generated by crossing G alpha q-TG with DGK zeta-TG mice, and the pathophysiological consequences were analyzed. DGK zeta prevented cardiac dysfunction, determined by dilatation of left ventricular (LV) dimensions, reduction of LV fractional shortening, and marked increases in LV end-diastolic pressure in G alpha q-TG mice. Translocation of PKC isoforms, phosphorylation activity of c-jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in G alpha q-TG mice were attenuated by DGK zeta. DGK zeta improved the survival rate of G alpha q-TG mice.

These results demonstrate the first evidence that DGK zeta blocks cardiac dysfunction and progression to lethal HF by activated G alpha q protein without detectable adverse effects in the in-vivo heart and suggest that DGK zeta is a novel therapeutic target for HF.
