Tumors can promote their own progressive growth by inducing T cell apoptosis. Though previous studies suggested that tumor-mediated T cell killing is receptor dependent, we recently showed that tumor gangliosides also participate, a notion consistent with reports indicating that, in some cell types, gangliosides can activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by stimulating reactive oxygen species production, cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 activation. In this study, we used normal peripheral blood T cells, as well as caspase-8-, caspase-9-, and Fas-associated death domain protein-deficient Jurkat cells, to assess whether the death ligands and gangliosides overexpressed by the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell line SK-RC-45 can independently stimulate T cell apoptosis as a mechanism of immune escape. Anti-FasL Abs and the glycosylceramide synthase inhibitor 1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (PPPP) each partially inhibited the ability of SK-RC-45 to kill cocultured activated T cells; together, as purified molecules, RCC gangliosides and rFasL induced a more extensive mitochondrial permeability transition and greater levels of apoptosis than either agent alone, equivalent to that induced by the FasL- and ganglioside-expressing RCC line itself. rFasL-mediated apoptosis was completely inhibited in caspase-8- and Fas-associated death domain protein-negative Jurkat cells, though apoptosis induced by purified gangliosides remained intact, findings that correlate with the observed partial inhibition of SK-RC-45-induced apoptosis in the Jurkat lines with defective death receptor signaling. Western blot analysis performed on lysates made from wild-type and mutant Jurkat cells cocultured with SK-RC-45 revealed caspase activation patterns and other biochemical correlates which additionally supported the concept that tumor-associated gangliosides and FasL independently activate the caspase cascade in T cells through the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, respectively.
