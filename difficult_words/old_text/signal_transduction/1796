A series of recombinant viruses with either site-specific mutations or various deletions of the early UL4 promoter of human cytomegalovirus were used to determine the roles of regulatory elements and the effects of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Viral gene expression was regulated by upstream cis-acting sites and by basic promoter elements that respond to the MAPK signal transduction pathways. Inhibitors of either the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway or the p38 MAPK pathway affected expression equally with either wild-type or mutant early UL4 promoters in the viral genome, indicating that the effects of the inhibitors are not exclusive for a single transcription factor. The minimal responsive element is the TATA box-containing early viral promoter.
