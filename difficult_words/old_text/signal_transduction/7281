Iron oxide nanoparticles (ION), with different coatings and sizes, have attracted extensive interest in the last years to be applied in drug delivery, cancer therapy and as contrast agents in imagiologic techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging. However, the safety of these nanoparticles is still not completely established, particularly to host defense systems that are usually recruited for their clearance from the body. In this paper, given the importance of neutrophils in the immune response of the organism to nanoparticles, the effect of polyacrylic acid (PAA)-coated and non-coated ION on human neutrophils was evaluated in vitro, namely their capacity to activate the oxidative burst and to modify their lifespan. The obtained results showed that the studied PAA-coated and non-coated ION triggered neutrophils' oxidative burst in a NADPH oxidase dependent manner, and that PAA-coated ION increased -Â while non-coated ION prevented - apoptotic signaling and apoptosis. These effects may have important clinical implications in biomedical applications of ION.
