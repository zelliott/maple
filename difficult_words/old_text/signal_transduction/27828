Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that only somatostatin receptor (SSTR) 1 mRNA was expressed in Ball-1 B-, Jurkat T-, and HL60 leukemia cell lines. In contrast, human normal mononuclear cells expressed the mRNA of all five subtypes of SSTR, although the expression level of SSTR1 was the highest. A binding study, revealed that [125I]-somatostatin bound specifically to HL60 cells and this binding was inhibited concentration-dependently by unlabeled somatostatin (SS). A [3H]thymidine incorporation study showed that SS significantly and concentration-dependently inhibited HL60 and BALL-1 leukemia cell growth. Furthermore, this inhibition of leukemia cell growth was associated with reduces c-fos gene expression. These data indicate that leukemia cells express SSTR1 and SS reduce c-fos gene expression with resultant suppression of leukemia cell growth, possibly mediated by the SSTRI.
