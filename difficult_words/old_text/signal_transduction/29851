The LH/hCG receptor, a member of the G protein coupled receptor family mediates the cellular actions of LH in the ovary. A considerable amount of information regarding its structure, mechanism of activation, and regulation of expression has emerged in recent years. Here we provide a brief overview of the current information on the structural organization of the receptor and the mechanism of receptor mediated signaling as well as an in-depth discussion on recent developments pertaining to the regulation of receptor expression. Specifically, we describe studies from our laboratory showing that the posttranscriptional regulation of the receptor involves an LH/hCG receptor mRNA-binding protein. We also propose a model to explain the loss of steady-state LH/hCG receptor mRNA levels during receptor down-regulation.
