Aggregation of the type 1 Fc-epsilon receptors (Fc-epsilon-RI) on mast cells initiates a network of biochemical processes culminating in secretion of both granule-stored and de novo-synthesized inflammatory mediators. A strict control of this response is obviously a necessity; nevertheless, this regulation is hardly characterized. Here we report that a prototype inhibitory receptor, the mast cell function-associated antigen (MAFA), selectively regulates the Fc-epsilon-RI stimulus-response coupling network and the subsequent de novo production and secretion of inflammatory mediators. Specifically, MAFA suppresses the PLC-gamma2-[Ca2+]i, Raf-1-Erk1/2, and PKC-p38 coupling pathways, while the Fyn-Gab2-mediated activation of PKB and Jnk is essentially unaffected. Hence, the activities of several transcription/nuclear factors for inflammatory mediators (NF-kappaB, NFAT) are markedly reduced, while those of others (Jun, Fos, Fra, p90rsk) are unaltered. This results in a selective inhibition of gene transcription of cytokines including IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-8, and IL-10, while that of TNF-alpha, MCP-1, IL-3, IL-5, or IL-13 remains unaffected. Taken together, these results illustrate the capacity of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-containing receptor to cause tight and specific control of the production and secretion of inflammatory mediators by mast cells.
