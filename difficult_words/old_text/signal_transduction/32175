Identification of molecules and their effectors has led to new therapies designed to specifically inhibit pathways in molecularly defined breast cancer subtypes. An orphan nuclear receptor, estrogen-related receptor alpha, has been shown to be a downstream target of two tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor. Identifying the mechanistic actions of orphan nuclear receptors could lead to new biomarkers and molecular targets in malignancy.
