Leptin and melanocortin signaling control ingestive behavior, energy balance, and substrate utilization, but only leptin signaling defects cause hypothalamic hypogonadism and infertility. Although GnRH neurons do not express leptin receptors, leptin influences GnRH neuron activity via regulation of immediate downstream mediators including the neuropeptides neuropeptide Y and the melanocortin agonist and antagonist, Î±-MSH, agouti-related peptide, respectively. Here we show that modulation of melanocortin signaling in female db/db mice through ablation of agouti-related peptide, or heterozygosity of melanocortin 4 receptor, restores the timing of pubertal onset, fertility, and lactation. Additionally, melanocortin 4 receptor activation increases action potential firing and induces c-Fos expression in GnRH neurons, providing further evidence that melanocortin signaling influences GnRH neuron activity. These studies thus establish melanocortin signaling as an important component in the leptin-mediated regulation of GnRH neuron activity, initiation of puberty and fertility.
