The aspartate chemoreceptor Tar has a thermosensing function that is modulated by covalent modification of its four methylation sites (Gln295, Glu302, Gln309, and Glu491). Without posttranslational deamidation, Tar has no thermosensing ability. When Gln295 and Gln309 are deamidated to Glu, the unmethylated and heavily methylated forms function as warm and cold sensors, respectively. In this study, we carried out alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the methylation sites. Although alanine substitutions influenced the signaling bias and the methylation level, all of the mutants retained aspartate-sensing function. Those with single substitutions had almost normal thermosensing properties, indicating that substitutions at any particular methylation site do not seriously impair thermosensing function. In the posttranslational modification-defective background, some of the alanine substitutions restored thermosensing ability. Warm sensors were found among mutants retaining two glutamate residues, and cold sensors were found among those with one or no glutamate residue. This result suggests that the negative charge at the methylation sites is one factor that determines thermosensor phenotypes, although the size and shape of the side chain may also be important. The warm, cold, and null thermosensor phenotypes were clearly differentiated, and no intermediate phenotypes were found. Thus, the different thermosensing phenotypes that result from covalent modification of the methylation sites may reflect distinct structural states. Broader implications for the thermosensing mechanism are also discussed.
