TCR stimulation induces integrin-mediated adhesion, facilitating stabilization of conjugates between T cells and antigen-presenting cells and thereby contributing to T cell activation. Integrin activation has been shown to require cytoskeletal reorganization; however, the molecular mechanisms mediating communication between the TCR and integrins remain unclear. Recently the adapter protein ADAP/Fyb/Slap has been shown to couple TCR stimulation to integrin activation by mediating increased integrin avidity. ADAP may also play a role in transduction of external signals by integrins. Like other adapters, ADAP is a multifunctional protein and interacts with molecules such as Fyn, Slp-76, Ena/VASP proteins, Vav1, WASP and the Arp2/3 complex.
