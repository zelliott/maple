Trk proteins are essential constituents of the high-affinity signal-transducing neurotrophin receptors. They are expressed in a variety of non-neuronal tissues, including lymphoid organs, but their cellular localization in these remains to be established, as does the exact role of neurotrophins in the immune system. In this study we used immunohistochemical methods to analyze the cellular distribution of TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, and p75 (the low-affinity pan-neurotrophin receptor) proteins in normal human lymph nodes.

Formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded human lymph nodes were processed for indirect immunoperoxidase labelling, using antibodies against each Trk protein, human p75, and a panel of antibodies against B-lymphocytes (CD20), macrophages (MAC387), dendritic cells (S-100 protein).

Immunoreactivity (IR) for p75 was observed in follicular dendritic cells of lymphoid follicles, and possibly in B cells. TrkA-like IR was seen in dendritic cells and also in some follicular dendritic cells, and in blood vessel walls. TrKB-like IR labelled scattered cells, mostly in the T cell zones, identified as macrophages, while specific TrkC-like IR could not be observed in immunocompetent cells. In no case was Trk-like IR seen in lymphocytes.

These results demonstrate the occurrence of Trk-like proteins in normal human lymph nodes and describe their cellular localization, favoring the notion that neurotrophins have a physiological role in the immune system, possibly acting through accessory cells and not directly on lymphocytes.
