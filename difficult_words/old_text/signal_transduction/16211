Mechanisms underlying synergistic liver injury caused by alcohol and obesity are not clear. We have produced a mouse model of synergistic steatohepatitis by recapitulating the natural history of the synergism seen in patients for mechanistic studies.

Moderate obesity was induced in mice by 170% overnutrition in calories using intragastric overfeeding of high fat diet. Alcohol (low or high dose) was then co-administrated to determine its effects.

Moderate obesity plus alcohol intake causes synergistic steatohepatitis in an alcohol dose-dependent manner. A heightened synergism is observed when a high alcohol dose (32g/kg/d) is used, resulting in plasma ALT reaching 392Â±28U/L, severe steatohepatitis with pericellular fibrosis, marked M1 macrophage activation, a 40-fold induction of iNos, and intensified nitrosative stress in the liver. Hepatic expression of genes for mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism are significantly downregulated, and hepatic ATP level is decreased. Synergistic ER stress evident by elevated XBP-1, GRP78 and CHOP is accompanied by hyperhomocysteinemia. Despite increased caspase 3/7 cleavage, their activities are decreased in a redox-dependent manner. Neither increased PARP cleavage nor TUNEL positive hepatocytes are found, suggesting a shift of apoptosis to necrosis. Surprisingly, the synergism mice have increased plasma adiponectin and hepatic p-AMPK, but adiponectin resistance is shown downstream of p-AMPK.

Nitrosative stress mediated by M1 macrophage activation, adiponectin resistance, and accentuated ER and mitochondrial stress underlie potential mechanisms for synergistic steatohepatitis caused by moderate obesity and alcohol.
