The co-ordination of T-cell motility, adhesion and activation remains poorly understood. It is also unclear how these functions are co-ordinated with external stimuli. Here we unveil a series of molecular interactions in cis at the surface of T lymphocytes with potent effects on motility and adhesion in these cells, and communicating with proliferative responses. These interactions were controlled by the signature cytokines of T helper subsets interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) was found to play a key role for T-cell motility by promoting development of polarized cell shape and cell movement. Endogenous thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) enhanced cell surface expression of LRP1 through CD47. Cell surface expressed LRP1 induced motility and processing of TSP-1 while inhibiting adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and fibronectin. Interleukin-2, but not IL-4, stimulated synthesis of TSP-1 and motility through TSP-1 and LRP1. Stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex inhibited TSP-1 expression. Inhibitor studies indicated that LRP1 regulated TSP-1 expression and promoted motility through JAK signalling. This LRP1-mediated motogenic signalling was connected to CD47/Gi protein signalling and IL-2-induced signalling through TSP-1. The motogenic TSP-1/LRP1 mechanism antagonized TCR/CD3-induced T-cell proliferation. These results indicate that LRP1 in collaboration with TSP-1 directs a counter-adhesive and counter-proliferative motogenic cascade. T cells seem programmed to prioritize movement before adhesion through this cascade. In conclusion, vital decision-making in T lymphocytes regulating motility, adhesive interactions and proliferation, are integrated through a molecular mechanism connecting different cell surface receptors and their signalling pathways.
