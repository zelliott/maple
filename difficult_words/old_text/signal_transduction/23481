Diabetic cardiomyopathy has been shown to promote hypertrophy, leading to heart failure. Recent studies have reported a correlation between diabetic cardiomyopathy and oxidative stress, suggesting that the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In a clinical setting, AGEs have been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease; however, the relationship between AGEs and cardiac hypertrophy remains unclear. This study sought to identify the role of AGEs in cardiac hypertrophy by treating H9c2 cells with glyceraldehyde-derived AGEs (200 μg/ml) or H2O2 (50 μM) for 96 h. Our results demonstrate that AGEs significantly increased protein levels and cell size. These effects were effectively blocked with PD98059 (10 μM; MEK/ERK inhibitor) pretreatment, suggesting that AGEs caused cell hypertrophy via the MEK/ERK pathway. We then treated cells with AGEs and H2O2 for 0-120 min and employed the Odyssey infrared imaging system to detect MEK/ERK phosphorylation. Our results show that AGEs up-regulated MEK/ERK phosphorylation. However, this effect was blocked by NAC (5 mM; ROS inhibitor), indicating that AGEs regulate MEK/ERK phosphorylation via ROS. Our findings suggest that glyceraldehyde-derived AGEs are closely related to cardiac hypertrophy and further identify a molecular mechanism underlying the promotion of diabetic cardiomyopathy by AGEs.
