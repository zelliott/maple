The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is constitutively activated in some pancreatic cancers; when activated, it inhibits chemotherapy-mediated apoptosis. We examined whether Akt activity correlates with apoptotic resistance to chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer.

A panel of human pancreatic cancer cells was evaluated for basal Akt activity as well as response to three chemotherapies. Chemotherapy-induced cell death was evaluated following either up- or down-regulation of Akt activity. Evaluation of phosphorylation of p21Cip/Waf1, a downstream target of Akt, was also evaluated.

There was a broad distribution among pancreatic cancer cell lines by Akt activity, as well as sensitivity to the three chemotherapeutic agents with no apparent correlation. Phosphorylation of p21Cip/Waf1, but not change in total levels, correlated with the chemosensitizing effect of Akt inhibition to paclitaxel.

Basal Akt activity does not appear to be a useful predictor for selection of pancreatic cancers in targeting Akt to broadly induce chemosensitivity.
