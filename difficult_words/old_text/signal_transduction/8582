Neovascular and degenerative diseases of the eye are leading causes of impaired vision and blindness in the world. Hypoxia or reduced oxygen tension is considered central to the pathogenesis of these disorders. Although the CD36 scavenger receptor features prominently in ocular homeostasis and pathology, little is known regarding its modulation by hypoxia. Herein we investigated the role and regulation of CD36 by hypoxia and by the major hypoxia effector, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1. In vivo, hypoxia markedly induced CD36 mRNA in corneal and retinal tissue. Subsequent experiments on human retinal pigment epithelial cells revealed that hypoxia time-dependently increased CD36 mRNA, protein, and surface expression; these responses were reliant upon reactive oxygen species production. As an important novel finding, we demonstrate that hypoxic stimulation of CD36 is mediated by HIF-1; HIF-1alpha down-regulation abolished CD36 induction by both hypoxia and cobalt chloride. Sequence analysis of the human CD36 promoter region revealed a functional HIF-1 binding site. A luciferase reporter construct containing this promoter fragment was activated by hypoxia, whereas mutation at the HIF-1 consensus site decreased promoter activation. Specific binding of HIF-1 to this putative site in hypoxic cells was detected by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Interestingly, inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway blocked the hypoxia-dependent induction of CD36 expression and promoter activity. Functional ramifications of CD36 hypoxic accumulation were evinced by CD36-dependent increases in scavenging and anti-angiogenic activities. Together, our findings indicate a novel mechanism by which hypoxia induces CD36 expression via activation of HIF-1 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway.
