Mammalian cells have evolved multiple responses for dealing with DNA damage. One response is to acutely downregulate DNA synthesis at the initiation step. Essentially nothing is known about the initial signal that activates this SDS pathway or the macromolecules involved in transducing the signal into the final inhibitory step at origins. Determining whether any radiation induced changes in known proteins involved in cell cycle regulation or in other signal transduction pathways are primary or secondary responses to DNA damage constitutes a major challenge to identifying members of the pathway. It may turn out to be easier to identify the final mediator in the pathway, namely the protein(s) whose interaction with origins is ultimately affected by radiation. Hopefully, mutations in SDS genes in genetically tractable systems such as S cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe will allow the identification of homologous genes in mammals. Most tumour cells are TP53 negative, and yet it is not clear that TP53 status influences radiation sensitivity. The SDS pathway may therefore represent an important protective mechanism that stands in the way of effective tumour cell killing by radiation therapy. It is hoped that an understanding of this pathway will provide opportunities for developing novel antineoplastic targets and/or radiation sensitizers.
