Thyroid hormones (THs) have a wide variety of essential roles in vertebrates, ranging from the regulation of key metabolic processes to cell proliferation and apoptosis. The classical mechanism of action of THs is genomic; 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) binds to specific nuclear receptors (TRs) and modifies the expression of specific genes. Recently, a new category of mechanisms, termed nongenomic, has been discovered for T3. These mechanisms include, among others, the rapid activation of signal transduction pathways, such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK, which eventually lead to cell proliferation. These effects are mediated in some cell types by a plasma membrane receptor, identified as integrin αvβ3, and in other cell types by cytoplasmic TRβ1. The aim of this work was to analyze the effect of T3 on the cell growth of chick embryo hepatocytes at two different stages of development, 14 and 19 days, and to determine the activation of the signal transduction pathways, focusing on the potential involvement of a plasma membrane receptor and the possible participation of PI3K/Akt and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our results clearly show that T3 stimulates cell proliferation at both stages of development through the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the production of small amounts of ROS, which operate as effective second messengers. Moreover, we prove that these effects are not initiated at the plasma membrane receptor for T3.
