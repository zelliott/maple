The tumour suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) plays essential roles in regulating signalling pathways involved in cell growth and apoptosis, and is inactivated in a wide variety of tumours. The role of PTEN as a tumour suppressor has been firmly established; however, the mechanism(s) by which its function and activity are regulated remains elusive. Here, we summarize recent progress in research directed towards trying to understand the molecular basis of regulatory mechanisms for PTEN. We also describe our novel finding that a tumour suppressor candidate protein binds to extreme C-terminal region of PTEN and regulates PTEN protein turnover.
