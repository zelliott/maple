In Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0, the synthesis of antifungal compounds is post-transcriptionally activated by the Gac/Rsm cascade. The two-component system GacS/GacA promotes transcription of three small regulatory RNAs (i.e., sRNAs), RsmX, RsmY, and RsmZ, which remove the regulatory proteins RsmA and RsmE from the ribosome-binding sites of exoproduct-related mRNAs. The GacS/GacA-dependent accumulation of RsmX/Y/Z and formation of RsmX/Y/Z-RsmA/E complexes relieve mRNA translational repression. Other bacteria as E. coli and Vibrio spp. utilize similar sRNA-protein based systems to adjust mRNA translation (e.g., the E. coli Csr system for carbon storage, motility and biofilm regulation). The Rsm/Csr sRNAs are remarkably similar in that they contain several stem-loops with an invariant GGA trinucleotide exposed in the hairpin loop that would be the characteristic structural-sequence motifs relevant for sRNA activity and stability. Here it is shown that the dysfunctional Gac/Rsm cascade of P. fluorescens DeltarsmXYZ mutants could be restored by appropriate transcription levels of artificial genes encoding RNAs with unrelated primary sequence but with two or more hairpins displaying the RsmA/E binding motifs. The results support the hypothesis that the molecular mimicry of Rsm/Csr sRNAs is based on proper secondary structures that expose critical binding motifs irrespective of their overall sequence.
