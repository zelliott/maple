Gene-for-gene resistance to a yellow strain of cucumber mosaic virus [CMV(Y)] is conferred by the dominant RESISTANCE to CMV(Y) (RCY1) allele in the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype C24. RCY1-conferred resistance to CMV(Y) and expression of the Pathogenesis-related 1 (PR-1) and PR-5 genes are partially compromised by the eds5 mutation and the nahG transgene that block accumulation of salicylic acid (SA). In contrast, the RCY1-conferred resistance to CMV(Y) is not affected by the jasmonic acid (JA)-insensitive coi1 and jar1 mutations. Interestingly, we report here that in contrast to the eds5 RCY1 plant, the eds5 coi1 RCY1 double-mutant plant exhibited a higher level of resistance to CMV(Y). Presence of the coi1 mutant allele also restored the CMV(Y)-activated expression of the PR-1 and PR-5 gene in the eds5 coi1 RCY1 plant. In contrast to the PR-1 and PR-5 genes, expression of the JA-dependent PLANT DEFENSIN 1.2 (PDF1.2) and HEVEIN-LIKE PROTEIN (HEL) genes was elevated in the CMV(Y)-inoculated leaves of the eds5 RCY1 plant, but not in the virus-inoculated leaves of the wild-type RCY1 and coi1 RCY1 plants. We propose that antagonistic interactions between the SA and JA signaling mechanisms modulate defense gene expression and the activation of RCY1-conferred gene-for-gene resistance to CMV(Y).
