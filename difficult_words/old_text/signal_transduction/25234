Activating mutants of ras are among the most frequently found genetic alterations in human cancers. Therefore, Ras appears to be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention using gene transfer. The protein kinase Raf-1 acts as a direct downstream effector of Ras and is involved in Ras-induced cellular transformation. Using the NIH3T3 fibroblast-derived tumor cell line PEJ, which expresses oncogenic Ha-rasG12V, we analyzed whether dominant negative mutants of Raf-1 can inhibit Ras-mediated transformation. Retroviral gene transfer was used to stably transduce PEJ cells with three different dominant negative mutants of Raf-1. This resulted in reversion of the transformed phenotype in vitro as evidenced by an increase in contact inhibition and reduced anchorage-independent growth. However, tumor formation in nude mice was significantly delayed only by one of these mutants. Therefore, dominant negative mutants of the oncoprotein Myc, which is known to synergize with Raf-1 in tumor formation, were transduced into PEJ cells expressing a dominant negative Raf mutant. This leads to killing of the cells. These results indicate that although interference with Ras-induced transformation using dominant negative mutants of Raf is feasible and effective in vitro using retroviral vectors, an additional block (e.g., that of Myc) is necessary to kill PEJ cells. These results also indicate that interference with Ras-dependent signaling is not sufficient for inhibition of tumor formation of PEJ cells in vivo.
