Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling is known to play an important role during cutaneous development. To elucidate the role of FGF10 during whisker formation, we examined the expression of Fgf10 in normal developing whiskers and phenotypes of Fgf10-deficient whiskers. Fgf10 is first expressed in the maxillary process, lateral and medial nasal processes, then in the mesenchymal cells underneath the future whisker placodes, and in the surrounding mesenchyme of developing whiskers. Fgf10-null whiskers exhibit a significant decrease in number and their structure is disorganized as revealed by scanning electron microscopy. Hair follicle marker genes such as Sonic hedgehog, Patched, and Patched 2 are aberrantly expressed in the mutant whiskers. Thus, FGF10 is required for proper whisker development mediated by SHH signaling in the mouse.
