Adhesion of fibroblasts to extracellular matrices via integrin receptors is accompanied by extensive cytoskeletal rearrangements and intracellular signaling events. The protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases has been implicated in several integrin-mediated events including focal adhesion formation, cell spreading, cell migration, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. However, the mechanism by which PKC regulates integrin function is not known. To characterize the role of PKC family kinases in mediating integrin-induced signaling, we monitored the effects of PKC inhibition on fibronectin-induced signaling events in Cos7 cells using pharmacological and genetic approaches. We found that inhibition of classical and novel isoforms of PKC by down-regulation with 12-0-tetradeconoyl-phorbol-13-acetate or overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of PKC significantly reduced extracellular regulated kinase 2 (Erk2) activation by fibronectin receptors in Cos7 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of constitutively active PKCalpha, PKCdelta, or PKCepsilon was sufficient to rescue 12-0-tetradeconoyl-phorbol-13-acetate-mediated down-regulation of Erk2 activation, and all three of these PKC isoforms were activated following adhesion. PKC was required for maximal activation of mitogen-activated kinase kinase 1, Raf-1, and Ras, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, and Shc association with Grb2. PKC inhibition does not appear to have a generalized effect on integrin signaling, because it does not block integrin-induced focal adhesion kinase or paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. These results indicate that PKC activity enhances Erk2 activation in response to fibronectin by stimulating the Erk/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway at an early step upstream of Shc.
