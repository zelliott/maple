Ageing causes a progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass that may lead to decreased strength and functionality. The term sarcopenia is especially used to characterise this geriatric syndrome. Numerous conditions and behaviours are considered to accelerate the progression of sarcopenia such as chronic diseases, malnutrition and physical inactivity. As people in modern countries are more and more sedentary, the impact of physical inactivity on the prevalence of sarcopenia might be more and more important in the future. In this review, we discuss how reactive oxygen species (ROS) could mediate the effects of lifelong inactivity in the onset and progression of age-related sarcopenia. Although the cellular mechanisms responsible for muscle ROS production are not necessarily the same, both inactivity and ageing are indeed known to increase basal ROS concentrations in skeletal muscle. New data and literature review are provided showing that chronic ROS overproduction induced by physical inactivity may exacerbate the activation of some redox-sensitive signalling pathways involved in age-related sarcopenia. We also address the scientific evidences implicating the role of ROS overproduction in the precocious failure of aged muscles to activate intracellular signalling responses to contractions.
