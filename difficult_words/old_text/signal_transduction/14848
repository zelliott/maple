This study demonstrates for the first time that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) increases H2O2 production in NIH3T3 fibroblasts through NADPH oxidase activation, confirming the involvement of phosphoinositide-3-kinase and protein kinase C in the activation of this enzyme in non-phagocyte mammalian cells. The results demonstrate also that both platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and S1P-mediated NADPH oxidase activation and H2O2 production by Gi-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and c-Src kinase. Moreover, both PDGF and S1P activate c-Src kinase through GPCRs, indicating that this kinase can constitute a connection factor between PDGF and S1P signaling, confirming the cross-talk previously found between their receptors. Thus, Gi-protein-mediated NADPH oxidase activation with the consequent H2O2 increase constitutes an early event in the PDGF and S1P pathways. However, a different time course of H2O2 production in S1P-stimulated cells compared to that obtained in PDGF-stimulated cells has been observed, and this seems to be related to the different activation behavior of c-Src kinase induced after S1P or PDGF stimulation. Finally, these data demonstrate that S1P-induced H2O2 production is necessary to maximize c-Src kinase activation, confirming that this is a redox regulated kinase. After which, c-Src plays an important role both upstream and downstream from NADPH oxidase activation.
