The phenotype of malignant epithelial cells in nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) results from latent infection by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) combined to cell gene alterations, especially those affecting the p16/Ink 4 gene. At the site of the primary tumor, NPC are strongly infiltrated by non-malignant EBV-negative T-lymphocytes. There are experimental clues suggesting that these lymphocytes are involved in tumor development, for example by providing anti-apoptotic signals to malignant epithelial cells. The amazing geographic distribution of NPC is accounted for by the conjunction of several risk factors in endemic regions. These risk factors are related to the diffusion of one or several susceptibility genes, the probable existence of viral strains with high oncogenic potential and non-viral environmental factors, especially dietary factors. The perspectives of immunotherapy in NPC are still unclear since viral proteins detected in tumors are poorly immunogenic (EBNA1, LMP1). Targeted molecules designed to interfere with viral and cellular oncoprotein signals will probably have interesting applications for the treatment of NPC.
