The central nervous dysfunctions of lethargy, fever and anorexia are manifestations of sepsis that seem to be mediated by increased cytokine production. Here we demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, an essential mediator of endotoxin-induced sepsis, prevents the proteasome-dependent degradation of RGS7, a regulator of G-protein signaling. The stabilization of RGS7 by TNF-alpha requires activation of the stress-activated protein kinase p38 and the presence of candidate mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation sites. In vivo, RGS7 is rapidly upregulated in mouse brain after exposure to either endotoxin or TNF-alpha, a response that is nearly abrogated in mice lacking TNF receptor 1. Our findings indicate that TNF-mediated upregulation of RGS7 may contribute to sepsis-induced changes in central nervous function.
