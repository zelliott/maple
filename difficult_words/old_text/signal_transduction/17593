Adenylate cyclase via production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) can transduce dual signals, positive and negative, on cell growth and differentiation. Such dual signals are transmitted by RI and RII cAMP-binding receptor proteins respectively, the regulatory subunits of cAMP dependent protein kinases. The growth stimulatory RI and inhibitory RII are in a strict balance to maintain normal cells, and departure from such balance can cause a great variety of human diseases, including cancer. Experimental approaches using site-selective cAMP analogues, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, and gene transfer have shown that restoration of the normal balance of RI/RII provides a biological means to the suppression of malignancy.
