Many G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulate the activity of multiple effectors. Yet, despite this apparent promiscuity, signaling in the context of differentiated cells is often highly specific. This specificity is attributable to the formation of cell-type-specific signaling complexes that are held together by scaffolding proteins, many of which contain one or more PDZ domains. Identifying the set of potential interactions among GPCRs, other signaling molecules and these scaffolding proteins is essential for understanding physiological signaling processes. A recent article describes an elegantly simple PDZ-domain array that can identify potential interacting partners of GPCRs and other signaling molecules.
