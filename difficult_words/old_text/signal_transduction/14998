Catalytically inactive pseudophosphatases are able to signal in the absence of enzymatic activity. Analyzing the oocyte-to-zygote transition in the worm, Cheng et al. (2009) and Parry et al. (2009) now show how two pseudophosphatases, EGG-4 and EGG-5, can regulate signaling by the DYRK family kinase MBK-2.
