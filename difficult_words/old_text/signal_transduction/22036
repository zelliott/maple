PRR [(pro)renin receptor] was named after its biological characteristics, namely the binding of renin and of its inactive precursor prorenin, that triggers intracellular signalling involving ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) 1/2. However the gene encoding for PRR is named ATP6ap2 (ATPase 6 accessory protein 2) because PRR was initially found as a truncated form co-purifying with V-ATPase (vacuolar H+-ATPase). There are now data showing that this interaction is not only physical, but also functional in the kidney and the heart. However, the newest and most fascinating development of PRR is its involvement in both the canonical Wnt/β-catenin and non-canonical Wnt/PCP (planar cell polarity) pathways, which are essential for adult and embryonic stem cell biology, embryonic development and disease, including cancer. In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, it has been shown that PRR acts as an adaptor between the Wnt receptor LRP5/6 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6) and Fz (frizzled) and that the proton gradient generated by the V-ATPase in endosomes is necessary for LRP5/6 phosphorylation and β-catenin activation. In the Wnt/PCP pathway, PRR binds to Fz and controls its asymetrical subcellular distribution and therefore the polarization of the cells in a plane of a tissue. These essential cellular functions of PRR are independent of renin and open new avenues on the pathophysiological role of PRR. The present review will summarize our knowledge of (pro)renin-dependent functions of PRR and will discuss the newly recognized functions of PRR related to the V-ATPase and to Wnt signalling.
