Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) have become the preferred source of stem cells for autologous transplantation because of the technical advantage and the shorter time to engraftment. Mobilization of CD34+ into the peripheral blood can be achieved by the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or both, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. G-CSF and GM-CSF differ somewhat in the number and composition of PBSCs and effector cells mobilized to the peripheral blood. The purpose of this review is to give a recent update on the type and immunologic properties of CD34+ cells and CD34+ cell subsets mobilized by G-CSF or GM-CSF with emphasis on (1) relative efficacy of CD34+ cell mobilization; (2) relative toxicities of G-CSF and GM-CSF as mobilizing agents; (3) mobilization of dendritic cells and their subsets; (4) delineation of the role of adhesion molecules, CXC receptor 4, and stromal cell-derived factor-1 signaling pathway in the release of CD34+ cell to the peripheral blood after treatment with G-CSF or GM-CSF.
