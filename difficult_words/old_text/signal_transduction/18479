Human placentae from normal and pre-eclamptic pregnancies were evaluated for possible changes in gene expression by microarray analysis to uncover new clues for the research of the etiology of pre-eclampsia.

Placentae from five normal pregnancies and five pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia were collected. mRNA levels of five pre-eclamptic placentae were examined using genome-wide 70-mer oligonucleotide microarrays (CapitalBio, Beijing, China) in comparison with the pooled control consisting of total RNA from five normotensive placentae.

Ninety-six genes were found consistently down- or up-regulated in at least four pre-eclamptic samples. Most of them were related to an imbalance of reactive oxygen metabolites in placenta, abnormal trophoblast invasion, disorders of lipoprotein metabolism and signal transduction, or some that have been reported to have close correlation to the pathology of pre-eclampsia. The microarray data were also confirmed by the measurement of real-time PCR.

DNA microarray is a high throughput and time-saving method to monitor altered gene expression. The results could provide interesting clues to the etiology of pre-eclampsia and lead to further studies in a more targeted fashion.
