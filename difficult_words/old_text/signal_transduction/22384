Overexpression of selenoprotein H (SelH) gene provides neuroprotection in neurons against UVB-induced cell death by blocking the mitochondrial-initiated apoptotic cell death pathway. This study examined the effects of SelH on mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function. The results demonstrated that overexpression of SelH gene in neuronal HT22 cells significantly increased the levels of mitochondrial biogenesis regulators, nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam). Mitochondrial cytochrome c content was elevated, mass was increased and respiration was enhanced. SelH transfection ameliorated ultra violet B (UVB)-induced suppression of mitochondrial biogenesis markers and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Overexpression of SelH promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and improves mitochondrial functional performance.
