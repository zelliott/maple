The platelet surface membrane possesses three P2 receptors activated by extracellular adenosine nucleotides; one member of the ionotropic receptor family (P2X(1)) and two members of the G-protein-coupled receptor family (P2Y(1) and P2Y(12)). P2Y(1) and P2Y(12) receptors have firmly established roles in platelet activation during thrombosis and haemostasis, whereas the importance of the P2X(1) receptor has been more controversial. However, recent studies have demonstrated that P2X(1) receptors can generate significant functional platelet responses alone and in synergy with other receptor pathways. In addition, studies in transgenic animals indicate an important role for P2X(1) receptors in platelet activation, particularly under conditions of shear stress and thus during arterial thrombosis. This review discusses the background behind discovery of P2X(1) receptors in platelets and their precursor cell, the megakaryocyte, and how signalling via these ion channels may participate in platelet activation.
