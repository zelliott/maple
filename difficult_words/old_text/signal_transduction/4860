Many GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) can activate RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases) in the absence of RTK ligands, a phenomenon called transactivation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain undefined. In the present study we investigate the molecular basis of GABA(B) (Î³-aminobutyric acid B) receptor-mediated transactivation of IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor type I receptor) in primary neurons. We take a chemical biology approach by developing an activity-based probe targeting the GABA(B) receptor. This probe enables us first to lock the GABA(B) receptor in an inactive state and then activate it with a positive allosteric modulator, thereby permitting monitoring of the dynamic of the protein complex associated with IGF-1R transactivation. We find that activation of the GABA(B) receptor induces a dynamic assembly and disassembly of a protein complex, including both receptors and their downstream effectors. FAK (focal adhesion kinase), a non-RTK, plays a key role in co-ordinating this dynamic process. Importantly, this dynamic of the GABA(B) receptor-associated complex is critical for transactivation and transactivation-dependent neuronal survival. The present study has identified an important mechanism underlying GPCR transactivation of RTKs, which was enabled by a new chemical biology tool generally applicable for dissecting GPCR signalling.
