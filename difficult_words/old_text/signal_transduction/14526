The CD95 and TRAIL death receptors can potently stimulate proinflammatory signalling, especially in apoptosis resistant cells. Here, we show that caspases are of cell type-specific relevance for non-apoptotic death receptor signalling in pancreatic tumour cells. Inhibition of caspases by zVAD-fmk strongly enhanced the proinflammatory response in PancTuI, BxPc3 and Panc89 cells, but inhibited this response in Colo357 cells as well as in apoptosis-resistant Colo357-BclxL cells overexpressing BclxL. To characterize the role of caspases in non-apoptotic death receptor signalling, we analysed CD95L- and TRAIL-induced signalling pathways in Colo357-BclxL cells in comparison with PancTuI cells. Both death ligands induced NFkappaB, ERKs, JNK and p38 in Colo357-BclxL cells and except for ERKs also in PancTuI cells. However, inhibition of caspases with zVAD-fmk resulted in strong inhibition of all these signalling pathways in Colo357-BclxL, but enhanced NFkappaB and JNK signalling in PancTuI cells. Caspase-mediated activation of NFkappaB and ERKs were involved in CD95L- and TRAIL-induced up-regulation of proinflammatory genes in Colo357-BclxL cells. At the level of the DISC we did not observe any significant differences in recruitment or processing of FADD, caspase-8, FLIP, TRAF2 and RIP between PancTuI and Colo357-BclxL cells. Consequently, an NFkappaB and ERK stimulating, caspase-dependent factor must operate downstream of the DISC in Colo357-BclxL cells.
