The treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) has recently witnessed the introduction of molecularly targeted agents based on disease biology, target discovery, and validation. One class of agents, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, is currently in phase III trials. There are multiple processes, however, that appear to be suitable for targeted therapy beyond EGFR. These include signal transduction, cell cycle control, prostaglandin synthesis, protein degradation, hypoxia, and angiogenesis. These systems and specific protein targets will be reviewed in detail with emphasis on promising preclinical and early clinical evidence of activity.
