Insulin and growth hormone (GH) induce mitogenic and metabolic signals in cells, GH either directly or indirectly via IGF-I production. We have studied a spontaneous murine T-cell lymphoma (LB cells) devoid of IGF-1 receptors in which proliferation is maintained by insulin [Int. J. Cancer 50 (1992) 80], and show that GH is more potent than insulin, with both GH and insulin dose-response curves for thymidine incorporation being bell-shaped. Binding showed somatogenic rather than lactogenic GH receptors. Insulin stimulated phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and of a 160-kDa protein, identified as the IRS-4 protein. This phosphorylated IRS-4 associated with PI3-kinase, which was activated along with the downstream p70(S6) kinase, whereas the Ras-MAPK pathway was not. Using selective inhibitors, the PI3-kinase, but not p70(S6) kinase or MEK, was found to be involved in insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis. GH induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-4 and nuclear translocation of STAT5. The LB cells constitute a new model for studying GH and insulin signalling without interference of IGF-1 receptors.
