Mineralized tissues that are protective scaffolds in the most primitive species have evolved and acquired more specific functions in modern animals. These are as diverse as support in locomotion, ion homeostasis, and precise hormonal regulation. Bone formation is tightly controlled by a balance between anabolism, in which osteoblasts are the main players, and catabolism mediated by the osteoclasts. The bone matrix is deposited in a cyclic fashion during homeostasis and integrates several environmental cues. These include diffusible elements that would include estrogen or growth factors and physicochemical parameters such as bone matrix composition, stiffness, and mechanical stress. Therefore, the microenvironment is of paramount importance for controlling this delicate equilibrium. Here, we provide an overview of the most recent data highlighting the role of cell-adhesion molecules during bone formation. Due to the very large scope of the topic, we focus mainly on the role of the integrin receptor family during osteogenesis. Bone phenotypes of some deficient mice as well as diseases of human bones involving cell adhesion during this process are discussed in the context of bone physiology.
