The fully-grown oocyte is transcriptionally inactive. Therefore, translational and post-translational modifications furnish the control mechanism of key components governing meiosis. Regulation by protein synthesis provides an irreversible unidirectional mechanism for an extended period that can be restricted by a complementary degradation of the same protein. Both processes utilize tight measures to ensure precise expression at the right time in the right place. Rapid modifications such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation supply reversible means to regulate protein action. Information regarding these extremely exciting issues is being accumulated recently in an exponential rate. However, the vast majority of these data is generated from studies conducted on Xenopus oocytes. We fully agree with Andrew Murray's statement that "The modern trend of promoting research on a small number of 'model' organisms will eventually deprive us of the opportunity to study interesting biology" [Cell 92 (1992) 157]. Thus, despite of the enormous technical difficulties resulting from the limited availability of biological material we extended our interest to mammalian model systems. Our review will attend to certain examples of such modifications in the regulatory pathway of meiosis in mammalian oocytes.
