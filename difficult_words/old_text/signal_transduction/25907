Although the flavonoid icariside II exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities, its molecular targets/pathways in human multiple myeloma cells are poorly understood. To analyze the effects on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling and apoptosis, U266 multiple myeloma cells were treated with icariside II and performed Western blotting, electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay (EMSA), RT-PCR, proliferation assay, cell cycle analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Icariside II inhibited STAT3 activation and enhanced the expression of SHP-1 and PTEN through inhibiting Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2) and c-Src. Icariside II down-regulated the expression of STAT3 target genes Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), survivin, cyclin D(1), COX-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Also, icariside II enhanced poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and caspase-3 activation. Pervanadate reversed the icariside II-mediated STAT3 inactivation and also blocked the cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP, suggesting involvement of STAT3 pathway in icariside II-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, icariside II enhanced the apoptotic effects of clinically used drugs thalidomide and bortezomib in U266 cells. Icariside II could be a potential therapeutic intervention agent alone or in combination with current drugs for multiple myeloma as a novel blocker of STAT3 signaling cascades at multiple levels, contributing to its anti-proliferative and anti-apoptosis.
