Rapid signaling of estrogen involves membrane estrogen receptors (ERs), including membrane subpopulations of ERα and ERβ. In the mid-1990s, several laboratories independently reported the cloning of an orphan G protein-coupled receptor from vascular and cancer cells that was named GPR30. Research published between 2000 and 2005 provided evidence that GPR30 binds and signals via estrogen indicating that this intracellular receptor is involved in rapid, non-genomic estrogen signaling. The receptor has since been designated as the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) by the International Union of Pharmacology. The availability of genetic tools such as different lines of GPER knock-out mice, as well as GPER-selective agonists and antagonists has advanced our understanding, but also added some confusion about the new function of this receptor. GPER not only binds estrogens but also other substances, including SERMs, SERDs, and environmental ER activators (endocrine disruptors; xenoestrogens) and also interacts with other proteins. This article represents a summary of a lecture given at the 7(th) International Meeting on Rapid Responses to Steroid Hormones in September 2011 in Axos, Crete, and reviews the current knowledge and questions about GPER-dependent signaling and function. Controversies that have complicated our understanding of GPER, including interactions with human ERα-36 and aldosterone as a potential ligand, will also be discussed.
