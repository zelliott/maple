In response to K+ availability or medium osmolality, the sensor kinase KdpD and the response regulator KdpE control the expression of the kdpFABC operon, coding for the high affinity K+-translocating Kdp ATPase of Escherichia coli. The stimulus for KdpD to undergo autophosphorylation is believed to be a change in turgor or some effect thereof, reflecting the role of K+ as an important cytoplasmic osmotic solute. The membrane-bound sensor kinase KdpD was overproduced as a fusion protein containing six contiguous histidine residues two amino acids before the C terminus. This KdpD-His6 protein was functional in vitro and in vivo. KdpD-His6 was purified from everted membrane vesicles by solubilization with the zwitterionic detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide followed by nickel chelate chromatography and ion exchange chromatography to >99% homogeneity. The solubilized protein was not active with respect to autophosphorylation, but retained the ability to bind 2-azido-ATP. KdpD-His6 was reconstituted into proteoliposomes in a unidirectional inside-out orientation as revealed by ATP accessibility and protease susceptibility. Purified and reconstituted KdpD-His6 exhibited autokinase activity, and the phosphoryl group could be transferred to KdpE. Furthermore, KdpD-His6 was found to be the only protein that mediates dephosphorylation of KdpE approximately P.
