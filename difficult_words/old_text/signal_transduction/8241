PML is a tumour suppressor inactivated in Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia (APL). PML is the essential component of a subnuclear structure called the PML nuclear body (PML-NB), which is disrupted in APL. By targeting different cellular proteins to this structure, PML can either hamper or potentiate their functions. The PML transcript undergoes alternative splicing to generate both nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms. Most of the research in this field has focused its attention on studying nuclear PML. Nevertheless, new exciting studies show that cytoplasmic PML may control essential cellular functions, thus opening new avenues for investigation.
