Monocyte Chemoattractant Proteins (MCPs) form a distinct, structurally-related subclass of CC chemokines. They are major chemoattractants for monocytes and T lymphocytes. The MCPs bind to specific G-protein-coupled receptors, initiating a signal cascade within the cell. Though the signal transduction pathways involved in MCP-1-mediated chemotaxis have been studied, the signalling pathways through which MCP-2, -3 and -4 trigger cell migration are not established. In this study, we examined the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation elicited by the MCPs (1-4) and its specific role in chemotaxis. Within 2 min, the MCPs (1-4) elicited a rapid and transient activation of MAPK in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in HEK-293 cells expressing CCR2b. U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK-kinase (MEK) activation, not only prevented extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation but also significantly inhibited the MCP-mediated chemotaxis. PI3K inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002 also partially inhibited the MCP-induced chemotaxis. However, these compounds did not significantly inhibit ERK1/2 activation. As PI3K inhibitors partially inhibit the MCP-mediated chemotaxis but do not significantly effect ERK1/2 activation, these data suggest that co-ordinated action of distinct signal pathways is required to produce chemokine-mediated chemotaxis.
