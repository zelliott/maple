Studies of mate choice in vertebrates have focused principally on birds, in which male ornaments are often highly developed, and have shown that females commonly select mates on the basis of particular phenotypic characteristics that may reflect their genetic quality. Studies of female mate choice in mammals are less highly developed and they have commonly focused on female mating preferences that are likely to be maintained by benefits to the female's own survival or breeding success. However, recent experimental studies of mate choice in mammals--especially rodents--provide increasing evidence of consistent female preferences that appear likely to generate benefits to the fitness of offspring. As yet, there is no compelling evidence that female mating preferences are less highly developed in female mammals than in female birds, although these preferences may more often be masked by the effects of male competition or of attempts by males to constrain female choice.
