The mechanism(s) regulating the expression of the TBX2 gene, a key regulator of development, is poorly understood and thus limits an understanding of its function(s). Here we demonstrate that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces TBX2 expression in normal human fibroblasts in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent and MAPK-independent manner. Our data further reveal that TPA activates transcription of TBX2 through activating MSK1, which leads to an increase in phosphorylated histone H3 and the recruitment of Sp1 to the TBX2 gene. In addition, TPA was shown to activate MSK1 in a PKC-dependent and MAPK-independent manner. This study is the first to provide evidence that phosphorylation of histone H3 leads to the transcriptional activation of the TBX2 gene and to link MSK1 to PKC.
