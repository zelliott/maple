Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men and is often associated with bone metastases. Prostate cancer bone lesions can be lytic or schlerotic, with the latter predominating. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a family of growth factors, which may play a role in the formation of prostate cancer osteoblastic bone metastases. This study evaluated the effects of BMPs on prostate cancer cell lines. We observed growth inhibitory effects of BMP-2 and -4 on LNCaP, while PC-3 was unaffected. Flow cytometric analysis determined that LNCaP cell growth was arrested in G(1) after bone morphogenetic protein-2 treatment. Treatment of LNCaP and PC-3 with BMP-2 and -4 activated downstream signaling pathways involving SMAD-1, up-regulation of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and changes in retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation. Interestingly, bone morphogenetic protein-2 treatment stimulated a 2.7-fold increase in osteoprotegerin (OPG), a molecule, which inhibits osteoclastogenesis, production in PC-3.
