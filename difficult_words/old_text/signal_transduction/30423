Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) form a conserved superfamily of eukaryotic serine/threonine protein kinases which require binding to a regulatory cyclin for activity. CDKs are organized in several gene families and are involved in different aspects of cell biology, such as gene transcription, cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we present the characteristics of the rice C-type CDK gene, Orysa;CDKC;1. The gene was expressed in all organs of the plant and relatively high amounts of its transcript were detected in mature leaves and panicles. This indicated a putative role during later stages of leaf and panicle development. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified Orysa;CYCT as an interactor with Orysa;CDKC;1. The expression profiles of the new Orysa;CDKC;1 in response to various factors from rice cells were compared with those of previously described Orysa;CDKA;1, and Orysa;CDKB2;1. The Orysa;CDKC;1 transcript was induced by salt stress and ABA treatments, but was unaffected by mannitol. In addition, the MBP kinase activity associated with Orysa;CDKC;1 immunocomplexes was induced under salt stress. We propose that Orysa;CDKC;1 may be involved in developmental programs, as well as in the salt- and ABA-signaling pathway.
