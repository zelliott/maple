Quercetin is a flavonoid molecule ubiquitous in nature and functions as an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agent with little toxicity in vivo and in vitro. Dose- and time-dependent effect of quercetin has been investigated on proinflammatory cytokine expression and NO production, focusing on its effects on the MAP kinases and the NF-kappaB signal transduction pathways in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells by using RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Quercetin strongly reduced activation of phosphorylated ERK kinase and p38 MAP kinase but not JNK MAP kinase by LPS treatment. In addition, quercetin treatment inhibited NF-kappaB activation through stabilization of the NF-kappaB/IkappaB complex and IkappaB degradation and proinflammatory cytokines and NO/iNOS expression. Quercetin may exert its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in the effect molecules such as proinflammatory cytokines and NO/iNOS by suppressing the activation of ERK and p38 MAP kinase, and NF-kappaB/IkappaB signal transduction pathways.
