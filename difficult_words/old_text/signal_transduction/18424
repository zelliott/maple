Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. Although its role in neurons has been studied extensively, little is known about its function in astrocytes. We studied the effects of glutamate on signaling pathways in primary astrocytes. We found that the tyrosine kinase related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to glutamate in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This phosphorylation was pertussis toxin (PTX) sensitive and could be attenuated by the depletion of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. RAFTK tyrosine phosphorylation was mediated primarily by class I/II metabotropic glutamate receptors and depends on protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Glutamate treatment of primary astrocytes also results in a significant increase in the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinases [extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2)]. Like RAFTK phosphorylation, ERK1/2 activation is PTX sensitive and can be attenuated by the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ and by PKC inhibition, suggesting that RAFTK might mediate the glutamate-dependent activation of ERK1/2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that glutamate stimulation of primary astrocytes leads to a significant increase in DNA synthesis. Glutamate-stimulated DNA synthesis is PTX sensitive and can be inhibited by the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that in primary astrocytes, glutamate might signal via RAFTK and MAP kinase to promote DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.
