Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a pluripotent growth and permeability factor that has a broad impact on endothelial cell function. The lung tissue is very rich in this protein; many different lung cells produce VEGF and also respond to VEGF. VEGF is critical for the development of the lung and serves as a maintenance factor during adult life. In addition to the physiological functions of this protein, there is increasing evidence that VEGF also plays a role in several acute and chronic lung diseases, such as acute lung injury, severe pulmonary hypertension, and emphysema. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding literature.
