The CC-chemokine receptor CCR5 mediates fusion and entry of the most commonly transmitted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains. We have isolated six new anti-CCR5 murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), designated PA8, PA9, PA10, PA11, PA12, and PA14. A panel of CCR5 alanine point mutants was used to map the epitopes of these MAbs and the previously described MAb 2D7 to specific amino acid residues in the N terminus and/or second extracellular loop regions of CCR5. This structural information was correlated with the MAbs' abilities to inhibit (i) HIV-1 entry, (ii) HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion, (iii) gp120 binding to CCR5, and (iv) CC-chemokine activity. Surprisingly, there was no correlation between the ability of a MAb to inhibit HIV-1 fusion-entry and its ability to inhibit either the binding of a gp120-soluble CD4 complex to CCR5 or CC-chemokine activity. MAbs PA9 to PA12, whose epitopes include residues in the CCR5 N terminus, strongly inhibited gp120 binding but only moderately inhibited HIV-1 fusion and entry and had no effect on RANTES-induced calcium mobilization. MAbs PA14 and 2D7, the most potent inhibitors of HIV-1 entry and fusion, were less effective at inhibiting gp120 binding and were variably potent at inhibiting RANTES-induced signaling. With respect to inhibiting HIV-1 entry and fusion, PA12 but not PA14 was potently synergistic when used in combination with 2D7, RANTES, and CD4-immunoglobulin G2, which inhibits HIV-1 attachment. The data support a model wherein HIV-1 entry occurs in three stages: receptor (CD4) binding, coreceptor (CCR5) binding, and coreceptor-mediated membrane fusion. The antibodies described will be useful for further dissecting these events.
