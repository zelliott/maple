Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is a potent mitogen and chemoattractant for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). To understand its mitogenic and chemotactic signaling events, we studied the role of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) and the Jak/STAT pathway. PDGF-BB induced the expression and activity of cPLA(2) in a time-dependent manner in VSMC. Arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone, a potent and specific inhibitor of cPLA(2), significantly reduced PDGF-BB-induced arachidonic acid release and DNA synthesis. PDGF-BB stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2 in a time-dependent manner. In addition, PDGF-BB activated STAT-3 as determined by its tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA-binding activity, and reporter gene expression, and these responses were suppressed by AG490, a selective inhibitor of Jak-2. AG490 and a dominant-negative mutant of STAT-3 also attenuated PDGF-BB-induced expression of cPLA(2,) arachidonic acid release, and DNA synthesis in VSMC. Together, these results suggest that induction of expression of cPLA(2) and arachidonic acid release are involved in VSMC growth in response to PDGF-BB and that these events are mediated by Jak-2-dependent STAT-3 activation.
