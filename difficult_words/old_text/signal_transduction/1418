Activation of a variety of cell surface receptors results in the phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of the minor plasma membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, with concomitant formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. There is strong evidence that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate stimulates Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The Ca2+-releasing actions of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate are terminated by its metabolism through two distinct pathways. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is dephosphorylated by a 5-phosphatase to inositol 1,4-bisphosphate; alternatively, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate can also be phosphorylated to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate by a 3-kinase. Although the mechanism of Ca2+ mobilization is understood, the precise mechanisms involved in Ca2+ entry are not known; the proposal that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate secondarily elicits Ca2+ entry by emptying an intracellular Ca2+ pool is considered.
