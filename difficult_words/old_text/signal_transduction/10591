Crustacean growth and development is characterized by periodic shedding (ecdysis) and replacement of the rigid exoskeleton. Secretions of the X-organ sinus gland complex control the cellular events that lead to growth and molting. Western blot and ELISA results showed a progressive increase in growth arrest-specific protein (Gas7) from early postmolt stage to a maximum at late postmolt stage. Phosphorylation of ERK2, a downstream signaling protein, was also identified in the subsequent stages. ERK2 phosphorylation resulted in the expression of molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH). Specific ERK inhibitors (PD98059 and UO126) exhibited the ability to reduce the molting duration of Fenneropenaeus indicus from 12-14 days to 7-8 days, suggesting that the ERK1/2 signaling pathway is responsible for the expression of MIH, which controls the molt cycle. We have identified the stage-specific expression of Gas7 (approximately 48 kDa) in the X-organ sinus gland complex of eyestalk which is involved in the downstream signaling of the ERK1/2 pathway regulating the expression of MIH during the molt cycle of the white shrimp, F. indicus. These are the first data showing an association between the Gas7 signal-transduction process and regulation of the molt cycle and provides an alternative molecular intervention mechanism to the traditional eyestalk ablation in crustaceans.
