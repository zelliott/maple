As pathogenic microorganisms establish an infection, they must be able to sense host-specific signals and respond by elaborating determinants that allow for survival in these hostile conditions. Pathogen cell surface proteins detect these signals and activate signal transduction cascades that ultimately alter gene expression resulting in an adaptive cellular response. Here we review the mechanisms by which a pathogenic fungus uses the highly conserved cAMP signal transduction pathway to regulate cellular differentiation as well as its virulence potential.
