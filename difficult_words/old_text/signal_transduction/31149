Exogenous glucose delays seed germination in Arabidopsis thaliana not only in wild type (WT), but also in a number of mutants in hormone signalling pathways. This study demonstrates that the ABA Insensitive 3 (ABI3) gene in the ABA signalling pathway and the RGA-like 2 (RGL2) and SPINDLY (SPY) genes in the GA signalling pathways all play important roles in the glucose-induced delay of seed germination. Transcription of the ABI3 and RGL2 genes is up-regulated by glucose. This study also supports the idea that different sugars such as the hexose stereoisomers, glucose, and mannose, delay or inhibit seed germination via different branches of the hormone signalling pathways. Analysis of post-germination seedling development of wild-type plants indicates that exogenous glucose supplied after germination may have a concentration-dependent stimulatory effect on root and shoot growth. Comparison of WT and spy seedling growth on different glucose concentrations suggests that the stimulatory effect of glucose is partially exerted via the GA or cytokinin signalling pathways. The effects of glucose on plant growth and development may be stimulatory or inhibitory depending on the developmental stage. The inhibitory effect on seed germination seems to be accomplished via the activation of the ABA signalling pathway, through ABI3, and inactivation of the GA signalling pathway through RGL2 and SPY. On the other hand, the stimulatory effect of glucose on seedling growth may involve the GA and/or cytokinin signalling pathways.
