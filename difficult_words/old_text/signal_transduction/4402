The first stage in signal transduction in platelets is interaction between the agonist (or adhesive protein) and its receptor. Changes in conformation or clustering induced by binding activate signalling on the cytoplasmic side of the platelet membrane. Platelets contain several families of receptors such as the leucine rich repeat group, GPIb-V-IX, involved in adhesion to von Willebrand factor and modulation of the thrombin response. Platelet integrins include GPIIb-IIIa (alpha IIb beta 3), the receptor for fibrinogen and the major mediator of aggregation, which is also a critical signal transducer both inside-out and outside-in to modulate primary signals. Molecules implicated as collagen receptors include the integrin alpha 2 beta 1, CD36 and GPVI and involve a novel signalling pathway. Many seven transmembrane receptors have been identified; current interest is in the proteolytic and purinergic families.
