We previously reported that the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica expresses at least three G-protein alpha subunits and that Galpha subunit CPG-1 is essential for regulated growth, pigmentation, sporulation, and virulence. We now report the cloning and characterization of a C. parasitica regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein, CPRGS-1. The phylogenetic relationship of CPRGS-1 to orthologs from other fungi was inferred and found to be generally concordant with species relationships based on 18S ribosomal sequences and on morphology. However, Hemiascomycotine RGS branch lengths in particular were longer than for their 18S sequence counterparts, which correlates with functional diversification in the signaling pathway. Deletion of cprgs-1 resulted in reduced growth, sparse aerial mycelium, and loss of pigmentation, sporulation, and virulence. Disruption of cprgs-1 was also accompanied by a severe posttranscriptional reduction in accumulation of CPG-1 and Gbeta subunit CPGB-1 and severely reduced expression of the hydrophobin-encoding gene cryparin. The changes in phenotype, cryparin expression, and CPGB-1 accumulation resulting from cprgs-1 gene deletion were also observed in a strain containing a mutationally activated copy of CPG-1 but not in strains containing constitutively activated mutant alleles of the other two identified Galpha subunits, CPG-2 and CPG-3. Furthermore, cprgs-1 transcript levels were increased in the activated CPG-1 strain but were unaltered in activated CPG-2 and CPG-3 strains. The results strongly suggest that CPRGS-1 is involved in regulation of Galpha subunit CPG-1-mediated signaling and establish a role for a RGS protein in the modulation of virulence, conidiation, and hydrophobin synthesis in a plant pathogenic fungus.
