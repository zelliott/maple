Coumarin (1,2-benzopyrone) is a naturally occurring fragrant compound found in a variety of plants and spices. Coumarins have attracted intense interest in recent years because of their diverse pharmacological activities. This study examines the antioxidant coumarin 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin (DAMC) and its thiocoumarin derivative 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylthiocoumarin (DAMTC) for their effect on human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells. Here we show that both DAMC and DAMTC not only inhibited cell proliferation, but also induced apoptosis with an IC(50) of 160 microg/ml as confirmed by morphological examination, annexin-V assay and flow cytometric analysis. Interestingly, it was observed that these two coumarin compounds exhibited little cytotoxicity towards peripheral blood mononuclear cells but induced apoptosis in malignant cells. DAMC/DAMTC treatment also resulted in pronounced release of apoptogenic cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol, alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Although an increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed, pre-treatment with antioxidant showed no protective effect against DAMC/DAMTC-induced apoptosis. Results of present study suggest that downregulation of Bcl-xl, Cox-2 and mitogen activated protein kinase pathway and upregulation of p53, Akt and NF-kappaB pathway are involved in the underlying molecular mechanism of apoptosis induction by DAMC and DAMTC in A549 cells.
