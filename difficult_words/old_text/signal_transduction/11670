Stem cell factor is an essential haemopoietic progenitor cell growth factor with proliferative and anti-apoptotic functions. Molecular biologists have now dissected some of the various pathways through which this cytokine signals to the nucleus. At the same time, new molecules have become available which can inhibit SCF signalling. This provides an exciting prospect for the treatment of Kit+ malignancies such as acute myeloblastic leukaemia. The capacity of SCF to synergize with other cytokines has been exploited in the ex vivo expansion of haemopoietic progenitors and dendritic cells, which may also hold therapeutic promise. In this review the last 5 years' literature on these issues is reviewed and collated.
