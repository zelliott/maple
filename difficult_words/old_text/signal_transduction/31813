Zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70) is a tyrosine kinase that plays a role in signal transduction from the T-cell receptor. ZAP-70 is expressed in normal T-cells and NK-cells. Increased expression of ZAP-70 has been identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL patients  with increased ZAP-70 expression have significantly worse prognosis in terms of both progression-free survival and overall survival. There are several methods to quantify ZAP-70: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. Use of flow cytometry  for ZAP-70 detection seems to be advantageous as this technique enables us to assess the presence of ZAP-70 separately on CLL clone, T-cells, and NK-cells. On the other hand, detection of ZAP-70 by flow cytometry is substantially influenced by many variables. The principal drawback of flow  cytometry is the absence of consensus regarding selection of optimal anti-ZAP-70 antibody, fluorochrome conjugate, the most reliable staining technique, and optimal positivity threshold. This article summarizes pitfalls of flow cytometric analysis of ZAP-70 in CLL.
