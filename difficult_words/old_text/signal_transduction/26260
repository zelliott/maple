SPHK1 expression is elevated in gastric cancer and is associated with shorter survival times for patients. However, the molecular mechanism of SPHK1 up-regulation in gastric cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we report that miR-124 down-regulated SPHK1 expression by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and that miR-124 expression was inversely correlated with SPHK1 expression in gastric cancer samples. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, similar to the effect of silencing SPHK1, up-regulation of miR-124 markedly inhibited proliferation and tumourigenicity of gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. This was found to be mechanistically associated with induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21$^{{\rm Cip1}}$ and p27$^{{\rm Kip1}}$, enhancement of the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 and suppression of AKT activity. Moreover, we showed that the re-introduction of SPHK1 (without the 3'-UTR), but not with the 3'-UTR, could abrogate the miR-124-mediated induction of p21$^{{\rm Cip1}}$ and p27$^{{\rm Kip1}}$, as well as rescue the miR-124-induced proliferation inhibition. Together, these results suggest that miR-124 has an important role in the suppression of gastric cancer and presents a novel mechanism of miRNA-mediated SPHK1 expression in cancer cells.
