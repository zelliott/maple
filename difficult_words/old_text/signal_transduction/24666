Transduction of a visual signal is a complex process. It involves photochemical, enzymatic and ionic reactions. An electrophysiological response is generated on absorption of a photon by a photoreceptor cell's pigment molecule, then propagates to the synapses. The first photochemical reaction, isomerization of retinal, in vertebrates occurs in the photoreceptor cells--rods and cones--of the retina, so changes conformation and activity of a pigment-bound protein, rhodopsin, in membranes of intracellular discs. Rhodopsin becomes enzymatically active and catalyses the activation by GTP of a great number of transducins, which in turn activate cGMP phosphodiesterase. This enzymatic chain propagates and greatly enhances hydrolysis of cytoplasmic cGMP. One photon incites hydrolysis of 10(5) cGMP molecules in 100 ms. Local cGMP decrease frees it from specific binding sites in cytoplasm occupied by proteinaceous canals in cell membrane around the activated disc. In darkness high cGMP concentration, hence binding, kept canals open, maintaining high cellular cation permeability, especially to Na+, and a strong cellular depolarization. Ca2+ influx, also allowed, balanced Na+ movement. Canal closure induces local hyperpolarization, the first electrophysiological response, which propagates through the cell to synaptic contacts. It also lowers intracellular Ca2+ concentration which initiates cGMP synthesis--from GTP by a guanylate cyclase controlled negatively by recoverin, a calcium-dependent protein--to restore cGMP towards at rest level. Although all macromolecules involved in this now fairly complete scheme have been isolated and characterized, cloned and sequenced, no three-dimensional structure has yet been established. The proteins are membrane-bound rather than in independent crystal form, which renders such structural studies difficult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
