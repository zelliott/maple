Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) is one of the most potent regulators of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. R-Smads (Smads 1/5/8) are the major transducers for BMPs receptors and, once activated, they are translocated in the nucleus regulating transcription target genes by interacting with various transcription factors. Runx-2 proteins have been shown to interact through their C-terminal segment with Smads and this interaction is required for in vivo osteogenesis. In particular, recruitment of Smads to intranuclear sites is Runx-2 dependent, and Runx-2 factor may accommodate the dynamic targeting of signal transducer to active transcription sites. Previously, we have shown, by in vitro and in vivo experiments, that BMP-2 up-regulated FGF-2 which is important for the maximal responses of BMP-2 in bone. In this study, we found that endogenous FGF2 is necessary for BMP-2 induced nuclear accumulation and co-localization of Runx-2 and phospho-Smads1/5/8, while Runx/Smads nuclear accumulation and co-localization was reduced in Fgf2-/- osteoblasts. Based on these novel data, we conclude that the impaired nuclear accumulation of Runx-2 in Fgf2-/- osteoblasts reduces R-Smads sub-nuclear targeting with a consequent decreased expression of differentiating markers and impaired bone formation in Fgf2 null mice.
