The plant hormone auxin is central in the regulation of growth and development, however, the molecular basis for its action has remained enigmatic. In the absence of a molecular model, the wide range of responses elicited by auxin have been difficult to explain. Recent advances using molecular genetic approaches in Arabidopsis have led to the isolation of a number of key genes involved in auxin action. Of particular importance are genes involved in channelling polar auxin transport through the plant. In addition a model for auxin signal transduction, centred on regulated protein degradation, has been developed.
