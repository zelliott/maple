A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12) is known to function as a scaffold protein and as a putative tumor suppressor. However, little is known about the biological role of AKAP12 in hepatic cells. In this study, we performed micro-array analysis to identify the downstream pathway of AKAP12A, and found that AKAP12A overexpression up-regulates the expressions of several cholesterol-associated genes including HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor, which have been reported to be controlled by sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). It was found that AKAP12A activates SREBP-2 in hepatic cells, as demonstrated by the presence of its cleavage product, whereas the activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 was not remarkably changed. Moreover, AKAP12A-induced SREBP-2 activation was found to depend on SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), as inhibition of SCAP by RNAi or sterols blocked SREBP-2 activation in response to AKAP12A overexpression. Interestingly, the hydrophobic amine U18666A caused dramatic movement of AKAP12A from the plasma membrane to cytosol and lysosomal membranes. Moreover, cholesterol depletion from the plasma membrane (using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin) caused a shift of AKAP12A from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. Cholesterol binding assay revealed that the N-terminal region of AKAP12A binds directly to cholesterol in vitro. Furthermore, AKAP12A overexpression enhanced [3H]-cholesterol efflux to extracellular acceptors, suggesting that AKAP12A may activate SREBP-2 by increasing cholesterol efflux. In conclusion, the present study suggests that AKAP12A is a novel regulator of cellular cholesterol metabolism.
