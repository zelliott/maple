Sexual steroids play an established role in the mechanisms concerning reproduction, ovulation, menstruation and onset of labour. However, sexual steroids are also involved in extragenital mechanisms, which were described for both oestrogen, and progesterone. Progesterone and its mechanisms of signal transduction still remain to be fully understood. However, there is evidence, that nitric oxide (NO) seems to be an important mediator in these mechanisms. NO, the molecule, which was described to exist in acid rain, was elected the molecule of the year 1992 from the American Academy of Science. NO is a short-lived molecule, which is involved in many reactions as an modulating transmitter due to its high diffusibility and its polarity. NO regulates the immune response of mononuclear cells, contractility of smooth muscle cells and neuronal transmission of non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic nerves. Additionally it was found, that NO may be important in the regulation of menstruation, the maintenance of uterine quiescence as well as the initiation of labour and the maturation of the uterine cervix.
