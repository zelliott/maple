The analysis of metabolic pathways with mathematical models contributes to the better understanding of the behavior of metabolic processes. This paper presents the analysis of a mathematical model for carbohydrate uptake and metabolism in Escherichia coli. It is shown that the dynamic processes cover a broad time span from some milliseconds to several hours. Based on this analysis the fast processes could be described with steady-state characteristic curves. A subsequent robustness analysis of the model parameters shows that the fast part of the system may act as a filter for the slow part of the system; the sensitivities of the fast system are conserved. From these findings it is concluded that the slow part of the system shows some robustness against changes in parameters of the fast subsystem, i.e. if a parameter shows no sensitivity for the fast part of the system, it will also show no sensitivity for the slow part of the system.
