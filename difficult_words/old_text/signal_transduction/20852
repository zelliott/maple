Several lines of evidence indicate that interactions among transmission lines can take place at the level of the cell membrane via interactions among macromolecules, integral or associated to the cell membrane, involved in signal recognition and transduction. The present view will focus on this last subject, i.e., on the interactions between receptors for chemical signals at the level of the neuronal membrane (receptor-receptor interaction). By receptor-receptor interaction we mean that a neurotransmitter or modulator, by binding to its receptor, modifies the characteristics of the receptor for another transmitter or modulator. Four types of interactions among transmission lines may be considered, but mainly intramembrane receptor-receptor interactions have been dealt with in this article, exemplified by the heteroregulation of D2 receptors via neuropeptide receptors and A2 receptors. The role of receptor-receptor interactions in the integration of signals is discussed, especially in terms of filtration of incoming signals, of integration of coincident signals, and of neuronal plasticity.
