The Drosophila alien gene is highly homologous to the human thyroid receptor interacting protein, TRIP15/COPS2, which is a component of the recently identified signalosome protein complex. We identified the mouse homologue of Drosophila alien through homology searches of the EST database. We found that the mouse cDNA encodes a predicted 443-amino-acid protein, which migrates at approximately 50 kDa. The gene for the mouse alien homologue, named Cops2, includes 12 coding exons spanning approximately 30 kb of genomic DNA on the central portion of mouse chromosome 2. Mouse Cops2 is widely expressed in embryonic, fetal, and adult tissues beginning as early as E7.5. Mouse Cops2 cDNA hybridizes to two mRNA bands in all tissues at approximately 2.3 and approximately 4 kb, with an additional approximately 1.9-kb band in liver. Immunostaining of native and epitope tagged proteins localized the mouse Cops2 protein in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, with larger amounts in the nucleus in some cells.
