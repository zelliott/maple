E protein transcription factors and their natural inhibitors, Id proteins, play critical and complex roles during lymphoid development. In this article, we report that partial maintenance of E protein activity during positive selection results in a change in the cell fate determination of developing iNKT cells, with a block in the development of iNKT1 cells and a parallel increase in the iNKT2 and iNKT17 subsets. Because the expression levels of the transcription factors that drive these alternative functional fates (GATA-3, RORÎ³T, T-bet, and Runx-3) are not altered, our results suggest that E protein activity controls a novel checkpoint that regulates the number of iNKT precursors that choose each fate.
