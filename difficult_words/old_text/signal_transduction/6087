This review summarizes the main aspects and newest findings of how proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) may modulate programmed cell death. Activation of PAR-1 has been found to induce or inhibit apoptosis in a variety of cells, depending on the dosage of its physiological agonist thrombin, or that of synthetic receptor activators. To date, cellular targets for PAR-1-mediated effects on apoptosis include neuronal, endothelial, and epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and tumor cells. The signaling pathways involved in the induction or prevention of apoptosis by PAR-1 activation are diverse, and include JAK/STAT, RhoA, myosin light chain kinase, ERK1/2, and various Bcl-2 family members. In view of the well-established involvement of microbial proteinases in host tissue malfunction, the article also elaborates on the possible significance of PAR-1 activation for the pathogenesis of infectious disease.
