During adipocyte differentiation, the cells experience dramatic alterations in morphology, motility and cell-ECM contact. Focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK), a widely expressed non-receptor tyrosine kinase in integrin signaling, has been reported to participate in these events in various cells. Utilizing 3T3-L1 cells and primary rat preadipocytes, we explored the role of FAK in adipocyte differentiation. Gradual cleavage of FAK was demonstrated during adipcoyte differentiation, both in vitro and in vivo. This cleavage of FAK was mediated by calpain. Inhibition of calpain activity resulted in the rescue of FAK degradation, accompanied with the disturbance of final maturation of adipocyte. Our study revealed that FAK participated in adipocyte differentiation, and its cleavage by calpain was required to fulfill the final maturation of adipocytes.
