The intracellular signaling pathways activated upon ligation of the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 remain relatively ill-defined, although CD28 ligation does result in the strong association with, and activation of, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. The downstream effector targets of the CD28-activated PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway remain poorly defined, but recent evidence from other systems has shown that Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) is a major target of PI 3-kinase and have indicated that a major function of PKB is the regulation of cell survival events. Given the strong coupling of CD28 to PI 3-kinase and the known protective effects of both CD28 and PI 3-kinase against apoptosis in different cell models, we investigated the effects of CD28 on PKB activation. We demonstrate that ligation of CD28 by either anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies or the natural ligand B7.1, results in the marked activation of PKB in both the leukemic T cell line Jurkat and freshly isolated human peripheral blood-derived normal T lymphocytes. Our data suggest therefore, that PKB may be an important intracellular signal involved in CD28 signal transduction and demonstrate CD28 coupling to downstream elements of a signaling cascade known to promote cell survival.
