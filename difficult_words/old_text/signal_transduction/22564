Much more is known about nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling than that initiated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), or NT-4. We sought to study early BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 signaling events. Using TrkB-expressing cells, we found that BDNF and NT-4 individually induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkB in a dose-dependent fashion. At maximally effective concentrations, BDNF or NT-4 induced robust TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation at 5 min; this progressively declined at 15, 30, and 60 min. Using immunoprecipitation, PI3-kinase and tyrosine phosphorylated PLC-gamma1 and SHC were shown to be associated with tyrosine phosphorylated TrkB in response to both BDNF and NT-4. BDNF and NT-4 induced similar intensities of phosphorylation of TrkB and signaling intermediates at equivalent doses. NT-3 treatment of TrkC-expressing cells induced very similar patterns for induction of TrkC tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of signaling intermediates. BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 caused rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK and SNT. These data suggest that the earliest signaling events for BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 are very similar to those for NGF.
