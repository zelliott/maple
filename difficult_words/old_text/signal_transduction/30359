C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) stimulates the differentiation and inhibits the proliferation of osteoblastic lineage cells. In this study, we examined whether the effects of CNP on osteoblastic functions change with aging using calvarial osteoblast-like cells from 25-week-old (young) and 120-week-old (aged) rats. CNP inhibited DNA synthesis and stimulated collagen synthesis and mineralized bone nodule formation. These effects were less pronounced in aged rat cells, suggesting the age-related attenuation of CNP-induced signaling. They were also blocked by the treatment of young rat cells with KT5823, a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor, but not by the treatment of aged rat cells with KT5823. CNP stimulated cGMP production in young rat cells, but not in aged rat cells. Natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-B, which has a guanylyl cyclase activity domain, and NPR-C, which has no enzyme activity domain, were predominantly expressed in young and aged rat cells, respectively. C-ANF, an NPR-C agonist, mimicked the effects of CNP on the proliferation and differentiation of aged rat cells; these effects were inhibited by the treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX), a Gi protein inhibitor. CNP and C-ANF evoked intracellular levels of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate and Ca(2+), which are markers for phospholiase C (PLC) activation, in aged rat cells, and the effects of these two peptides were also blocked by the treatment with PTX. From these results, we concluded that CNP acts as a positive regulator of bone formation by osteoblasts and that the signaling pathway for CNP is switched from NPR-B/cGMP/PKG to NPR-C/G(i) protein/PLC with aging.
