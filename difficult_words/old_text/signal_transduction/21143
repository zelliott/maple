The dorsal/ventral (D/V) boundary functions as an organizer in the growth and patterning of the Drosophila wing disc and gives rise to the wing margin in the adult fly. Here we show that strawberry notch (sno) is a downstream component of the Notch signaling pathway and is important for the specification of this organizer. sno encodes a novel nuclear protein conserved in C. elegans, mouse, and humans. Mutations in wing margin genes interact dominantly with sno and loss of sno function results in loss of expression of wingless, vestigial, cut, and E(spl)-m8 at the D/V boundary. In regulating these genes, sno functions in close cooperation with Suppressor of Hairless and Hairless. Finally, sno has no role in lateral inhibition suggesting that it may contribute to the specificity between lateral and inductive Notch signaling pathways.
