Prolactin (PRL) induces transcriptional activation of milk protein genes, such as the whey acidic protein (WAP), beta-casein, and beta-lactoglobulin genes, through a signaling cascade encompassing the Janus kinase Jak2 and the mammary gland factor (MGF; also called Stat5), which belongs to the family of proteins of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). We isolated and sequenced from mouse mammary tissue Stat5 mRNA and a previously unreported member, which we named Stat5b (Stat5 is renamed to Stat5a). On the protein level Stat5a and Stat5b show a 96% sequence similarity. The 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the two mRNAs are not conserved. Stat5a comprises 793 amino acids and is encoded by a mRNA of 4.2 kb. The Stat5b mRNA has a size of 5.6 kb and encodes a protein of 786 amino acids. Both Stat5a and Stat5b recognized the GAS site (gamma-interferon-activating sequence; TTCNNNGAA) in vitro and mediated PRL-induced transcription in COS cells transfected with a PRL receptor. Stat5b also induced basal transcription in the absence of PRL. Similar levels of Stat5a and Stat5b mRNAs were found in most tissues of virgin and lactating mice, but a differential accumulation of the Stat5 mRNAs was found in muscle and mammary tissue. The two RNAs are present in mammary tissue of immature virgin mice, and their levels increase up to day 16 of pregnancy, followed by a decline during lactation. The increase of Stat5 expression during pregnancy coincides with the activation of the WAP gene.
