It has been speculated that autoimmune diseases are caused by failure of central tolerance. However, this remains controversial. We have suggested that CD40 expression identifies autoaggressive T cells in the periphery of autoimmune prone mice. In this study, we report that CD40 was cloned from autoaggressive T cells and that engagement induces expression and nuclear translocation of the recombinases, recombination activating gene (RAG) 1 and RAG2 in the autoaggressive, but not in the nonautoaggressive, peripheral T cell population. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CD40 engagement induces altered TCR Valpha, but not Vbeta, expression in these cells. Therefore, CD40-regulated expression of RAG1 and RAG2 in peripheral T cells may constitute a novel pathway for the generation of autoaggressive T cells.
