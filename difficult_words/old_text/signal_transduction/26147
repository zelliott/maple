TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine regulating diverse cellular processes. It signals through membrane-bound receptors, downstream Smad proteins and/or other signalling mediators. Smad7 has been well established to be a key negative regulator of TGF-β signalling. It antagonizes TGF-β signalling through multiple mechanisms in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Smad7 can be transcriptionally induced by TGF-β and other growth factors and serves as an important cross-talk mediator of the TGF-β signalling pathway with other signalling pathways. Accordingly, it plays pivotal roles in embryonic development and adult homoeostasis, and altered expression of Smad7 is often associated with human diseases, such as cancer, tissue fibrosis and inflammatory diseases.
