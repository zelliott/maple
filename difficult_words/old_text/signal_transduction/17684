A number of extracellular factors are involved in the embryonic development of skeletal muscle and the muscle regeneration that is triggered in response to muscle damage. Some of them, such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-like molecules, leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) or platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), are involved in the activation of cell proliferation that operates before muscle differentiation. In addition, factors such as IGFs, neuregulins (NRGs), sonic hedgehog (Shh) or Wnt promote muscle differentiation. Here, we review the intracellular signals that are triggered in the myogenic effect of IGFs and neuregulin and we describe common pathways. A fuller understanding of the signalling pathways triggered by these factors may permit the design of new tools for muscle regeneration therapy.
