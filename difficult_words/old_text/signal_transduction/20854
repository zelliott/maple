Experimental results suggest that protein kinase C (PK-C) may play a substantial role in the action of IFNs, but the precise biochemical pathway remains unknown. Recent evidences reveal the complexity of the mechanism of IFN-action and show that the IFN-alpha, -beta and -gamma induced pathways are overlapping. We briefly discuss what is known in this field and suggest a way in which the contrasting views might be reconciled.
