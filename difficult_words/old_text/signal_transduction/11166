Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are recruited to phagosomes and sample the contents of the compartment for microbial products. In this review, we discuss the relationship between phagocytosis and TLRs from two additional perspectives: first, TLR signaling modulates phagocytosis; second, phagocytosis modulates the consequences of TLR activation.
