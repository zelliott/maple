Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) stimulates plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression in human mesangial cells mediated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/Smad signaling pathway. TGF-beta activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in mesangial cells, and ERK is involved in activation of Smad2/3. This study examines whether an interaction exists between Ox-LDL-induced TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathways and ERK activation leading to PAI-1 transcription in human mesangial cells. Ox-LDL (50 microg/mL) induced an acute increase in ERK activity within 15 min, which decreased to control value at 2 h. Incubation with anti-TGF-beta or SB-431542, an inhibitor of the TGF-beta type I receptor, along with Ox-LDL, inhibited the expected increase in ERK phosphorylation. Treatment with PD98059 or UO126, mitogen-activated ERK-activating kinase 1/2 inhibitors, significantly inhibited the Ox-LDL-induced increase in PAI-1 mRNA and nuclear Smad3 expression, DNA/protein complex formation, and PAI-1 promoter activity. These results suggest that phosphorylation of ERK is induced by Ox-LDL through the induction of the TGF-beta signaling pathway and that activated ERK, in turn, participates in the Ox-LDL-induced Smad3 activation and subsequent PAI-1 gene expression in mesangial cells.
