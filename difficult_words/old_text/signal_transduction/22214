We earlier showed that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) exhibit increased expression of Gi proteins. Since the levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) are enhanced in VSMC from SHR, we undertook the present study to examine the implication of endogenous ET-1 and the underlying mechanisms in the enhanced expression of Giα proteins in VSMC from SHR. The enhanced expression of Giα-2 and Giα-3 proteins in VSMC from SHR was inhibited by ET(A) and ET(B) receptor antagonists, BQ123 and BQ788 respectively. In addition, these antagonists also attenuated the enhanced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity by low concentrations of GTPγS and by inhibitory hormones in VSMC from SHR compared to WKY. Furthermore, AG1295, AG1024 and PP2, inhibitors of platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and c-Src respectively, inhibited the enhanced expression of Giα protein and the enhanced phosphorylation of PDGFR and IGF-1R in VSMC from SHR to WKY levels. In addition, NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor DPI and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a scavenger of superoxide anion (O₂⁻) also inhibited the enhanced phosphorylation of PDGFR and IGF-1R and c-Src in VSMC from SHR to control levels. Furthermore, the augmented phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in VSMC from SHR was attenuated by BQ123 and BQ788, growth factor receptors inhibitors and PP2. These results suggest that the enhanced levels of endogenous ET-1 in VSMC from SHR increase oxidative stress, which through c-Src-mediated activation of growth factor receptors and associated MAP kinase signaling, contribute to the enhanced expression of Giα proteins.
