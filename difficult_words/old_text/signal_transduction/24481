Advanced pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by extensive vascular remodeling that is usually resistant to vasodilator therapy. Mevastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step for cholesterol synthesis. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to upregulate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 and to block cell proliferation through cholesterol-independent pathways. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of mevastatin on DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). We found that mevastatin induced G1 arrest and decreased DNA synthesis in rat PASMCs and did so in association with an increase in both total and cyclin E-bound p27Kip1. This caused a marked decrease in cyclin E kinase activity, which suggests an important role for p27Kip1 in the ability of mevastatin to induce G1 arrest. However, in PASMCs lacking functional p27Kip1, mevastatin still decreased cyclin E kinase activity, caused G1 arrest, and decreased DNA synthesis. In p27Kip1-deficient PASMCs, mevastatin induced a greater reduction of cyclin E protein levels (to 35% of control) than in wild-type cells (to 70% of control) and also reduced the phosphorylation of cdk2 on threonine 160. Mevastatin also caused apoptosis in both wild-type and p27Kip1-deficient PASMCs and was able to do so at a dose that did not induce cell cycle arrest. These data suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can both inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in PASMCs through p27Kip1-independent pathways and may be important therapeutic agents in pulmonary arterial hypertension.
