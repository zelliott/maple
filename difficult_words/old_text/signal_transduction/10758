The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered to be an important event during malignant tumor progression and metastasis. Although Raf/MEK/ERK signaling causes EMT, the mechanisms, including the signaling pathways, are as yet unclear. In the present study we have examined the effects of signal transduction pathways on oncogenic Raf-1-induced EMT, using an immortalized mouse hepatic cell line. Oncogenic Raf-1-induced EMT is characterized by down-regulation of adherens and tight junctions and the reorganization of actin. An active Raf-1 gene was introduced into a mouse hepatic cell line which was then treated with the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059, the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580, the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 or the c-Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2. The expression and localization of the adherens and tight junction proteins E-cadherin, occludin, ZO-1, claudin-1 and claudin-2 were determined by western blotting, RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. The barrier function of tight junctions was assessed by measurements of transepithelial electric resistance (TER) and permeability in terms of fluxes of [(14)C]mannitol and [(14)C]inulin. In Raf-1-transfected cells expression of occludin and claudin-2 was markedly down-regulated at the protein and mRNA levels and the TER value was decreased, while the permeability was increased. The distribution of ZO-1, pancadherin and F-actin was changed from linear to zipper-like structures at cell borders. In Raf-1-transfected cells treated with PD98059 and SB203580, but not LY294002, expression and localization of claudin-2, but not occludin, recovered, together with barrier function, measured as the TER value. The distributions of ZO-1, pancadherin and F-actin also recovered on treatment with PD98059 and SB203580, but not LY294002. Expression and localization of occludin recovered slightly on treatment with PP2. Thus, oncogenic Raf-1 regulates EMT via distinct MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase and c-Src tyrosine kinase signal pathways in the mouse hepatic cell line.
