Propofol exhibits neuroprotective effects against hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, but the underlying mechanisms are still not clear. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a considerable role in the induction of innate immune and inflammatory responses. The purposes of this study are to investigate the effect of propofol on the oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)/reoxygenation (OGD/R) BV2 microglia and to explore the role of TLR4/myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway in the neuroprotective effects of propofol. BV2 microglia were placed into an airtight chamber and in glucose-free medium for OGD/reoxygenation. Cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide assay. TLR4 and its downstream signaling molecules, MyD88 and NF-κB expressions were detected by Western blotting. Level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in culture medium was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. BV2 microglia apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. We found that pretreatment with propofol significantly alleviated the hypoxic injury in BV2 microglia. Propofol inhibited upregulation of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB expressions in BV2 microglia exposed to OGD/reoxygenation. Propofol pretreatment also significantly reduced the production of TNF-α and apoptosis in OGD/reoxygenation BV2 microglia. The results indicated that TLR4 and its downstream MyD88-dependent signaling pathway contributed to neuroprotection of propofol to microglia exposed to OGD/reoxygenation.
