The involvement of the PIK3CA gene product p110Î±, the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), in human cancer has been suggested for over 15 years, and support for this proposal had been provided by both genetic and functional studies, including most recently the discovery of common activating missense mutations of PIK3CA in a wide variety of common human tumor types. This chapter will focus on the discovery of these mutations and describes their relevance to a wide range of common human tumor types.Of note, the identification and functional analysis of the PIK3CA gene are reviewed in other chapters in this book. However, a brief mention will be made here of its general properties as background to our focus on the discovery of its cancer-specific mutations.
