Preconditioning with sevoflurane (SPC) diminishes effusion of rat alveolar membrane during inflammation. It is not clear whether this preconditioning directly inhibits permeability of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (PMVEC) monolayer. In this article, we evaluated effects of SPC on permeability of PMVEC monolayer and identified signaling pathways involved in these effects. PMVEC monolayer was exposed to different conditions (5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD), TNF-α, SPC, SPC with subsequent exposure to TNF-α and 5-HD, and SPC with subsequent exposure to TNF-α alone), and the permeability of PMVEC monolayer was assessed using FITC-bovine serum albumin (ELISA). Expression of ICAM-1 (Western blot and RT-PCR) and activation of p38 MAPK (Western blot) were also assessed. Compared to the TNF-α group, permeability of PMVEC monolayer in the SPC + TNF-α group was significantly lower. Activation of p38 MAPK was also diminished in the TNF-α group. Pre-treatment with 5-HD reverted beneficial effects of SPC. Expression of ICAM-1 was not modulated by any of the tested experimental exposures. The results of this study demonstrate that SPC is capable of diminishing the TNF-α-induced increase of permeability of PMVEC monolayer, and that this beneficial effect is partly reversed by 5-HD. Further, SPC suppresses activation of p38 MAPK.
