The presence of a network of peptidergic nerve fibers in the skeleton, expressing several neuropeptides including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), has been demonstrated. This observation, together with our findings in vitro showing that VIP can regulate the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts as well as the recruitment of osteoclasts, has suggested the existence of a neuro-osteogenic interplay in bone metabolism. In the present study, the effects of VIP and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), two members of the VIP/secretin/glucagon superfamily, on osteoclast formation and mRNA expression of three key regulatory proteins involved in osteoclast formation have been investigated. VIP, PACAP-27, and PACAP-38, at concentrations of 10(-6) M, all significantly inhibited formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinuclear cells (TRAP + MNC) in mouse bone marrow cultures stimulated by 1, 25(OH)(2)-vitamin D3 (D3; 10(-8) M). By using semiquantitative RT-PCR, it was found that D3 upregulated the mRNA expressions of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK), whereas the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG) was downregulated in mouse bone marrow cultures stimulated by D3 for 7 days. Both VIP and PACAP-38 decreased the stimulatory effects of D3 on RANKL and RANK expression, whereas the inhibitory effect of D3 on OPG expression was reversed by VIP and PACAP-38. These observations indicate that the inhibitory effects of VIP and PACAP on osteoclast recruitment are due to regulation of the expression of key proteins involved in later stages of osteoclast differentiation.
