In order to elucidate the feature of T-cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction in T-cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the expression levels of CD3gamma, delta, epsilon and zeta chain genes in CD3+ T cells were analyzed using real-time PCR. CD3+ T cells sorted from peripheral blood of 10 AML patients and 10 healthy donors were used in the study. Significantly lower expression levels of all four CD3gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta chain genes were found in the AML samples. The expression pattern of the four CD3 chains was epsilon>gamma>delta>zeta in CD3+ T cells from AML samples, which was different from the healthy control group. In conclusion, the results provide a global gene expression profile of CD3gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta chains in AML patients. Deficiency of all four CD3 gene expression levels might represent the feature related to T-cell immunodeficiency.
