Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) conveys regulatory signals through multiple intracellular pathways, subsequently affecting various cellular functions. To identify new targets for TGFbeta, we studied the changes in the proteome of Mv1Lu lung epithelial cells in response to TGFbeta1 treatment. Thirty-eight non-abundant protein spots, affected by TGFbeta1, were selected, and proteins were identified by peptide mass-fingerprinting (PMF). Among them, proteins involved in regulation of immune response, apoptosis, regulation of TGFbeta signalling, metabolism and DNA repair were identified. Twenty-eight of the 38 proteins are new targets for TGFbeta1, thus suggesting novel ways of integration of TGFbeta signalling in intracellular regulatory processes. We show that TGFbeta1-dependent decrease in expression of one of the new targets, Rad51, correlates with a decrease in DNA repair efficiency. This was evaluated by formation of nuclear Rad51-containing DNA repair complexes in response to DNA damage, by single cell gel electrophoresis and by cell survival assay. The TGFbeta1-dependent inhibition of DNA repair was reversed by ectopic overexpression of Rad51. Therefore, TGFbeta can promote DNA instability through down-regulation of Rad51 and inhibition of DNA repair.
