Although the effects of trematode infection on snail host physiology or host responses on parasite development have been well described in the literature, very little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms and specific molecules responsible for mediating those effects. It is presumed that many host-parasite interactions are communicated through receptor-mediated events, in particular those involving haemocytic immune responses to invading parasites, larval motility and migration through host tissues, and larval acquisition of host molecules either as nutrients or critical developmental factors. The intent of this chapter is to review current knowledge of molecules (both receptors and their ligands or counter-receptors) involved in molecular communication at the interface between larval trematodes, especially the mother or primary sporocyst stage, and host cells/tissues in intimate proximity to developing larvae. Information to date suggests that the molecular exchange at this interface is a highly complex and dynamic process, and appears to be regulated in specific cases. Topics discussed will focus on snail cell receptor interactions with the sporocyst tegument and its secretions, host cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion receptors and their related signal transduction pathways, and sporocyst tegumental surface receptors and ligands involved in the binding of soluble host molecules.
