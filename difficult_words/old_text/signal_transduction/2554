Signal transduction systems (sts(s)) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels in skeletal muscle distantly located from the site of large body surface area (BSA) burns are due to the systemic effects of burn trauma. Evaluating the guanylate and adenylate cyclase sts(s), by measuring adenosine 3':5'-phosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3':5'-phosphate (cyclic GMP) by radioimmunoassay with polymorphic forms of AChE demonstrated that the various systems (i.e., cyclic GMP and AChE) interact while under the duress of burn trauma. This trauma emanates from large skin burns (30-50% BSA) that have induced a chronic burn trauma response at postburn day 21. This study showed that a system, with a minimum of 2 components, regulated cyclic AMP levels. This paper provides insight into our current understanding of the effects of burn trauma on cellular signalling and discusses some of the potential implications of recent findings on long term rehabilitative care.
