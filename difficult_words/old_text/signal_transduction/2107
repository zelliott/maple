Part of the beneficial effects of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are due to augmenting the actions of bradykinin (BK). We studied this effect of enalaprilat on the binding of [3H]BK to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected to express the human BK B2 receptor alone (CHO-3B) or in combination with ACE (CHO-15AB). In CHO-15AB cells, enalaprilat (1 mumol/L) increased the total number of low-affinity [3H]BK binding sites on the cells at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C, from 18.4 +/- 4.3 to 40.3 +/- 11.9 fmol/10(6) cells (P < .05; Kd, 2.3 +/- 0.8 and 5.9 +/- 1.3 nmol/L; n = 4). Enalaprilat preserved a portion of the receptors in high-affinity conformation (Kd, 0.17 +/- 0.08 nmol/L; 8.1 +/- 0.9 fmol/10(6) cells). Enalaprilat decreased the IC50 of [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]BK, the BK analogue more resistant to ACE, from 3.2 +/- 0.8 to 0.41 +/- 0.16 nmol/L (P < .05, n = 3). The biphasic displacement curve of the binding of [3H]BK also suggested the presence of high-affinity BK binding sites. Enalaprilat (5 nmol to 1 mumol/L) potentiated the release of [3H]arachidonic acid and the liberation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) induced by BK and [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]BK. Moreover, enalaprilat (1 mumol/L) completely and immediately restored the response of the B2 receptor, desensitized by the agonist (1 mumol/L [Hyp3-Tyr(Me)8]BK); this effect was blocked by the antagonist, HOE 140. Finally, enalaprilat, but not the prodrug enalapril, decreased internalization of the receptor from 70 +/- 9% to 45 +/- 9% (P < .05, n = 7). In CHO-3B cells, enalaprilat was ineffective. ACE inhibitors in the presence of both the B2 receptor and ACE enhance BK binding, protect high-affinity receptors, block receptor desensitization, and decrease internalization, thereby potentiating BK beyond blocking its hydrolysis.
