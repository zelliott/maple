The NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan is a membrane-spanning molecule expressed by immature precursor cells in a variety of developing tissues. In tightly adherent cell lines with a flattened morphology, NG2 is organized on the cell surface in linear arrays that are highly co-localized with actin and myosin-containing stress fibers in the cytoskeleton. In contrast, microtubules and intermediate filaments in the cytoskeleton exhibit completely different patterns of organization, suggesting that NG2 may use microfilamentous stress fibers as a means of cytoskeletal anchorage. Consistent with this is the observation that cytochalasin D disrupts the organization of both stress fibers in the cytoskeleton and NG2 on the cell surface. Very similar linear cell surface arrays are also seen with three other cell surface molecules thought to interact with the actin cytoskeleton: the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin, the CD44 proteoglycan, and the L1 neuronal cell adhesion molecule. Since the cytoplasmic domains of these four molecules are dissimilar, it seems possible that cytoskeletal anchorage in each case may occur via different mechanisms. One indication of such differences can be seen in colchicine-treated cells which have lost their flattened morphology but still retain long actin-positive tendrils as remnants of the actin cytoskeleton. NG2 and alpha 5 beta 1 are associated with these tendrils while CD44 and L1 are not, suggesting that at least two subclasses of cell surface molecules exist which can interact with different subdomains of the actin cytoskeleton.
