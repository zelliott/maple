Understanding intracellular signal transduction by cell surface receptors requires information about the precise order of relevant modifications on the early transducer elements. Here we introduce the B cell line DT40 and its genetically engineered variants as a model system to determine and functionally characterize post-translational protein modifications in general. This is accomplished by a customized strategy that combines mass spectrometric analyses of protein modifications with subsequent mutational studies. When applied to the B cell receptor (BCR)-proximal effector SLP-65, this approach uncovered a differential and highly dynamic engagement of numerous newly identified phospho-acceptor sites. Some of them serve as kinase substrates in resting cells and undergo rapid dephosphorylation upon BCR ligation. Stimulation-induced phosphorylation of SLP-65 can be early and transient, or early and sustained, or late. Functional elucidation of conspicuous phosphorylation at serine 170 in SLP-65 revealed a BCR-distal checkpoint for some but not all possible B cell responses. Our data show that SLP-65 phosphorylation acts upstream for signal initiation and also downstream during selective processing of the BCR signal. Such a phenomenon defines a receptor-specific signal integrator.
