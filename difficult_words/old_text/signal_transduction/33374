The work group identified a number of research areas where they felt there were significant data gaps where additional research was critical to better under standing of the origins of birth defects and to developing ways for their prevention. These included: 1. Studies designed to determine the role of growth and differentiation factors during pre- and postimplantation stages of development. These investigations could include descriptive studies involving the localization and timing of genes expressed and their products, but must also emphasize and include studies involving the function of these molecules and their interactions in normal and abnormal development. 2. Studies designed to develop and utilize models for investigating normal and abnormal development. These approaches could include in vivo and in vitro techniques, such as creation of genetically defined systems and cell, organ, and whole embryo cultures. These technologies should emphasize ways to study the functions of growth and differentiation factors and the effects of environmental factors. 3. Studies designed to identify environmental agents and their targets in embryonic, extraembryonic, and maternal tissues that may play a role in producing developmental abnormalities through peturbations of growth and differentiation factors. 4. Studies designed to determine cellular and molecular mechanisms for protection and recovery from environmental insults.
