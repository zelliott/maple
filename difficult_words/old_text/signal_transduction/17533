The human glioma cell lines U251 and HP591 were chosen as "in vitro" models for functional astrocytes. When cultured in the presence of IL-1 beta these cell lines demonstrated a marked increase in interleukin-6 production and in [3H]-thymidine uptake. The addition of dbcAMP could mimic the first effect of IL-1 beta but at the same time suppressed cell proliferation. These results suggest that IL-1 beta possibly exerts one of its biological effects (IL-6 synthesis) by means of the cyclic AMP pathway.
