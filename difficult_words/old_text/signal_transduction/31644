Liver damage due to infection, cirrhosis, accidents and diseases lead to destruction of hepatocytes and their regeneration to its original form is important for the proper functioning of the body. Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter, was coupled with a biopolymer chitosan and the nanosized complexes were made. The morphology was studied by scanning electron microscope and the interaction of GABA with chitosan was analysed by FT-IR spectroscopy. The interaction of GABA-chitosan nanoparticles with hepatocytes were observed by FITC labeled nanoparticles. After partial hepatectomy in male Wistar rats, DNA synthesis was estimated by tritiated thymidine uptake and the activity of thymidine kinase and protein synthesis by tritiated leucine uptake in hepatocytes. There was an increase in tritiated thymidine uptake in partially hepatectomised groups with nanoparticle treatment (GCNP) when compared to partially hepatectomised groups without nanoparticle treatment (PHNT) and with pure GABA treatment (G). Inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) content and gene expression of phospholipase C mRNA and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B (NF-KB) mRNA was decreased for groups G and GCNP with respect to PHNT. Thus our results showed increased hepatocyte regeneration with decreased cell death in group G and more better with GCNP when compared to PHNT.
