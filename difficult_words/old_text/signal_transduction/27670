The effects of exogenous and endogenous. NO on myocardial functions such as contraction, relaxation and heart rate have recently gained considerable scientific interest. .NO stimulates myocardial soluble guanylate cyclase to produce cGMP, which activates two major target proteins. A small increase in cGMP levels predominantly inhibits phosphodiesterase III, while high cGMP levels activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Accordingly, submicromolar .NO concentrations improve myocardial contraction, while submillimolar .NO concentrations decrease contractility. The latter action includes direct inhibitory .NO effects on ATP synthesis and voltage-gated calcium channels. Overall, the inotropic effects of exogenous .NO are small and probably of minor importance for myocardial contractility. Cardiomyocytes are capable of expressing eNOS and iNOS. Endogenous .NO has effects on myocardial contraction, similar to that of exogenous .NO. Various NOS inhibitors can substantially reduce myocardial contractility in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that basal endogenous .NO production supports myocardial contractility. There is also evidence for a .NO-dependent cardiodepressive effect of cytokines that is mediated by expression of iNOS. This is consistent with the negative inotropic effects of .NO at high concentrations. Cardiodepressive actions of endogenous .NO production may play a role in certain forms of heart failure. Finally, .NO also has an effect on heart rate. Physiologic .NO concentrations can stimulate heart rate by activating the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (If) and this effect decreases at submillimolar .NO concentrations. In summary, physiological concentrations of .NO increase contractility and heart rate under basal conditions, while high .NO concentrations induce the opposite effects.
