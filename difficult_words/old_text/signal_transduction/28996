Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a key regulator of calcium metabolism. Parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHrP) contributes to skeletal development through regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation during early bone growth. Both PTH and PTHrP act through the same receptor (PTHR1). A second receptor, PTHR2, has been identified although its function is comparatively unknown. PTH hyper-secretion induces bone resorption, whereas intermittent injection of PTH increases bone mass. To explore the effects of genetic variation in the PTH pathway, we have analysed variations in PTH, PTHLH, PTHR1 and PTHR2 in relation to bone mass and fracture incidence in elderly women.

This study includes 1044 elderly women, all 75 years old, from the MalmÃ¶ Osteoporosis Prospective Risk Assessment study (OPRA). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 4 genes and derived haplotypes in the PTH signaling pathway were analysed in 745-1005 women; 6 SNPs in the PTH gene and 3 SNPs each in the PTHLH, PTHR1 and PTHR2 genes were investigated in relation to BMD (assessed at baseline), fracture (434 prevalent fractures of all types over lifetime, self-reported and 174 incident fractures up to 7 years, X-ray verified) and serum PTH.

Individually, SNPs in the 4 loci did not show any significant association with BMD. Neither were PTHLH, PTHR1 and PTHR2 polymorphisms associated with fracture. Three of 5 common haplotypes, accounting for >98% of alleles at the PTH locus, were identified as independent predictors of fracture. Haplotype 9 (19%) was suggestive of an association with fractures of any type sustained during lifetime (p=0.018), with carriers of one or more copies of the haplotype having the lowest incidence (p=0.006). Haplotypes 1 (13%) and 5 (37%) and 9 were suggestive of an association with fractures sustained between 50 and 75 years (p=0.02, p=0.013 and p=0.034). Carriers of haplotypes 1 and 5 were more likely to suffer a fracture (haplotype 1, p=0.045; haplotype 5, p=0.008). We conclude, that while further genotyping across the gene is recommended, in this cohort of elderly Swedish women, polymorphisms in PTH may contribute to the risk of fracture through mechanisms that are independent of BMD.
