G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest group of plasma membrane receptors in nature and are activated by a variety of different ligands. The biological outcome of GPCR stimulation is complex, as a plethora of signaling pathways are activated upon stimulation. These complexity and diversity of GPCR signaling make it difficult to manipulate the signaling pathway of a specific GPCR by natural ligands. To reduce the complexity in experimental settings, specific pharmacological ligands that preferentially activate one signaling pathway have been developed. In addition, G-protein-coupled designer receptors that are unresponsive to endogenous ligands but can be activated by otherwise pharmacologically inert compounds have been designed. These receptors have been termed designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs. The lack of constitutive activity of these designer receptors allows their use for in vitro and in vivo studies of GPCR-mediated signal transduction. The analysis of recently generated transgenic mice showed that the expression of G-protein-coupled designer receptors represents a powerful chemical-genetic tool to investigate GPCR signaling and function.
