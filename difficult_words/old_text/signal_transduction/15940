Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5 or initially NCLK for neuronal CDC2-like kinase) was switched twice at its birth nearly twenty years ago: first it was thought to be cyclin-dependent, second it was assumed to be primarily of importance in neuronal cells-both turned out not to be the case. In this review we want to discuss issues of pharmacological inhibition, to highlight the versatile roles, and to summarize the growing evidence for the functional importance of Cdk5 in non-neuronal tissues, such as blood cells, tumor cells, epithelial cells, the vascular endothelium, testis, adipose and endocrine tissues. The organizing principles we follow are apoptosis/cell death, migration/motility, aspects of inflammation, and, finally, secretion/metabolism.
