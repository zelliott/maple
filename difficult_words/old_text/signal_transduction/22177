Interferons (IFNs) can activate the PI3K-AKT and Raf-MEK-ERK signal pathways and induce antiviral proteins (MxA, 2',5'-OAS and PKR) expression in specific cell lines. However, the relationship between those antiviral proteins expression and signal pathways remains unknown at present. Thus our experiments were designed to determine the exact relationship in HepG2.2.15 cell line. The results demonstrated that IFN-α and IL-29 were both able to activate PI3K-AKT and Raf-MEK-ERK signal pathways, and IFN-α up-regulated the expression of MxA, 2',5'-OAS and PKR whereas IL-29 increased mRNA expression of MxA and 2',5'-OAS and had no influence on PKR. Furthermore, MxA, 2',5'-OAS and PKR expression were down-regulated while PI3K-AKT signal pathway was blocked by LY294002. And MxA was up-regulated after Raf-MEK-ERK signal pathway being blocked by PD98059. These findings indicate that the expression of MxA, 2',5'-OAS and PKR are up-regulate by PI3K-AKT signal pathway, and Raf-MEK-ERK signal pathway has a negative regulatory effect on the expression of MxA and no significant effect on 2',5'-OAS and PKR.
