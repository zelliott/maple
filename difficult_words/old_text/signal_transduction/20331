Gene chip technology can be used to identify and localize signal transduction genes associated with metastasis. We used the human genome U133A gene chip to detect differences in gene expression profiles among high (H) and low (L) metastatic human ovarian cancer cell lines (HO-8910PM, HO-8910), and normal ovarian tissues (C), to identify metastasis-associated signal transduction genes and determine their chromosomal localizations. A total of 37 signal transduction genes showed more than twofold differences in expression levels between the H and L metastatic ovarian cancer cell lines; of these, 21 genes were up-regulated [signal log ratio (SLR)≥1], and 16 genes were down-regulated (SLR≤-1). Most genes were located on chromosome 1 (7 genes, 18.9%), followed by chromosome 8 (5 genes, 13.5%), then chromosomes 6, 11, and 17 (3 genes each, 8.1%). A total of 21 of the differentially expressed genes (56.7%) were localized on the short arm of the chromosome (q). The disruption of signal transduction gene expression may be an important factor associated with ovarian cancer metastasis. The affected signal transduction genes were localized to chromosomes 1, 8, 6, 11, and 17.
