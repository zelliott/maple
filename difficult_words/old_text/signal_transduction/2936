PG (prostaglandin) E2 plays an important role in the modulation of the immune response and the inflammatory process. In the present study, we describe a PGE2 positive feedback for COX (cyclo-oxygenase)-2 and mPGES-1 [microsomal PGES (PGE synthase)-1] expression in the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Our results show that PGE2 induces COX-2 and mPGES-1 expression, an effect mimicked by dbcAMP (dibutyryl-cAMP) or forskolin. Furthermore, the cAMP signalling pathway co-operates with LPS (lipopolysaccharide) in the induction of COX-2 and mPGES-1 transcriptional activation. Analysis of the involvement of PGE receptors [EPs (E-prostanoids)] showed that incubation with EP2 agonists up-regulated both COX2 and mPGES-1 mRNA levels. Moreover, EP2 receptor overexpression enhanced the transcriptional activation of COX2 and mPGES-1 promoters. This induction was repressed by the PKA (protein kinase A) inhibitor H89. Activation of the PGE2/EP2/PKA signalling pathway induced the phosphorylation of CREB [CRE (cAMP-response element)-binding protein] in macrophages and stimulated the specific binding of this transcription factor to COX2 and mPGES-1 promoters. Deletion or mutation of potential CRE sites in both promoters diminished their transcriptional activity. In summary, the results of the present study demonstrate that activation of PKA/CREB signalling through the EP2 receptor by PGE2 plays a key role in the expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 in activated macrophages.
