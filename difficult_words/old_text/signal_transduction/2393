Protein tyrosine phosphorylation by endogenous and expressed tyrosine kinases is reduced markedly by the expression of functional voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. The levels of tyrosine kinase protein and cellular protein substrates are unaffected, consistent with a reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation that results from inhibition of protein tyrosine kinase activity. The attenuation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is correlated with the gating properties of expressed wild-type and mutant Kv channels. Furthermore, cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation is reduced within minutes by acute treatment with the electrogenic potassium ionophore valinomycin. Because tyrosine phosphorylation in turn influences Kv channel activity, these results suggest that reciprocal modulatory interactions occur between Kv channel and protein tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathways.
