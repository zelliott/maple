Pregnancy is characterized by a complex interplay of inflammatory events regulated by both the innate and acquired immune systems. Similarly, parturition can be viewed as the activation of "pro-labour" inflammatory pathways, which drive cervical ripening and myometrial activation. Premature activation of these pathways, for example, by infection, can lead to preterm labour and birth. Nuclear factor κβ is a key modulator of these pathways and functions by regulating the expression of prostaglandins, chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in both term and preterm labour. Future design of therapeutics that target key mediators of inflammation and immune activation would therefore be a rational approach for preventing preterm labour and immune-mediated neonatal brain damage.
