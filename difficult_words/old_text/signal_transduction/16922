The B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS)-A PRoliferation-Inducing Ligand (APRIL) signaling pathway has an important role in the selection, maturation and survival of B cells and plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The inhibition of BLyS, a survival factor for transitional and mature B cells, has recently proven to be successful in large phase III clinical trials that led to the approval of an anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody (belimumab) for the treatment of SLE. Yet, there is currently a need to both understand better the mechanisms of action of belimumab in SLE and better define the subsets of patients that are more likely to respond to the drug.
