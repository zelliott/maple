The chemokine CXCL12, via its receptor CXCR4, promotes increased survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells that express high levels of Î¶-chain-associated protein (ZAP-70), a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with aggressive disease. In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms governing this effect. Although significant differences in the expression or turnover of CXCR4 were not observed between ZAP-70(+) and ZAP-70(-) cell samples, CXCL12 induced greater intracellular Ca(2+) flux and stronger and more prolonged phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) in the ZAP-70(+) CLL cells. The CXCL12-induced phosphorylation of ERK and MEK in ZAP-70(+) CLL cells was blocked by sorafenib, a small molecule inhibitor of RAF. Furthermore, ZAP-70(+) CLL cells were more sensitive than ZAP-70(-) CLL cells to the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib in vitro at concentrations that can readily be achieved in vivo. The data suggest that ZAP-70(+) CLL cells may be more responsive to survival factors, like CXCL12, that are elaborated by the leukemia microenvironment, and this sensitivity could be exploited for the development of new treatments for patients with this disease. Moreover, sorafenib may have clinical activity for patients with CLL, particularly those with ZAP-70(+) CLL.
