Transient transfection of expression vectors for various members of the hematopoietin receptor family and STAT proteins into COS-1 cells indicated that each receptor was capable of stimulating the DNA binding activity of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5B. However, gp130 preferentially activated STAT1 and STAT3. Activation of STAT5B differed from that of the other two in that the box 3 sequence motif in the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 was not required. Moreover, STAT5B and STAT3 enhanced gene transcription via separate regulatory elements. This study has identified two potential signal transduction pathways by which hematopoietin receptors, including the interleukin-6 receptor, control transcription of acute phase plasma protein genes in hepatic cells.
