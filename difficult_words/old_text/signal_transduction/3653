Two important functions of glucocorticoids (Gc), namely, suppression of immune system function and feedback repression of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, are mediated through repression of gene transcription. Previous studies have indicated that this repression is exerted in part through antagonism between the glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and the AP-1 family of transcription factors. However, this mechanism could not account for repression of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, an important regulator of the HPA axis. Our recent identification of the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 as a mediator of CRH induction of POMC transcription led us, in the present work, to show that Gc antagonize this positive signal at two levels. First, Gc partly blunt the CRH induction of Nur77 mRNA, and second, they antagonize Nur77-dependent transcription. GR repression is exerted by antagonism of Nur77 action on the NurRE element of the POMC gene. Gc antagonism of NurRE activity was observed in response to physiological stimuli in both endocrine (CRH induction of POMC) and lymphoid (T-cell receptor activation) cells. In transfection experiments, transcriptional activation by Nur77 and the repressor activity of liganded GR titrated each other on their cognate DNA target. In vitro binding experiments as well as mutation analysis of GR suggest that the mechanism of GR antagonism of Nur77 is very similar to that of the antagonism between GR and AP-1. The convergence of positive signals mediated by Nur77 (and also probably by related family members) and negative signals exerted by GR appears to be a general mechanism for control of transcription, since it is active in both endocrine and lymphoid cells.
