The effect of fractionated doses of Co(60) gamma-irradiation (2 Gy per fraction over 5 days), as is delivered in cancer radiotherapy, was compared with acute doses of 10 and 2 Gy, in a serially transplanted mouse fibrosarcoma grown in Swiss mice. The aspects that were studied included the three major mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, namely p44 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase, and stress-activated protein (SAP) kinase, which are known to be involved in determining the cell fate following exposure to ionizing radiation. The response of dual specificity phosphatase PAC1 which is involved in the dephosphorylation of MAP kinases was also looked at. There were significant differences in the response to different dose regimens for all the factors studied. Fractionated irradiation elicited an adaptive response with a sustained activation over 7 days of prosurvival p44 MAP kinase which was balanced by the increased activation of proapoptotic p54 SAP kinase up to 1 day post-irradiation, whereas, phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase showed a decrease at most time points. PAC1 was induced following fractionated irradiation and may be acting as a feed back regulator of p44 MAP kinase. The activation of SAP kinase after fractionated irradiation may be a stress response, whereas, constitutively activated p44 MAP kinase may play an important role in the induction of radioresistance during fractionated radiotherapy of cancer and may serve as a promising target for specific inhibitors to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy.
