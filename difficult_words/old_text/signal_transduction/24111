The reaction mechanism of the Na,K-ATPase is thought to involve a number of ligand-induced conformational changes. The specific amino acid residues responsible for binding many of the important ligands have been identified; however, details of the specific conformational changes produced by ligand binding are largely undescribed. The experiments described in this paper begin to identify interactions between domains of the Na,K-ATPase alpha-subunit that depend on the presence of particular ligands. The major cytoplasmic loop (between TM4 and TM5), which we have previously shown contains the ATP-binding domain, was overexpressed in bacteria either with a His(6) tag or as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. We have observed that these polypeptides associate in the presence of MgATP. Incubation with [gamma-(32)P]ATP under conditions that result in phosphorylation of the full-length Na,K-ATPase did not result in (32)P incorporation into either the His(6) tag or glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. The MgATP-induced association was strongly inhibited by prior modification of the fusion proteins with fluorescein isothiocyanate or by simultaneous incubation with 10 microm eosin, indicating that the effect of MgATP is due to interactions within the nucleotide-binding domain. These data are consistent with Na,K-ATPase associating within cells via interactions in the nucleotide-binding domains. Although any functional significance of these associations for ion transport remains unresolved, they may play a role in cell function and in modulating interactions between the Na,K-ATPase and other proteins.
