The Th17 pathway has recently been shown to play a critical role in host defense, allergic responses and autoimmune inflammation. Th17 cells predominantly produce IL-17 and IL-22, which are two cytokines with broad effects in the lung and other tissues. This review summarizes not only what is currently known about the molecular regulation of this pathway and Th17-related cytokine signaling, but also the roles of these cytokines in pathogen immunity and asthma. In the last 5 years, the Th17 field has rapidly grown and research has revealed that the Th17 pathway is essential in lung pathogenesis in response to exogenous stimuli. As work in the field continues, it is expected that many exciting therapeutic advances will be made for a broad range of diseases.
