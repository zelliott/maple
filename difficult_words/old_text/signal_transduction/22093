Interleukin (IL)-32 is a recently described cytokine that appears to play a critical role in a variety of inflammatory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, thus far, the regulation of IL-32 production has not been fully established. Here, we report on signaling pathways that regulate the production of IL-32α, the most abundant isoform, in the human alveolar epithelial cell line, A549. IL-32α was expressed and secreted by IL-1β. The IL-32 expression was attenuated by PP2 (a Src-family kinase [SFK] inhibitor), rottlerin (a protein kinase [PK] Cδ inhibitor), and LY294002 (a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3K] inhibitor). Furthermore, the overexpression of Fgr rather than other SFKs upregulated IL-32α expression, while Fgr small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection downregulated it. The suppression of Fgr with PP2 and Fgr siRNA inhibited activating phosphorylation of PKCδ and PI3K/Akt, but not IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)1, a well-known MyD88-dependent signaling molecule, and Erk1/2, p38, and JNK. Rottlerin and PKCδ siRNA also inhibited expression of IL-32α and activation of PI3K/Akt, but not of IRAK1 and mitogen activation protein (MAP) kinases. MyD88 siRNA suppressed the expression of IL-32α and the phosphorylation of IRAK1, PI3K, and MAP kinases, but not of PKCδ. Of interest, both Fgr/PKCδ and MyD88-dependent signals regulated PI3K/Akt, suggesting that it is a crosstalk molecule. Among MyD88-dependent MAP kinases, only p38 regulated IL-32α expression and PI3K/Akt activation. With these results, we demonstrated that the expression and secretion of IL-32α are regulated by MyD88-dependent IRAK1/p38/PI3K and independent Fgr/PKCδ/PI3K pathways, and that Fgr and PKCδ are critical for the MyD88-independent IL-32α production.
