Autophagy is an essential and conserved lysosomal degradation pathway that controls the quality of cytoplasm by eliminating the intracellular aggregated proteins and damaged organelles. Autophagy works in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent pathway or mTOR-independent pathway to keep the neuronal homeostasis. Mounting evidence has implicated the importance of defective autophagy in the pathogenesis of aging and neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has also demonstrated a neuroprotective role of autophagy in mediating the degradation of amyloid beta and tau which are major factors of AD. Amounts of molecules function in either mTOR-dependent pathway or mTOR-independent pathway to induce autophagy, which maybe a potential treatment for AD. In this review, we summarize the latest studies concerning the role of autophagy in AD and explore autophagy modulation as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. However, to date, little of the researches on autophagy have been performed to investigate the modulation in AD; more investigations need to be confirmed in the future.
