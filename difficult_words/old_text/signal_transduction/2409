The Arabidopsis FAD7 gene encodes a plastid omega-3 fatty acid desaturase that catalyzes the desaturation of dienoic fatty acids in membrane lipids. The mRNA levels of the Arabidopsis FAD7 gene in rosette leaves rose rapidly after local wounding treatments. Wounding also induced the expression of the FAD7 gene in roots. To study wound-responsive expression of the FAD7 gene in further detail, we analyzed transgenic tobacco plants carrying the -825 Arabidopsis FAD7 promoter-beta-glucuronidase fusion gene. In unwounded transformants, FAD7 promoter activity was restricted to the tissues whose cells contained chloroplasts. Activation of the FAD7 promoter by local wounding treatments was more substantial in stems (29-fold) and roots (10-fold) of transgenic plants than it was in leaves (approximately two-fold). Significant induction by wounding was observed in the overall tissues of stems and included trichomes, the epidermis, cortex, vascular system, and the pith of the parenchyma. Strong promoter activity was found preferentially in the vascular tissues of wounded roots. These results indicate that wounding changes the spatial expression pattern of the FAD7 gene. Inhibitors of the octadecanoid pathway, salicylic acid and n-propyl gallate, strongly suppressed the wound activation of the FAD7 promoter in roots but not in leaves or stems. In unwounded plants, exogenously applied methyl jasmonate activated the FAD7 promoter in roots, whereas it repressed FAD7 promoter activity in leaves. Taken together, wound-responsive expression of the FAD7 gene in roots is thought to be mediated via the octadecanoid pathway, whereas in leaves, jasmonate-independent wound signals may induce the activation of the FAD7 gene. These observations indicate that wound-responsive expression of the FAD7 gene in aerial and subterranean parts of plants is brought about by way of different signal transduction pathways.
