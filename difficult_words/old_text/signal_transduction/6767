Hypertensive myocardial remodeling has an important role in the pathophysiology of hypertensive disease. This study suggests that telmisartan (TEL) can inhibit myocardial fibrosis of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) through the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Smad signaling pathway. Through echocardiography and hemodynamics, it was shown that TEL could improve cardiac function and reduce the degree of hypertensive LVH in hypertensive rats. Through immunoassay, it was shown that TEL could antagonize renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system expression in plasma and myocardial tissue. By Masson staining, Elisa and alkaline hydrolysis assays, it was demonstrated that TEL could significantly inhibit myocardial fibrosis in hypertensive rats and attenuate extracellular matrix-related proteins associated with pressure overload. Western blotting was used to detect the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway protein expression of myocardial tissue, and it was further found that TEL could inhibit activation of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. In conclusion, TEL could inhibit myocardial local angiotensin II (Ang II) level by directly affecting the Ang II receptor. TEL may also restore the balance of matrix metalloproteinases/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, reduce myocardial collagen fibrosis and delay hypertensive LVH by affecting the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway.
