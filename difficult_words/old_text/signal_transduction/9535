Acquired cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease and related vascular problems contribute to more than one-third of worldwide morbidity and mortality. In many instances, particularly in the under developed world, cardiovascular diseases are diagnosed at a late stage limiting the scope for improving outcomes. A range of therapies already exist for established cardiovascular disease, although there is significant interest in further understanding disease pathogenesis in order to improve diagnosis and achieve primary and secondary therapeutic goals. The urocortins are a group of recently defined peptide members of the corticotrophin-releasing factor family. Previous pre-clinical work and human association studies suggest that urocortins have potential to exert some beneficial and other detrimental effects on the heart and major blood vessels. More current evidence however favours beneficial effects of urocortins, for example these peptides have been shown to inhibit production of reactive oxygen species and vascular cell apoptosis, and thus may have potential to antagonise the progression of cardiovascular disease. This review summarises published data on the potential role of urocortins in cardiovascular disease.
