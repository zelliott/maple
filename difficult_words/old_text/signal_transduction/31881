CD4⁺ T helper cells are playing critical roles in host defense to pathogens and in the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Naïve CD4⁺T cells, upon antigen-specific recognition, receive signals to differentiate into distinct effector T helper cell subsets characterized by their pattern of cytokine production and specific immune functions. A tight balance between these different subsets ensures proper control of the immune response. There is increasing evidence revealing an important role for Notch signaling in the regulation of CD4⁺T helper cell differentiation or function in the periphery. However, the exact mechanisms involved remain unclear and appear contradictory. In this review, we summarize current knowledge and discuss recent advances in the field to reconcile different views on the role of Notch signaling in the differentiation of functional T helper subsets.
