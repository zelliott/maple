Significant advances in the genetic dissection of the auxin transport pathway have recently been made. Particularly relevant is the molecular analysis of mutants impaired in auxin transport and the subsequent cloning of genes encoding candidate proteins for the elusive auxin efflux carrier. These studies are thought to pave the way to the detailed understanding of the molecular basis of several important facets of auxin action.
