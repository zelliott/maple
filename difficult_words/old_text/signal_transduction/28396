Accumulating evidence has indicated that neurotrophin receptor trafficking plays an important role in neurotrophin-mediated signaling in developing as well as mature neurons. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms and the components of neurotrophin receptor vesicular transport. This article will describe how neurotrophin receptors, Trk and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), are intimately involved in the axonal transport process. In particular, the molecules that may direct Trk receptor trafficking in the axon will be discussed. Finally, potential mechanisms by which receptor-containing vesicles link to molecular cytoskeletal motors will be presented.
