Animal cells can be regarded as factories for the production of relevant proteins. The advances described in this chapter towards the development of cell lines with higher productivity capacities, certain metabolic and proliferation properties, reduced apoptosis and other features must be regarded in an integrative perspective. The systematic application of systems biology approaches in combination with a synthetic arsenal for targeted modification of endogenous networks are proposed to lead towards the achievement of a predictable and technologically advanced cell system with high biotechnological impact.
