Earlier studies have revealed an improvement of cardiac function in animals with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to myocardial infarction (MI) by treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Since heart failure is also associated with attenuated responses to catecholamines, we examined the effects of imidapril, an ACE inhibitor, on the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) signal transduction in the failing heart. Heart failure in rats was induced by occluding the coronary artery, and 3 weeks later the animals were treated with g/(kg x day) (orally) imidapril for 4 weeks. The animals were assessed for their left ventricular function and inotropic responses to isoproterenol. Cardiomyocytes and crude membranes were isolated from the non-ischemic viable left ventricle and examined for the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ [Ca2+]i and beta-ARs as well as adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, respectively. Animals with heart failure exhibited depressions in ventricular function and positive inotropic response to isoproterenol as well as isoproterenol-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in cardiomyocytes; these changes were attenuated by imidapril treatment. Both beta1-AR receptor density and isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity were decreased in the failing heart and these alterations were prevented by imidapril treatment. Alterations in cardiac function, positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol, beta1-AR density and isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity in the failing heart were also attenuated by treatment with another ACE inhibitor, enalapril and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan. The results indicate that imidapril not only attenuates cardiac dysfunction but also prevents changes in beta-AR signal transduction in CHF due to MI. These beneficial effects are similar to those of enalapril or losartan and thus appear to be due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.
