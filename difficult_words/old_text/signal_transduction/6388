The type V TGF-beta receptor (TbetaR-V) mediates IGF-independent growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 and mediates growth inhibition by TGF-beta1 in concert with the other TGF-beta receptor types. TbetaR-V was recently found to be identical to LRP-1. Here we find that insulin and (Q3A4Y15L16) IGF-I (an IGF-I analog that has a low affinity for IGFBP-3) antagonize growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 in mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells) stimulated by serum. In these cells, IGFBP-3 induces serine-specific dephosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. The IGFBP-3-induced dephosphorylation of IRS-2 is prevented by cotreatment of cells with insulin, (Q3A4Y15L16) IGF-I, or TbetaR-V/LRP-1 antagonists. The magnitude of the IRS-2 dephosphorylation induced by IGFBP-3 positively correlates with the degree of growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 in Mv1Lu cells and mutant cells derived from Mv1Lu cells. Stable transfection of murine 32D myeloid cells (which lack endogenous IRS proteins and are insensitive to growth inhibition by IGFBP-3) with IRS-1 or IRS-2 cDNA confers sensitivity to growth inhibition by IGFBP-3; this IRS-mediated growth inhibition can be completely reversed by insulin in 32D cells stably expressing IRS-2 and the insulin receptor. These results suggest that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are key molecules for the TbetaR-V/LRP-1-mediated growth inhibitory signaling cascade.
