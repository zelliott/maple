Important functions in myogenesis have been proposed for FGF6, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family accumulating almost exclusively in the myogenic lineage. However, the analyses of Fgf6 (-/-) mutant mice gave contradictory results and the role of FGF6 during myogenesis remained largely unclear. Recent reports support the concept that FGF6 has a dual function in muscle regeneration, stimulating myoblast proliferation/migration and muscle differentiation/hypertrophy in a dose-dependent manner. The alternative use of distinct signaling pathways recruiting either FGFR1 or FGFR4 might explain the dual role of FGF6 in myogenesis. A role for FGF6 in the maintenance of a reserve pool of progenitor cells in the skeletal muscle has been also strongly suggested. The aim of this review is to summarize our knowledge on the involvement of FGF6 in myogenesis.
