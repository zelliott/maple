We have generated transgenic reporter mice to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of thyroid hormone signaling during mouse brain development. The reporter system, utilizing a chimeric yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain-thyroid hormone alpha ligand-binding domain fusion protein to drive lacZ expression, revealed that thyroid hormone signaling starts in the midbrain roof several days before the onset of thyroid gland function, and that it remains highly heterogeneous in the central nervous system throughout pre- and postnatal development. We speculate that this heterogeneity might provide neural cells with positional information during development.
