Circulating neutrophils are essential for innate immunity and undergo rapid, stepwise adhesion to and transmigration through the endothelium following tissue injury and microbial invasion. Neutrophil dysfunction may contribute to morbidity and mortality in acute kidney injury but has not frequently been studied at a mechanistic level. Rossaint et al. provide experimental evidence in mice and humans that acute uremia causes discrete intracellular signaling abnormalities that interfere with specific stages of neutrophil trafficking during inflammation.
