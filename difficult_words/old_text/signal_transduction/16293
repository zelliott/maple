Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are membrane-bound cell-cell communication molecules that regulate the spatial organisation of cells in various tissues by repulsive or adhesive signals arising from contact between EphB- and ephrin-bearing cells. However, the expression and functions of Eph receptors in the gastric epithelium and Brunner's glands are virtually unknown. We detected several EphB receptors and ephrin-B ligands in the pyloric and duodenal mucosa of the adult mouse by RT-PCR amplification. Immunostaining showed complementary expression patterns, with ephrin-B1 being preferentially expressed in the superficial part and EphB receptors in the deeper part of both epithelia. In the gastric pylorus, ephrin-B1 was expressed in pit cells and proliferating cells of the isthmus. In contrast, EphB2, EphB3, and EphB4 were expressed in pyloric glandular cells and proliferating cells of the isthmus. In the duodenum, ephrin-B1 was expressed in cells lining the ducts of Brunner's glands as well as those covering villi and the upper portion of the crypts of Lieberk√ºhn. In contrast, EphB2 and EphB3 were expressed in the gland segment of Brunner's glands and the lower portion of the crypts and EphB4, in the crypts. In both mucosae, EphB2, EphB3, and EphB4 were found to be tyrosine phosphorylated, suggesting that EphB/ephrin-B signalling might occur preferentially in the isthmus, crypts, and duct-gland transition of Brunner's glands, where the receptor and ligand expression overlaps. Based on these findings, we propose that EphB/ephrin-B signalling may regulate cell positioning within the pyloric and duodenal epithelium.
