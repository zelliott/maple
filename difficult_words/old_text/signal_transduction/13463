Gastrulation in vertebrates is a highly dynamic process driven by convergent extension movements of internal mesodermal cells, under the regulatory activity of the Spemann-Mangold or gastrula organizer. In a large-scale screen for genes expressed in the organizer, we have isolated a novel gene, termed Xmc, an acronym for Xenopus marginal coil. Xmc encodes a protein containing two widely spaced evolutionarily non-conserved coiled coils. Xmc protein is found in vesicular aggregates in the cytoplasm and associated with the inner plasma membrane. We show that Xmc is expressed in a dynamic fashion around the blastoporal circumference, in mesodermal cells undergoing morphogenetic movements, in a pattern similar to FGF target genes. Likewise, Xmc expression can be induced by ectopic XeFGF signaling and the early mesodermal expression is dependent on FGF receptor-mediated signaling. Morpholino-mediated translational 'knock-down' of Xmc results in embryos that display a reduced elongation of the antero-posterior axis and in a pronounced inhibition of morphogenetic movements in embryos and dorsal marginal zone explants. Xmc loss-of-function does not interfere with mesoderm induction or maintenance per se. Our results suggest that Xmc is a novel FGF target gene that is required for morphogenetic movements during gastrulation in Xenopus.
