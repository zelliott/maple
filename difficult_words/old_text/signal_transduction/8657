To observe the effect of curcumin on protein kinases on cell signal pathway in breast cancer cell MCF-7.

The suppressive effect of curcumin on MCF-7 cell proliferation as different concentration and at different time points were observed by MTT assay; The activity of p-ERK, p-NF-kappaB, p-p38 and p-JNK were observed by western blot.

The suppressive effect of curcumin was shown as a dose dependent and a time dependent manner,and the IC50 was 22.48 micromol/L 40 micromol/L curcumin inhibited the expression of p-ERK, p-NF-kappaB and p-p38, but not p-JNK.

Curcumin can inhibit MCF-7 cell's proliferation, and its mechanism may be related to the activities of protein kinases on cell signal pathway.
