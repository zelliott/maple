The opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonizes airways of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) with resultant chronic destructive lung disease. P. aeruginosa adaptation to the CF airway includes biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance. Isolates from asymptomatic individuals in the first 3 years of life have unique characteristics, suggesting that adaptation occurs before clinical symptoms. One defined early adaptation is expression of a specific proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is associated with antimicrobial peptide resistance. This CF-specific LPS is induced when P. aeruginosa is grown in medium that is limited for magnesium. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative proteomic approaches were used to define 1,331 P. aeruginosa proteins, of which 145 were differentially expressed on limitation of magnesium. Among proteins induced by low magnesium were enzymes essential for production of 2-heptyl 3-hydroxy 4-quinolone, the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), which interacts with the homoserine lactone signaling pathway. Measurement of PQS in P. aeruginosa isolates from asymptomatic children with CF indicated that strains with increased synthesis of PQS are present during early colonization of CF patient airways.
