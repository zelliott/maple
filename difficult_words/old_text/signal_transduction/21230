We have recently reported the identification and cloning of the gene encoding p59ILK, a novel protein ser/thr kinase that is found in physiologic complexes with beta integrin subunits. ILK is a potential protoonocogene that appears to function in mediating signal transduction by beta 1 family integrins. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of metaphase and decondensed free chromatin fibers localized ILK to 11p15.5-p15.4. This position was also confirmed by relational mapping using well-characterized translocations with breakpoints in chromosome band 11p15. Our results indicate that ILK maps between HBBC and CALC loci, in the 11p15.5-p15.4 band interval. This location may be important in evaluating the potential role of p59ILK in tumorigenesis since it has been shown that this region is associated with both genomic imprinting and loss of heterozygosity in certain types of tumor.
