In a previous work, we identified a Cys(2)/His(2)-type zinc-finger transcription repressor, (ZFT1), that functions in a spermine-mediated signal transduction pathway in tobacco plants. Database search disclosed the presence of another Cys(2)/His(2)-type zinc-finger protein ZFP1 (accession number AAC06243) in tobacco plants. In this work, we characterized ZFP1 and investigated whether this protein is also involved in a Spm-signaling pathway. This factor showed the highest identity to petunia ZPT2-2 and higher similarity to petunia ZPT2-3, Arabidopsis STZ/ZAT10, soybean SCOF-1, red pepper CAZFP1/CaPIF1 as well as to tobacco ZFT1. ZFP1 localized to the nucleus and had a specific DNA-binding activity, supportive to be a transcription factor. Furthermore, the protein had a mild repression activity on transcription in plant cells. The expression of ZFP1, encoding ZFP1, was upregulated during tobacco mosaic virus-induced hypersensitive response. ZFP1 expression was also induced by exogenously applied spermine and its induction was repressed by inhibitors of amine oxidase/polyamine oxidase. Collectively, our data indicate that ZFP1 is a new transcription factor which functions in a spermine-signaling pathway in tobacco.
