We have previously found that bronchial epithelial cells express CCR3 whose signaling elicits mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and cytokine production. Several investigators have focused on the signaling crosstalk between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the role of EGFR in CCR3 signaling in the bronchial epithelial cell line NCI-H292. Eotaxin (1-100 nM) induced dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in NCI-H292 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with the EGFR inhibitor (AG1478) significantly inhibited the MAP kinase phosphorylation induced by eotaxin. Eotaxin stimulated IL-8 production, which was inhibited by AG1478. The transactivation of EGFR through CCR3 is a critical pathway that elicits MAP kinase activation and cytokine production in bronchial epithelial cells. The delineation of the signaling pathway of chemokines will help to develop a new therapeutic strategy to allergic diseases including bronchial asthma.
