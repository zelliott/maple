Ex ovo omnia--all animals come from eggs--this statement made in 1651 by the English physician William Harvey marks a seminal break with the doctrine that all essential characteristics of offspring are contributed by their fathers, while mothers contribute only a material substrate. More than 360 years later, we now have a comprehensive understanding of how haploid gametes are generated during meiosis to allow the formation of diploid offspring when sperm and egg cells fuse. In most species, immature oocytes are arrested in prophase I and this arrest is maintained for few days (fruit flies) or for decades (humans). After completion of the first meiotic division, most vertebrate eggs arrest again at metaphase of meiosis II. Upon fertilization, this second meiotic arrest point is released and embryos enter highly specialized early embryonic divisions. In this review, we discuss how the standard somatic cell cycle is modulated to meet the specific requirements of different developmental stages. Specifically, we focus on cell cycle regulation in mature vertebrate eggs arrested at metaphase II (MII-arrest), the first mitotic cell cycle, and early embryonic divisions.
