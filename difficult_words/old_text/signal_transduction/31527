The emigration of leucocytes into the tissue as a crucial step in the response to inflammatory signals has been acknowledged for more than 100 years. The endothelium does not only represent a mechanical barrier between blood and tissue, the circulatory system also connects different organ systems with each other, thus allowing the communication between remote systems. Leukocytes can function as messengers and messages at the same time. Failure or dysregulation of leucocyte-endothelial communication can severely affect the integrity of the organism. The interaction between leucocytes and the vascular endothelium has been recognised as an attractive target for the therapy of numerous disorders and diseases, including excessive inflammatory responses and autoimmune diseases, both associated with enormous consequences for patients and the health care system. There is promising evidence that the success rate of such treatments will increase as the understanding of the molecular mechanisms keeps improving. This chapter reviews the current knowledge about leucocyte-endothelial interaction. It will also display examples of both physiological and dysregulated leucocyte-endothelial interactions and identify potential therapeutical approaches.
