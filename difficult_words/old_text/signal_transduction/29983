Since its introduction less than 3 years ago, imatinib mesylate (STI571) has altered the entire approach to the therapy of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In addition to its impact on clinical practice, imatinib has also increased the focus of basic and translational CML research on enhancing the cellular effects of imatinib and preventing and overcoming resistance to the drug. Here, I summarize some recent advances in our understanding of the regulatory and signaling mechanisms of Bcr-Abl, with an emphasis on therapeutic implications.
