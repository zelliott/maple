Group behavior in bacterial populations requires intercellular communication, generally by means of self-produced signals. As the model system of bacterial quorum sensing demonstrates, the integration of these 'group' signals with other global regulators can lead to very complex and sophisticated interactions that are not necessarily limited to the signal-producing species alone.
