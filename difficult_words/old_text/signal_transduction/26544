Recent advances demonstrate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPARγ) agonist, pioglitazone, as an anti-inflammatory drug. We investigated the effect of pioglitazone on experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) rats. Pioglitazone was given once daily (10 mg/kg) by oral gavage feeding from day 1-24 (suppressive group) and day 11-24 (therapeutic group). Pioglitazone ameliorated the clinical score of EAN, decreased expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and the activation of NF-κB, while increasing the expression of PPARγ and IL-4. Furthermore, we observed higher expression of PPARγ and IL-4 and lower expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ and reduced activation of NF-κB in suppressive group than those in the therapeutic group, which corresponds to lower clinical score and earlier disease recovery. Our data effectively demonstrate the anti-inflammatory properties of pioglitazone in EAN by inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway.
