We have previously designed antibody-cytokine receptor chimeras that could respond to a cognate antigen. While these chimeric receptors were functional, it has not been investigated exactly how they mimic signal transduction through corresponding wild-type receptors. In this study, we compared the growth properties and the phosphorylation status of intracellular signal transducers between the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR)- or gp130-based chimeric receptors and wild-type EpoR or EpoR-gp130 chimera, respectively. Expression plasmids, encoding V(H) or V(L) region of anti-hen egg lysozyme (HEL) antibody HyHEL-10 tethered to a pair of extracellular D2 domain of EpoR and transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains of either EpoR or gp130, were constructed, and pairs of chimeric receptor combinations (V(H)-EpoR and V(L)-EpoR, V(H)-gp130 and V(L)-gp130, V(H)-EpoR and V(L)-gp130, V(H)-gp130 and V(L)-EpoR) were expressed in an IL-3-dependent myeloid cell line, 32D. Growth assay revealed that the transfectants all grew in a HEL-dependent manner. As for phosphorylation of Stat3, Stat5, ERK and Akt, the chimeric receptors showed similar activation pattern of signalling molecules with wild-type receptors, although the chimeric receptors showed ligand-independency and a little lower maximal phosphorylation than the corresponding wild-type receptors. The results demonstrate that antibody-receptor chimeras could substantially mimic wild-type receptors.
