The objectives of this work were to update and summarize recent experimental works on neuroglobin, mainly focus on its neuroprotective effects and the mechanisms.

The literature was reviewed using PubMed database, and some of the recent findings from our laboratory were included.

Neuroglobin is a recently discovered tissue globin with a high affinity for oxygen and is widely and specifically expressed in neurons of vertebrate's central and peripheral nervous systems. Investigations in the past several years have advanced our knowledge on the functions and mechanisms of neuroglobin, but many issues remain unclear. Emerging reports have shown that overexpression of neuroglobin confers neuroprotection against neuronal hypoxia or ischemia-induced damage in cultured neurons and in cerebral ischemic animal models. Accumulating findings suggest several possible neuroprotective roles and mechanisms including ligand binding and oxygen sensing, modulation of cell signaling pathways and maintenance of mitochondria function.

Emerging experimental works suggest that neuroglobin is neuroprotective against hypoxic/ischemic insults, probably via ligand binding and oxygen sensing, modulation of cell signaling pathways and maintenance of mitochondria function.
