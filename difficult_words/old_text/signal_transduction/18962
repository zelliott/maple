MADS box genes are known to perform important functions in the development of various plant organs. Although the functions of many MADS box genes have previously been elucidated, the biological function of the type I MADS box genes remains poorly understood. In order to understand the function and regulation of the type I MADS box genes, we conducted molecular genetic analyses of AGL28, a member of the Malpha class of type I genes. AGL28 was expressed in vegetative tissues in a photoperiod-independent manner, but not within the reproductive apex. This indicates that AGL28 plays a role in the vegetative phase. Overexpression of AGL28 caused precocious flowering via the upregulation of the expression of FCA and LUMINIDEPENDENS (LD), both floral promoters within the autonomous pathway. However, the loss of AGL28 function did not result in any obvious flowering time phenotype, which suggests that AGL28 may perform a redundant function. Collectively, our data suggest that AGL28 is a positive regulator of known floral promoters within the autonomous pathway in Arabidopsis.
