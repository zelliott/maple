Infants with intestinal failure who are parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependent may develop cholestatic liver injury and cirrhosis (PN-associated liver injury: PNALI). The pathogenesis of PNALI remains incompletely understood. We hypothesized that intestinal injury with increased intestinal permeability combined with administration of PN promotes lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling dependent Kupffer cell (KC) activation as an early event in the pathogenesis of PNALI. We developed a mouse model in which intestinal injury and increased permeability were induced by oral treatment for 4 days with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) followed by continuous infusion of soy lipid-based PN solution through a central venous catheter for 7 (PN7d/DSS) and 28 (PN28d/DSS) days. Purified KCs were probed for transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. PN7d/DSS mice showed increased intestinal permeability and elevated portal vein LPS levels, evidence of hepatocyte injury and cholestasis (serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bile acids, total bilirubin), and increased KC expression of interleukin-6 (Il6), tumor necrosis factor α (Tnfα), and transforming growth factor β (Tgfβ). Markers of liver injury remained elevated in PN28d/DSS mice associated with lobular inflammation, hepatocyte apoptosis, peliosis, and KC hypertrophy and hyperplasia. PN infusion without DSS pretreatment or DSS pretreatment alone did not result in liver injury or KC activation, even though portal vein LPS levels were elevated. Suppression of the intestinal microbiota with broad spectrum antibiotics or ablation of TLR4 signaling in Tlr4 mutant mice resulted in significantly reduced KC activation and markedly attenuated liver injury in PN7d/DSS mice.

These data suggest that intestinal-derived LPS activates KC through TLR4 signaling in early stages of PNALI.
