The first metastasis suppressor gene identified was nm23. Transfection of nm23 into metastatic cell lines resulted in the inhibition of metastasis, but not primary tumor size in vivo. Using in vitro assays, nm23 overexpression resulted in reduced anchorage-independent colonization in response to TGF-beta, reduced invasion and motility in response to multiple factors, and increased differentiation. We hypothesize that the mechanism of action of Nm23 in metastasis suppression involves diminished signal transduction downstream of a particular receptor. Candidate biochemical mechanisms are identified and discussed herein.
