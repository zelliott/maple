Secreted signalling molecules affect the behavior of cells at a distance. Here we discuss how the Wnt family member Wingless reaches distant cells within the embryonic epidermis of Drosophila. We consider three possible mechanisms: free diffusion, restricted diffusion and active transport. We argue that free diffusion is unlikely to occur. However, a variant of restricted diffusion may account for Wingless transport. It may be that Wingless is carried from one side of a cell to the other by a drifting transmembrane protein such as a specific receptor or a glycosaminoglycan. Transfer from cell-to-cell would involve release from the donor cell and recapture in an adjacent cell. Alternatively, Wingless might be transported by a mechanism akin to transcytosis. This would involve the packaging of Wingless in specialized vesicles at one end of a cell, active transport across the cell, and vesicle fusion and Wingless release on the other side. We describe the evidence in favor and against these two alternatives.
