The predominance of insulin resistance, T2D linked pancreatic cancer has increased throughout the world. The insulin/IGF signaling pathway related to insulin resistance, T2D and pancreatic cancer has been described. In this context, we have demonstrated the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and control of miRNAs in insulin/IGF signaling pathway, and pancreatic cancer. In this paper, an overview was depicted about the role of following miRNAs in pancreatic development and insulin secretion (miR-375, miR-7, miR-124a2, miR-195, miR-126, miR-9, miR-96, miR-34a); insulingrowth factor-1 receptor expression (miR-7, miR-139, miR-145, miR-1); the diabetes-associated pancreatic cancer pathway genes such as IRS, PI3K, AKT/PKB (miR-128a, miR-19a, miR-21, miR-29 a/b/c); mTOR protein regulation (miR- 99, miR-21, miR-126, and miR-146a) etc. At last, we have also explained the role of miRNAs in diagnostic marker (miR- 200, miR-21, miR-103, miR-107, and miR-155) and as a therapeutic modulator (miR-34, miR-21, miR-221, and miR-101) in pancreatic cancer.
