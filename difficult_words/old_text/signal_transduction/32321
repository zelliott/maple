A series of individual proteins have been linked to performance in the Morris water maze (MWM) but no global effects have been reported. It was therefore the aim of the study to show which proteins were strain-independent, global factors for training in the MWM. Strains C57BL/6J, apodemus sylvaticus and PWD/PhJ were used. MWM and gels from trained animals were from a previous own study and corresponding yoked groups were generated. Hippocampal proteins were extracted and run on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Spots with different expressional levels between trained and yoked groups were punched and identified by mass spectrometry (nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS, ion trap). Two-way ANOVA with two factors (strain and training) was carried out and a Bonferroni test was used to compare groups. 12 proteins from several pathways and cascades showed different levels in trained mice versus corresponding yoked animals in all strains tested. Four out of these proteins were verified by immunoblotting: beta-synuclein, profilin 2, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NME1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 3. Four proteins verified by immunoblotting could be shown to be involved in training in the MWM as a global effect, independent of the strain tested.
