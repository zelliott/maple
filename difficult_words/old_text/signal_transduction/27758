Apoptosis is an important mechanism for regulating the numbers of monocytes and macrophages. Caspases (cysteine-aspartate-specific proteases) are key molecules in apoptosis and require proteolytic removal of prodomains for activity. Caspase-1 and caspase-3 have both been connected to apoptosis in other model systems. The present study attempted to delineate what role these caspases play in spontaneous monocyte apoptosis. In serum-free conditions, monocytes showed a commitment to apoptosis as early as 4 h in culture, as evidenced by caspase-3-like activity. Apoptosis, as defined by oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, was prevented by a generalized caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK, and the more specific caspase inhibitor, z-DEVD-FMK. The caspase activity was specifically attributable to caspase-3 by the identification of cleavage of procaspase-3 to active forms by immunoblots and by cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate DEVD-AFC. In contrast, a caspase-1 family inhibitor, YVAD-CMK, did not protect monocytes from apoptosis, and the fluorogenic substrate YVAD-AFC failed to show an increase in activity in apoptotic monocytes. When cultured with LPS (1 microgram/ml), monocyte apoptosis was prevented, as was the activation of caspase-3. Unexpectedly, LPS did not change baseline caspase-1 activity. These findings link spontaneous monocyte apoptosis to the proteolytic activation of caspase-3.
