Epithelial cell adhesion is principally regulated by calcium-dependent cell adhesion proteins, termed cadherins. Recent studies indicate that cadherin function is modulated by a class of proteins, termed catenins, that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin. Here we review the evidence that catenins regulate cadherin function in cell-cell adhesion, and discuss their role in initiating cell surface polarity in epithelial cells.
