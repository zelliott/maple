We review current advances in experimental as well as computational modeling and simulation approaches to structural systems biology, whose overall aim is to build quantitative models of signaling networks while retaining the crucial elements of molecular specificity. We briefly discuss the current and emerging experimental and computational methods, particularly focusing on hybrid and multiscale methods, and highlight several applications in cell signaling with quantitative and predictive capabilities. The scope of such models range from delineating protein-protein interactions to describing clinical implications.
