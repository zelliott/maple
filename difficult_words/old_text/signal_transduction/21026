Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor pathway substrate clone 15 (Eps15) has been described as a 142-kDa EGF receptor substrate. It has been shown to bind to the EGF receptor, adaptor protein-2, and clathrin and is present at clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. Upon stimulation of cells with EGF or transforming growth factor alpha, Eps15 becomes rapidly and transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. This phosphorylation coincides with an increase of 8 kDa in molecular mass. Here we show that this increase in molecular mass is not due to tyrosine phosphorylation. Instead, we found both by Western blotting and protein sequencing that this EGF-induced increase in molecular mass is the result of monoubiquitination. Eps15 ubiquitination but not tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited under conditions that blocked EGF-induced internalization of the EGF receptor. Our results establish ubiquitination as a second form of EGF-stimulated covalent modification of Eps15.
