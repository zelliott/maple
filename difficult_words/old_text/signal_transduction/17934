The cellular and molecular events governing bone formation in the embryo, healing of a fractured bone, and induced bone fusion follow a similar pattern. Discovery, purification, and recombinant synthesis of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) constitute a major milestone in the understanding of bone physiology. In this review the author discusses the mechanism of action, clinical applications, dosage, and optimum carriers for BMPs. The roles played by other growth factors are also discussed.
