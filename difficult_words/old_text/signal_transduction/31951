We recently reported the discovery of the novel pyrrolo[3,2-c]quinoline-4-one derivative 1 as a potent inhibitor of Hedgehog (Hh) pathway signaling. However, the PK evaluation of 1 at high dosage (100 mg/kg) revealed the C(max) value 3.63 Î¼g/mL, likely due to poor solubility of this compound. Efforts to improve solubility by reducing the aromatic ring count of the core system led to N-methylpyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine derivative 11. Further optimization of the 3-alkoxy group led to compound 11d with acceptable solubility and potent Hh inhibitory activity. Compound 11d suppressed transcription factor Gli1 mRNA expression in tumor-associated stromal tissue and inhibited tumor growth (treatment/control ratio, 3%) in a mouse medulloblastoma allograft model owing to the improved PK profile based on increased solubility. Compound 11d (TAK-441) is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of advanced solid tumors.
