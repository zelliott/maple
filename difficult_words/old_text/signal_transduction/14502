Mutation in the wound-induced peptide transporter gene AtPTR3 (At5g46050) of Arabidopsis thaliana has been shown to affect germination on media containing a high salt concentration. The heterologous expression in yeast was utilized to verify that the AtPTR3 protein transports di-and tripeptides. The T-DNA insert in the Atptr3-1 mutant in the Arabidopsis ecotype C24 revealed two T-DNA copies, the whole vector sequence, and the gus marker gene inserted in the second intron of the AtPTR3 gene. An almost identical insertion site was found in the Atptr3-2 mutant of the Col-0 ecotype. The AtPTR3 expression was shown to be regulated by several signalling compounds, most clearly by salicylic acid (SA), but also methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and abscisic acid. Real-time PCR experiments suggested that the wound-induction of the AtPTR3 gene was abolished in the SA and JA signalling mutants. The Atptr3 mutant plants had increased susceptibility to virulent pathogenic bacteria Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, and produced more reactive oxygen species when grown on media containing paraquat or rose bengal. Public microarray data suggest that the AtPTR3 expression was induced by Pseudomonas elicitors and by avirulent P. syringae pathovars and type III secretion mutants. This was verified experimentally for the hrpA mutant with real-time PCR. These results suggest that AtPTR3 is one of the defence-related genes whose expression is reduced by virulent bacterium by type III dependent fashion. Our results suggest that AtPTR3 protects the plant against biotic and abiotic stresses.
