Activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is mediated by signal-induced phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, subsequent IkappaBalpha degradation, and then translocation of unbound NF-kappaB to the nucleus. Termination of gene expression occurs when IkappaBalpha binds NF-kappaB subunits (Rel A) in the nucleus. Leptomycin B specifically inhibits export of IkappaBalpha and the inactive IkappaBalpha/Rel A complex via the nuclear export protein exportin 1. We hypothesized that inhibition of IkappaBalpha nuclear export would increase nuclear IkappaBalpha and attenuate NF-kappaB inflammatory gene expression in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. We found that inhibition of exportin 1 causes nuclear accumulation of both endogenous NF-kappaB (Rel A) and IkappaBalpha. IL-1beta causes nuclear accumulation of NF-kappaB (Rel A) but does not increase nuclear IkappaBalpha. Inhibition of exportin 1 before IL-1beta prevented an increase in the nuclear ratio of NF-kappaB (Rel A) to IkappaBalpha and decreases NF-kappaB DNA binding. Furthermore, inhibition of exportin 1 attenuates IL-1beta-induced phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha without affecting IkappaB kinase phosphorylation. Lastly, inhibition of exportin 1 attenuates monocyte chemoattractant protein, IL-8, and intercellular adhesion molecule expression in response to IL-1beta stimulation. We suggest that the decrease in cell activation due to exportin 1 inhibition is a result of termination of NF-kappaB DNA binding due to increased concentration of IkappaBalpha in the nucleus.
