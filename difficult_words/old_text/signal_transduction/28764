Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in macrophages. These molecules are involved in inflammation associated with endotoxic shock. Selenium (Se), a biologically essential trace element, modulates the functions of many regulatory proteins involved in signal transduction and affects a variety of cellular activities, including cell growth and survival. We demonstrate that Se attenuated LPS-induced ROS and NO production in murine macrophage cultures in vitro. This Se-decreased production of NO was demonstrated by decreases in both mRNA and protein expression for inducible NO synthase (iNOS). The preventive effects of Se on iNOS were p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase- and nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent. Se specifically blocked the LPS-induced activation of p38 but not that of c-jun-N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase; the p38-specific pathway was confirmed using p38 inhibitor SB 203580. These results suggest that the mechanism by which Se may act as an anti-inflammatory agent and that Se may be considered as a possible preventive intervention for endotoxemia, particularly in Se-deficient locations. However, the efficacy and safety of Se need to be further investigated, because long-term intake > 0.4 mg Se/day in adults can produce adverse effects.
