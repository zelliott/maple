Plant growth is marked by its adaptability to continuous changes in environment. A regulated, differential distribution of auxin underlies many adaptation processes including organogenesis, meristem patterning and tropisms. In executing its multiple roles, auxin displays some characteristics of both a hormone and a morphogen. Studies on auxin transport, as well as tracing the intracellular movement of its molecular components, have suggested a possible scenario to explain how growth plasticity is conferred at the cellular and molecular level. The plant perceives stimuli and changes the subcellular position of auxin-transport components accordingly. These changes modulate auxin fluxes, and the newly established auxin distribution triggers the corresponding developmental response.
