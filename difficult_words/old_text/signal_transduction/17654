Protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in several cell events including proliferation, survival and differentiation. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of PKC activation on retinal cells proliferation. We demonstrated that PKC activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a tumor promoter phorbol ester, is able to decrease retinal cells proliferation. This effect was mediated by M1 receptors and dependent on intracellular Ca(2+) increase, tyrosine kinase activity, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, polypeptide secretion and activation of TrkB receptors. The effect of PMA was not via activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Carbamylcholine and brain derived neurotrophic factor were both able to decrease retinal cells proliferation to the same level as PMA did. Our results suggest that PKC activation leads to a decrease in retinal cells proliferation through the release of acetylcholine and brain derived neurotrophic factor in the culture, and activation of M1 and TrkB receptors, respectively.
