Here, we show an increase in c-Met receptor expression during reserpine-induced gastric damage in the rat, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Pretreatment of animals with adrenomedullin prevented this increase in c-Met expression. c-Met immunoreactivity was localized in gastric glands. c-Met immunoreactivity was associated with increased phosphorylation of c-Met receptor and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK(1/2)). Our results suggest that both adrenomedullin and c-Met act as parallel defence mechanisms during pharmacologically induced gastric mucosa injury.
