To elucidate the relationship between dsx and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (Dmrt-1) and differentiation, alteration in mRNA levels during differentiation of NEC8 human embryonic carcinoma cells was investigated. After stimulation with 50 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), the cells differentiated into cells with mesenchymal characteristics and upregulated Dmrt-1 mRNA, possibly through the protein kinase C/mitogen-activated protein kinase/activated protein-1 signaling pathway. Conversely, knockdown of Dmrt-1 by small interfering RNA resulted in cell morphology that was different from that after PMA treatment. These results indicated that Dmrt-1 expression was apparently associated with the differentiation of NEC8, and this cell line may be a helpful in vitro tool to clarify the role of Dmrt-1 in the differentiation process.
