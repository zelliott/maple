Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and the synthetic double-stranded RNA poly(I).poly(C) [poly(I.C)] stimulate transcription of the JE gene in BALB/c-3T3 fibroblasts. The response of JE to poly(I.C) does not appear to be channeled through any known component of the PDGF receptor signal transduction apparatus. In addition, JE sequences upstream of the transcription start site are devoid of previously identified poly(I.C)-responsive elements, such as those found in the beta-interferon gene. These data suggest that a novel signal transduction pathway regulates the JE response to PDGF and double-stranded RNA. The c-myc and c-fos proto-oncogenes also respond to this pathway but with poor efficiency. However, this pathway operates very efficiently on other PDGF-inducible genes that encode the secretory proteins KC and M-CSF.
