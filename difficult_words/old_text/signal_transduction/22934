The development of the hormone-secreting cell types in the pituitary gland provides an excellent model system in which to explore the complex transcriptional mechanisms underlying the specification and maintenance of differentiated cell types in mammalian organogenesis. Pituitary development is orchestrated through the combinatorial actions of a repertoire of signaling-gradient-induced transcription factors which, on the basis of their distinct and overlapping expression patterns, and functional interactions, ultimately has led to the generation of functionally distinct cell phenotypes from a common ectodermal primordium.
