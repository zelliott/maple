In recent years, the study of lipid signalling networks has significantly increased. Although best studied in mammalian cells, lipid signalling is now appreciated also in microbial cells, particularly in yeasts and moulds. For instance, microbial sphingolipids and their metabolizing enzymes play a key role in the regulation of fungal pathogenicity, especially in Cryptococcus neoformans, through the modulation of different microbial pathways and virulence factors. Another example is the quorum sensing molecule (QSM) farnesol. In fact, this QSM is involved not only in mycelial growth and biofilm formation of Candida albicans, but also in many stress related responses. In moulds, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, QSM and sphingolipids are important for maintaining cell wall integrity and virulence. Finally, fungal cells make oxylipins to increase their virulence attributes and to counteract the host immune defences. In this review, we discuss these aspects in details.
