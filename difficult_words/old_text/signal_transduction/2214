Extracellular nucleotides like ATP that activate the Ca2+ -phosphatidylinositol (PI) signalling pathway have been suggested to participate in the regulation of normal human thyroid function. We examined, whether P2y-purinergic receptors are expressed on human thyroid cancer cells and whether post-receptor Ca2+ signalling is altered by malignant transformation. Extracellular ATP caused a biphasic increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in normal human thyrocytes and in human follicular (FTC) and papillary (PTC) thyroid carcinoma cells. In FTC and PTC cell lines the dose-response curves for ATP-induced changes in [Ca2+]i were shifted to the right when compared with normal thyrocytes, whereas in undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC) cells even high concentrations of ATP (500 microM) failed to stimulate a rise in [Ca2+]i. By contrast, ATP stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation and capacitative Ca2+ entry was operational as judged by thapsigargin in normal thyrocytes and all thyroid cancer cells. Thus, P2y-purinergic receptors are expressed on thyroid tumor cells independent of degree of differentiation. In UTC cells, however, impairment in the Ca2+ -phosphatidylinositol (PI) signalling cascade occurs distal to the formation of IP3 and proximal to the activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry. Disturbed ATP-induced Ca2+ -signalling and alterations in the Ca2+ -PI signalling cascade may contribute to decreased expression or loss of specific thyroid functions in thyroid cancer cells.
