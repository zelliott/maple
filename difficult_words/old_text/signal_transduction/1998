A practical method of synthesizing a highly selective EP4-receptor agonist 1 using Corey lactone 2 as a key intermediate was developed. Selective methanesulfonylation of the primary alcohol of the diol 8 under the newly devised conditions followed by the protection of the remaining secondary alcohol are key reactions in this new method. Further biological evaluation of 1a-b is also reported.
