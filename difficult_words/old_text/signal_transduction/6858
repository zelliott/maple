The transcription factors ChAP1 and Skn7 of the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus are orthologs of Yap1 and Skn7 in yeast, where they are predicted to work together in a complex. Previous work showed that in C. heterostrophus, as in yeast, ChAP1 accumulates in the nucleus in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The expression of genes whose products counteract oxidative stress depends on ChAP1, as shown by impaired ability of a Δchap1 mutant to induce these 'antioxidant' genes. In this study, we found that under oxidative stress, antioxidant gene expression is also partially impaired in the Δskn7 mutant but to a milder extent than in the Δchap1 mutant, whereas in the double mutant - Δchap1-Δskn7 - none of the tested genes was induced, with the exception of one catalase gene, CAT2. Both single mutants are capable of infecting the plant, showing similar virulence to the WT. The double mutant, however, showed clearly decreased virulence, pointing to additive contributions of ChAP1 and Skn7. Possible mechanisms are discussed, including additive regulation of gene expression by oxidative stress.
