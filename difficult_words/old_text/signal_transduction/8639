Human herpesviruses (HHVs) are widespread pathogens involved in proliferative diseases, inflammatory conditions, and cardiovascular diseases. During evolution, homologs of human chemokine receptors were integrated into the HHV genomes. In addition to binding endogenous chemokines, these viral G protein-coupled receptors (vGPCRs) have acquired the ability to signal in a constitutive manner. Ligand-induced and ligand-independent and autocrine and paracrine signaling properties of vGPCRs modify the functions of the expressing cells and lead to transformation and escape from immune surveillance. Furthermore, cross-talk or heterodimerization with endogenous chemokine receptors represent other ways for vGPCRs to modify intracellular signaling and cellular functions. As such, these viral receptors seem to play a prominent role during viral pathogenesis and life cycle and thus represent innovative antiviral therapies.
