Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic liver disease are both very harmful to human health almost all over the world, which lead to the fibrosis of the two organs ultimately. Currently, there are few satisfactory therapeutic methods in treating the two diseases. Some research works from Chinese medicine and Western medicine were done in the area recently, the results showed that kidney and liver fibrosis shared similar biological signals and events such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and transforming growth factor Î² 1, the same herbal mesenchymal medicine exhibited significantly improving effects on both liver fibrosis and kidney fibrosis by involving similar mechanism. This coincides with the theory of homogeny of Liver (Gan) and Kidney (Shen) of Chinese medicine. It would provides new clues in exploring the treatment of liver fibrosis and kidney fibrosis.
