Several signal transduction pathways have been implicated in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), yet the signal transduction mechanisms behind the maintenance-expression phase of LTP are still poorly understood. We investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) in LTP at Schaffer collateral/commissural fiber-CA1 synapses in rat hippocampal slices using biochemical approaches and extracellular electrophysiological recordings. We observed that PI3-kinase activity was induced in the CA1 region during LTP of field EPSPs (fEPSPs) and that two structurally unrelated PI3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, abated established LTP, suggesting that PI3-kinase is involved in the maintenance-expression phase of LTP. However, LTP recovered after washout of the reversible PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, confirming that LTP maintenance and expression are distinct events and indicating that PI3-kinase activity is required for LTP expression rather than for its maintenance. Interestingly, preincubation with LY294002 did not prevent LTP induction. In fact, if LY294002 was withdrawn 5 min after high-frequency stimulation, an LTP of fEPSP was seen. Last, a voltage-dependent calcium channel-dependent form of LTP in the CA1 could also be reversibly abated by LY294002, raising the possibility that PI3-kinase could be required for the expression of multiple forms of synaptic potentiation.
