Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (Angptl3)-lipoprotein lipase (LPL) pathway may be a useful pharmacologic target for hyperlipidemia. The present study was conducted to test the effect of soluble fiber extracted from Undaria pinnatifida (UP), on hyperlipidemia in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. Forty mice were divided into four groups (n = 10): control group (C57BL/6J mice), ApoE(-/-) mice group, and two groups of ApoE(-/-) mice treated with UP fiber (5 or 10 % per day). UP soluble fiber treatment significantly decreased plasma and hepatic total cholesterol, triglycerides levels, plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and malondialdehyde concentrations and increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and downregulated protein expression of Angptl3 concomitantly with upregulated protein expression of LPL. In addition, T0901317 caused elevated expression of hepatic Angptl3 protein, and the effect of T0901317 was also abrogated by UP soluble fiber in C57BL/6J mice. The present results suggest that the UP soluble fiber regulates Angptl3-LPL pathway to lessen hyperlipidemia in mice.
