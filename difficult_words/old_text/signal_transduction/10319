The intrinsic features of naive CD4 T cells that affect their ability to respond to polarizing signals for Th cell differentiation are not well understood. In this study, we show that naive CD4 T cells from mice transgenic for the Hlx gene expressed lower levels of IL-4Ralpha. The down-regulation of IL-4Ralpha diminished IL-4 signaling and the Th2 response and enhanced the Th1 response under suboptimal polarizing conditions. In nontransgenic CD4 T cells, blocking IL-4Ralpha with Abs had the same effect in an Ab dose-dependent manner. Conversely, Hlx haploinsufficiency caused higher expression of IL-4Ralpha to favor Th2 cell differentiation. Thus, the IL-4Ralpha level on naive CD4 T cells is genetically controlled by Hlx and determines the ratio of Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation.
