An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that growth factor networks are highly interactive with estrogen receptor signaling in the control of breast cancer growth. As such, tumor responses to antiestrogens are likely to be a composite of the estrogen receptor and growth factor-inhibitory activity of these agents, with alterations/aberrations in growth factor signaling providing a mechanism for the development of antiestrogen resistance. In this light, the current article focuses on illustrating the relationship between growth factor signaling and antiestrogen failure in our in-house tumor models of breast cancer and describing how we are now beginning to successfully target growth factor activity to improve the effects of antiestrogen drugs and to block aggressive disease progression.
