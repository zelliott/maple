Chemotherapeutics target rapidly dividing cancer cells by directly or indirectly inducing DNA damage. Upon recognizing DNA damage, cells initiate a variety of signaling pathways collectively referred to as the DNA damage response (DDR). Interestingly, the pathways used to elicit this response are as varied as the types of DNA damage induced. However, the activation of these various pathways has similar results including DNA repair, suppression of global general translation, cell cycle arrest and, ultimately, either cell survival or cell death. This review will focus on a series of chemotherapy-induced DNA lesions and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the DDR, the DNA repair pathways it activates and the cellular consequences of these converging pathways.
