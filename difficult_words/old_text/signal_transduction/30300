It is well known that the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis is an important regulator of foetal growth and in recent years, it has been suggested that the ligands IGF-I and IGF-II may, in part, mediate this effect by promoting proper placental development and function. In other tissues, IGF effects on metabolism, proliferation and differentiation are primarily mediated via IGF binding protein-regulated interaction of IGFs with the type 1 IGF receptor and therefore here, we review the placental expression and postulated role, of each of the IGF axis components and discuss the cellular mechanisms through which these effects are exerted.
