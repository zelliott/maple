In vitro studies of activation and proliferation induced by mitogens in the presence of Cyclosporin A (CsA) and or cytokines were carried out to determine the effects of CsA and cytokines on mitogen activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from thirteen Hashimoto's disease patients (HP) and ten healthy controls. The proliferative response (PR) of PBMC from HP to mitogens at 7 days of culture was higher than in controls. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) addition significantly increased the PR in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated PBMC from HP, but not in controls. CsA inhibited in a dose dependent manner the PR, as well as the expression of activation antigens induced by mitogens in both groups of subjects, but PBMC from HP were sensitive to CsA at lower doses than those that were effective on PBMC from controls. Both IL-2 or IL-4 overcame the inhibitory effect of CsA on PBMC from HP and controls. Conversely, IL-10 or IFN-alpha addition increases the inhibitory effect of CsA on the PR of PBMC from both HP and controls. We conclude that PBMC from Hashimoto's disease patients shown an abnormal pattern of PR that is associated to increased PR to mitogens and higher sensitivity to immunomodulatory effects of IL-2 and CsA.
