Prolonged use of glucocorticoids induces pronounced insulin resistance in vivo. In vitro, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with dexamethasone for 48 h reduces the maximal level of insulin- and stress (arsenite)-induced glucose uptake by approximately 50%. Although phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling was slightly attenuated, phosphorylation of its downstream effectors such as protein kinase B and protein kinase C-lambda remained intact. Nor was any effect of dexamethasone treatment observed on insulin- or arsenite-induced translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) toward the plasma membrane. However, for a maximal response to either arsenite- or insulin-induced glucose uptake in these cells, functional p38 MAPK signaling is required. Dexamethasone treatment markedly attenuated p38 MAPK phosphorylation coincident with an up-regulation of the MAPK phosphatases MKP-1 and MKP-4. Employing lentivirus-mediated ectopic expression in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes demonstrated a differential effect of these phosphatases: whereas MKP-1 was a more potent inhibitor of insulin-induced glucose uptake, MKP-4 more efficiently inhibited arsenite-induced glucose uptake. This coincided with the effects of these phosphatases on p38 MAPK phosphorylation, i.e. MKP-1 and MKP-4 attenuated p38 MAPK phosphorylation by insulin and arsenite, respectively. Taken together, these data provide evidence that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes dexamethasone inhibits the activation of the GLUT4 in the plasma membrane by a p38 MAPK-dependent process, rather than in a defect in GLUT4 translocation per se.
