We have used a human salivary gland cell line (HSG) as a possible in vitro model to evaluate the effects of IFN-gamma on human salivary gland epithelium (Wu et al., 1994, 1996, 1997). In the present study, we examined the JAK-STAT signal-transduction pathway in IFN-gamma-treated HSG cells. We demonstrate that JAK2 and Stat1 are phosphorylated at tyrosine residues in a time- and concentration-dependent manner following exposure to IFN-gamma. In addition, we show that activation of this signalling pathway is decreased by the addition of a blocking antibody to the IFN-gamma receptor. The same maneuver is also able to reduce by approximately 50-70% the surface expression of two IFN-gamma-induced immunoregulatory molecules: HLA-DR and ICAM-1. These results demonstrate that the JAK2 and Stat1 signalling pathway is active in salivary-derived epithelial cells and may contribute to their immunopathologic destruction.
