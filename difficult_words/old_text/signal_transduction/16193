The mechanisms regulating the emergence of BM prothymocytes remain poorly characterized. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses looking for genes expressed in human prothymocytes led to the identification of AF1q/MLLT11 as a candidate gene conceivably involved in this process. Analysis of AF1q protein subcellular localization and intracellular trafficking showed that despite pronounced karyophily, it was subjected to constitutive nuclear export followed by ubiquitin-mediated degradation in the centrosomal area. Using in vitro assays based on either forced expression or shRNA-mediated silencing of AF1q, we provide evidence that the protein promotes T- over B-cell differentiation in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. At the molecular level, AF1q confers to multipotent progenitors an increased susceptibility to Delta-like/Notch-mediated signaling. Consistent with these findings, enforced AF1q expression in humanized mice fosters the emergence of BM CD34(+)CD7(+) prothymocytes, enhances subsequent thymus colonization, and accelerates intrathymic T-cell development. In contrast, AF1q silencing provokes a global shift of BM lymphopoiesis toward the B-cell lineage, hinders prothymocyte development, inhibits thymus colonization, and leads to intrathymic accumulation of B cells. Our results indicate that AF1q cooperates with the Notch signaling pathway to foster the emergence of BM prothymocytes and drive subsequent intrathymic specification toward the T-cell lineage.
