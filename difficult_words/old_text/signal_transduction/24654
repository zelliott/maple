Protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown to be involved in the mitogenic response and in oncogenic cell transformation in many experimental models. We analyzed the expression of PKC in both highly purified leukemic T cells freshly isolated from adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients and control T lymphocytes obtained from healthy volunteers. PKC activity was decreased in the ATL cells as compared with the control T cells. Cytosolic PKC activity in the ATL cells was remarkably decreased, whereas particulate membrane PKC activity was similar to the control level. The percentage of PKC activity in the particulate fraction was 34% in the ATL cells and 19% in the control cells. Regarding the altered subcellular localization of PKC activity, phorbol ester-induced translocation of cytosolic PKC was inhibited in some ATL cases. Similarly to the decrease in PKC activity, there was a decrease in the expression of the major PKC isozymes II(beta) and III(alpha) in ATL cells. These results suggest impaired regulation of PKC expression in ATL as well as in many experimental cancers.
