Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with a complex pathogenesis. It is often associated with an increased vascular resistance, whilst in the more advanced stages there is a remodelling of the vascular walls. PAH has an intricate involvement of various signaling pathways, including the ras homolog family member A (RhoA)-Rho kinase (ROCK) axis. Currently, available therapies are not always able to significantly slow PAH progression. Therefore, newer approaches are needed.

In this review, areas covered include the role of the RhoA/ROCK in PAH pathogenesis and the plausibility of its therapeutic targeting. Furthermore, various inhibitory compounds are discussed, including Fasudil and SB-772077-B.

Currently, specific RhoA/ROCK inhibition is the most promising therapeutic approach for PAH. Research has shown that it suppresses both the components of this axis and the upstream upregulating mediators. An inhaled RhoA/ROCK inhibitor may be a successful future therapy; however, further clinical trials are needed to support this approach.
