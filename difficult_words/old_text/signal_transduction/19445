The retina is one of the most essential elements of vision pathway in vertebrate. The dysplasia of retina cause congenital blindness or vision disability in individuals, and the misbalance in adult retinal vascular homeostasis leads to neovascularization-associated diseases in adults, such as diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration. Many developmental signaling pathways are involved in the process of retinal development and vascular homeostasis. Among them, Notch signaling pathway has long been studied, and Notch signaling-interfered mouse models show both neural retina dysplasia and vascular abnormality. In this review, we discuss the roles of Notch signaling in the maintenance of retinal progenitor cells, specification of retinal neurons and glial cells, and the sustaining of retina vascular homeostasis, especially from the aspects of conditional knockout mouse models. The potential of Notch signal manipulation may provide a powerful cell fate- and neovascularization-controlling tool that could have important applications in treatment of retinal diseases.
