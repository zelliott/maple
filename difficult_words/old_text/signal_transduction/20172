Allosteric interactions: Metal(II) cyclens inhibit Ras-effector interactions by stabilizing a weak effector-binding state of Ras, state 1(T), and binding directly in the active site. The novel state (1T) inhibitor Zn(2+)-BPA (BPA = bis(2-picolyl)amine) binds outside the nucleotide binding pocket but nevertheless allosterically stabilizes state 1(T) and thus inhibits the Ras-Raf interaction.
