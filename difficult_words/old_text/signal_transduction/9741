Toll-like receptors are important pattern recognition receptors which have key roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses. They are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, Toll-like receptors have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of several skin diseases such as skin infections, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, lichen planus, Beh√ßet's disease, leprosy, syphilis, Lyme disease, atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, non-melanoma skin cancers and melanoma. In this manuscript, the structure and functions of Toll-like receptors in immune responses, their impact on skin diseases and recent advances on therapeutic usage have been reviewed.
