Members of the ErbB (epidermal growth factor receptor) family of receptor tyrosine kinases are important in etiology of human mammary carcinoma, and are rational targets for cancer therapy. The frequent selection of ErbB2/HER2/Neu, and, less often, the epidermal growth factor receptor, and ErbB3 for overexpression in breast cancer implies that these receptors have important functions in normal mammary development. Better understanding of ErbBs in mammary development may yield important dividends for development and deployment of cancer therapies. The roles of these receptors and their ligands in mammary development are discussed, with an emphasis on new insights from genetic analysis of the receptors in mice.
