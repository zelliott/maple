It has been proposed that a localized calcium (Ca) signal at the growing end of the cleavage furrow triggers cleavage furrow formation in large eggs. We have examined the possible role of a Ca signal in cleavage furrow formation in the Xenopus laevis egg during the first cleavage. We were able to detect two kinds of Ca waves along the cleavage furrow. However, the Ca waves appeared after cleavage furrow formation in late stages of the first cleavage. In addition, cleavage was not affected by injection of dibromoBAPTA or EGTA into the eggs at a concentration sufficient to suppress the Ca waves. Furthermore, even smaller classes of Ca release such as Ca puffs and Ca blips do not occur at the growing end of the cleavage furrow. These observations demonstrate that localized Ca signals in the cleavage furrow are not involved in cytokinesis. The two Ca waves have unique characteristics. The first wave propagates only in the region of newly inserted membrane along the cleavage furrow. On the other hand, the second wave propagates along the border of new and old membranes, suggesting that this wave might be involved in adhesion between two blastomeres.
