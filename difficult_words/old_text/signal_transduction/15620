The growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) is a ubiquitously expressed and evolutionary conserved adapter protein possessing a plethora of described interaction partners for the regulation of signal transduction. In B lymphocytes, the Grb2-mediated scaffolding function controls the assembly and subcellular targeting of activating as well as inhibitory signalosomes in response to ligation of the antigen receptor. Also, integration of simultaneous signals from B-cell coreceptors that amplify or attenuate antigen receptor signal output relies on Grb2. Hence, Grb2 is an essential signal integrator. The key question remains, however, of how pathway specificity can be maintained during signal homeostasis critically required for the balance between immune cell activation and tolerance induction. Here, we summarize the molecular network of Grb2 in B cells and introduce a proteomic approach to elucidate the interactome of Grb2 in vivo.
