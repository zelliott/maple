Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are thought to be responsible for dermal photoaging in human skin. In the present study, we evaluated the involvement of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in MMP-1 expression under ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation in cultured human dermal fibroblasts. UVA (20 J/cm(2)) up-regulates MIF production, and UVA-induced MMP-1 mRNA production is inhibited by an anti-MIF antibody. MIF (100 ng/ml) was shown to induce MMP-1 in cultured human dermal fibroblasts. We found that MIF (100 ng/ml) enhanced MMP-1 activity in cultured fibroblasts assessed by zymography. Moreover, we observed that fibroblasts obtained from MIF-deficient mice were much less sensitive to UVA regarding MMP-13 expression than those from wild-type BALB/c mice. Furthermore, after UVA irradiation (10 J/cm(2)), dermal fibroblasts of MIF-deficient mice produced significantly decreased levels of MMP-13 compared with fibroblasts of wild-type mice. Next we investigated the signal transduction pathway of MIF. The up-regulation of MMP-1 mRNA by MIF stimulation was found to be inhibited by a PKC inhibitor (GF109203X), a Src-family tyrosine kinase inhibitor (herbimycin A), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein), a PKA inhibitor (H89), a MEK inhibitor (PD98089), and a JNK inhibitor (SP600125). In contrast, the p38 inhibitor (SB203580) was found to have little effect on expression of MMP-1 mRNA. We found that PKC-pan, PKC alpha/beta II, PKC delta (Thr505), PKC delta (Ser(643)), Raf, and MAPK were phosphorylated by MIF. Moreover, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of PKC alpha/beta II and MAPK in response to MIF was suppressed by genistein, and herbimycin A as well as by transfection of the plasmid of C-terminal Src kinase. The DNA binding activity of AP-1 was significantly up-regulated 2 h after MIF stimulation. Taken together, these results suggest that MIF is involved in the up-regulation of UVA-induced MMP-1 in dermal fibroblasts through PKC-, PKA-, Src family tyrosine kinase-, MAPK-, c-Jun-, and AP-1-dependent pathways.
