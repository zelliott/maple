The effects of melafen (plant growth stimulant) on membrane structure and functions of animal cells were studied. The process of signal transduction from cell surface to intracellular structures and conformation changes in membranes in the presence of this substance were studied by light scatter and differential scanning microcalorimetry. Melafen in a wide range of concentrations (10(-13)-10(-3) M) inhibited Ca(2+) signal system involved in the function of Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) and Cl(-) channels in Ehrlich ascitic carcinoma cells. Being a hydrophilic substance, melafen had little effect on the lipid phase of artificial membranes, but impaired the function state of transformed cell. The importance of studies of transformed cells causes no doubt because of increasing incidence of diseases associated with uncontrolled cell division.
