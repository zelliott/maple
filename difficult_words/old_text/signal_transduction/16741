Gibberellins (GAs) are a family of plant hormones controlling many aspects of plant growth and development including stem elongation, germination, and the transition from vegetative growth to flowering. Cloning of the genes encoding GA biosynthetic and inactivating enzymes has led to numerous insights into the developmental regulation of GA hormone accumulation that is subject to both positive and negative feedback regulation. Genetic and biochemical analysis of GA-signaling genes has revealed that posttranslational regulation of DELLA protein accumulation is a key control point in GA response. The highly conserved DELLA proteins are a family of negative regulators of GA signaling that appear subject to GA-stimulated degradation through the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway. This review discusses the regulation of GA hormone accumulation and signaling in the context of its role in plant growth and development.
