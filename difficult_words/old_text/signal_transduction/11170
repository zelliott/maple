Despite recent efforts to understand the neurobiology of Bipolar Disorder (BD), the exact pathophysiology remains undetermined. Due to the effects of various psychopharmacological agents, initial research focused on the study of biogenic amines. Recent evidence has shown that dysfunction in intracellular signaling systems and gene expression may be associated with BD. These alterations may cause interruptions in mood regulating circuits such as the limbic system, striatum and prefrontal cortex, and the neuroprotective effects of mood stabilizers may reverse this pathological process. This study aims to update the recent findings relative to the neurochemistry of BD.
