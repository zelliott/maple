To investigate the effect of DADLE, a δ-opioid receptor agonist, on the proliferation of human liver cancer HepG2 cells and explore the mechanism involving PKC pathway.

HepG2 cells were treated with DADLE at different doses (0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 µmol/L). Cell viability was determined using methyl thiazolyl terazolium (MTT) assay. The expression of PKC mRNA and p-PKC protein were examined by RT-PCR and Western blot assay. After treated separately with DADLE plusing NAL or PMA, the cell cycle of HepG2 cells was analyzed by flow cytometer. MTT was used to detect their proliferation capacity and Western blot was used to examine the p-PKC expression. The growth inhibitory rate of HepG2 cells treated with DADLE and cis-diammine dichloridoplatinum (CDDP) was analyzed.

DADLE at different concentrations showed an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HepG2 cells though inhibiting the expression of PKC mRNA and p-PKC protein. The results of flow cytometry showed that compared with the control group, the percentage of S + G(2)/M cells in DADLE-treated group was lowered by 3.94% (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, after treated with NAL and PMA, the percentage was elevated by 3.22% and 3.63%, respectively (P < 0.01). The MTT and Western blot assays showed that compared with the control group, the values of A570 and p-PKC protein levels in the HepG2 cells of DADLE-treated group were significantly decreased (P < 0.01). After treatment with NAL and PMA, the values of A570 and p-PKC protein levels were elevated significantly (P < 0.01). The growth inhibitory rate of DADLE + CDDP group was 79.9%, significantly lower than 25.2% and 43.2% of the DADLE and CDDP groups, respectively.

Activation of δ-opioid receptor by DADLE inhibits the apoptosis of human liver cancer HepG2 cells. The underlying mechanism may be correlated with PKC pathway. DADLE can enhance the chemosensitivity of HepG2 cells to CDDP.
