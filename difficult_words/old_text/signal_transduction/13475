Serotonin has been shown to be a neuromodulator in the Aplysia californica CNS. The diversity of serotonin actions is due to the existence of several different receptor subtypes. In this study we report the cloning of a full-length cDNA, coding for a novel serotonin receptor (5-HTap2). The receptor protein bears the characteristics of G protein-coupled receptors. It shares 68% and 34% of its amino acid sequence identity with the 5-HTlym receptor from Lymnaea stagnalis and the mammalian 5-HT1A receptor, respectively. When transfected in HEK 293 cells, 5-HTap2 was negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. Ligand binding analysis indicated that the order of potencies of various drugs for the inhibition of [3H]LSD binding was: methiothepin > metergoline > 5-CT > PAPP > 5-HT > ketanserin > NAN-190 > 8-OH-DPAT > clozapine. RT-PCR amplification of RNA isolated from different tissues indicated that this receptor is expressed in the CNS and in bag cells. The expression of 5-HTap2 restricted to the CNS suggests an important role for this receptor in the modulation of neuronal functions in Aplysia. Moreover, the high expression of 5-HTap2 in the bag cells, associated with its pharmacological profile, suggests that this receptor may be implicated in modulating the afterdischarge during the egg-laying behavior.
