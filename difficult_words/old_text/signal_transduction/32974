Over a dose range up to 50 Gy of low-LET (linear energy transfer) ionizing radiation and up to 5 kJ/m2 UVB, mammalian cells convert molecular damage into productive response (mostly gain of function). By inactivation of negative regulatory components, such as protein tyrosine phosphatases as one mechanism discovered, the balance between restraining and stimulating influences is disturbed and an increase in signal flow results. Also DNA damage causing transcriptional arrest produces a signalling cascade of as yet unknown details. Such stimulation of the intracellular communication network can lead to apoptosis, elevated cell cycling and differentiation processes possibly including repair and recombination. The outcome likely depends on integration of all signals received which is as yet ill-understood. Although accurate determinations of low-dose inductions have not been achieved for technical reasons, the dose-response curves of induced signal transduction likely show threshold characteristics, in contrast to the direct consequences of DNA damage.
