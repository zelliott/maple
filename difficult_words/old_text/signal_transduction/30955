The past five years have seen a steady accumulation of data reinforcing the view that Rab-regulated recycling pathways contribute to cell migration. In particular, detailed descriptions have emerged of the mechanisms that recruit integrins and growth factor receptors to Rab4- and Rab11-driven pathways. Recent work provides new insight into the importance of particular recycling events in cell migration within a variety of physiological contexts.
