We examined the level of 1,2-diacylglycerol and inositol phosphates in normal and EJ-H-ras-transformed BALB/3T3 fibroblasts by prelabelling the cells with [3H]glycerol, [3H]inositol, [14C]glucose, [14C]arachidonic acid, and [14C]palmitic acid. Steady-state level of inositol phosphates, however, was the same in control and transformed cells. Diacyglycerol labelling by [14C]arachidonic acid was the same in control and transformed cells. Insulin dramatically increased diacylglycerol labeling by [14C]glucose in normal cells, whereas it did not affect ras-transformed fibroblasts. Neurotransmitter-induced inositol lipid turnover was greatly enhanced in ras-transformed cells; conversely, platelet-derived growth factor and thrombin-stimulated normal cells to a greater extent than transformed fibroblasts. Taken together these results suggest that ras transformation may induce multifarious effects on signal transduction: it may cause de novo synthesis of diacylglycerol and subversion of neurotransmitter and growth factor receptor coupling to inositol lipid metabolism.
