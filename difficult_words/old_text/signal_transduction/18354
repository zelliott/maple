Using an inducible gene expression system (Tet-ON system), the role of NGFI-A gene during the neuronal differentiation of PCI2 cells was examined. When NGFI-A was transiently over-expressed, no obvious effects on cell proliferation or neurite outgrowth were observed. Interestingly, however, NGFI-A over-expression resulted in significant retardation in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Similar suppressive effects were observed also on the v-K-ras-induced neurite outgrowth. These results raise the possibility that NGFI-A protein may play some negative role in NGF signaling.
