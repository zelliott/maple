We carried out studies with Escherichia coli to determine the site at which the methylation-independent pathways for taxis to oxygen and to sugars of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system converge with the methylation-dependent chemotaxis pathways. Using genetic reconstitution of the pathways in a null strain, we determined that all pathways examined required the products of the genes cheA, cheW, and cheY. Thus, we conclude that both the methylation-independent and methylation-dependent pathways converge at CheA, the histidine kinase product of cheA.
