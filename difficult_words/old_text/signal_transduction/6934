However, the effect of ABA on virus infection is not fully understood. Here, we describe the effects of the ABA pathway on the accumulation of Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in two different hosts: Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. We report that ABA2 plays a critical role in the accumulation of BaMV and CMV. Mutants downstream of ABA2 (aao3, abi1-1, abi3-1, and abi4-1) were susceptible to BaMV, indicating that the ABA pathway downstream of ABA2 is essential for BaMV resistance. The aba2-1 mutant decreased the accumulation of BaMV (+)RNA, (-)RNA, and coat protein, with the most dramatic effect being observed for (-)RNA. These findings were further validated by the use of virus-induced gene silencing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in N. benthamiana. In addition, infecting N. benthamiana with BaMV or CMV increased ABA contents and activated the SA and ABA pathways, thereby disrupting the antagonism between these two cascades. Our findings uncover a novel role for ABA2 in supporting BaMV and CMV accumulation, distinct from the opposing role of its downstream genes.
