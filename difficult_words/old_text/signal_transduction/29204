We investigated the estrogenic activity of Cirsium japonicum water extracts, which have long been used to treat vascular-related diseases. The activity of the extracts was characterized in a transient transfection system, using estrogen receptor isoforms and estrogen-responsive luciferase plasmids in HEK 293 cells. The extract activated both and estrogen receptors. Activation was inhibited by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780, indicating that the effects were mediated through the estrogen receptor isoforms. Treatment with the extracts increased expression of the progesterone receptor and pS2 genes and expression of estrogen receptor was decreased in MCF-7 cells. These results suggested that the Cirsium japonicum water extracts showed estrogenic effects and may be a potential clinical application for treatment of estrogen related vascular diseases.
