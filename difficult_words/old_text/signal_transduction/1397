We describe here a regulated and highly active K+ uptake pathway in potato (Solanum tuberosum), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), and maize (Zea mays) mitochondria. K+ transport was not inhibited by ATP, NADH, or thiol reagents, which regulate ATP-sensitive K+ channels previously described in plant and mammalian mitochondria. However, K+ uptake was completely prevented by quinine, a broad spectrum K+ channel inhibitor. Increased K+ uptake in plants leads to mitochondrial swelling, respiratory stimulation, heat release, and the prevention of reactive oxygen species formation. This newly described ATP-insensitive K+ import pathway is potentially involved in metabolism regulation and prevention of oxidative stress.
