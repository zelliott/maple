Dependence of basal cell carcinomas and medulloblastomas on the Hedgehog pathway provides an opportunity for targeted or "personalized" therapy. The recent effectiveness and FDA approval of the first Smoothened inhibitors validates this class of agents, but has revealed drug-resistant tumor variants that bypass Smoothened inhibition. Here, we summarize the effectiveness of Hedgehog pathway inhibitors and highlight promising areas for the development of next generation drug antagonists for Hedgehog-dependent cancers.
