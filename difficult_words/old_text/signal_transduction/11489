In many tissues in many organisms, messenger RNA (mRNA) is not randomly distributed throughout a cell, but is targeted and accumulated in specific subcellular locations. Signal transduction pathways can be extremely sensitive to gradients of signaling proteins and represent a cellular phenomenon where RNA localization may be important. Manseau discusses how targeting of the RNA for a secreted ligand, Wingless (Wg), is important in promoting proper Wg signaling in early Drosophila embryos and the mechanism for achieving this subcellular targeting. The possible mechanistic models for how restricted wg mRNA distribution influences Wg signaling are also detailed.
