Integrins play a key role in cellular immune responses in a variety of organisms; however, knowledge of integrins and their effects on cell signalling and functional responses in molluscan defence reactions is poor. Using integrin-mediated cell adhesion kits, alphaVbeta3 and beta1 integrin-like subunits were identified on the surface of Lymnaea stagnalis haemocytes. Haemocyte binding via these integrins was found to be dependent on Ca2+/Mg2+. Western blotting with an anti-phospho (anti-active) focal adhesion kinase (FAK) antibody revealed a 120-125 kDa FAK-like protein in these cells; this protein was transiently phosphorylated upon haemocyte adhesion over 90 min, with maximal phosphorylation occurring after 30 min binding. Also, integrin engagement with the tetrapeptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) resulted in a rapid increase in phosphorylation of the FAK-like protein; however, RGDS did not affect the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Treatment of haemocytes with RGDS (2 mM) inhibited phagocytosis of E. coli bioparticles by 88%. Moreover, at this concentration, RGDS reduced cell spreading by 61%; stress fiber formation was also impaired. Taken together, these results demonstrate a role for integrins in L. stagnalis haemocyte adhesion and defence reactions and, for the first time, link integrin engagement to FAK activation in molluscs.
