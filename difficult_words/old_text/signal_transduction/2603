A panel of human CD4+ T cell clones was utilized to dissect and analyze the biochemical consequences of activation of CD3 or CD28. To molecularly characterize receptor-activated proximal signaling events, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins co-precipitating with a Grb2 fusion protein after receptor activation were analyzed. Ligation of CD28, but not other costimulatory molecules, induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of two previously identified Grb2 binding proteins (pp76 and pp116). A third Grb2 binding protein (pp36) was extensively tyrosine phosphophorylated in response to combined CD3 and CD28 activation, but not in response to ligation of either receptor alone. cAMP and co-ligation of CD45 affected the receptor-activated tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb2-associated proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrated that two signaling molecules, Vav and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI(3)K), also interacted with the Grb2 protein complex. The activity of PI(3)K was required for T cell activation, because wortmannin, a PI(3)K inhibitor, blocked T cell proliferation and cytokine production induced by ligation of CD3 and CD28. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in activated human T cell clones, the composition of Grb2 protein complex is modulated by costimulatory signals and cAMP, which may be important for the regulation of intracellular signal transduction.
