MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional and/or translational level by binding loosely complimentary sequences in the 3'untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs. Increased expressions of several miRNAs, specifically hsa-miR-21, have been reported to modulate glioma development. Here we report downregulation of miR-451 in A172, LN229 and U251 human glioblastoma cells. Increased expression of miR-451 by administration of miR-451 mimics oligonucleotides reversed the biology of each of the three cell lines, inhibiting cell growth, inducing G0/G1 phase arrest and increasing cell apoptosis. Further, treatment with miR-451 mimics oligonucleotides diminished the invasive capacity of these cells, as the number of cells invading through matrigel was significantly decreased. Akt1, CyclinD1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and Bcl-2 protein expression decreased, and p27 expression increased in a dose-dependent manner with miR-451 mimics oligonucleotides. Taken together, these studies reveal miR-451 impacts glioblastoma cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis, perhaps via regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. We propose an essential role for miR-451 as a tumor-suppressor of human glioma.
