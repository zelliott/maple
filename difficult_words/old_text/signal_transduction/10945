RET is the receptor for glial-derived neurotrophic factor growth factors. It is a paradigm of a single gene that causes different types of human cancer when targeted by different genetic alterations. Like other receptor tyrosine kinases, once activated, RET recruits a variety of signaling molecules that mediate biological responses. Here we review data on the signaling pathways that lead to RET-mediated cell transformation and recent evidence that manipulation of RET holds promise for thyroid cancer treatment.
