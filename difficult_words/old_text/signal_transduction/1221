Many viruses have evolved fusion-mediating glycoproteins that couple the energy released from irreversible protein refolding to the work of membrane fusion. The viral fusion proteins require a triggering event to undergo a cascade of tightly regulated conformational changes. Different isolates of the paramyxovirus SV5 fusion (F) protein have either a short (20-residue) or long (42-residue) cytoplasmic tail (CT), and a long CT suppresses fusion activity in a sequence-specific manner. Addition of a domain to the F protein CT, which has the propensity to form a three-helix bundle, stabilizes the F protein and increases the energy required for fusion activation. Quantitative cell-cell fusion assays and measurement of ectodomain conformation by monoclonal antibody reactivity indicate that this suppression of fusion by the long CT or addition of a three-helix bundle occurs at a step preceding initial membrane merger. The data suggest that F protein activation involves CT signaling to the ectodomain.
