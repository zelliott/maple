In previous studies we have demonstrated release of nitric oxide (NO) in human tissues following exposure to estrogen. We now designed experiments to determine whether estrogen is present in the neural tissue of Mytilus edulis, a marine mollusk, and whether, as in vertebrates, it stimulates constitutive NO synthase activity. After HPLC purification of 17beta-estradiol (17beta-E(2)) from M. edulis ganglionic tissue, we confirmed the presence of 17beta-E(2) by RIA and ES-Q-TOF-MS analysis. We further found that when either exogenous or endogenous (purified HPLC fraction) 17beta-E(2) was added to pedal ganglia, there was immediate concentration-dependent NO release. Furthermore, 17beta-E(2) conjugated to BSA also stimulated NO release, suggesting mediation by a membrane surface receptor. Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist, inhibited the action of both 17beta-E(2) and 17beta-E(2) conjugated to BSA, further supporting the presence of an estrogen receptor. In addition, by Western blot analysis with anti-ER-beta antibodies, we observed a 55-kDa protein in both the membrane and cytosolic fractions in pedal ganglia as well as in human leukocytes (that have been previously shown to express ER-beta). In summary, our results suggest that a physiological dose of estrogen acutely stimulates NO release within pedal ganglia via an estrogen cell surface receptor.
