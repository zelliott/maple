It is becoming clear that Ras proteins mediate their diverse biological functions by binding to, and participating in, the activation of multiple downstream targets. Recent work has identified nucleotide-exchange factors for Ral-GTPases as the newest members of the set of putative Ras 'effector molecules'. This new work has also detected two potential downstream targets of Ral proteins, a novel CDC42/Rac GTPase-activating protein and a phospholipase D.
