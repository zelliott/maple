During the past two decades, a significant amount of data has been accumulated revealing the intriguing functions of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in all aspects of embryonic development and organogenesis. Numerous genes encoding BMPs, BMP receptors, and their downstream signal transducers have been mutated in the mouse through targeted mutagenesis. This review focuses on what is known about the role of BMP signaling in gastrulation, mesoderm formation, left-right asymmetry, neural patterning, skeletal and limb development, organogenesis, and gametogenesis as revealed by BMP-signaling mutants.
