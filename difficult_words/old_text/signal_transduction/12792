The GPA1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a protein that is highly homologous to the alpha subunit of mammalian hetrotrimeric G proteins and is essential for haploid cell growth. A mutation of the GPA1 protein, GPA1Val-50, in which Gly-50 was replaced by valine, could complement the growth defect of a GPA1 disruption, gpal::HIS3. However, cells with gpa1::HIS3 expressing the GPA1Val-50 protein were supersensitive to alpha-factor in a short-term incubation but resumed growth after long-term incubation even after exposure to high concentrations of alpha-factor. The former phenotype associated with GPA1Val-50 is recessive, and the latter phenotype is dominant to GPA1+. The supersensitivity of GPA1Val-50 to alpha-factor was dependent on STE2 and STE4, which demonstrates that this GPA1Val-50-produced phenotype requires the mating-factor receptor and the beta subunit of the G protein. The double mutant of sst2-1 GPA1Val-50 recovered from division arrest, which suggested that SST2 is not required for recovery of the GPA1Val-50 mutant.
