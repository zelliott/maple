Since the discovery of the Toll-like receptors and their crucial role as modulators of innate immunity, there has been increasing appreciation of their role in human health and disease.

Here we review the role of Toll-like receptors and their endogenous ligands in various renal diseases, particularly their activation in the inflammatory response of ischemic kidney injury, organ transplantation, and immune-mediated glomerulonephritis.
