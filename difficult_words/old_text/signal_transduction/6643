The role of [Ca2+]i as a second messenger in non-excitable cells has been appreciated for almost 3 decades. The advent of fluorescent Ca2+ indicators has allowed the monitoring of Ca2+ signalling in suspensions of these cells. Agonist mediated changes in [Ca2+]i usually show an initial Ca2+ transient followed by a maintained increase. The former has been shown to be due to Ca2+ release from one or more intracellular stores, the latter due to activation of receptor operated Ca2+ entry (ROCE). More recently it has been recognized that many cells show distinct maintained oscillatory behavior when examined by single cell optical methods. It is proposed here that these oscillations are the consequence of IP3 and Ca2+ stimulation of Ca2+ release and ligand activation of ROCE followed by Ca2+ inhibition of Ca2+ and ROCE as Ca2+ pumps are activated. These oscillations allow more exact regulation of a pump/leak controlled second messenger such as [Ca2+]i.
