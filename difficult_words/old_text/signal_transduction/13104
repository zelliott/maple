A group of evolutionarily conserved pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS proteins was initially defined by their ability to repress photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis. It was proposed that this regulation be mediated by targeting degradation of key cellular regulators that promote photomorphogenesis. Among them, COP1 and the COP9 signalosome have been hypothesized to fulfill the roles as an ubiquitin ligase (E3) and an essential E3 modulator. Here we report that COP10 encodes a protein similar to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) variant proteins (UEV). COP10 is part of a nuclear protein complex and capable of directly interacting with both COP1 and the COP9 signalosome. Our data indicates that COP10 defines a possible E2 activity, thus validating the working hypothesis that the pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS group of proteins defined a protein ubiquitination pathway.
