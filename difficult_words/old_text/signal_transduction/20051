A splice variant of Gβ3, termed Gβ3s, has been associated with the C825T polymorphism in the Gβ3 gene and linked with many human disorders. However, the biochemical properties and functionality of Gβ3s remain controversial. Here, using multidisciplinary approaches including co-immunoprecipitation analysis and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) measurements, we showed that unlike Gβ3, Gβ3s failed to form complexes with either Gγ or Gα subunits. Moreover, using a mutant Gγ2 deficient in lipid modification to purify Gβ3s from Sf9 cells without the use of detergents, we further showed that the failure of Gβ3s to form dimers with Gγ was not due to the instability of the dimers in detergents, but rather, reflected the intrinsic properties of Gβ3s. Additional studies indicated that Gβ3s is unstable, and unable to localize properly to the plasma membrane and to activate diverse Gβγ effectors including PLCβ2/3, PI3Kγ, ERKs and the Rho guanine exchange factor (RhoGEF) PLEKHG2. Thus, these data suggest that the pathological effects of Gβ3 C825T polymorphism may result from the downregulation of Gβ3 function. However, we found that the chemokine SDF1α transmits signals primarily through Gβ1 and Gβ2, but not Gβ3, to regulate chemotaxis of several human lymphocytic cell lines, indicating the effects of Gβ3 C825T polymorphism are likely to be tissue and/or stimuli specific and its association with various disorders in different tissues should be interpreted with great caution.
