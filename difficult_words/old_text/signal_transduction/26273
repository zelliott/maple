Voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) are critically involved in excitation contraction coupling and regulation of the force of contraction. An important mechanism contributing to the adaptation of heart function is modulation of the L-type Ca2+ current (I(Ca-L)) by hormones of the autonomous nervous system. The signaling pathways underlying this regulation in the adult heart are well understood. However, VDCC expression and its regulation in the embryonic heart are less understood. This report therefore provides a short overview of the current knowledge on this topic using embryonic stem cells and the mouse as model systems.
