Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains the most common form of leukemia and the most common cause of leukemia death. Although conventional chemotherapy can cure between 25 and 45% of AML patients, most patients will either die of relapse or die from the complications associated with treatment. Thus, more specific and less toxic treatments for AML patients are needed. Recently, a small molecular inhibitor (STI571 or Gleevec) that targets the BCR-ABL gene was found to have a dramatic clinical effect in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). These results have encouraged investigators to search for additional small molecular inhibitors and other targeted therapies that may be applicable to other forms of leukemia. In this review, we examine some of the signaling pathways that are aberrantly regulated in AML, focusing on the tyrosine kinase/RAS/MAP kinase and JAK/STAT pathways. After reviewing these two pathways, we explore some of the targeted therapies directed at these pathways that are under development for AML, many of which are already in clinical trials.
