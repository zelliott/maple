Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins is a mechanism of signalling for different receptors and is important for cell growth and differentiation. Mast cells and basophils are secretory cells that play a role in inflammatory and immediate allergic reactions. The activation/aggregation of different surface receptors on these cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins. Because these signals are essential for the function of basophils and mast cells, characterizing these pathways could provide methods to specifically regulate the function of these cells. Here we discuss the signals generated by three receptors: the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) the growth factor receptor, Kit, and integrins.
