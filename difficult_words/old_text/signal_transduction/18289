Lipoprotein receptors are commonly thought merely to mediate the internalization of lipoprotein particles or the exchange of lipids at the cell surface. Recent findings have now implicated these multifunctional receptors in cellular signalling mechanisms that extend beyond simple ligand endocytosis. By mediating the cellular uptake of lipophilic vitamins and hormones, megalin, a member of the LDL receptor gene family, regulates critical hormonal and metabolic processes. Other members of the LDL receptor family interact with cytoplasmic adaptor and scaffold proteins, which allows them to transmit signals directly across the plasma membrane of the target cell. This sheds a new light on the emerging roles of lipoprotein receptors in pathologic disease processes such as Alzheimer's disease.
