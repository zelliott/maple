Many bacterial pathogens manipulate the host cell cytoskeleton during infection. Such cytoskeletal modulation can occur at several points of contact between the pathogen and the host, and involves extracellular receptors, intracellular signal transduction and cytoskeletal proteins themselves. The field of bacterial pathogenesis has progressed dramatically over the past decade, such that structural knowledge is both timely and essential for a full appreciation of the biology at the pathogen-host interface. Several recent examples involving bacterial proteins that target actin, Rho family GTPases and extracellular receptors have contributed to a structural understanding of eukaryotic cytoskeletal modulation by pathogens.
