During the discovery of mechanisms that govern immune activation and suppression, immune tolerance always came second in the scientific timeline. This has subsequently shaped the advances in the clinical translation of DC therapy protocols used for immunostimulation or immunosuppression. With several hundred clinical trials already registered within the U.S. National Institutes of Health for the use of DCs in cancer vaccination, only a few involve TolDCs for use as negative vaccines. However, as a result of the strong scientific rationale from preclinical and clinical trials, the use of negative vaccination in organ transplantation is likely on its way to reach the extent of the use of positive cancer vaccines in the future. As the underlying mechanisms emerge, the role of DCs in the induction of transplant tolerance is recognized unambiguously as central in the bidirectional communication with various types of immune cells. This is achieved by a complex interplay of numerous tolerogenic signals involving regulatory cytokines and other surface-bound or soluble inhibitory molecules associated with corresponding inhibitory signaling cascades. A detailed understanding of these processes will accelerate the advances of clinical immunologists in translating their knowledge from bench to bedside. In this review, we present the role of TolDCs as well as the most recent findings concerning associated molecular and cellular mechanisms that shape the balance between regulatory and effector immune responses during organ transplantation.
