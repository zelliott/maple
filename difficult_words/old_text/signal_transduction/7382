To investigate whether β-catenin signaling in chondrocytes regulates osteoclastogenesis, thereby contributing to postnatal bone growth and bone remodeling.

Mice with conditional knockout (cKO) or conditional activation (cAct) of chondrocyte-specific β-catenin were generated. Changes in bone mass, osteoclast numbers, and osteoblast activity were examined. The mechanisms by which β-catenin signaling in chondrocytes regulates osteoclast formation were determined.

The β-catenin cKO mice developed localized bone loss, whereas cAct mice developed a high bone mass phenotype. Histologic findings suggested that these phenotypes were caused primarily by impaired osteoclast formation, rather than impaired bone formation. Further molecular signaling analyses revealed that β-catenin signaling controlled this process by regulating the expression of the RANKL and osteoprotegerin (OPG) genes in chondrocytes. Activation of β-catenin signaling in chondrocytes suppressed Rankl gene transcription through a glucocorticoid receptor-dependent mechanism. The severe bone loss phenotype observed in β-catenin cKO mice was largely restored by treatment with human recombinant OPG or transgenic overexpression of Opg in chondrocytes.

β-catenin signaling in chondrocytes plays a key role in postnatal bone growth and bone remodeling through its regulation of osteoclast formation.
