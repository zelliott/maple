During their evolution, plants have acquired diverse capabilities to sense their environment and modify their growth and development as required. The versatile utilization of solar radiation for photosynthesis as well as a signal to coordinate developmental responses to the environment is an excellent example of such a capability. Specific light quality inputs are converted to developmental outputs mainly through hormonal signalling pathways. Accordingly, extensive interactions between light and the signalling pathways of every known plant hormone have been uncovered in recent years. One such interaction that has received recent attention and forms the focus of this review occurs between light and the signalling pathway of the jasmonate hormone with roles in regulating plant defence and development. Here the recent research that revealed new mechanistic insights into how plants might integrate light and jasmonate signals to modify their growth and development, especially when defending themselves from either pests, pathogens, or encroaching neighbours, is discussed.
