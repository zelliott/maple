Chronic allergic inflammatory diseases are characterized by tissue damage with consequent remodeling including fibrosis and angiogenesis. Eosinophils are usually recruited to sites of allergic inflammation infiltrating the tissues as fully differentiated cells. In the last two decades, these cells have been characterized as a proangiogenic. The inadequate blood supply together with a high consumption of oxygen by the infiltrated cells is the main cause of tissue hypoxia in inflammation. Infiltrated eosinophils respond to hypoxia by increasing their viability and proangiogenic potential and regulate the expression of receptors particularly CD300a.
