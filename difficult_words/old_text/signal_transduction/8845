The non-receptor spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk; EC 2.7.10.2) is involved in signal transduction in a variety of cell types. In particular, it is a key mediator of immune receptors signaling in host inflammatory cells (B cells, mast cells, macrophages and neutrophils), important for both allergic and antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. Deregulated Syk kinase activity also allows growth factor-independent proliferation and transforms bone marrow-derived pre-B cells that are able to induce leukemia. Consequently, the development of Syk kinase inhibitors could conceivably treat these disorders and so they have became a major focus in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry.

In this review, we analyze the structure and role of Syk kinase, the use of small molecules, interacting with ATP-binding site, as inhibitors of kinase activity and finally the potential of using inhibitors of Syk kinase expression to attenuate pathological conditions.

Syk kinase inhibition is suggested as a powerful tool for the therapy of different pathologies.
