We previously suggested that CD8(+) T cells promoted resolution of granulomatous experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (G-EAT) at least in part through regulation of Fas ligand (FasL) expression on thyroid epithelial cells. To directly evaluate the role of the Fas pathway in G-EAT resolution, Fas- and FasL-deficient mice on the NOD.H-2h4 background were used as recipients of activated G-EAT effector cells. When MTg-primed wild-type (WT) donor splenocytes were activated and transferred to WT recipients, thyroid lesions reached maximal severity on day 20 and resolved on day 50. Fas, FasL, and FLIP were up-regulated, and many apoptotic inflammatory cells were detected in recipient thyroids on day 20. Fas was predominantly expressed by inflammatory cells, and FasL and FLIP were mainly expressed by thyroid epithelial cells. After depletion of CD8(+) T cells, G-EAT resolution was delayed, FLIP and FasL were predominantly expressed by inflammatory cells, and few inflammatory cells were apoptotic. When WT donor splenocytes were transferred to gld recipients, disease severity on day 20 was similar to that in WT recipients, but resolution was delayed. As in CD8-depleted WT recipients, there were few apoptotic inflammatory cells, and FLIP and FasL were expressed primarily by inflammatory cells. These results indicated that the expression of functional FasL in recipient mice was critical for G-EAT resolution. WT cells induced minimal disease in lpr recipients. This was presumably because donor cells were eliminated by the increased FasL on lpr recipient cells, because donor cells were not eliminated, and the mice developed G-EAT if lpr recipients were given anti-FasL mAb.
