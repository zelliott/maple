Involvement and role of oxidatively modified lipids become increasingly evident in different signaling pathways, although specific mechanisms remain to be explored. The current forum focuses on several aspects of signaling by oxidatively modified lipid molecules during apoptosis and implications of different oxidized phospholipids in elimination of apoptotic cells and regulation of inflammatory response. Studies of signaling mechanisms by oxidatively modified lipids represent a rapidly expanding field of oxidative lipidomics, a new and exciting research focus at the interface of traditional lipid/membrane biochemistry and biophysics with free radical chemistry and cell biology.
