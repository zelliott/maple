A ceramide glycanase (CGase activity has been characterized from lactating rat mammary tissue which cleaves the glycosidic bond between sphingosine and the glucose chain of a glycosphingolipid (GSL) thus liberating the intact oligosaccharide chain from a GSL. The majority (65%) of the hydrolase activity was detected in the supernatant fraction when the rat mammary tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 x g. Attempts to purify the enzyme indicated that the CGase protein is of hydrophobic nature as it binds to hydrophobic columns. The enzyme has been partially purified using hydrophobic columns in tandem. The partially purified protein was found to be immunoreactive to the antibody raised against the purified clam CGase. The immunostained band corresponded to a 64 kDa protein as also found with the clam enzyme. This immuno cross-reactivity indicated probable structural similarities between CGase proteins isolated from widely separated species in the evolutionary tree. The rat CGase was found to have a specific detergent requirement for optimal activity, and the pH optimum was found to be between 5 and 6. The enzyme activity is partially heat stable. It is not a divalent cation requiring enzyme; however, the activity is totally inhibited in the presence of mercury, indicative of a sulfhydryl group in the active site of the enzyme. The rat mammary CGase activity is inhibited in the presence of both D- and L-PPMP (1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol. HCl), homologs of PDMP (1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol. HCl), a well-known inhibitor of GlcT-1 (Ceramide: UDP-Glc Glucosyltransferase), an enzyme in the glycolipid synthetic pathway. The inhibition seems to be of a competitive nature and the same type of inhibition is also observed with clam CGase. The CGase activity was found to be highest in lactating tissue compared to the activity found in either pregnant or post-lactating rat mammary tissues. Tissue survey indicated the presence of high levels of CGase in lactating rat liver, uterus, and ovary; moderate activity was detected in kidney and spleen. Both virgin and male rat mammary tissue also indicated a basic level of CGase activity. However, newborn spleen and mammary tissue showed a comparable level of activity to that found in lactating rat tissues. This report is mainly concerned with the characterization of CGase activity from a mammalian source and its importance in cellular processes.
