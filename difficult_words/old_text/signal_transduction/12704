Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) promoted the adhesion and morphological changes of human T-cell line MOLT-4 in a Con A-dependent manner. This morphological change-promoting activity was specific for HRG and the Arg23-Lys66 glycopeptide from human HRG. The carbohydrate chain at Asn45 was essential for this activity. The morphological changes of MOLT-4 cells caused by HRG and Con A (HRG/Con A) were not inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin or LY294002, while the changes by Con A alone were completely inhibited by these reagents, suggesting that HRG/Con A cooperate to activate leukocytes via a signaling pathway distinct from that by Con A alone. The morphological changes by Con A were associated with pseudopodia like structure. On the other hand, the morphological changes caused by HRG/Con A were associated not only with pseudopodia like structure but also with an increase of the F-actin-rich surface protrusions. Wortmannin inhibited only the formation of pseudopodia like structure.
