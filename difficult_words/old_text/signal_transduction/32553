Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha) is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand which is distinguished from EGF by its acid-labile structure and potent transforming function. We recently reported that TGFalpha induces less efficient EGFR heterodimerization and downregulation than does EGF (Gulliford et al., 1997, Oncogene, 15:2219-2223). Here we use isoform-specific EGFR and ErbB2 antibodies to show that the duration of EGFR signalling induced by a single TGFalpha exposure is less than that induced by equimolar EGF. The protein trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) reduces the duration of EGF signalling to an extent similar to that seen with TGFalpha alone; the effects of TGFalpha and BFA on EGFR degradation are opposite, however, with TGFalpha sparing EGFR from downregulation but BFA accelerating EGF-dependent receptor loss. This suggests that BFA blocks EGFR recycling and thus shortens EGF-dependent receptor signalling, whereas TGFalpha shortens receptor signalling and thus blocks EGFR downregulation. Consistent with this, repeated application of TGFalpha is accompanied by prolonged EGFR expression and signalling, whereas similar application of EGF causes receptor downregulation and signal termination. These findings indicate that constitutive secretion of pH-labile TGFalpha may perpetuate EGFR signalling by permitting early oligomer dissociation and dephosphorylation within acidic endosomes, thereby extinguishing a phosphotyrosine-based downregulation signal and creating an irreversible autocrine growth loop.
