Cortactin, an F-actin binding protein, stabilizes F-actin networks and promotes actin polymerization by activating the Arp2/3 complex. Overexpression of cortactin has been reported in several human cancers. Cortactin stimulates cell migration, invasion, and experimental metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism is not still understood. In the present study, we therefore evaluated the possibility that cortactin could be appropriate as a molecular target for cancer gene therapy. In 70 primary oral squamous cell carcinomas and 10 normal oral mucosal specimens, cortactin expression was evaluated by immunological analyses, and the correlations of the overexpression of cortactin with clinicopathologic factors were evaluated. Overexpression of cortactin was detected in 32 of 70 oral squamous cell carcinomas; significantly more frequently than in normal oral mucosa. Cortactin overexpression was more frequent in higher grade cancers according to T classification, N classifications, and invasive pattern. Moreover, RNAi-mediated decrease in cortactin expression reduced invasion. Downregulation of cortactin expression increased the expression levels of E-cadherin, Î²-catenin, and EpCAM. The siRNA of cortactin also reduced PTHrP expression via EGF signaling. These results consistently indicate that the overexpression of cortactin is strongly associated with an aggressive phenotype of oral squamous cell carcinoma. In conclusion, we propose that cortactin could be a potential molecular target of gene therapy by RNAi targeting in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
