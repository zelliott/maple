Analyzing signaling networks in immune cells is of particular interests in diseases where treatment choices are preferentially immunomodulatory. By combining phospho-specific antibodies with multicolor flow cytometry it is possible to perform quantitative multiparameter analysis of signaling pathways within complex cell populations. Multiplexed phosphoprotein analysis will potentially incorporate environmental factors such as toxins or pathogens and genetic variability of individual patients in a step towards personalized medicine.
