Integrin receptors mediate adhesive events that are critical for a specific and effective immune response to foreign pathogens. Integrin-dependent interactions of lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to endothelium regulate the efficiency and specificity of trafficking into secondary lymphoid organs and peripheral tissue. Within these sites, integrins facilitate cell movement via interactions with the extracellular matrix, and promote and stabilize antigen-specific interactions between T lymphocytes and APCs that are critical for initiating T cell-activation events. In this review, we discuss the role of integrins in T cell-mediated immunity, with a focus on how these receptors participate in lymphocyte recirculation and T cell activation, how antigen stimulation regulates integrin activity, and how integrins define functionally unique subsets of T cells and APCs.
