The Mre11 complex is a multisubunit nuclease that is composed of Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1/Xrs2. Mutations in the genes that encode components of this complex result in DNA- damage sensitivity, genomic instability, telomere shortening and aberrant meiosis. The molecular defect that underlies these phenotypes has long been thought to be related to a DNA repair deficiency. However, recent studies have uncovered functions for the Mre11 complex in checkpoint signalling and DNA replication.
