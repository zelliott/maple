Wnt, Hedgehog and bone morphogenetic proteins function as either short-range or long-range signaling molecules depending on the tissue in which they are expressed. In the past year, filapodia-like cytoplasmic extensions, cell-surface proteogylcans and/or extracellular binding proteins have been identified that may enable these molecules to signal at a distance. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that variations in the signaling range of these molecules may be due to tissue-specific differences in intracellular processing or tissue-restricted expression of binding proteins.
