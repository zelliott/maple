Rhesus monkey embryonic stem (rES) cells have similar characteristics to human ES cells, and might be useful as a substitute model for preclinical research. Notch signaling is involved in the formation of bile ducts, which are composed of cholangiocytes. However, little is known about the role of Notch signaling in cholangiocytic commitment of ES cells. We analyzed the effect of Notch signaling on the induction of cholangiocyte-like cells from rES cells. About 80% of definitive endoderm (DE) cells were generated from rES cells after treatment with activin A. After treatment with BMP4 and FGF1 on matrigel coated wells in serum-free medium, rES-derived DE gave rise to cholangiocyte-like cells by expression of cholangiocytic specific proteins (CK7, CK18, CK19, CK20, and OV-6) and genes (GSTPi, IB4, and HNF1Î²). At the same time, expression of Notch 1 and Notch 2 mRNA were detected during cell differentiation, as well as their downstream target genes such as Hes 1 and Hes 5. Inhibition of the Notch signal pathway by L-685458 resulted in decreased expression of Notch and their downstream genes. In addition, the proportion of cholangiocyte-like cells declined from approximately 90% to approximately 20%. These results suggest that Notch signaling may play a critical role in cholangiocytic development from ES cells.
