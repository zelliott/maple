Idiopathic interstitial lung diseases (iILDs) are characterized by inflammation, hyperplasia of Type-II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and lung remodelling often with progressive fibrosis. It remains unclear which signals initiate iILD and/or maintain the disease processes. Using real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry on archival biopsies of three patterns of iILD (usual interstitial pneumonitis/UIP, non-specific interstitial pneumonitis/NSIP and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia/COP) we investigated whether hedgehog signalling (previously associated with lung damage and repair) was functional and whether the damage associated extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C was present in activated Type-II AECs in all three iILDs. Using tissue culture, protein and mRNA detection we also determined how two signals (oxidative damage and TGF-β) associated with iILD pathogenesis affected Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and tenascin-C production by a Type-II AEC cell line. We report that SHH pathway and tenascin-C mRNA and proteins were found in UIP, NSIP and COP. SHH signalling was most active at sites of immature organizing fibrous tissue (fibroblastic foci) in UIP. In vitro Type-II AECs constitutively secrete SHH but not tenascin-C. Oxidative injury stimulated SHH release whereas TGF-β inhibited it. TGF-β and oxidative damage both upregulated tenascin-C mRNA but only TGF-β induced synthesis and release of a distinct protein isoform. SHH signalling is active in Type-II AECs from three types of ILD and all three express tenascin-C.
