Atopic diseases are very common, and atopy has a strong genetic predisposition.

Using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing, we searched for mutations in the a subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor that would predispose persons to atopy. We examined the prevalence of the alleles among patients with allergic inflammatory disorders and among 50 prospectively recruited adults. Subjects with atopy were identified on the basis of an elevated serum IgE level (> or = 95 IU per milliliter) or a positive radioimmunosorbent test in response to standard inhalant allergens. The signaling function of mutant interleukin-4 receptor a was examined by flow cytometry, binding assays, and immunoblotting.

A novel interleukin-4 receptor alpha allele was identified in which guanine was substituted for adenine at nucleotide 1902, causing a change from glutamine to arginine at position 576 (R576) in the cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin-4 receptor alpha protein. The R576 allele was common among patients with allergic inflammatory disorders (found in 3 of 3 patients with the hyper-IgE syndrome and 4 of 7 patients with severe atopic dermatitis) and among the 50 prospectively recruited adults (found in 13 of 20 subjects with atopy and 5 of 30 without atopy; P=0.001; relative risk of atopy among those with a mutant allele, 9.3). The R576 allele was associated with higher levels of expression of CD23 by interleukin-4 than the wild-type allele. This enhanced signaling was associated with a change in the binding specificity of the adjacent tyrosine residue at position 575 to signal-transducing molecules.

The R576 allele of interleukin-4 receptor alpha is strongly associated with atopy. This mutation may predispose persons to allergic diseases by altering the signaling function of the receptor.
