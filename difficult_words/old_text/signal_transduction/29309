Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the endotoxin of Gram-negative bacteria, is capable of eliciting a wide variety of pathophysiological effects, including endotoxin shock, tissue injury and lethality in both humans and animals. It is also a potent stimulant to initiate the proliferation, differentiation and activation of B lymphocytes and macrophages, resulting in changes of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL1-beta, IL6, IL-8 and IL-12, and enhancement of immune responses. However, little is known about its effect on the induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes. In the present study, the lymphocytes from Carassius auratus were employed for this purpose. The cells were exposed to LPS at various doses for different time periods. By careful apoptotic characteristic analysis, such as condensation of nuclear chromatin, fragmentation of genomic DNA and formation of apoptotic bodies, it provided the first evidence that LPS had apoptotic-inducing effect on fish lymphocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. LPS exposure induced significant increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi), depletion of ATP production, down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, up-regulation of Bax and mitochondrial NO-synthase (mNOS) expression, and selective activation of caspase-9 rather than caspase-8. Each of these observations suggests that the LPS-induced apoptosis in C. auratus lymphocytes occurs largely via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This observation was different from the mechanism behind the LPS-induced apoptosis in mammalian macrophages/thymocytes that occurs via the TNF-alpha-mediated death-receptor pathway. Our study suggested the existence of a possible novel role in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative bacterial infection in fish and even in mammals, which may contribute to the therapy of bacterial diseases. Also, it will help to gain more insights into the mechanisms of septic shock and of LPS-induced immunosuppression and autoimmunity.
