A hostile environment and decreased regenerative capacity may contribute to the failure of axon regeneration in the adult central nervous system. Recent studies leading to the identification of several myelin-associated inhibitors and their signaling molecules provide opportunitities to assess the contribution of these inhibitory molecules in restricting axon regeneration. These findings may ultimately allow for the development of strategies to alleviate the inhibitory effects of such molecules in an effort to encourage axon regeneration after spinal cord and brain injury.
