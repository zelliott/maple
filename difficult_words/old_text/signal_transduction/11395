The 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptor systems play central roles in the control of serotonergic neurotransmission and feature prominently in many behaviors and physiological functions. In addition, the regulation of these receptors and their effector mechanisms has been the focus of intense interest because of their potential importance in the therapeutic actions of anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs. Here we describe the regulation of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by receptors which activate phospholipid signaling cascades. Although it might be expected that these two highly homologous Gi-coupled receptors would be regulated similarly by activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), we have found that the regulation differs markedly between these receptor systems. Further, our data suggest that the modulation of agonist efficacy at these receptor subtypes is dependent on the nature of receptor coupling to PLC and PLA(2) activation. Moreover, regulation at the level of the effector (e.g., adenylyl cyclase) appears to play a significant role in the regulation of both the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptor systems by the PLA(2) signaling cascade. Such data illustrate multiple levels for control of biochemical signaling cascades within cells and demonstrate that although different receptors may couple to the same effector pathways, the ultimate cellular effects produced by these receptors may differ due to differential cross-talk regulation.
