The stressosome is a 1.8-MDa cytoplasmic complex that conveys environmental signals to the σ(B) stress factor of Bacillus subtilis. A functionally irreducible complex contains multiple copies of three proteins: the RsbRA coantagonist, RsbS antagonist, and RsbT serine-threonine kinase. Homologues of these proteins are coencoded in different genome contexts in diverse bacteria, forming a versatile sensing and transmission module called RST after its common constituents. However, the signaling pathway within the stressosome itself is not well defined. The N-terminal, nonheme globin domains of RsbRA project from the stressosome and are presumed to channel sensory input to the C-terminal STAS domains that form the complex core. A conserved, 13-residue α-helical linker connects these domains. We probed the in vivo role of the linker using alanine scanning mutagenesis, assaying stressosome output in B. subtilis via a σ(B)-dependent reporter fusion. Substitutions at four conserved residues increased output 4- to 30-fold in unstressed cells, whereas substitutions at four nonconserved residues significantly decreased output. The periodicity of these effects supports a model in which RsbRA functions as a dimer in vivo, with the linkers forming parallel paired helices via a conserved interface. The periodicity further suggests that the opposite, nonconserved faces make additional contacts important for efficient stressosome operation. These results establish that the linker influences stressosome output under steady-state conditions. However, the stress response phenotypes of representative linker substitutions provide less support for the notion that the N-terminal globin domain senses acute environmental challenge and transmits this information via the linker helix.
