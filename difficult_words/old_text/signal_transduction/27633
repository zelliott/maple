The retroviral Gag-like protein p58gag expressed in a highly metastatic ascites rat mammary adenocarcinoma has been implicated in cell surface changes contributing to xenotransplantability. p58gag is present in the cells in a plasma membrane- and microfilament-associated signal transduction particle containing Src and is phosphorylated on tyrosine. Overlay analyses and affinity chromatography with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of Src homology-3 (SH3) domains showed direct binding of the Src but not the Crk SH3 domain to p58gag. This association was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of partially purified p58gag from ascites cell lysates with platelet Src. Further, a GST-p58gag fusion protein bound full length c-Src from either platelets or c-Src-expressing insect cells. The GST-p58gag fusion protein, but not GST, was phosphorylated by platelet or insect cell-expressed c-Src, but not by a kinase negative c-Src variant. The binding of GST-p58gag to c-Src was almost completely abolished by a 50-fold excess of the GST-SH3 domain of Src, and a parallel decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of p58gag was observed. These results demonstrate that p58gag is tyrosine-phosphorylated as a consequence of its specific association with c-Src via its SH3 domain. These observations suggest a mechanism by which Gag proteins may contribute to retroviral maturation or pathogenesis through binding and relocalization of SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Src-like tyrosine kinases to sites of association of microfilaments with the plasma membrane.
