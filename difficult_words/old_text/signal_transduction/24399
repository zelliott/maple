Anopheles gambiae is the mosquito vector responsible for transmitting Plasmodium falciparum, a malaria parasite of humans. With the emergence of genome projects for a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, there has been a long-standing interest in sequencing the genomes of the malaria parasite and its insect vector. This tour de force effort has now been completed and reported. The alignment of putative orthologs in An. gambiae with those of Drosophila melanogaster highlights several similarities and differences. These findings could have implications in: (1) identifying new targets for insecticide development; (2) strengthening our understanding of the developmental biology of mosquitoes; and (3) possibly controlling pathogen transmission. A brief overview of these interesting findings and the implications for further studies will be discussed here.
