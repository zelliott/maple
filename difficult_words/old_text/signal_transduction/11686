His-Phe-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Met (HFYLPM) is a synthetic peptide that stimulates Jurkat T cells resulting in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) increase in a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive manner. We have examined the physiological role of the peptide in T cell activity by comparative investigation of intracellular signaling pathways accompanied with HFYLPM-induced T cell chemotaxis with a well-known chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-induced signalings. Wortmannin and genistein inhibited both of HFYLPM- and SDF-1-induced Jurkat T cell chemotaxis indicating that phosphoinositide-3-kinase and tyrosine kinase activity were required for the processes. However, U-73122 and BAPTA/AM preferentially blocked HFYLPM- but not SDF-1-induced T cell chemotaxis. It indicates that phospholipase C/calcium signaling is necessary for only chemotaxis by HFYLPM. One of the well-known cellular molecules involving chemotaxis, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), was activated by SDF-1 but not by HFYLPM ruling out a possible role of ERK on the peptide-mediated chemotaxis. These results indicate that the synthetic peptide, HFYLPM, stimulates T cell chemotaxis showing unique signaling and provide a useful tool for the study of T cell activation mechanism.
