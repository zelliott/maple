During brain development, functional neurogenesis is achieved by the concerted action of various steps that include the expansion of progenitor cells, neuronal specification, and establishment of appropriate synapses. Brain patterning and regionalization is regulated by a variety of extracellular signals and morphogens that, together with neuronal activity, orchestrate and regulate progenitor proliferation, differentiation, and neuronal maturation. In the adult brain, CB(1) cannabinoid receptors are expressed at very high levels in selective areas and are engaged by endocannabinoids, which act as retrograde messengers controlling neuronal function and preventing excessive synaptic activity. In addition, the endocannabinoid system is present at early developmental stages of nervous system formation. Recent studies have provided novel information on the role of this endogenous neuromodulatory system in the control of neuronal specification and maturation. Thus, cannabinoid receptors and locally produced endocannabinoids regulate neural progenitor proliferation and pyramidal specification of projecting neurons. CB(1) receptors also control axonal navigation, migration, and positioning of interneurons and excitatory neurons. Loss of function studies by genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade of CB(1) receptors interferes with long-range subcortical projections and, likewise, prenatal cannabinoid exposure induces different functional alterations in the adult brain. Potential implications of these new findings, such as the participation of the endocannabinoid system in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia) and the regulation of neurogenesis in brain depression, are discussed herein.
