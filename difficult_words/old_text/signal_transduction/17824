Leaf senescence is a process of programmed cell death, which is induced in an age-dependent manner and by various environmental cues. The mechanisms that regulate the induction and progression of leaf senescence remain unclear because of their complexity. However, recent genetic and reverse-genetic approaches have identified key components of the regulation of leaf senescence and have revealed glimpses of the underlying molecular mechanisms.
