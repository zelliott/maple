Platelet activating factor (PAF) stimulated aggregation and [32P]-phosphatidic acid (PA) production was compared in normal and diabetic human subjects in platelet rich plasma. The concentration of PAF for half maximal (50%) aggregation of normal and diabetic platelets was 50 nM and 8 nM, respectively. PAF stimulated [32P]-PA production (a metabolite of phospholipase C pathway) was also greater in the platelets from diabetic subjects. This [32P]-PA production was inhibited by the PAF receptor antagonists SRI-63441 and SRI-63675. When the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were compared with the PAF stimulated [32P]-PA production a significant relationship was observed. These studies have demonstrated for the first time that diabetic human platelets show hypersensitivity to PAF in both aggregation and [32P]-PA production compared to normal subjects. This may be a result of some modification in phospholipid turnover mechanism and is receptor mediated. Further, the relationship of the degree of aggregation and [32P]-PA production to the level of HbA1c suggest that the insulin deficiency may contribute to these effects.
