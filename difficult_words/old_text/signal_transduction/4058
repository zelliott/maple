Using scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy, we have found that apical microvilli of diverse cell types, including nonepithelial cells, elongate in culture in response to the oxidative stress of hydrogen peroxide. The microvilli induced in culture on retinal pigment epithelial cells display a 30-nm axial periodicity similar to that described for stable microvilli of intestinal brush border. Microvilli can also be induced to elongate by chelating intracellular Ca2+ and by the Ca(2+)-uptake inhibitor thapsigargin. Thus a response of microvillar protrusion occurs widely and may be related to depletion of intracellular calcium stores.
