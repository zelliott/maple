Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) from human umbilical cord blood (UCB) produce lower amounts of IFN-Î± upon TLR stimulation compared with adult counterparts. This difference may play a role in the low graft-versus-host disease rate after UCB transplantation and in the impaired immune response of the neonate to pathogens. Comparing UCB PDC to their adults counterparts, we found that they exhibited a mature surface phenotype and a normal antigen uptake. They upregulated costimulatory molecules upon activation, although with delayed kinetics. Protein, but not ARN, levels of TLR-9, MyD88, IRAK1 and IRF-7, involved in the TLR-9 signaling pathway were reduced. The expression levels of miR-146a and miR-155, known to be involved in the post-transcriptional down-regulation of immune responses, were higher. These data point out a post-transcriptional down-regulation of the TLR-9/IRF-7 signaling pathway in UCB PDC.
