Ultraviolet light radiation in sunlight is known to cause major alterations in growth and differentiation patterns of exposed human tissues. The specific effects depend on the wavelengths and doses of the light, and the nature of the exposed tissue. Both growth inhibition and proliferation are observed, as well as inflammation and immune suppression. Whereas in the clinical setting, these responses may be beneficial, for example, in the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, as an environmental toxicant, ultraviolet light can induce significant tissue damage. Thus, in the eye, ultraviolet light causes cataracts, while in the skin, it induces premature aging and the development of cancer. Although ultraviolet light can damage many tissue components including membrane phospholipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, it is now recognized that many of its cellular effects are due to alterations in growth factor- and cytokine-mediated signal transduction pathways leading to aberrant gene expression. It is generally thought that reactive oxygen intermediates are mediators of some of the damage induced by ultraviolet light. Generated when ultraviolet light is absorbed by endogenous photosensitizers in the presence of molecular oxygen, reactive oxygen intermediates and their metabolites induce damage by reacting with cellular electrophiles, some of which can directly initiate cell signaling processes. In an additional layer of complexity, ultraviolet light-damaged nucleic acids initiate signaling during the activation of repair processes. Thus, mechanisms by which solar ultraviolet radiation triggers cell signal transduction are multifactorial. The present review summarizes some of the mechanisms by which ultraviolet light alters signaling pathways as well as the genes important in the beneficial and toxic effects of ultraviolet light.
