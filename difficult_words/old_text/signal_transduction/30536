beta-Carbolines (BCs) derive from tryptophan and its derivatives. They are formed endogenously in humans and mammals and occur inter alia in cooked meat and tobacco smoke. They have been detected in human brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma. Up to now they were predominantly identified as compounds exhibiting neurotoxic actions. Since significantly higher amounts are present in parkinsonian patients, they are regarded as potential pathogenetic factors in Parkinson's disease. We identified for the first time a BC (9-methyl-BC; 9-me-BC) exerting neuroprotective and neuron-differentiating effects. Treatment of primary mesencephalic dopaminergic cultures with 9-me-BC inhibited the basal release of lactate dehydrogenase and reduced the number of cells stained with propidium iodide. Caspase-3 activity was decreased, the total protein content was unchanged and ATP content was increased. Furthermore, the expression of inflammation-related genes was reduced. The number of differentiated dopaminergic neurones was significantly increased and a wide array of neurotrophic/transcription factors (Shh, Wnt1, Wnt5a, En1, En2, Nurr1, Pitx3) and marker genes (Th, Dat, Aldh1a1) decisive for dopaminergic differentiation was stimulated. Consistently, the dopamine content was slightly, although non-significantly, increased and the dopamine uptake capacity was elevated. An anti-proliferative effect was observed in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells which is consistent with a reduced incorporation of bromodesoxyuridine into the DNA of primary mesencephalic cells. Whether the additional dopaminergic neurones in primary culture derive from dopaminergic precursor cells, previously tyrosine hydroxylase negative dopaminergic neurones or are the result of a transdifferentiation process remains to be established.
