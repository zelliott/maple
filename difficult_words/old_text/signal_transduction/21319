Innervation of the neocortex by the thalamus is dependent on the precise coordination of spatial and temporal guidance cues. In this issue of Cell, work by LÃ³pez-Bendito et al.(2006) reveals that tangentially migrating cells within the ventral telencephalon are essential for axonal navigation between the thalamus and the neocortex, a process apparently mediated by Neuregulin-1/ErbB4 short- and long-range signaling.
