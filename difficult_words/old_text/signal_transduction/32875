Members of the TNF family of receptors play important roles in normal physiology and in defence. The recent rapid progress in the understanding of the mechanisms of apoptosis has been accompanied by assumptions that TNF family receptors such as CD95(Fas/APO-1) only have a role in regulating cell survival. While regulation of cell death is one important function of TNF family receptors, they are capable of activating signal transduction pathways that have many other effects. The present review will focus on signalling of some TNF family receptors in the immune system, not only for apoptosis, but also for survival or activation.
