Engagement of mIgM induces G1 arrest and apoptosis in immature B cells. The biochemical mechanism(s) regulating the cell death process are poorly understood. Cross-linking of CD72 (a B cell co-receptor) with anti-CD72 antibody was shown to protect B cells from apoptosis. We investigated the molecular mechanism involved in apoptosis preventing signaling mediated by CD72 ligation using a derivative (WEHIdelta) of the WEHI231 cell line which is representative of immature B cells. Apoptotic WEHIdelta cells following cross-linking of mIgM demonstrate a dramatic loss of c-Myc protein after transient up-regulation. In contrast, pre-ligation of CD72 was able to sustain c-Myc expression after transient up-regulation. Cross-linking of mIgM of WEHIdelta cells causes accumulation of the Cdk inhibitor, p27(Kip1). CD72 pre-ligation was shown to inhibit the accumulation of p27(Kip1) protein. Moreover, NF-kappaB activity was not suppressed in WEHIdelta cells after mIgM cross-linking when the cells were pre-treated with anti-CD72 antibody. These results strongly suggest that the apoptosis preventing signal evoked by CD72 ligation is delivered through the pathway of NF-kappaB, c-Myc, p27(Kip1) and cyclin.
