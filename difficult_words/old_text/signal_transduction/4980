Dynamic regulation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway controls central and peripheral lymphocyte deletion, and may interfere with the pro-apoptotic potency of B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitors such as ABT-737. By following a T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic population of alloantigen-specific T cells, we found that sensitivity to ABT-737 radically changed during the course of allo-specific immune responses. Particularly, activated T cells were fully resistant to ABT-737 during the first days after antigen recognition. This phenomenon was caused by a TCR-calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells-dependent upregulation of A1, and was therefore prevented by cyclosporine A (CsA). As a result, exposure to ABT-737 after alloantigen recognition induced selection of alloreactive T cells in vivo, whereas in combination with low-dose CsA, ABT-737 efficiently depleted alloreactive T cells in murine host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host models. Thus, ABT-737 resistance is not a prerogative of neoplastic cells, but it physiologically occurs in T cells after antigen recognition. Reversibility of this process by calcineurin inhibitors opens new pharmacological opportunities to modulate this process in the context of cancer, autoimmunity and transplantation.
