Thrombin signaling in the endothelium is linked to multiple phenotypic changes, including alterations in permeability, vasomotor tone, and leukocyte trafficking. The thrombin signal is transduced, at least in part, at the level of gene transcription. In this review, we focus on the role of thrombin signaling and transcriptional networks in mediating downstream gene expression and endothelial phenotype. In addition, we report the results of DNA microarrays in control and thrombin-treated endothelial cells. We conclude that (1) thrombin induces the upregulation and downregulation of multiple genes in the endothelium, (2) thrombin-mediated gene expression involves a multitude of transcription factors, and (3) future breakthroughs in the field will depend on a better understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of these transcriptional networks.
