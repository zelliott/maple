Fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus involves three morphologic stages---rippling, aggregation, and sporulation---all of which are induced by the cell surface-associated C-signal. We analyzed the function of the DevT protein, a novel component in the C-signal response pathway. A mutant carrying an in-frame deletion in the devT gene displays delayed aggregation and a cell autonomous sporulation defect, whereas it remains rippling proficient. To further define the function of DevT, the methylation pattern of FrzCD, a cytoplasmic methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein homologue, was examined in the Delta devT mutant, and we found that DevT is required for methylation of FrzCD during development. Specifically, DevT was found to be required for the C-signal-dependent methylation of FrzCD. The Delta devT mutant produced wild-type levels of C-signal. However, accumulation of the FruA response regulator protein, which is essential for the execution of the C-signal-dependent responses, was reduced in the Delta devT mutant. The DevT protein was found to stimulate the developmentally activated transcription of the fruA gene. Epistasis analyses indicate that DevT acts independently of the A- and E-signals to stimulate fruA transcription. These findings suggest that the developmental defects of the Delta devT mutant are associated with a lack of FruA to ensure a proper response to the C-signal during the aggregation and sporulation stages of development.
