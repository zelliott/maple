Tumor suppressor protein p53 induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence in response to cellular stresses. The p53 tetramer formation is essential for its functions. Despite of these crucial functions of p53 for integrity of genome, activation of the p53 signal pathway causes low induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell generation efficiency. In this study, we report transient inhibition of p53-dependent transcription using a p53 tetramerization domain peptide that contains cell penetrating and nuclear localization signals. The peptide was efficiently introduced into cells and inhibited p21 expression via hetero-tetramerization with endogenous p53 protein. This method can be applied towards safe and efficient iPS cell generation.
