Cartilage plays multiple roles in vertebrate animals. In an embryonic stage and early postnatal life, cartilage is important not only as a structural support of early embryo but also as a template of endochondral bone. In a later postnatal life, cartilage provides smooth joint movement and tissue elasticity. A number of critical signaling molecules that regulate cartilage formation and chondrocytes maturation in endochondral bone formation have been identified to date. The interplay of those important molecules is also actively studied. However, several fundamental questions still remain unsolved. What signal initiates mesenchymal cell condensation? Does condensation enough to make cells competent for BMP-induced chondrogenesis? Is there chondrocyte stem cell in cartilage? Likewise, it is not known which factor triggers chondrocytes maturation. In this review article, we summarized the action of several key factors including BMP, hedgehog, PTHrP, and Wnt in condensation, chondrogenenic differentiation and maturation of chondrocytes. Towards further understanding of above fundamental questions, this review article also tried to propose future direction of cartilage biology research.
