Loss of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling has been implicated in malignant transformation of various tissues. Smad4 plays a central role in the signal transduction of TGF-beta. Deletion or mutation of Smad4 has been described in a number of cancers. This study was aimed to investigate a potential role of Smad4 in leukemia including its expression and location in blast cells. The mononuclear cells were separated from bone marrow of leukemia patients. The samples, blast cells of which were more than 90% in mononuclear cells, were selected. The expression and location of Smad4 protein were analyzed by immunohistochemistry methods. The results showed that the Smad4 protein located mainly in nucleus, part of this protein located in cytoplasma, the expressions of Smad4 were not detected in 6 out of 9 ALL patients, in 7 out of 24 AML patients and in 1 out of 2 CML patients; these leukemia patients, in whose cells the expression of Smad4 was not detected, included one L1 and one L3, four L2, one M0, one M1, two M2a, one M3a, one M4b, one M6 and one CML. In conclusion, the Smad4 protein was mainly in nucleus, the deletion or functional change of Smad4 may related with the pathogenesis of human AML.
