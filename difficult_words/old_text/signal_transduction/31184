Occludin is the first identified integral protein for the tight junction (TJ), and its long COOH-terminal domain is considered to have functions in receiving and transmitting cell survival signals. Loss of TJ-associated molecules, such as occludin, has been correlated with tumor progression in carcinogenesis; however, the precise molecular mechanisms explaining its loss of expression and whether occludin expression has any effects on cancer phenotypes remain to be clarified. Here, we show that forced expression of occludin in cancer cells exhibits enhanced sensitivity to differently acting apoptogenic factors, and thus inhibits the tumorigenicity of transformed cells, via modulation of unique sets of apoptosis-associated genes. In addition, studies using deletion mutants of occludin constructs show that 44 amino acids at the COOH-terminal end play a critical role in modifying the cellular phenotypes. Interestingly, occludin decreases cellular invasiveness and motility, thereby abrogating metastatic potencies of cancer cells. We also found that occludin expression is silenced by CpG island hypermethylation on its promoter region. Synergy with a demethylator and histone deacetylase inhibitor or retinoids that stimulate retinoic acid receptor alpha induces endogenous occludin, which is sufficient for apoptotic sensitization. Our results show the functional diversity of occludin and suggest that methylator phenotype of occludin provides enhanced tumorigenic, invasive, and metastatic properties of cancer cells, identifying occludin as a likely candidate for a tumor-suppressor gene in certain types of cancer.
