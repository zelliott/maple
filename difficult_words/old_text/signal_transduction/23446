The application of systems biology approaches has greatly facilitated the process of deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying leaf senescence. Analyses of the leaf senescence transcriptome have identified some of the major biochemical events during senescence including protein degradation and nutrient remobilization. Proteomic studies have confirmed these findings and have suggested up-regulated energy metabolism during leaf senescence which might be important for cell viability maintenance. As a critical part of systems biology, studies involving transcription regulation networking and senescence-inducing signaling have deepened our understanding on the molecular regulation of leaf senescence. The important next steps towards a systems biological understanding of leaf senescence will be discussed.
