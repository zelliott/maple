To examine the effects of hyperglycemia on insulin signaling in A-10 vascular smooth muscle cells, cells were treated with extracellular D-glucose and effects of insulin were studied on the diacylglycerol-protein kinase C signaling system. A-10 cells specifically bound 125I-insulin, and insulin-like growth factor-I did not displace the label. 125I-insulin binding was unaltered under hyperglycemic conditions. To determine if insulin receptors were coupled to other insulin-regulated processes, diacylglycerol, protein kinase C, and glucose transport were evaluated. Insulin increased cellular diacylglycerol (DAG) levels which were also increased following glucose treatment and not further stimulated by insulin. The uptake of 2-[3H]deoxy-D-glucose (2-DOG) was stimulated by insulin and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Insulin- and TPA-stimulated 2-[3H]DOG uptake was inhibited by a protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine. Preincubation of cells with 500 nM TPA overnight resulted in the inhibition of insulin- and TPA-stimulated 2-[3H]DOG uptake. Protein kinase C activity was translocated from cytosolic to membrane fractions following insulin treatment. Overnight glucose (25 mM) treatment resulted in a 50% decrease in protein kinase C enzyme activity and > 90% decrease in protein kinase C beta immunoreactive levels. Protein kinase C activity and levels were not affected by osmotic control media containing mannitol. A-10 cells express GLUT4-type glucose transporters. Neither insulin-regulatable glucose transporter (GLUT4) mRNA nor GLUT4 protein levels were diminished by glucose. Significant decreases in insulin- and TPA-stimulated 2-[3H]DOG uptake occurred, however, with glucose. The down-regulation of protein kinase C beta and resultant inhibition of 2-[3H]DOG uptake by chronic glucose suggests a biochemical link between hyperglycemia and DAG-protein kinase C signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells.
