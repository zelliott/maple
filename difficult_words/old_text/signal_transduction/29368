The thioredoxin (TRX) system consists of TRX, TRX reductase, and NAD(P)H, and is able to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) through interactions with the redox-active center of TRX, which in turn can be reduced by TRX reductase in the presence of NAD(P)H. Among the TRX superfamily is peroxiredoxin (PRX), a family of non-heme peroxidases that catalyzes the reduction of hydroperoxides into water and alcohol. The TRX system is active in the vessel wall and functions either as an important endogenous antioxidant or interacts directly with signaling molecules to influence cell growth, apoptosis, and inflammation. Recent evidence implicates TRX in cardiovascular disease associated with oxidative stress, such as cardiac failure, arrhythmia, ischemia reperfusion injury, and hypertension. Thioredoxin activity is influenced by many mechanisms, including transcription, protein-protein interaction, and post-translational modification. Regulation of TRX in hypertensive models seems to be related to oxidative stress and is tissue- and cell-specific. Depending on the models of hypertension, TRX system could be upregulated or downregulated. The present review focuses on the role of TRX in vascular biology, describing its redox activities and biological properties in the media and endothelium of the vessel wall. In addition, the pathopysiological role of TRX in hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases is addressed.
