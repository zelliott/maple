Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy is a common side effect of chronic glucocorticoid therapy. Several mechanisms are currently being examined as ways in which glucocorticoid-induced myopathy occurs. These include apoptotic signaling through mitochondrial-mediated and Fas-mediated apoptosis, the role of the proteosome, the suppression of the IGF-1 signaling, and the role of ceramide in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and myopathy. It is difficult to differentiate which mechanism may be the initiating event responsible for the induction of apoptosis; however, all of the mechanisms play a vital role in glucocorticoid-induced myopathy.
