Chronic adult periodontitis is usually characterized by inflammatory cell accumulation in the extravascular periodontal connective tissue. In order to reveal how the lymphocyte migration and retention in periodontal lesions is regulated, we have focused on the molecular basis for the adhesive interactions between lymphocytes and human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). In this study, we investigated the involvement of cell adhesion molecules in adhesive interactions between lymphocytes and HGF. We found that activated lymphocytes bound strongly to HGF and VLA integrins, extracellular matrix receptors, play crucial roles in the binding. Interestingly, we first revealed that CD44 molecules (hyaluronate receptor) on lymphocytes also participated in lymphocyte-HGF interactions and that hyaluronate anchored on the surface of HGF functioned as the ligand for CD44. In addition, when HGF were stimulated with inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF alpha and IFN gamma, the binding avidity between lymphocytes and HGF was significantly increased and the adhesion was mainly mediated by LFA-1/ICAM-1 pathway. We then examined the possibility whether lymphocyte-HGF interaction may cause activation of HGF. When HGF directly interacted with lymphocytes for 3 h, IL-1 beta mRNA expression was clearly increased in HGF. These findings suggested that the adhesive interactions between lymphocytes and HGF was mediated at least by VLA integrins, LFA-1/ICAM-1 and CD44/hyaluronate and that the heterotypic cell-cell interactions could mutually cause intracellular signal transduction.
