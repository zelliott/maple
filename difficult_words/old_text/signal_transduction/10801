To investigate the effect of quercetin on the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and fibronectin (FN) in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) stimulated with transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1.

HSCs of rat were isolated by in situ perfusion and gradients centrifugation; the activated HSCs were incubated with quercetin (10(-9)-10(-5) mol/L) for 24, 48 and 72 h. TGFbeta1 was detected by flow cytometry. The expression of CTGF was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and then FN was detected by immunohistochemistry.

Quercetin (10(-8) to 10(-5) mol/L) inhibited the expression of TGFbeta1 in HSCs. TGFbeta1 expression decreased after the HSCs being incubated with quercetin (10(-7) mol/L) for 48 h (mean fluorescence: 13.33+/-2.44 and 18.08+/-2.54, t=16.52, P<0.01). TGFbeta1 increased the expression of CTGF mRNA in HSCs, but this effect was abrogated by quercetin (10(-7) mol/L) within 72 h. Quercetin (10(-7) mol/L) significantly inhibited the expression of FN in HSCs.

Quercetin may have an inhibitory effect on the signal pathways of TGFbeta1, including the expression of TGFbeta1, FN and CTGF.
