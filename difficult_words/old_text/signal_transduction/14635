1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (VD(3)) induces differentiation in a number of leukemia cell lines and under various conditions is able to either stimulate or inhibit nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity. Here we report a time-dependent biphasic regulation of NF-kappaB in VD(3)-treated HL-60 leukemia cells. After VD(3) treatment there was an early approximately 4 h suppression and a late 8-72 h prolonged reactivation of NF-kappaB. The reactivation of NF-kappaB was concomitant with increased IKK activities, IKK-mediated IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, p65 phosphorylation at residues S276 and S536, p65 nuclear translocation and p65 recruitment to the NF-kappaB/vitamin D responsive element promoters. In parallel with NF-kappaB stimulation, there was an up-regulation of NF-kappaB controlled inflammatory and anti-apoptotic genes such as TNFalpha, IL-1beta and Bcl-xL. VD(3)-triggered reactivation of NF-kappaB was associated with PI3K/Akt phosphorylation. PI3K/Akt antagonists suppressed VD(3)-stimulated IkappaBalpha phosphorylation as well as NF-kappaB-controlled gene expression. The early approximately 4 h VD(3)-mediated NF-kappaB suppression coincided with a prolonged increase of IkappaBalpha protein which require de novo protein synthesis, lasted for as least 72 h and was insensitive to MAPK, IKK or PI3K/Akt inhibitors. Our data suggest a novel biphasic regulation of NF-kappaB in VD(3)-treated leukemia cells and our results may have provided the first molecular explanation for the contradictory observations reported on VD(3)-mediated immune-regulation.
