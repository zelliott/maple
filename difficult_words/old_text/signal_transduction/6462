Intra-abdominal fat accumulation is related to several diseases, especially diabetes and heart disease. Molecular mechanisms associated with this independent risk factor are not well established. Through the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) strategy, we have studied the transcriptomic effects of castration and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in retroperitoneal adipose tissue of C57BL6 male mice. Approximately 50,000 SAGE tags were isolated in intact and gonadectomized mice, as well as 3 and 24 h after DHT administration. Transcripts involved in energy metabolism, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme supernatant, fatty acid synthase, lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase and monoglyceride lipase, were upregulated by DHT. Transcripts involved in adipogenesis, and cell cycle and cell shape organization, such as DDX5, C/EBPalpha, cyclin I, procollagen types I, III, IV, V and VI, SPARC and matrix metalloproteinase 2, were upregulated by DHT. Cell defense, division and signaling, protein expression and many novel transcripts were regulated by castration and DHT. The present results provide global genomic evidence for a stimulation of glycolysis, fatty acids and triacylglycerol production, lipolysis and cell shape reorganization, as well as cell proliferation and differentiation, by DHT. The novel transcripts regulated by DHT may contribute to identify new mechanisms involved in the action of sex hormones and their potential role in obesity.
