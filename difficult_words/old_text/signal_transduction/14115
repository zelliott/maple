Exercise produces many beneficial effects on brain health, in part by increasing hippocampal BDNF levels; however, the mechanism underlying BDNF gene regulation remains unknown. In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Wrann et al. (2013) show that exercise induces hippocampal Bdnf expression by stimulating expression of FNDC5, the precursor of irisin, via the transcriptional complex PGC-1α/Errα.
