Rho regulates various cell functions, including cell morphology and motility. However, the functional role of Rho on the signaling pathway in myocardial cells (MCs) is unknown. In the present study, we attempted to explore the mode of Rho action for c-fos gene expression in MCs. Expression of the c-fos promoter/enhancer linked to the luciferase reporter gene (c-fos luciferase) was stimulated by the wild type of RhoA and the point-mutated active form of RhoA (RhoA Val14) but not the biologically inactive effector domain mutant of RhoA. Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor inhibited the action of RhoA on c-fos luciferase expression. The deletion analysis revealed that the c-fos serum response element (SRE) and the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE) mainly account for c-fos luciferase expression by RhoA Val14. The c-fos SRE mutant, which contains an intact binding site for the serum response factor but lacks the ternary complex factor binding site, was activated by RhoA Val14. The action of RhoA Val14 on c-fos luciferase expression was not inhibited by downregulation of protein kinase C, protein kinase C inhibitors, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These results indicate that activated RhoA stimulates c-fos gene expression through the c-fos SRE and TRE and that the signaling pathway from activated RhoA to the c-fos promoter/enhancer is independent of these inhibitor-sensitive pathways in MCs.
