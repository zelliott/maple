A series of curcumin analogues including new 4-arylidene curcumin analogues (4-arylidene-1,7-bisarylhepta-1,6-diene-3,5-diones) were synthesized. Cell growth inhibition assays revealed that most 4-arylidene curcumin analogues can effectively decrease the growth of a panel of lung cancer cells at submicromolar and low micromolar concentrations. High content analysis technology coupled with biochemical studies showed that this new class of 4-arylidene curcumin analogues exhibits significantly improved NF-κB inhibition activity over the parent compound curcumin, at least in part by inhibiting IκB phosphorylation and degradation via IKK blockage; selected 4-arylidene curcumin analogues also reduced the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells in a clonogenic assay.
