Inhibition by several inhibitory molecules on oligodendrocytes, and by chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans and semaphorins in the glial scar discourages regeneration of axons in the injured spinal cord. This inhibition is compounded by the poor regenerative ability of most central nervous system (CNS) axons. Treatments that block some of these inhibitory mechanisms promote regeneration in animal models of cord injury. Plasticity is also reduced by some of the inhibitory molecules, and some of the treatments that promote regeneration also promote plasticity. This is probably a more achievable therapeutic target than axon regeneration, and an effective treatment would be of assistance to the majority of patients with partial cord injuries.
