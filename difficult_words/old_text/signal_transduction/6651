In this short review, the cellular mode of action of angiotensin II and arginine-vasopressin is described with emphasis on the transmembrane signalling system. Two target cells are considered: the zona glomerulosa cell of the adrenal gland and the vascular smooth muscle cell. The information provided should help practitioners in endocrinology and hypertension to understand the physiological concepts which are expected to form the basis for future therapeutic developments.
