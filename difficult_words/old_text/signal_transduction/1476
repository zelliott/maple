Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a bioactive compound present in Brassica vegetables that shows an antitumor activity in experimental animals and inhibits the growth of human cancer cells in vitro. In recent years, studies on prostate cancer (PCa) chemoprevention have been intensified, because there is a long latency for the development of clinical PCa, which makes the PCa a better target for chemoprevention. We have shown previously that I3C induces cell growth inhibition by G(1) cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in PC-3 PCa cells; however, the mechanism(s) by which I3C induces apoptosis in PC-3 cells is still not clear. A cell survival pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) and Akt is known to play an important role in inhibiting apoptosis in response to growth factor signaling, which prompted us to investigate whether this pathway plays any role in I3C-induced apoptosis in PCa cells. Here we report that I3C inhibits the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of Akt kinase. In addition, I3C abrogated epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced activation of Akt in PC-3 cells. Western blot analyses of EGF receptor showed that I3C down-regulates the EGF receptor levels and its autophosphorylation. This was also accompanied by the inhibition of EGF-induced phosphorylation of PI3K by I3C treatment. Furthermore, the known downstream modulators of the Akt/PI3K cell survival pathway, Bcl-x(L), and BAD proteins showed decreased expression after I3C treatment. From these results, we conclude that I3C-induced apoptosis is partly mediated by the inhibition of Akt activation, resulting in the alterations in the downstream regulatory molecules of Akt activation in PC-3 cells. However, further in-depth investigation is needed to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between Akt pathway and I3C effect.
