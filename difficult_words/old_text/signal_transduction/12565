Large epidemiologic studies have established that diabetes, hyperlipidemia and obesity all increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. However, the precise mechanisms by which these metabolic disorders increase the propensity to develop atherosclerosis are not known. Recently, the concept of the metabolic syndrome - a constellation of conditions including obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance - has received much attention. Studies on the metabolic syndrome might enable a better understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to cardiovascular disease. This review focuses on endothelial nitric oxide synthase and summarizes evidence that a reduction in the bioavailability of endothelium-derived nitric oxide serves as a key link between metabolic disorders and cardiovascular risk.
