Leukocytes play a central role in vein graft neointimal hyperplasia, which is significantly augmented under low shear conditions. The current concept is that shear force regulates leukocyte adhesion predominately through up-regulation of chemokines and growth factors within the graft wall. Using rabbit and murine vein graft models, we demonstrate that CC chemokine receptor 2/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mediated monocyte recruitment and a low shear environment act synergistically to augment neointimal hyperplasia development and removal of either of the conditions leads to a significant reduction in neointimal thickening. We propose a novel concept that the shear stress response element phenotypically stems from the complex interplay of the biological and physical microenvironments.
