Bacteria are capable to sense an increase of cell density population and to reply quickly and coordinately by the induction of special sets of genes. This type of the regulation was named Quorum Sensing (QS); it is based on the effect of low-molecular-weight signaling molecules of different nature (autoinducers) which accumulate in the culture at high density of bacterial population and interact with receptor regulatory proteins. QS systems are the global regulators of bacterial genes expression and play a key role in the control of many metabolic processes in cell including the regulation of virulence of bacteria. Here we review the molecular mechanisms of QS systems functioning in bacteria belonging to different taxonomic groups and discuss the potential of QS regulation as a new drug target for the treatment of bacterial infections. At present this approach is accounted as a new alternative strategy of antimicrobial therapy directed on the development of drugs inhibiting QS regulation and active just against pathogenicity of bacteria (antipathogenic drugs). Such a strategy allows to avoid a wide dissemination of resistant forms of pathogenic bacteria and the formation of biofilms increasing in many times the resistance of bacteria to drug preparations.
