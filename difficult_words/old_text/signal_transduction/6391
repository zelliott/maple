Class I alpha phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is an important enzyme in the early insulin signaling cascade, and plays a key role in insulin-mediated glucose transport. Despite extensive investigation, the genes responsible for the development of the common forms of type 2 diabetes remain unknown. This study was performed to identify variants in the coding region of p85 alpha, the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. Fibroblasts from skin biopsies from type 2 diabetics and controls were established to address this issue. P85 alpha cDNA was sequenced, and a single point mutation at codon 326 was found. This mutation resulted in a homozygous missense amino acid change Met --> Ile in one subject with type 2 diabetes and heterozygous variant in two other diabetic patients and one with severe insulin resistance. Interestingly, those patients revealed an impaired insulin-mediated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 binding to p85 alpha without any alteration in IRS-2/p85 alpha association. Furthermore, IRS-1, IRS-2, p85 alpha and MAPK protein contents were not significantly changed, and neither were MAPK or Akt phosphorylation. We conclude from our data that this variant may have only minor impact on signaling events; however, in combination with variants in other genes encoding signaling proteins, this may have a functional impact on early insulin signaling.
