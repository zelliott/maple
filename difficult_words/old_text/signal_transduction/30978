The mechanisms of innate immunity functioning--the first row of counteraction (resistance) to infectious agents are reviewed. A concept of pathogen associated molecular patterns--the unique prokaryotic conservative structures--as well as a concept of pattern-recognizing receptors of innate immunity cell recognizing the given bacterial patterns, are discussed. The data on molecular and genetic structures of both Toll-like- and NOD-receptors: the important compounds of pattern-recognizing receptors, the main signaling pathways from receptor to cell genome activation as well as the principles of immune cell activation by pathogen associated molecular patterns are submitted.
