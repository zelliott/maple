Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and P53 mutations are frequently observed in bladder cancer. We here describe the distribution of FGFR3 mutations and P53 overexpression in 260 primary urothelial cell carcinomas. FGFR3 mutations were observed in 59% and P53 overexpression in 25%. Interestingly, FGFR3 and P53 alterations were mutually exclusive, because they coincided in only 5.7% of tumors. Consequently, we propose that they characterize two alternative genetic pathways in urothelial cell carcinoma pathogenesis. The genetic alterations were reflected in the pathology and the clinical outcome, i.e., FGFR3 mutations were found in low-stage/-grade tumors and were associated with a favorable disease course, whereas P53 alterations were tied to adverse disease parameters.
