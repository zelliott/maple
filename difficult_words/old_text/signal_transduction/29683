It is here demonstrated that the set of gene expressions underlying the angiogenic balance in tissues can be molecularly reset en masse by a single protein. Using genome-wide expression profiling, coupled with RT-PCR and phosphorylation analysis, we show that the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin downregulates many signaling pathways in human microvascular endothelium associated with proangiogenic activity. Simultaneously, endostatin is found to upregulate many antiangiogenic genes. The result is a unique alignment between the direction of gene regulation and angiogenic status. Profiling further reveals the regulation of genes not heretofore associated with angiogenesis. Our analysis of coregulated genes shows complex interpathway communications in an intricate signaling network that both recapitulates and extends on current understanding of the angiogenic process. More generally, insights into the nature of genetic networking from the cell biologic and therapeutic perspectives are revealed.
