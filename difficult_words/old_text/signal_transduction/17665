c-Yes and c-Src are the two most closely related members of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Although there is much evidence to support redundancy in signaling between these two kinases, there is also a growing body of evidence to indicate specificity in signaling. In this review, we summarize c-Yes, its potential functions and its ability to modulate signals that are distinct from c-Src.
