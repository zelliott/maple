We wished to determine whether the cytokine-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) pathway is modulated by chronic hypoxia in vitro.

We investigated the effects of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1beta on expression of iNOS mRNA, iNOS protein, and NO production in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes subjected to 1% O2 for 48 hours. Among several cytokines tested, IL-1beta was the most effective in stimulating NO production, which was maximum at 48 hours. In parallel, IL-1beta induced expression of both iNOS mRNA and protein. Hypoxia alone had no effect on NO production, iNOS gene expression, or protein induction. However, chronic hypoxia decreased IL-1beta-stimulated NO production, mRNA expression, and protein level in cardiac myocytes. Radioligand binding and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that during chronic hypoxia, IL-1 receptor density and activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB induced by IL-1beta were decreased, which may account at least in part for the decrease in iNOS expression.

These data indicate that IL-1beta induces iNOS gene expression, de novo synthesis of iNOS protein, and NO generation in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and that chronic hypoxia appears to be a potent negative regulator of iNOS expression in these cells.
