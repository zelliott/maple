Tight regulation of gene transcription is critical in muscle development as well as during the formation and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We previously demonstrated that the transcription of G protein beta1 (Gbeta1) is enhanced by treatment of cultured myotubes with neuregulin (NRG), a trophic factor that plays an important role in neural development. In the current study, we report that the transcript levels of Gbeta1 and Gbeta2 subunits in skeletal muscle are up-regulated following sciatic nerve injury or blockade of nerve activity. These observations prompted us to explore the possibility that G protein subunits regulate NRG-mediated signaling and gene transcription. We showed that overexpression of Gbeta1 or Gbeta2 in COS7 cells attenuates NRG-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation, whereas suppression of Gbeta2 expression in C2C12 myotubes enhances NRG-mediated ERK1/2 activation and c-fos transcription. These results suggest that expression of Gbeta protein negatively regulates NRG-stimulated gene transcription in cultured myotubes. Taken together, our observations provide evidence that specific heterotrimeric G proteins regulate NRG-mediated signaling and gene transcription during rat muscle development.
