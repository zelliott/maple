The Signal Transduction Pathways as Therapeutic Targets meeting was attended by approximately 400 participants from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, including basic scientists, pharmaceutical scientists and postdoctoral fellows from many fields. The overall focus of the meeting was on the role that signal transduction plays in biology and pathophysiology and the design of compounds that can modulate these pathways. This report describes several signaling pathways that are potential targets for inflammation and cancer, including those that involve the following signaling molecules: Jun N-terminal kinase, cyclin-dependent kinases, hypoxia-inducible factor, p21-activated kinases, MEK kinase 1, phosphoinositide 3-kinases, myc, p53, Smad, hedgehog, nuclear factor-kB and G protein. This report also describes various compounds as potential anti-inflammatory or anticancer agents.
