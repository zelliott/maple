Signaling through the Notch1 receptor is essential for the control of numerous developmental processes during embryonic life as well as in adult tissue homeostasis and disease. Since the outcome of Notch1 signaling is highly context-dependent, and its precise physiological and pathological role in many organs is unclear, it is of great interest to localize and identify the cells that receive active Notch1 signals in vivo. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a BAC-transgenic mouse line, N1-Gal4VP16, that when crossed to a Gal4-responsive reporter mouse line allowed the identification of cells undergoing active Notch1 signaling in vivo. Analysis of embryonic and adult N1-Gal4VP16 mice demonstrated that the activation pattern of the transgene coincides with previously observed activation patterns of the endogenous Notch1 receptor. Thus, this novel reporter mouse line provides a unique tool to specifically investigate the spatial and temporal aspects of Notch1 signaling in vivo.
