Since its discovery over three decades ago, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been a model system for learning how growth factors regulate biological processes. For the first several decades investigators used cells grown in tissue culture. More recently, PDGF signaling has also been investigated in mice. This review outlines the advances in these two systems, and highlights some of the directions for future investigation.
