Reproducible cell-cell interactions contribute to the invariance of Caenorhabditis elegans development and allow high resolution study of molecular mechanisms of intercellular signaling. A number of new cell interactions have been discovered in the past year. The power of nematode molecular genetics has been increased through several technical advances and the genome project, and these new approaches are now being successfully applied both to familiar and new signaling mechanisms.
