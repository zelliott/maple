Recent advances suggest type I interferon (IFN) pathway as an emerging mediator of systemic autoimmunity. This review aims to summarize the latest developments in the biology of type I IFN pathway and its contributory role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders with a particular focus on Sjögren's syndrome.

Increased circulating type I IFN levels along with upregulated type I IFN inducible genes in salivary gland tissues, peripheral blood and mononuclear cells suggest activation of type I IFN pathway in Sjögren's syndrome. Additional regulatory mechanisms and novel potential suppressors of type I IFN production provide new insights into disease pathogenesis, pointing to type I IFN system as a potential new therapeutic target.

Compelling evidence suggests type I IFN as a key player in pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome and an attractive potential therapeutic target. Meticulous stratification of patient subgroups characterized by activation of type I IFN pathway should be performed in carefully designed translational studies.
