Apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mice, atherosclerosis-prone mice, show an autoimmune response, but the pathogenesis is not fully understood. We investigated the pathogenesis in female and male ApoE(-/-) mice. The spleens of all ApoE(-/-) and C57BL/6 (B6) mice were weighed. The serum IgG level and titers of anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody were assayed by ELISA. Apoptosis of spleen tissue was evaluated by TUNEL. TLR4 level in spleen tissue was tested by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Levels of MyD88, p38, phosphorylated p38 (pp38), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in spleen tissue were detected by Western blot analysis. We also survey the changes of serum autoantibodies, spleen weight, splenocyte apoptosis and the expressions of TLR4, MyD88, pp38, IRF3 and Bax in spleen tissue in male ApoE(-/-) mice after 4weeks of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Toll-like receptor 4 ligand, administration. ApoE(-/-) mice showed splenomegaly and significantly increased serum level of IgG and titers of ANA and anti-dsDNA antibody as compared with B6 mice. Splenocyte apoptosis and the expression of TLR4, MyD88, pp38, IRF3 and Bax in spleen tissue were significantly lower in ApoE(-/-) than B6 mice. The expression of TLR4, MyD88, IRF3, pp38, and Bax differed by sex in ApoE(-/-) spleen tissue. The down-regulation of TLR4 signal molecules induced by LPS led to decreased expression of Bax and increased serum titers of ANA and anti-dsDNA antibody. Therefore, the TLR4 signal pathway may participate in maintaining the balance of splenocyte apoptosis and autoantibody production in ApoE(-/-) mice.
