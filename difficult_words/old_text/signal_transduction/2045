Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase plays an important role in a variety of biological processes, including proliferation and apoptosis. PI3-kinase is a heterodimer consisting of an 85 kDa adapter protein (p85) containing one SH3 domain and two SH2 domains and a 110 kDa catalytic subunit (p110). Recently an oncogenic form of p85 named p65-PI3K lacking the C-terminal SH2 domain has been cloned from an irradiation-induced murine thymic lymphoma and transgenic mice expressing p65-PI3K in T lymphocytes develop a lymphoproliferative disorder. Here we describe the cloning of a C-terminal truncated form of p85 expressed in a human lymphoma cell line (CO) with a T cell phenotype derived from a patient with Hodgkin's disease. As a result of a frame-shift mutation at amino acid 636, p76 is lacking most of the C-terminal SH2 domain, but contains the inter-SH2 domain and is associated with an active form of PI3-kinase. A PI3-kinase-dependent constitutive activation of Akt was detected in CO cells which was only partially reduced after serum starvation. Treatment of CO cells with the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation associated with an increased number of apoptotic cells. This is the first detection of a mutated form of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase in human hematopoietic cells further underlining a potential role of PI3-kinase/Akt signaling in human leukemogenesis.
