The activation and signalling activity of the membrane mu-opioid receptor (MOP-R) involve interactions among the receptor, G-proteins, effectors and many other membrane or cytosolic proteins. Decades of investigation have led to identification of the main biochemical processes, but the mechanisms governing the successive protein-protein interactions have yet to be established. We will need to unravel the dynamic membrane organisation of this complex and multifaceted molecular machinery if we are to understand these mechanisms. Here, we review and discuss advances in our understanding of the signalling mechanism of MOP-R resulting from biochemical or biophysical studies of the organisation of this receptor in the plasma membrane.
