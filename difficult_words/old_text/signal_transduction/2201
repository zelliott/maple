Leptin (OB), an adipocyte-secreted circulating hormone, and its receptor (OB-R) are key components of an endocrine loop that regulates mammalian body weight. In this report we have analyzed signal transduction activities of OB-R containing the fatty mutation [OB-R(fa)], a single amino acid substitution at position 269 (Gln --> Pro) in the OB-R extracellular domain that results in the obese phenotype of the fatty rat. We find that this mutant receptor exhibits both ligand-independent transcriptional activation via interleukin 6 and hematopoietin receptor response elements and ligand-independent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins 1 and 3. However, OB-R(fa) is unable to constitutively activate STAT5B and is highly impaired for ligand induced activation of STAT5B compared with OB-R(wt). Introduction of the fatty mutation into a OB-R/G-CSF-R chimera generates a receptor with constitutive character that is similar but distinct from that of OB-R(fa). Constitutive mutant OB-R(fa) receptor signaling is repressed by coexpression of OB-R(wt). The implications of an extracellular domain amino acid substitution generating a cytokine receptor with a partially constitutive phenotype are discussed both in terms of the mechanism of OB-R triggering and the biology of the fatty rat.
