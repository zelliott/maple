In Drosophila melanogaster, achaete (ac) and m8 are model basic helix-loop-helix activator (bHLH A) and repressor genes, respectively, that have the opposite cell expression pattern in proneural clusters during Notch signaling. Previous studies have shown that activation of m8 transcription in specific cells within proneural clusters by Notch signaling is programmed by a "combinatorial" and "architectural" DNA transcription code containing binding sites for the Su(H) and proneural bHLH A proteins. Here we show the novel result that the ac promoter contains a similar combinatorial code of Su(H) and bHLH A binding sites but contains a different Su(H) site architectural code that does not mediate activation during Notch signaling, thus programming a cell expression pattern opposite that of m8 in proneural clusters.
