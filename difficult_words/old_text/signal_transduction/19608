The treatment of cancer is being revolutionized by an improved understanding of the genetic events that occur in tumors. Advances in the understanding of the prevalence and patterns of mutations in melanoma have recently led to impressive results in trials of personalized, targeted therapies for this disease. In this review, we will discuss the molecular targets that have been validated clinically, additional genetic events that are candidates for future trials, and the challenges that remain to improve outcomes further in this aggressive disease.
