Insulin stimulates the disposal of blood glucose into skeletal muscle and adipose tissues by the translocation of GLUT4 from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane, and consequently the concentration of blood glucose levels decreases rapidly in vivo. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Akt play a pivotal role in the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin, but detailed mechanisms are unknown. We and others reported that not only insulin but also platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor facilitate glucose uptake through GLUT4 translocation by activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt in cultured cells. However, opposite results were also reported. We generated transgenic mice that specifically express the PDGF receptor in skeletal muscle. In these mice, PDGF stimulated glucose transport into skeletal muscle in vitro and in vivo. Thus, PDGF apparently shares with insulin some of the signaling molecules needed for the stimulation of glucose transport. The degree of glucose uptake in vivo reached approximately 60% of that by insulin injection in skeletal muscle, but blood glucose levels were not decreased by PDGF in these mice. Therefore, PDGF-induced disposal of blood glucose into skeletal muscle is insufficient for rapid decrease of blood glucose levels.
