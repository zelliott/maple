Pancreatic derived factor (PANDER, FAM3B) is a peptide mainly synthesized and secreted by pancreatic β-cells. PANDER is proposed to be involved in regulation of β-cell function under physiological conditions and impairment of β-cell function under pathological conditions. MCP-1 (CCL2) is expressed by normal pancreatic islets and has been implicated in inflammation related pancreatic disorders. We examined the effect of MCP-1 on PANDER expression by using murine pancreatic β-cell line MIN6 and pancreatic islets. We found that MCP-1 induced PANDER mRNA transcription and protein synthesis in MIN6 cells and islets. By using calcium chelator (EGTA); inhibitors for PKC (Go6976), MEK1/2 (PD98059) or c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) (SP600125); c-Jun dominant-negative construct; PANDER promoter luciferase constructs; and islets isolated from Fos knockout mice; we demonstrated that MCP-1 induced PANDER gene expression in β-cells through Ca(2+)-ERK1/2-AP-1 and PKC-JNK-AP-1 signaling pathways. Our findings suggest a new link between the endocrine and immune systems and provide useful information for further investigating the physiological functions of PANDER and its involvement in inflammation-related pancreatic disorders.
