A methanolic extract of Costus pictus (CPME) showed optimum anti-diabetic activity at 100 ng/ml. Bioactivity-guided purification of CPME led to the isolation of methyl tetracosanoate (MT) which showed an optimum glucose uptake at 1 ng/ml. CPME at 10 mug/ml inhibited adipogenesis whereas fully differentiated adipocytes exhibited a 3-fold increase in lipid accumulation compared to pre-adipocytes. Gene and protein expression of key targets in insulin signaling and adipogenesis pathway revealed that CPME exhibited anti-diabetic activity along with anti-adipogenic activity whereas MT demonstrated only anti-diabetic activity.
