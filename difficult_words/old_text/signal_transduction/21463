With an ever-growing population of obese people as well as comorbidities associated with obesity, finding effective weight loss strategies is more imperative than ever. One of the challenges in curbing the obesity crisis is designing successful strategies for long-term weight loss and weight-loss maintenance. Currently, weight-loss strategies include promotion of therapeutic lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), pharmacological therapy, and bariatric surgery. This review focuses on several pharmacological targets that activate central nervous system pathways that normally limit food intake and body weight. Though it is likely that no single therapy will prove effective for everyone, this review considers several recent pre-clinical targets, and several compounds that have been in human clinical trials.
