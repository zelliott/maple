Many genetic alterations that contribute to CNS tumorigenesis and progression have been identified. One goal of such studies is to identify loci that would serve as diagnostic prognostic markers or both. A significant advance is the observation that chromosome 1p loss identified anaplastic oligodendroglioma and a subset of high-grade glioma patients who responded to chemotherapy and had longer survival times. Combined 1p and 19q loss was a predictor of prolonged survival of patients having pure oligodendrogliomas. Such markers eventually may be used to identify patients upfront who would benefit from treatment, while sparing patients who would not benefit. Although many molecular participants involved in the biologic pathways that promote proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion have been elucidated, there are still many gaps in clinicians' knowledge. It is expected that the use of the human genome project information and databases such as SAGEmap, in combination with techniques such as cDNA arrays and proteomics, will facilitate greatly the identification of novel genes that contribute to CNS tumors. cDNA arrays and tissue arrays will permit the construction of CNS-specific screening tools that will permit the identification of tumor-specific mutations and alterations so that patient-specific therapies can be designed.
