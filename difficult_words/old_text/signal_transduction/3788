Receptors for the glycoprotein hormones, LH/CG, FSH, and TSH, are a unique subclass of the seven-transmembrane, G protein-coupled proteins with a large N-terminal extracellular (ecto-) domain. Although ecto-domains of gonadotropin receptors confer ligand binding, expression of soluble binding proteins has been difficult. We fused the ecto-domains of LH or FSH receptors to the single-transmembrane domain of CD8 and found that hybrid proteins anchored on the cell surface retained high-affinity ligand binding. Inclusion of a junctional thrombin cleavage site in the hybrids allowed generation of soluble receptor fragments that interfered with gonadotropin binding to their receptors and blocked cAMP production stimulated by gonadotropins. Cross-linking analyses confirmed the formation of high molecular weight complexes between receptor ecto-domains and their specific ligands. A similar approach also generated a soluble TSH receptor fragment capable of blocking TSH-induced signal transduction. When administered to rats, the soluble FSH receptor fragment retarded testis growth and induced testis cell apoptosis. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of generating ligand-binding regions of glycoprotein hormone receptors to selectively neutralize actions of gonadotropins and TSH, thus allowing future design of novel contraceptives and management of different gonadal and thyroid dysfunction. The present study represents the first successful derivation of soluble, ligand-binding domains from glycoprotein hormone receptors as functional antagonists. Similar approaches could allow generation of ecto-domains of related receptors to neutralize actions of ligands or receptor antibodies and to facilitate structural-functional analysis.
