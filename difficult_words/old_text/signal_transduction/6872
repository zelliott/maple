Relating protein concentration to cell-type-specific responses is one of the remaining challenges for obtaining a quantitative systems level understanding of mammalian signaling. Here we used mass-spectrometry (MS)- and antibody-based quantitative proteomic approaches to measure protein abundances for 75% of a hand-curated reconstructed ErbB network of 198 proteins, in two established cell types (HEK293 and MCF-7) and in primary keratinocyte cells. Comparison with other quantitative studies allowed building a set of ErbB network proteins expressed in all cells and another which are cell-specific and could impart specific properties to the network. As a proof-of-concept of the importance of protein concentration, we generated a small simplified mathematical model encompassing ligand binding, followed by receptor dimerization, activation, and degradation. The model predicts ErbB phosphorylation in HEK293, MCF-7, and keratinocyte cells simply by incorporating cell-type-specific ErbB1, ErbB2, and caveolin-1 abundances but otherwise contains similar rate constants. Altogether, the data provide a resource for protein abundances and localization to be included in larger mathematical models, enabling the generation of cell-type-specific computational models. MS data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange via PRIDE (with identifier PXD000623) and PASSEL (with identifier PASS00372).
