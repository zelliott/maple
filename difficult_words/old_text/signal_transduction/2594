Many laboratories, using a variety of organisms, have contributed to deciphering the identity and the order of the components leading from ligand-bound receptor tyrosine kinases to various intracellular events, including changes in gene expression. The gaps have only been filled recently. This minireview summarizes the findings and points out the degree of conservation of the same pathway in distant organisms, both at the molecular level and in terms of the consecutive steps. The review also looks at points at which this pathway might be diverging and points onto which other pathways might be converging. These interactions are not always clear cut, and understanding them will be the challenge for the future.
