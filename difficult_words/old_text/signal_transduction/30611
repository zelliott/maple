A CD30-ligand (CD30L) is a 40-kilodalton, type II membrane-associated glycoprotein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family. Serum levels of soluble CD30 increased in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), suggesting that CD30L/CD30 signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. In this study, we investigated the role of CD30L in oxazolone (OXA)- and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in CD30L knockout (KO) mice.

Colitis was induced by OXA or TNBS in CD30LKO mice with BALB/c or C57BL/6 background, respectively, and diverse clinical signs of the disease were evaluated. Cytokine production from lamina propria T cells of the colon was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-interleukin (IL)-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or agonistic anti-CD30 mAb was inoculated in mice with colitis induced by OXA or TNBS.

CD30LKO mice were susceptible to OXA-induced colitis but resistant to TNBS-induced acute colitis. The levels of T helper cell 2 type cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 in the LP T cells were significantly higher, but the levels of interferon gamma were lower in OXA- or TNBS-treated CD30LKO mice than in wild-type mice. In vivo administration of agonistic anti-CD30 mAb ameliorated OXA-induced colitis but aggravated TNBS-induced colitis in CD30LKO mice.

These results suggest that CD30L/CD30 signaling is involved in development of both OXA- and TNBS-induced colitis. Modulation of CD30L/CD30 signaling by mAb could be a novel biologic therapy for IBD.
