In non-excitable cells, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R), a ligand-gated Ca(2+) channel, plays an important role in the control of intracellular Ca(2+). There are three subtypes of IP(3)R that are differentially distributed among cell types. AR4-2J cells express almost exclusively the IP(3)R-2 subtype. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) on the activity of IP(3)R-2 in AR4-2J cells. We showed that immunoprecipitated IP(3)R-2 is a good substrate for PKA. Using a back-phosphorylation approach, we showed that endogenous PKA phosphorylates IP(3)R-2 in intact AR4-2J cells. Pretreatment with PKA enhanced IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) release in permeabilized AR4-2J cells. Pretreatment with the cAMP generating agent's forskolin and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) enhanced carbachol (Cch)-induced and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced Ca(2+) responses in intact AR4-2J cells. Our results are consistent with an enhancing effect of PKA on IP(3)R-2 activity. This conclusion supports the emerging concept of crosstalk between Ca(2+) signaling and cAMP pathways and thus provides another way by which Ca(2+) signals are finely encoded within non-excitable cells.
