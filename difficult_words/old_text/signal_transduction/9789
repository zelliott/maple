Studies have revealed that the adult mammalian brain has the capacity to regenerate some neurons after cerebral ischemia. And this perspective on neurogenesis adds to the conceptual framework for strategies for the repair of ischemia-induced brain injury, that is, if the effect of ischemia-induced neurogenesis is enhanced, then the recovery of brain function after stroke can be promoted. Neurogenesis is a multistep process that requires the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells, migration and that new cells differentiate, survive and integrate into existing neural networks. For that to occur, the same concerted action of various factors is needed, especially transcription factors which regulate the expression of many moleculars and interact with them to promote neurogenesis. This review article gives a brief overview of some transcription factors (NF-ÎºB, Hes, STAT3, AP-1, CREB, HIF1, Pax6, Tcf/Lef, Gli, Sox2, Olig2, Dlx2, TLX, Bmi-1) in ischemia-induced neurogenesis.
