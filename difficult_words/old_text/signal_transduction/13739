More than 40 variations of intercellular organelle transfer, such as a mitochondria or lysosome originating in one cell being transported to another cell, have been described. We review the mechanisms and subcellular structures by which, and conditions under which, transfer occurs, with particular attention paid to the role of external cell stress in activating transfer. We propose a research agenda for answering key questions in this burgeoning field.
