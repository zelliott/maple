Many solid tumours show an increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), which forms a barrier to transcapillary transport. This barrier is an obstacle in tumour treatment, as it results in inefficient uptake of therapeutic agents. There are a number of factors that contribute to increased IFP in the tumour, such as vessel abnormalities, fibrosis and contraction of the interstitial matrix. Lowering the tumour IFP with specific signal-transduction antagonists might be a useful approach to improving anticancer drug efficacy.
