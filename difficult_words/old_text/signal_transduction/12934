Recent work has identified the elusive male (pollen) determinant that underlies self-incompatibility in Brassica (cabbage). The key pollen factor, recognized by the stigma of an incompatible plant, is a small cysteine-rich protein that interacts directly with the receptor domain of a stigma receptor serine-threonine kinase to initiate haplotype-specific pollen recognition and rejection.
