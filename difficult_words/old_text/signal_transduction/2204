The tetraspanin CD81 is ubiquitously expressed and associated with CD19 on B lymphocytes and with CD4 and CD8 on T lymphocytes. Analysis of mice with disrupted CD81 gene reveals normal T cells but a distinct abnormality in B cells consisting of decreased expression of CD19 and severe reduction in peritoneal B-1 cells. CD81-deficient B cells responded normally to surface IgM crosslinking, but had severely impaired calcium influx following CD19 engagement. CD81-deficient mice had increased serum IgM and IgA and an exaggerated antibody response to the type II T independent antigen TNP-Ficoll. These results suggest that CD81 is important for CD19 signaling and B cell function.
