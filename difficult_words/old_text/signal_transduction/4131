For a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel to enter its open state, serine residues in the R domain must be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and intracellular ATP must bind to the nucleotide-binding folds and subsequently be hydrolyzed. CFTR with its R domain partially removed, DeltaR(708-835)-CFTR, forms a chloride channel that opens independently of protein kinase A phosphorylation, with open probability approximately one-third that of the wild type CFTR channel. Deletion of this portion of the R domain from CFTR alters the response of the channel to 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate, pyrophosphate, and vanadate, compounds that prolong burst duration of the wild type CFTR channel but fail to do so in the DeltaR-CFTR. In addition, the addition of exogenous unphosphorylated R domain protein, which blocks the wild type CFTR channel, has no effect on the DeltaR-CFTR channel. However, when the exogenous R domain is phosphorylated, significant stimulation of the DeltaR-CFTR channel results; Po increases from 0.10 to 0.22. These data are consistent with a model for CFTR function in which the R domain in the unphosphorylated state interacts with the first nucleotide binding fold to inhibit either binding or hydrolysis of ATP or transduction of the effect to open the pore, but when the R domain is phosphorylated, it undergoes conformational change and interacts at a separate site in the first nucleotide binding fold to stimulate either binding or hydrolysis of ATP or transduction of the effect to open the pore.
