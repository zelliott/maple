The Hippo pathway, a signaling cascade that controls cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cell differentiation, has emerged as a fundamental regulator of many physiological and pathological processes. Recent studies have revealed a complex network of interactions directing Hippo pathway activity, and have connected this pathway with other key signaling pathways. Such crosstalk has uncovered novel roles for Hippo signaling, including regulation of TGFβ/SMAD and WNT/β-catenin pathways. This review highlights some of the recent findings in the Hippo field with an emphasis on how the Hippo pathway is integrated with other pathways to mediate diverse processes.
