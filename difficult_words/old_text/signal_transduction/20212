To elucidate the signaling mechanisms involved in the protective effect of EUK-207 against irradiation-induced cellular damage and apoptosis in human intestinal microvasculature endothelial cells (HIMEC).

HIMECs were irradiated and treated with EUK-207. Using hydroethidine and DCF-DA fluorescent probe the intracellular superoxide and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined. By real-time PCR and western blotting caspase-3, Bcl2 and Bax genes and proteins were analyzed. Proliferation was determined by [(3)H]-thymidine uptake. Immunofluorescence staining was used for translocation of p65 NFκB subunit.

Irradiation increased ROS production, apoptosis, Bax, Caspase3 and NFkB activity in HIMEC and inhibited cell survival/growth/proliferation. EUK-207 restored the endothelial functions, markedly inhibited the ROS, up-regulated the Bcl2 and down-regulated Bax and prevented NFκB caspase 3 activity in HIMEC.

HIMEC provide a novel model to define the effect of irradiation induced endothelial dysfunction. Our findings suggest that EUK-207 effectively inhibits the damaging effect of irradiation.
