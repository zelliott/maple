We investigated the effects of retinoic acids (RAs) on steroid hormone production and mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes in rat placenta in vitro and in vivo. In the rat trophoblast giant cell line Rcho-1, the natural retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA) and synthetic RXR agonist LG100268 slightly promoted production of progesterone and androgen, whereas the natural retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonist all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and synthetic RAR agonist TTNPB did not. Furthermore, although administration of atRA and 9cRA into the rat uterus at 13.5days postcoitum robustly induced mRNA expression of cellular retinol binding protein II, the gene for which is targeted by RAR and/or RXR, in the placenta, neither RA affected the expression of placental steroidogenic enzymes, and both had little effect on progesterone and androgen levels in the placenta and embryo, suggesting that placental steroidogenesis is not regulated by RAs in rats.
