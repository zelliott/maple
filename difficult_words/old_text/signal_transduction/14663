Both plant and animal genomes encode proteins with nucleotide binding domains fused to leucine-rich repeat domains that are involved in responses to pathogens. While these domain structures are probably an example of convergent evolution, there are a number of similarities in the core mechanisms by which these proteins are regulated.
