In previous studies we have reported that gastrin exerts a trophic effect on rat colonic epithelial cells in vitro. The effect of gastrin appeared to be mediated through a protein kinase C mechanism. In this study, we have characterized the role of protein kinase C in the gastrin-induced stimulation. Gastrin, in a time- and dose-dependent manner, increased protein kinase C translocation from the cytosol to the membrane, an index of enzyme activation. Maximum translocation occurred in 1 to 2 min following exposure to gastrin (10(-8) M), before declining back to baseline level within 5 min. Gastrin did not change total protein kinase C activity in the colonic cells. Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, totally abolished the basal as well as the gastrin-stimulated activity of protein kinase C. The tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also stimulated colonic epithelial protein kinase C. However, prolonged treatment of cells with phorbol inhibited their subsequent response to gastrin stimulation. The response to gastrin was also prevented by the gastrin receptor antagonist proglumide. These observations suggest that protein kinase C mediates the stimulatory effect of gastrin on colonic epithelial cells, possibly through a receptor mechanism.
