Recently, it has been shown that cerebellar LTD has a late phase that may be blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors. To understand the mechanisms underlying the late phase, we interfered with the activation of transcription factors that might couple synaptic activation to protein synthesis. Particle-mediated transfection of cultured Purkinje neurons with an expression vector encoding a dominant inhibitory form of CREB resulted in a nearly complete blockade of the late phase. Kinases that activate CREB were inhibited, and LTD was assessed. Inhibition of PKA or the MAPK/RSK cascades were without effect on the late phase, while constructs designed to interfere with CaMKIV function attenuated the late phase. These results indicate that the activation of CaMKIV and CREB are necessary to establish a late phase of cerebellar LTD.
