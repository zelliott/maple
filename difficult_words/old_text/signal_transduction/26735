Miniature is an extracellular zona pellucida domain-containing protein, required for flattening of pupal wing epithelia in Drosophila. Here, we show that Miniature also plays an important role in the post-eclosion wing maturation processes triggered by the neurohormone bursicon. Wing expansion and epithelial apoptosis are drastically delayed in miniature loss-of-function mutants, and sped up upon overexpression of the protein in wings. Miniature acts upstream from the heterotrimeric Gs protein transducing the bursicon signal in wing epithelia. We propose that Miniature interacts with bursicon and regulates its diffusion through or stability within the wing tissue.
