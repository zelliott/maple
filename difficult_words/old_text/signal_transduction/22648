The invasion of host cells by the obligate intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is calcium dependent. We have identified two calcium storage areas in tachyzoites, the endoplasmic reticulum and vesicles that contain high concentrations of calcium as amorphous calcium phosphate precipitates. Our data indicate that these vesicles slowly lose their calcium during the intracellular development of the tachyzoite as their nucleus phosphorus content increases. We found fluctuations in the sulfur content of the tachyzoite during invasion following the exocytosis of protein from the secretory organelles, with a loss of sodium and chlorine, and the uptake of potassium from the host cell cytoplasm. We demonstrated that penetration of the tachyzoite into the host cell was accompanied by increases in the concentrations of phosphorus and sulfur in the host cell nucleus, probably due to increased transcription. The cytosol sodium concentrations decreased, while the potassium content increased. Thus, the subcellular element distribution of tachyzoites and host cells changes during invasion and intracellular growth of the parasites. In addition, our results indicate that tachyzoite calcium might be involved in the egress of the parasite from the host cell.
