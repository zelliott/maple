Dietary restriction can extend life span in most organisms tested to date, suggesting that mechanisms sensing nutrient and energy availability might regulate longevity. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has emerged as a key energy sensor with the ability to transcriptionally reprogram the cell and metabolically adapt to external cues. In this review, we will discuss the possible role of AMPK in the beneficial effects of calorie restriction on health and life span.
