G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) has previously been described to be important in steroid-mediated growth and to inhibit cell proliferation. Here we investigated whether the effect of GPR30 on cell growth is dependent on steroid hormone receptors. We stably introduced GPR30 in immortalized normal mammary epithelial (HME) cells using retroviruses for gene delivery. GPR30 inhibited the growth and proliferation of the cells. They expressed glucocorticoid receptor, but not estrogen or progesterone receptor. GPR30 down-regulated the expression of cofactor transcription intermediary factor 2 (TIF2) analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR analysis, and also diminished the expression of TIF2 at protein level analyzed by Western blotting using nuclear extracts from mammary epithelial cells. When HME cells were transiently transfected with the glucocorticoid response element MMTV-luc reporter plasmid, stable expression of GPR30 resulted in the abolition of ligand-induced transactivation of the promoter. In COS cells, transient transfection of GPR30 with glucocorticoid receptor alpha resulted in an abrogation of the MMTV-luc and GRE-luc reporter activities induced by dexamethasone. The results suggest a novel mechanism by which membrane-initiated signaling interferes with steroid signaling.
