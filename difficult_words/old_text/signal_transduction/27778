The recognition of molecular control elements which govern cell and organ function is essential for the development of novel drug therapies and for an understanding of drug actions. Thus, a major interest is focused on methodologies which permit the identification of novel control elements. This is of particular relevance for the identification of drug targets, the distinction of target isoforms, the differentiation of signalling pathways, the generation of disease models and toxicological testing. In this review, we discuss different classes of genetically modified animals and their potential to elucidate biological processes relevant for pharmacological research including functional genomics. Techniques which permit the time- and tissue-specific inducible regulation of gene expression present an important methodological advance.
