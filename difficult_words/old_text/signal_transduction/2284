Saccharomyces cerevisiae spore germination is a process in which quiescent, non-dividing spores become competent for mitotic cell division. Using a novel assay for spore uncoating, we found that spore germination was a multi-step process whose nutritional requirements differed from those for mitotic division. Although both processes were controlled by nutrient availability, efficient spore germination occurred in conditions that did not support cell division. In addition, germination did not require many key regulators of cell cycle progression including the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc28p. However, two processes essential for cell growth, protein synthesis and signaling through the Ras protein pathway, were required for spore germination. Moreover, increasing Ras protein activity in spores resulted in an accelerated rate of germination and suggested that activation of the Ras pathway was rate-limiting for entry into the germination program. An early step in germination, commitment, was identified as the point at which spores became irreversibly destined to complete the uncoating process even if the original stimulus for germination was removed. Spore commitment to germination required protein synthesis and Ras protein activity; in contrast, post-commitment events did not require ongoing protein synthesis. Altogether, these data suggested a model for Ras function during transitions between periods of quiescence and cell cycle progression.
