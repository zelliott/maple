Development of germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells requires the transcription factor B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6). Expression of Bcl6 in B cells and helper T cells is regulated by complex signals including those generated through their antigen-specific interactions, which take place in various microenvironments depending on their activation/differentiation states. In the last several years, it has become possible to detect Bcl6 protein in individual B cells and T cells by intracellular staining with the newly developed antibodies or by using the reporter mice. Experiments using these reagents have started to clarify microanatomical location of early Bcl6 upregulation in B cells and T cells, and contributed to reveal the dispensability and indispensability of B cells in the early and late phase of Tfh differentiation. They also started to reveal the diversity, plasticity, and/or instability of Tfh cells. We summarize the recent findings made by tracking Bcl6 expression together with the updated knowledge about dynamics of antigen-engaged B cells and helper T cells and discuss them in relation to possible signaling requirements for the development of GC B cells and Tfh cells.
