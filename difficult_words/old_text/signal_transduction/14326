Genome-wide gene-expression studies have shown that hundreds of yeast genes are induced or repressed transiently by changes in temperature; many are annotated to stress response on this basis. To obtain a genome-scale assessment of which genes are functionally important for innate and/or acquired thermotolerance, we combined the use of a barcoded pool of ~4,800 nonessential, prototrophic Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion strains with Illumina-based deep-sequencing technology. As reported in other recent studies that have used deletion mutants to study stress responses, we observed that gene deletions resulting in the highest thermosensitivity generally are not the same as those transcriptionally induced in response to heat stress. Functional analysis of identified genes revealed that metabolism, cellular signaling, and chromatin regulation play roles in regulating thermotolerance and in acquired thermotolerance. However, for most of the genes identified, the molecular mechanism behind this action remains unclear. In fact, a large fraction of identified genes are annotated as having unknown functions, further underscoring our incomplete understanding of the response to heat shock. We suggest that survival after heat shock depends on a small number of genes that function in assessing the metabolic health of the cell and/or regulate its growth in a changing environment.
