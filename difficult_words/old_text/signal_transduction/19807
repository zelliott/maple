This study investigated changes in gene expressions related to mineralization when mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is applied in vitro to human dental pulp cells (HDPCs).

MTA in a Teflon tube (diameter 10 mm, height 2 mm) was applied to HDPCs. Empty tube-applied HDPCs were used as negative control. Total RNA was extracted at 6, 24, and 72 hours after MTA application for microarray analysis. The results were confirmed selectively by performing reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for genes that showed changes of more than 2-fold or less than half.

Of the 24,546 genes, 109 genes were up-regulated more than 2-fold (eg, THBS1, VCAN, BHLHB2, FN1, COL10A1, TUFT1, and HMOX1), and 69 genes were down-regulated below 50% (eg, DCN, SOCS2, and IL8).

These results suggest that rather than being a bio-inert material, MTA affects pulp cells in various ways. MTA appears to affect mineralization and induces slight inflammation and protective role against slight inflammation.
