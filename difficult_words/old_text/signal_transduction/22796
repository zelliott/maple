Inflammatory mediators released during acute and chronic diseases activate multiple intracellular signalling cascades including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, which plays a significant role in the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. Stimulation of leukocytes by pro-inflammatory cytokines is known to result in the activation of the MAPK isoform p38. However, the functional consequences of p38 MAPK activation during leukocyte recruitment, including adhesion, migration and effector functions such as oxidative burst and degranulation, are only just beginning to be elucidated. Specific p38 inhibitors aimed at reducing the production of inflammatory mediators are now being developed, and might in the future provide more effective treatment for inflammatory diseases.
