Swelling of C6 glioma cells in hypotonic medium (180 mOsm) results in two- to three-fold activation of K+ (86Rb+) influx suppressed by 10 microM bumetanide. Bumetanide-sensitive transport of 86Rb+ is dependent on extracellular K+, Na+ and Cl- both in iso-osmotic conditions and under hypo-osmotic shock, supporting the notion that it is mediated by Na+,K+,2Cl- cotransport. Inhibitors of protein kinase C (10 microM polymyxin B and l microM staurosporine) had no significant effect on basal cotransport but reduced its hypotonic stimulation by 70-80%. Similar results were obtained with calmodulin antagonist R24571 (10 microM), indicating Ca2+/calmodulin-dependence of the process. Influence of polymyxin B and R24571 was not additive. Swelling-activated Na+,K+,2Cl- cotransport was also suppressed by protein kinase C activator PMA (l microM). By contrast, preincubation of cells with inhibitors of protein phosphatases (100 microM vanadate, 5 mM fluoride and 0.5 microM okadaic acid) activated greatly the bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake in isotonic conditions, while a subsequent hypotonic swelling led to smaller or no increment. These results indicate the involvement of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent staurosporine/polymyxin B-sensitive protein kinase other than protein kinase C in swelling-induced activation of Na+,K+,2Cl- cotransport in glial cells.
