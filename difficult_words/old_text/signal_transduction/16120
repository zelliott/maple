A key characteristic of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is the ability to self-renew. Several genes and signaling pathways control the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation in HSC and potentially also in leukemic stem cells. Besides pathways such as Wnt signaling, Hedgehog signaling and Notch signaling, transcription factors (FoxOs) and cell fate determinants may also play a role in stem cells. While some of these pathways seem to be dispensable for maintenance of adult HSC, there may be a distinct requirement in leukemia stem cells for leukemic self-renewal. Here we will focus on self-renewal related signaling in myeloid leukemia stem cells and its therapeutic relevance.
