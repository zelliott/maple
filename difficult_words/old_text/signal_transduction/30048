We investigated the signal transduction pathway(s) of leukotriene D(4) (LTD(4)) in the human promonocytic U937 cells, a cell line known to constitutively express CysLT(1) receptors. Herein, we demonstrate that LTD(4) specifically acts on a CysLT(1) receptor to dose-dependently increase (three to five-fold over basal) RasGTP through a G(i/o) protein. In fact, while cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) increase was only partially sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTx), Ras activation was almost completely inhibited by the same toxin. Furthermore, the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 completely inhibited both [Ca(2+)](i) and RasGTP increase, suggesting that in these cells PLC is the point of convergence for both PTx insensitive and sensitive pathways leading to [Ca(2+)](i) release and Ras activation. Indeed, chelating intracellular Ca(2+) strongly (>70%) prevented LTD(4)-induced Ras activation, indicating that this ion plays an essential role for CysLT(1)-induced downstream signaling in differentiated U937 (dU937) cells. In addition, while Src did not appear to be substantially involved in CysLT(1)-induced signaling, genistein was able to partially inhibit LTD(4)-induced [Ca(2+)](i) transient ( approximately 34%) and almost completely prevented Ras activation (>90%), suggesting a potential role for other Ca(2+)-dependent tyrosine kinases in LTD(4)-induced signaling. Finally, agonist-induced CysLT(1) stimulation was followed by a specific extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation, an event with a pharmacological profile similar to that of Ras activation, partially ( approximately 40%) sensitive to Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin and totally blocked by PTx. In conclusion, LTD(4)-induced CysLT(1) receptor activation in dU937 cells leads to Ras activation and ERK phosphorylation mostly through a PTx-sensitive G(i/o) protein, PLC, and Ca(2+)-dependent tyrosine kinase(s).
