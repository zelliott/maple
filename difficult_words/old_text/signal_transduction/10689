Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the primary aetiological agent of at least three malignancies associated with HIV infection and immunosuppression: Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. KSHV encodes proteins that deregulate key checkpoints in the signalling pathways governing cell proliferation, which may ultimately contribute to the virus' oncogenic potential. To alter cellular signalling associated with proliferation, these viral proteins function like growth factor ligands/receptors, signal transduction proteins, transcription factors and cell cycle regulators. This review focuses on the mechanisms by which some KSHV-encoded proteins activate signalling pathways and cell proliferation and their role in the pathogenesis of KSHV-driven mechanisms.
