Leaf senescence is regulated through a complex regulatory network triggered by internal and external signals for the reprogramming of gene expression. In plants, the major developmental phase transitions and stress responses are under epigenetic control. In this review, the underlying molecular mechanisms are briefly discussed and evidence is shown that epigenetic processes are also involved in the regulation of leaf senescence. Changes in the chromatin structure during senescence, differential histone modifications determining active and inactive sites at senescence-associated genes and DNA methylation are addressed. In addition, the role of small RNAs in senescence regulation is discussed.
