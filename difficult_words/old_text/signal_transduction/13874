Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common solid cancer of the adult kidney and the majority of RCC cases are detected accidentally. This reality and the nonexistence of a standard screening test contribute to the fact that one third of patients are diagnosed with local invasive disease or metastatic disease. miRNAs are a family of small ncRNAs that regulate gene expression and have been identified as key regulators in many biological processes including cell development, differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation. The EGF receptor signaling pathway is usually deregulated in cancer and it is suggested to have an important role in RCC. Further studies are needed to characterize deregulation of this pathway during RCC development. In this review we highlight some potential miRNAs that could be involved in the modulation of the EGF receptor pathway and consequently in RCC development.
