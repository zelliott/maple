A growing number of chronic liver disease patients, especially those with metabolic syndrome-associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or hepatitis C virus-associated dysmetabolic syndrome, will take statins to prevent cardiovascular disease. As a result, clinicians will weigh complex issues raised by the interaction of statins with liver metabolism in these disorders. In this article, we critically review data concerning statins and liver pathophysiology with an emphasis on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatitis C virus, while also touching on other chronic liver diseases. Basic research interests include statins' mechanism of action and their effects on cholesterol-related cell signaling pathways and angiogenesis. From the clinical standpoint, many chronic liver diseases increase cardiovascular risk and would undeniably benefit from sustained statin use. The false alarms and security accompanying aminotransferase monitoring, however, are disturbing in light of the scarcity of data on statins' long-term effects on liver histology. Although some actions of statins might eventually prove to be particularly useful in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hepatitis C virus, or hepatocellular carcinoma, others may prove harmful. The lack of definitive data makes a fully informed decision impossible. Research using histological endpoints is urgently needed to determine the indications and contraindications of this extraordinary class of agents in patients with chronic liver disease.
