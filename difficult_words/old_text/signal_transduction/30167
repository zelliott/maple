Herpesvirus saimiri (Saimiriine herpesvirus-2) causes lethal T lymphoproliferative diseases in the susceptible species and transforms T lymphocytes to continuous growth in vitro. H. saimiri-induced transformation of T cells is becoming an important experimental tool of biomedical research. Two proteins of H. saimiri subgroup C, Tip and StpC, are essential for T cell transformation by this virus. It has been shown previously that StpC transforms fibroblasts, activates NF-kappaB, and binds to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, but the molecular mechanism of its action remains insufficiently understood. This study further characterized the effect of StpC on NF-kappaB. First, StpC activates NF-kappaB via the consensus pathway involving activation of I-kappaB kinase and subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of I-kappaB in both T lymphoid and epithelial cells. Second, triggering of this pathway by StpC in both T lymphoid and epithelial cells is dependent on the presence of functional NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK). Third, StpC physically interacts with TRAF in epithelial cells, and the effect of StpC on NF-kappaB activity in these cells requires the presence of functional TRAF. Finally the effect of StpC is completely independent of TNF-alpha, a well described stimulus of NF-kappaB activity. Moreover it appears that StpC uncouples stimulation of NF-kappaB activity from TNF-alpha stimulation. Overall these results argue that the effect of StpC on NF-kappaB is similar to the effects of other viral proteins, "usurping" the TRAF/NIK/I-kappaB kinase pathway, and reinforce the notion that the role of StpC in cell transformation by H. saimiri may be mediated by signaling that results in NF-kappaB activation.
