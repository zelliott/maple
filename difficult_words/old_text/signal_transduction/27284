Platelets play a key role in arterial thrombosis. Inhibition of platelet function forms an essential part of anti-thrombotic therapy. Although aspirin is a cost-effective drug which offers considerable scope in the prevention of arterial thrombosis, it only inhibits part of the platelet activation process. Much recent progress has concerned the inhibition of surface receptors of platelets. Ticlopidine and clopidogrel specifically interfere with the ADP-induced activation pathway. Inhibitors of GP IIb-IIIa complexes, including c7E3, block the final step of the platelet aggregation process as used by all physiologic agonists and are proving powerful therapeutic agents. This review looks at these and future advances in the construction of therapeutic strategies aimed at combatting arterial thrombosis.
