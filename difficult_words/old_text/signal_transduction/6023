In this review, we summarize recent results on the understanding of actin organization and cell polarization with an emphasis on the critical role of actin during this process. We first report on the advances made in understanding the function and mechanism of formin family proteins in the nucleation of actin filaments. We also discuss how formins and other regulators of actin dynamics are thought to be involved in the generation of cell polarity. In the second part we discuss new findings indicating that, rather than using a linear pathway from signal transduction to cytoskeleton re-organization, cell polarity is established through bidirectional interplay between these processes. We describe the various types of feedback loops identified and point out common schemes. Finally we briefly summarize the emerging role of actinlike proteins in the generation of polarity in prokaryotes that implies an early origin of actin's role in cell polarity.
