Nodal signaling controls germ layer formation, left-right asymmetry, and patterning of the brain in the vertebrate embryo. Cellular responses to Nodal signals are complex and include changes in gene expression, cell morphology, and migratory behavior. Only little is known about the genes regulated by Nodal signaling. We designed a subtractive screening strategy by using a constitutively active Nodal receptor to identify putative target genes of Nodal signals in the early gastrula of zebrafish embryos. By quantitative analysis of macro-array hybridizations, 132 genes corresponding to 1.4% of genes on the entire macro-array were identified, which were enriched in the Nodal-induced probe pool. These genes encode components of signal transduction pathways, transcription regulators, proteins involved in protein metabolism but also cytoskeletal components and metabolic enzymes, suggesting dramatic changes of cell physiology in gastrula cells in response to Nodal signals.
