Two T-cell receptor (TCR) populations are expressed on T cells; one is linked to the cytoskeleton via its zeta chain. These cytoskeleton-linked receptors (30-40% of the total number of TCRs) might be important in TCR-mediated signaling and/or concurrent events. Here, differences between the two populations are summarized, and new data are examined to speculate on the functional significance of cytoskeleton-linked TCRs.
