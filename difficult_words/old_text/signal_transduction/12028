This study investigated the possibility of the presence of specific receptor for relaxin-like factor (RLF)/insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) in boar testes. While RLF/INSL3 was produced by Leydig cells in the boar testis, its own receptor RXFP2 was expressed mainly in meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells, but not in Leydig cells, suggesting the existence of RLF/INSL3-RXFP2 signaling in germ cells of boars.
