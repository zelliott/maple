CYP7B1, a cytochrome P450 enzyme, metabolizes several steroids involved in hormonal signaling including 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol (3beta-Adiol), an estrogen receptor agonist, and dehydroepiandrosterone, a precursor for sex hormones. Previous studies have suggested that CYP7B1-dependent metabolism involving dehydroepiandrosterone or 3beta-Adiol may play an important role for estrogen receptor beta-mediated signaling. However, conflicting data are reported regarding the influence of different CYP7B1-related steroids on estrogen receptor beta activation. In the present study, we investigated CYP7B1-mediated conversions of dehydroepiandrosterone and 3beta-Adiol in porcine microsomes and human kidney cells. As part of these studies, we compared the effects of 3beta-Adiol (a CYP7B1 substrate) and 7alpha-hydroxy-dehydroepiandrosterone (a CYP7B1 product) on estrogen receptor beta activation. The data obtained indicated that 3beta-Adiol is a more efficient activator, thus lending support to the notion that CYP7B1 catalysis may decrease estrogen receptor beta activation. Our data on metabolism indicate that the efficiencies of CYP7B1-mediated hydroxylations of dehydroepiandrosterone and 3beta-Adiol are very similar. The enzyme catalyzed both reactions at a similar rate and the K(cat)/K(m) values were in the same order of magnitude. A high dehydroepiandrosterone/3beta-Adiol ratio in the incubation mixtures, similar to the ratio of these steroids in many human tissues, strongly suppressed CYP7B1-mediated 3beta-Adiol metabolism. As the efficiencies of CYP7B1-mediated hydroxylation of dehydroepiandrosterone and 3beta-Adiol are similar, we propose that varying steroid concentrations may be the most important factor determining the rate of CYP7B1-mediated metabolism of dehydroepiandrosterone or 3beta-Adiol. Consequently, tissue-specific steroid concentrations may have a strong impact on CYP7B1-dependent catalysis and thus on the levels of different CYP7B1-related steroids that can influence estrogen receptor beta signaling.
