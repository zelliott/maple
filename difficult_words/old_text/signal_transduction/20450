The production of a plethora of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the cell and tissues as the result of endogenous or exogenous mechanisms and interaction of our cells with the environment define the so called 'oxidative load'. The final balance between the oxidatively-induced stress and the various cellular defense mechanisms draw the picture on the landscape of oxidative injury and biological consequences. In this Special Issue, I have compiled a synthesis of concise reviews by leading experts in their fields. The articles focus on the current status and advances in the various pathways leading to the production of high oxidative stress, DNA damage and its processing in human cells and tissues. Significant mechanistic insights are offered as well as connections with biological and clinical significance.
