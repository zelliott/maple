Cell proliferation and related cellular behavior in ocular neoplastic disease and in the healing process in ocular surgery or post-injury management, as well as new treatment strategy were investigated. The roles of growth factors and their signal transduction pathways were studied. Cell proliferation-related signals were found to be activated to a greater extent in malignant ocular tumors than in benign tumor cells regardless of the similarity of simple histological findings. Suppression of cell proliferation-related signals can be a new treatment for ocular neoplastic diseases. The causes of complications associated with tissue repair response include acceleration of cell proliferation and extracellular matrix expression and cellular phenotypic alteration, i. e., epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These cellular activities can be controlled by modulation of growth factor signaling by employing such strategy including gene introduction.
