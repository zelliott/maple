Airways function as an innate immune organ against airborne bacteria that are inhaled and deposited in airways. One of the mechanisms of host defense is to recruit neutrophils into airways to clear the invaders. Airway epithelial cells produce neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin (IL)-8 in response to invading bacteria. In this study we show a signaling pathway on the plasma surface of human airway epithelial NCI-H292 cells that regulate IL-8 production in response to a model inflammatory stimulus, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and a pathophysiological stimulus, gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide. First, we show that EGF receptor (EGFR) and MAP kinase ERK1/2 are involved in IL-8 expression by these stimuli. Second, we show that EGFR ligand transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha mediates IL-8 production. Third, we show that tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE) is required for IL-8 production by cleaving EGFR proligand proTGF-alpha into soluble TGF-alpha, activating EGFR. Last, we show that dual oxidase 1 (Duox1), a homolog of NADPH oxidase in airways, mediates TACE activation and IL-8 expression via generation of reactive oxygen species. In summary, we describe a signaling pathway, Duox1-TACE-TGF-alpha-EGFR, on the surface of airway epithelial (NCI-H292) cells that mediates airway epithelial defense against bacterial infection by producing IL-8. This pathway, which also regulates mucin production in human airways, provides mechanisms for killing foreign organisms and for their clearance.
