Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is capable of activating many downstream signaling molecules via its two receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2. TNF can stimulate the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) as well as the stress induced kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) through mechanisms that are not fully delineated. NF-kappaB becomes activated mainly through TNFR1 while JNK can be stimulated by either TNF receptor subtype. TNF can also induce apoptosis within cells due to its ability to recruit procaspase-8 to TNFR1, which in turn induces the caspase proteolytic cascade. We provide evidence here in human cells, that TNF-induced JNK activation is under the influence of caspases while NF-kappaB activity is not. By using pharmacological inhibitors of caspases, we have shown that JNK activity is reduced following caspase inhibition, especially when caspase-3 is targeted. NF-kappaB activity, as assessed by IkappaBalpha or IkappaBbeta degradation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and NF-kappaB gene reporter assays, is shown to be unaffected by caspase inhibition. Therefore, downstream TNF receptor signaling events are differentially influenced by caspases.
