Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) plays key roles in many aspects of mitosis. We have previously shown that induction of p21(Waf1) by p53 is responsible for protection of cells against adriamycin-induced polyploidy formation and mitotic catastrophe. Here we show that adriamycin treatment suppressed Plk1 expression in a p53- and p21(Waf1)-dependent manner. Ablation of p21(Waf1) inhibited the adriamycin-induced p53 activation, and this inhibition was alleviated by knockdown of Plk1, suggesting that p21(Waf1)-dependent suppression of Plk1 expression is responsible for maintaining p53 activation during stress response. Plk1 associated with p53 and disrupted its interaction with target gene promoters in cells treated with adriamycin. Overexpression of Plk1 inhibited the p53-mediated prevention of caspase-independent mitotic death, but not polyploidy formation, in adriamycin-treated cells. Together our results indicate that suppression of Plk1 by p21(Waf1) is responsible for p53-dependent protection against adriamycin-induced caspase-independent mitotic death.
