In the past three years, there has been considerable progress in delineating the mechanism of calcium-containing crystal-induced cell activation: (1) the identification of Ca2+ influx and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation as the signal transduction pathways; (2) induction of nuclear transcription factors of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein, activator protein-1, and nuclear factor kappaB; (3) the differential role of crystal endocytosis and dissolution in crystal-induced metalloproteinase synthesis and mitogenesis; (4) crystal upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases, including MMP-13 but downregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and -2, thus magnifying the degenerative effect of crystals. Phosphocitrate, a specific inhibitor of biologic effect of calcium crystals, reverses the degenerative effects of crystals.
