The basic-loop-helix transcription factors, MyoD and Myf-5, are essential regulators of skeletal muscle lineage determination in vertebrates. Investigations into the signaling and response systems regulating MyoD and Myf-5 gene expression in muscle progenitor cells have led to the identification of molecular signals and DNA regulatory regions that control expression of these muscle regulatory genes. Here we discuss recent advances in these areas, with emphasis on in vivo analyses of MyoD transcription.
