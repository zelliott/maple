Various studies, mostly in the past 5 years, have demonstrated that, in addition to their well-described function in regulating electrical excitability, voltage-dependent ion channels participate in intracellular signalling pathways. Channels can directly activate enzymes linked to cellular signalling pathways, serve as cell adhesion molecules or components of the cytoskeleton, and their activity can alter the expression of specific genes. Here, I review these findings and discuss the extent to which the molecular mechanisms of such signalling are understood.
