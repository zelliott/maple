We previously demonstrated that human C3d or pep16, a 16-amino acid synthetic peptide derived from human C3d, induced in vivo and in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of pp105, an intracellular component found only in human cells that express CR2 at their surface. To determine the contribution of CR2 molecules to this enzymatic regulation, we first analyzed whether activation of CR2 by other extracellular CR2 ligands could trigger such regulation in cell extracts. Subsequently, we used cell extracts of either CR2-positive cells depleted in CR2 molecules by absorption with anti-CR2 antibodies or CR2-negative cells transfected with CR2 cDNA. We demonstrate here that pp105 phosphorylation was induced when CR2 was activated by C3d and pep16 as well as by gp350, the Epstein-Barr virus capsid protein or OKB7, an anti-CR2 monoclonal antibody (mAb). HB5, another anti-CR2 mAb, which did not activate B lymphocytes through CR2, did not induce pp105 phosphorylation. Thus, C3d, pep16, gp350, and OKB7 presented similar properties in activating CR2 to trigger pp105 phosphorylation and in regulating B lymphocyte proliferation, while HB-5 had no effect on either assays. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the presence of CR2 activated by its extracellular ligands regulates pp105 phosphorylation through two distinct pathways: one which also requires the presence of non-activated CD19, and one which is independent of CD19. The involvement of CD19 in the first pathway was not due to the formation of putative CR2-CD19 complexes. Both pathways were TAPA-1 independent. This is the first demonstration that activated CR2 molecules can play a regulatory role in enzymatic function, such as phosphorylation, despite the absence of CD19 and TAPA-1.
