An overwhelming immune response, particularly from macrophages, with gram-negative bacteria-induced sepsis plays a critical role in survival of and organ damage in infected patients. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a major structure protein of caveolae, regulates many cellular functions. We examined the vital role of Cav-1 in the response of macrophages and mice to bacteria or LPS exposure. Deletion of Cav-1 decreased the expression of CD14 and CD36 during macrophage differentiation and suppressed their phagocytotic ability. As well, the ability to kill bacteria was inhibited in Cav-1 macrophages and mice peritoneal cavity, tissue, and plasma, which was partly attributed to hindered expression of iNOS induced by bacteria or LPS. Furthermore, deletion of Cav-1 attenuated the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 and myeloid differentiation factor 88 and the activation of nuclear factor ÎºB, all of which impeded the production of inflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial exposure in Cav-1 macrophages and mice. Thus, Cav-1 participates in the regulation of CD14, CD36, Toll-like receptor 4 and myeloid differentiation factor 88 protein expression and is crucial for the immune response of macrophages to bacterial infection. Cav-1 may be a therapeutic target in the treatment of sepsis.
