Resveratrol (RSVL), an edible polyphenolic stilbene, claims a myriad of cardiovascular benefits. However, the molecular underpinnings of such actions are poorly understood. Currently, in sheep coronary arteries (SCA), RSVL markedly (threefold) enhanced cGMP formation (t(1/2): 6.5 min; EC(50): 3 microM). This response was not abrogated by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor (IBMX, 0.5 mM), but was partly sensitive (20-30%) to either removal of the endothelium, treatment with the nitric oxide synthase-inhibitor (L-NMMA, 10 microM), or with the soluble GC (sGC)-inhibitor (ODQ, 10 microM). In membrane preparations from denuded SCA, either RSVL or the pGC agonist atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP, 0.1-1 microM) activated GC in the particulate, but not in the soluble, membrane fraction. By contrast, the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 1-10 microM), stimulated GC only in the soluble fraction. Further, pretreatment with RSVL partly desensitized the ANP response, but was additive to that of SNP. In arterial tension studies, RSVL relaxed PGF(2alpha)-precontracted denuded rings in a concentration-dependent manner, a response that was markedly enhanced (approximately 18 fold) in the presence of IBMX. Conversely, precontraction with phorbol ester, which also desensitizes pGC, blunted relaxations to RSVL but not to forskolin or SNP. These findings demonstrate that RSVL increases cGMP in coronary arteries, mostly by activation of pGC. This pathway triggers vasorelaxant responses that remain effective in endothelium-disrupted arteries.
