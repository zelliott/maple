Expansion of the polyglutamine repeat region of the androgen receptor (AR) results in Kennedy's disease, a neurological disorder typified by degeneration of motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord. As the AR has been shown to inhibit beta-catenin dependent (Wnt) signalling we asked if expansion of the polyglutamine repeats might affect this property of the protein. Using the TOPflash/FOPflash reporter assay we found that a pathogenic form of the AR containing 51 glutamine repeats showed a consistent, though minimal, reduction in its ability to inhibit beta-catenin-mediated transcription, in comparison to a non-pathogenic form with 20 repeats. A reduced ability to inhibit Wnt signalling may thus contribute in part to the underlying aetiology of Kennedy's disease.
