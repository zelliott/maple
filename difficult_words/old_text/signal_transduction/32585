The neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM plays an important role in axonal growth, learning, and memory. A signaling pathway has been elucidated in which clustering of the NCAM140 isoform in the neural plasma membrane stimulated the activating phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the transcription factor cyclic AMP response-element binding protein (CREB). NCAM clustering transiently induced dual phosphorylation (activation) of the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) by a pathway regulated by the focal adhesion kinase p125fak, p59fyn, Ras, and MAPK kinase. CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 induced by NCAM was dependent in part on an intact MAPK pathway. c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which is associated with apoptosis and cellular stress, was not activated by NCAM. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway in rat cerebellar neuron cultures selectively reduced NCAM-stimulated neurite outgrowth. These results define an NCAM signal transduction mechanism with the potential for modulating the expression of genes needed for axonal growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity.
