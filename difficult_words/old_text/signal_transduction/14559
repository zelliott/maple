Neural agrin is a heparan sulphate proteoglycan first defined by its ability to induce the clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on cultured muscle cells. Neural agrin activates the transmembrane Muscle Specific Kinase (MuSK) on the postsynaptic muscle cell to stabilise the developing neuromuscular synapse. Three biological mechanisms for agrin/MuSK signalling are briefly discussed: selective transcription of synaptic genes such as MuSK itself, to reinforce developing postsynaptic clusters of AChRs; initiation of second messenger signalling pathways that can induce the formation of AChR clusters and retrograde signalling downstream of agrin/MuSK that may transform the growth cone of the motor axon into a stable differentiated nerve terminal, specialised for regulated exocytosis of neurotransmitter. Here we briefly review some key mechanisms through which neural agrin acts to foster the formation of mature neuromuscular synapses.
