Bone marrow- (BM-) derived cells can differentiate into smooth muscle-like cells (SMLC), resulting in vascular pathogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism of the differentiation remains unknown. We have recently reported that Notch signaling promotes while a Notch target HERP1 inhibit the differentiation of mesenchymal cells to SMC. During the differentiation of BM-derived mononuclear cells into smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA)-positive cells, expression of Jagged1 and SMC-specific Notch3 was increased. Blocking Notch with gamma-secretase inhibitor prevented the induction of SMA. Wire-mediated vascular injury was produced in femoral arteries in mice transplanted with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells. Many double-positive cells for GFP/Jagged1 or GFP/Notch3 were detected in the thickened neointima. In contrast, only a few SMA-positive cells were positive for GFP in neointima where HERP1, a suppressor for Notch, were abundantly expressed. In conclusion, Notch-HERP1 pathway plays an important role in differentiation of BM-derived mononuclear cells into SMLC.
