We earlier showed that the increased expression of Gi proteins exhibited by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was attributed to the enhanced levels of endogenous endothelin. Since the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) are also enhanced in VSMC from SHR, the present study was undertaken to examine the role of enhanced levels of endogenous Ang II in the overexpression of Giα proteins in VSMC from SHR and to further explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increase. The enhanced expression of Giα-2 and Giα-3 proteins in VSMC from SHR compared to WKY was attenuated by the captopril, losartan and AG1478, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, AT(1) receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respectively as well as by the siRNAs of AT1, cSrc and EGFR. The enhanced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity by low concentrations of GTPγS (receptor-independent functions) and of inhibitory responses of hormones on adenylyl cyclase activity (receptor-dependent functions) in VSMC from SHR was also attenuated by losartan. Furthermore, the enhanced phosphorylation of EGFR in VSMC from SHR was also restored to control levels by captopril, losartan, PP2, a c-Src inhibitor and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) scavenger, whereas enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was attenuated by captopril and losartan. Furthermore, NAC also restored the enhanced phosphorylation of c-Src in SHR to control levels. These results suggest that the enhanced levels of endogenous Ang II in VSMC from SHR, transactivate EGFR, which through MAP kinase signaling, enhance the expression of Giα proteins and associated adenylyl cyclase signaling.
