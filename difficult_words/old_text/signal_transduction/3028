Merlin is a tumour suppressor involved in the development of a variety of tumours including mesotheliomas. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a dominantly inherited tumour disease, is also caused by loss of merlin. NF2 patients suffer from multiple genetically well-defined tumours, schwannomas are most frequent among those. Using our in vitro model for human schwannoma, we found that schwannoma cells display enhanced proliferation because of the overexpression/activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor and ErbB2/3, increased cell-matrix adhesion because of the overexpression of integrins, and decreased apoptosis. Mechanisms underlying schwannomas basal proliferation and cell-matrix adhesion are not understood. Here, we investigated insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), which is expressed and released from central nervous system tumours and strongly overexpressed in schwannoma at the mRNA level. IGFBP-1 acts via β1-integrin and focal-adhesion-kinase (FAK), which are strongly overexpressed and basally activated in schwannoma. Using short hairpin RNA knockdown, small inhibitors and recombinant IGFBP-1, we demonstrate that schwannoma cells, in contrast to Schwann cells, release IGFBP-1 that activates the Src/FAK pathway, via integrin β1, potentiating schwannoma's proliferation and cell-matrix adhesion. We show that FAK localizes to the nucleus and Src triggers IGFBP-1 production. Further, we observed downregulation of the tumour-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog in schwannoma cells leading to increased activity of anti-apoptotic AKT. Thus, IGFBP-1/integrin β1/Src/FAK pathway has a crucial role in merlin-related tumourigenesis and therefore represents an important therapeutic target in the treatment of merlin-deficient tumours.
