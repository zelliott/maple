Over the last decade, neuroprotective effects of erythropoietin (Epo) and its underlying mechanisms in terms of signal transduction pathways have been defined and there is a growing interest in the potential therapeutic use of Epo for neuroprotection. Several mechanisms by which Epo provides neuroprotection are recognized. In this review, we focused on the neuroprotective mechanisms of Epo and provide a short overview on both experimental and clinical studies, testing Epo as a neuroprotective agent in the neonatal brain injury, and the safety concerns with the clinical use of Epo treatment in neonates.
