Mutations in either the CDC36 or CDC39 gene cause yeast cells to arrest in G1 of the cell cycle at the same point as treatment with mating pheromone. We demonstrate here that strains harboring temperature-sensitive mutations in CDC36 or CDC39 activate expression of the pheromone-inducible gene FUS1 when shifted to nonpermissive temperature. We show further that cell-cycle arrest and induction of FUS1 are dependent on known components of the mating factor response pathway, the STE genes. Thus, the G1-arrest phenotype of cdc36 and cdc39 mutants results from activation of the mating factor response pathway. The CDC36 and CDC39 gene products behave formally as negative elements in the response pathway: they are required to block response in the absence of pheromone. Epistasis analysis of mutants defective in CDC36 or CDC39 and different STE genes demonstrates that activation requires the response pathway G protein and suggests that CDC36 and CDC39 products may control synthesis or function of the G alpha subunit.
