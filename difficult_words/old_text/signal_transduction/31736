Biglycan (BGN) has been reported to promote bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) stimulated osteoblastic differentiation. However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. The glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of BGN have a variety of biological functions. In the present study, we explored the potential role of the GAG chains of BGN in promoting BMP-4-induced osteoblast differentiation. BGN knockout (KO) murine calvarial cells were transfected with adenovirus overexpressing wild-type BGN (Adv-BGN), adenovirus expressing GAG-mutant BGN (Adv-BGNm) and adenovirus without BGN (Adv-Emp). Transfected cells were treated with or without BMP-4. Subsequently, BMP-4 signaling and function were assessed by evaluating the expression of the osteoblast differentiation-related proteins, Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Furthermore, the binding specificity of the transfected cells to BMP-4 was also investigated using immunofluorescence staining. Our study demonstrated that a mutant BGN lacking GAG chains decreased BGN-assisted BMP-4 signaling and osteoblast differentiation and that the expression of this mutant BGN in biglycan knockout (BGNâ€‘KO) calvarial osteoblasts could not rescue its differentiation deficiency as efficiently as wild-type (WT) BGN. These results strongly suggest that the GAG chains of BGN promote BGN-assisted BMP-4 function.
