Reversible translocation of signalling proteins to and from their sites of action has emerged as an important theme in signal transduction. The recent findings of the stimulus-induced translocation of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor to and from the postsynaptic region are model cases for understanding how the dynamic localization of signalling proteins is used to regulate signal transduction.
