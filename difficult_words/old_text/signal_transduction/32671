Progression of BY-2 tobacco cells through the cell cycle was followed after treatments with ultra violet (UV) and salicylic acid (SA) used as a potent inhibitor of the octadecanoid pathway which can mediate response to UV irradiation. Cells in S phase were more sensitive than G0/G1 or G2 cells to UV irradiation. Although SA efficiently blocked cells in G0/G1 or G2, it did not block S phase synchronized cells. UV and SA applied simultaneously to cells in G0/G1 delayed the cell cycle progression more than each one separately. Therefore UV irradiation and SA act as agonists to arrest BY-2 cells at cell cycle entry. To further investigate the signalling pathway mediating UV response, we complemented a UV-sensitive Escherichia coli strain with a Nicotiana xanthi cDNA expression library. A cDNA (arcA3) whose coding sequence is identical to the 2,4-D induced arcA cDNA cloned by Ishida et al. (1993) was isolated. We show that arcA3 transcription is induced at cell cycle entry but not directly by the 2,4-D treatment. Moreover, arcA3 transcription is induced prior to the restriction point as shown with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine. The arcA3 transcription level is increased by UV irradiation but prevented by SA. Indeed, addition of SA prior to UV irradiation blocks the induction of arcA3 transcription. This suggests that arcA3 gene is modulated in both UV and SA responses, the SA effect preceding the UV step. Since arcA3 is 67% similar to RACK1 (functional homology), a rat intracellular receptor for protein kinase C, and possesses identical PKC fixation motifs, it is hypothesised that the arcA3 gene is involved in UV and SA cell cycle arrest.
