An appropriate balance of extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation is required for normal morphogenesis and maintenance of tissue architecture. Extracellular matrix molecules and their receptors, as well as proteinases and their inhibitors, are all involved in matrix remodeling. In this report we show that signal transduction through extracellular matrix receptors regulates matrix remodeling.
