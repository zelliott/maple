G protein-coupled receptors represent the most diverse group of proteins involved in transmembrane signalling, that participate in the regulation of a wide range of physicochemical messengers through the interaction with heterotrimeric G proteins. In addition, GPCRs stimulation also triggers a negative feedback mechanism, known as desensitization that prevents the potentially harmful effects caused by persistent receptor stimulation. In this adaptative response, G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) play a key role and alterations in their function are related to diverse pathophysiological situations. Based on the scarce knowledge about the regulation of GRK2 by other kinases of the same family, the aim of the present work was to investigate the regulation of GRK2 levels in systems where other GRKs are diminished by antisense technique. Present findings show that in U937 cells GRK2 levels are regulated by GRK3 and not by GRK6 through a mechanism involving InsP upregulation. This work reports a novel GRK3-mediated GRK2 regulatory mechanism and further suggests that GRK2 may also act as a compensatory kinase tending to counterbalance the reduction in GRK3 levels. This study provides the first evidence for the existence of GRKs cross-regulation.
