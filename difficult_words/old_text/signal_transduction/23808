The importance of adrenergic pathways in cancer has long been suspected, but now there is mounting epidemiological, preclinical, and clinical evidence of its importance in gynecologic cancers. To date, most of these effects are mediated primarily through the beta 2 adrenergic receptor activation of the tumor cell cyclic AMP-protein kinase A signaling pathway. This review will discuss the current knowledge about the neuroendocrine stress response in gynecologic tumor biology.
