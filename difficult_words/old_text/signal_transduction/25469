Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to actively replicate in cells of the immune system, altering both their function and cytokine expression. Naked nucleocapsids have been reported in the serum of infected patients. We investigated interference of recombinant non-enveloped capsid-like particles with signaling pathways in T cells. HCV non-enveloped particles (HCVne) internalization was verified in Jurkat and Hut 78 T cells, as well as primary human peripheral blood and intrahepatic mononuclear cells. HCVne uptake leads to activation of the MAPKs-p38 signaling pathway. Using specific phosphoantibodies, signaling pathways inhibitors, and chemical agents, it was demonstrated that p38 activation in T cells correlated with IL-2 transcriptional activation and was accompanied by a parallel increase of IL-2 cytokine secretion. c-fos and egr-1, two transcription factors, essential for IL-2 promoter activity, were also found to be elevated. We propose that HCVne uptake by T lymphocytes results in increased MAPKs-p38 activity and IL-2 expression, thus altering the host immune response.
