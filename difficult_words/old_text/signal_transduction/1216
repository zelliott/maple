High mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1, formerly known as HMG-1), a highly conserved ubiquitous protein, has been for a long time described as a nuclear DNA-binding protein involved in nucleosome stabilization and gene transcription. Recent discoveries indicate that HMGB1 is released from activated innate immune cells or necrotic cells and functions as an important mediator of endotoxemia, sepsis, arthritis, and local inflammation. Therapeutic agents that inhibit HMGB1 release or action confer significant protection against endotoxemia, sepsis, and arthritis in animal models and thus hold potential for the clinical management of various inflammatory diseases.
