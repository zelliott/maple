Neuro2a cells endogenously express cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors. CB1 stimulation with HU210 activated ERK and induced the transcription factor Krox-24. A functional MEK-ERK pathway is an important requirement for CB1-mediated Krox-24 induction as blockade of MEK signaling by UO126 reduces both basal and CB1-mediated activation of Krox-24. CB1 receptor stimulation did not activate either JNK or p38 MAPK pathways or the pro-proliferation phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. However, serum removal or blockade of PI3K signaling by LY294002 transiently stimulated basal Krox-24 expression and increased CB1-mediated induction of Krox-24. This was consistent with a transient increase in pMEK, pERK, and pCREB levels following PI3K blockade. These data demonstrate that CB1-mediated activation of the Krox-24 transcription factor is negatively regulated through the PI3K-Akt pathway and reveals several points of signaling cross-talk between these two important kinase pathways.
