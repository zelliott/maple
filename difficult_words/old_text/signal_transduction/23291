JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays a critical role in different ontogenesis processes of higher eukaryotes. Fruit fly drosophila is a handy model system used to study this pathway since major components of the pathway are represented by unique factors. This article describes the usage of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells in studies of the pathway's target genes activation. We showed that S2 cells contain plenty of STAT protein which migrates into nucleus under cells treatment with pervanadate. Then we demonstrated that under pervanadate action STAT protein along with other transcription factors is recruited onto regulatory sequences of target genes and activates their transcription.
