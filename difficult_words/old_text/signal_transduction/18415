Inherited retinal degenerations such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) are characterized by progressive death of the photoreceptors due to apoptosis. To identify changes in gene expression associated with the degenerative state in RP retinas, expression profiling of apoptosis-related genes was performed using a gridded array technique.

Total RNAs from RP and control retinas were used to generate radiolabeled cDNA probes to screen gridded membrane arrays of 205 apoptosis-related genes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to generate probes corresponding to differentially expressed genes for Northern blot analysis and for mRNA in situ hybridization studies of retinal cryosections. Fluorescence immunocytochemistry was performed on retinal sections using available antibodies.

By expression profiling, we identified upregulated expression of the mRNA for secreted Frizzled-related protein-2 (SFRP2) in RP retina in comparison with control. By Northern blot analysis, SFRP2 mRNA levels were 2- to 20-fold higher in RP samples than in controls. The localization of SFRP2 mRNA by in situ hybridization varied according to the degree of degeneration, from stratified in relatively well-preserved retinas to diffuse in the highly degenerative state. By immunofluorescence, SFRP2 protein in RP retinas was found mainly to colocalize with the cell adhesion and signal transducing protein beta-catenin.

SFRPs can regulate apoptosis in vitro and appear to interact with the Wnt/Frizzled signaling pathway, which includes routes to apoptotic activation. Increased SFRP2 expression in RP retinas suggests that an altered pattern of Wnt signal transduction may be a step in the degenerative process linking causal mutations with eventual photoreceptor demise.
