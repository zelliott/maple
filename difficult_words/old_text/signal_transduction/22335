Central neurocytomas (CN) are rare tumors. Since their first description in 1982, the number of case reports and series has been rapidly increasing. Although they are considered low-grade neoplasms, they can be associated with an aggressive primary course or recurrence after resection. The cellular origin of central neurocytoma (CN) and the molecular events leading to tumorigenesis have been largely unknown. Here, we present a review of the scientific literature contributing to our knowledge of CN focusing on cellular origin and oncogenic alterations, and how these findings inform areas amenable to future research and therapeutic intervention. Our discussion is expanded to include important and related insights into the cellular origin and classification of central nervous system tumors.
