The stringent regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence versus cell cycle progression is essential for the preservation of a pool of long-term self-renewing cells and vital for sustaining an adequate supply of all blood lineages throughout life. Cell growth, the process that is mass increase, serves as a trigger for cell cycle progression and is regulated predominantly by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Emerging data from various mice models show deletion of several mTORC1 negative regulators, including PTEN, TSC1, PML and Fbxw7 result in similar HSC phenotypes characterized as HSC hyper-proliferation and subsequent exhaustion, and defective repopulating potential. Further pharmacological approaches show that PTEN, TSC1 and PML regulate HSC maintenance through mTORC1. mTORC1-mediated cell growth regulatory circuits thus play a critical role in the regulation of HSC quiescence.
