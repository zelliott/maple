Analysis of embryonic induction has pointed to the importance of the antagonistic roles played by secreted inducing factors and their soluble inhibitory binding proteins. These interactions have been particularly well characterized in patterning the primary axes of insects and vertebrates. New results implicate similar antagonistic relationships in numerous later events of embryogenesis.
