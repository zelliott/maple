An important recent advance in the understanding of vertebrate photoreceptor light adaptation has come from the discovery that as many as eight distinct molecular mechanisms may be involved, and the realization that one of the principal mechanisms is not dependent on calcium. Quantitative analysis of these mechanisms is providing new insights into the nature of rod photoreceptor light adaptation.
