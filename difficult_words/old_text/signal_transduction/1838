FcR nonbinding anti-CD3 epsilon mAbs elicit partial TCR signaling that leads to T cell unresponsiveness and tolerance in vivo. In this study, the membrane-proximal events that promote T cell inactivation by FcR nonbinding anti-CD3 mAbs were examined. In the context of FcR nonbinding anti-CD3, TCR complexes did not aggregate and failed to translocate into glycolipid-enriched membrane microdomains. Furthermore, FcR nonbinding anti-CD3 mAbs induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the Fyn substrate Cbl, but not the ZAP-70 substrate linker for activation of T cells. Overexpression of Fyn, but not Lck, restored the mitogenicity of FcR nonbinding anti-CD3 in primary T cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Fyn mediates the partial signaling induced by TCR antagonists.
