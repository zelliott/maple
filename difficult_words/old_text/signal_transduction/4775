G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of remarkably versatile membrane proteins that are attractive therapeutic targets because of their involvement in a vast range of normal physiological processes and pathological diseases. Upon activation, intracellular domains of GPCRs mediate signaling to G-proteins, but these domains have yet to be effectively exploited as drug targets. Cell-penetrating lipidated peptides called pepducins target specific intracellular loops of GPCRs and have recently emerged as effective allosteric modulators of GPCR activity. The lipid moiety facilitates translocation across the plasma membrane, where pepducins then specifically modulate signaling of their cognate receptor. To date, pepducins and related lipopeptides have been shown to specifically modulate the activity of diverse GPCRs and other membrane proteins, including protease-activated receptors (PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4), chemokine receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4), sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-3 (S1P3), the melanocortin-4 receptor, the Smoothened receptor, formyl peptide receptor-2 (FPR2), the relaxin receptor (LGR7), G-proteins (GÎ±(q/11/o/13)), muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and vanilloid (TRPV1) channels, and the GPIIb integrin. This minireview describes recent advances made using pepducin technology in targeting diverse GPCRs and the use of pepducins in identifying potential novel drug targets.
