The HUPO Brain Proteome Project is an initiative coordinating proteomics studies to characterise human and mouse brain proteomes. Proteins identified in human brain samples during the project's pilot phase were put into biological context through integration with various annotation sources followed by a bioinformatics analysis. The data set was related to the genome sequence via the genes encoding identified proteins including an assessment of splice variant identification as well as an analysis of tissue specificity of the respective transcripts. Proteins were furthermore categorised according to subcellular localisation, molecular function and biological process, grouped into protein families and mapped to biological pathways they are known to act in. Involvement in pathological conditions was examined based on association with entries in the online version of Mendelian Inheritance in Man and an interaction network was derived from curated protein-proteininteraction data. Overall a non-redundant set of 1804 proteins was identified in human brain samples. In the majority of cases splice variants could be unambiguously identified by unique peptides, including matches to several hypothetical transcripts of known as well as predicted genes.
