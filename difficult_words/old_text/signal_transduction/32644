In search for effectors of the Ras-related GTPase Rap2, we used the yeast two-hybrid method and identified the C-terminal Ras/Rap interaction domain of the Ral exchange factors (RalGEFs) Ral GDP dissociation stimulator (RalGDS), RalGDS-like (RGL), and RalGDS-like factor (Rlf). These proteins, which also interact with activated Ras and Rap1, are effectors of Ras and mediate the activation of Ral in response to the activation of Ras. Here we show that the full-length RalGEFs interact with the GTP-bound form of Rap2 in the two-hybrid system as well as in vitro. When co-transfected in HeLa cells, an activated Rap2 mutant (Rap2Val-12) but not an inactive protein (Rap2Ala-35) co-immunoprecipitates with RalGDS and Rlf; moreover, Rap2-RalGEF complexes can be isolated from the particulate fraction of transfected cells and were localized by confocal microscopy to the resident compartment of Rap2, i.e. the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the overexpression of activated Rap2 neither leads to the activation of the Ral GTPase via RalGEFs nor inhibits Ras-dependent Ral activation in vivo. Several hypotheses that could explain these results, including compartmentalization of proteins involved in signal transduction, are discussed. Our results suggest that in cells, the interaction of Rap2 with RalGEFs might trigger other cellular responses than activation of the Ral GTPase.
