We have examined the signal transduction pathways of a number of cytokines that interact with receptors that are members of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily. A 97-kDa protein was phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to stimulation of appropriate target cells with interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-CSF, or erythropoietin. These data suggest that a 97-kDa phosphotyrosylprotein represents a point of convergence for signal transduction by a number of growth factor receptors that do not have homology with any known protein tyrosine kinase. To address the possibility that p97 may represent a tyrosine kinase involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, we tested the capacity of this protein to bind a tyrosine kinase substrate or ATP. Indeed, a 97-kDa phosphotyrosylprotein purified from IL-2-stimulated lymphoid cells as well as granulocyte-macrophage-CSF-stimulated myeloid cells bound to a polymer of glutamic acid and tyrosine which is a tyrosine kinase substrate. Further, a 97-kDa phosphotyrosylprotein present in both lineages also bound 8-azido-ATP. These data indicate that a 97-kDa phosphotyrosylprotein with properties consistent with those of a protein tyrosine kinase is involved in the signal transduction pathways of certain members of the newly identified hematopoietin receptor superfamily and may represent an early point of convergence in the stimulus-response coupling of multiple cytokine receptors.
