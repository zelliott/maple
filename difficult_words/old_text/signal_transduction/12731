The CD300 glycoproteins are a family of related leucocyte surface molecules that modulate a diverse array of cell processes via their paired triggering and inhibitory receptor functions. All family members have a single Ig-V like domain and they share a common evolutionary pathway. At least one member of the family has undergone significant positive selection (ranked second in the top 50) indicating a need to maintain some crucial function. Here we have reviewed the CD300 family members, and their expression on cells of the monocyte and dendritic cell lineages. The consequences of CD300 molecule expression by these leucocyte lineages are only now beginning to be understood. The ability to fine tune monocyte and dendritic cell function and immune responses highlights several potential options to exploit these molecules as therapeutic targets in chronic inflammatory diseases, allergy and other disease states.
