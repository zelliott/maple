The relation between elevation of cytosolic free calcium and activation of membrane conductance has been studied in single acinar cells of the rat parotid. Outward and inward currents are activated by calcium elevation and oscillate in phase with oscillations of cytosolic calcium. The outward current results from activation of a large unit-conductance Ca2+ and voltage-dependent K+ channel, whereas the inward current is most likely carried predominantly by Cl-. Both these conductances have been previously described in exocrine cells. Buffering calcium at resting levels eliminated current responses to muscarinic agonists, suggesting that calcium is the only significant second messenger involved in the short-term control of this conductance by acetylcholine.
