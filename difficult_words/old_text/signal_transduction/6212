PS-341, also known as Velcade or Bortezomib, represents a new class of anticancer drugs which has been shown to potently inhibit the growth and/or progression of human cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Although it has been logically hypothesized that NF-kappaB is a major target of PS-341, the underlying mechanism by which PS-341 inhibits tumor cell growth is unclear. Here we found that PS-341 potently activated the caspase cascade and induced apoptosis in human HNSCC cell lines. Although PS-341 could inhibit NF-kappaB activation, the inhibition of NF-kappaB was not sufficient to initiate apoptosis in HNSCC cells. Using biochemical and microarray approaches, we found that proteasome inhibition by PS-341 induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HNSCC cells. The inhibition of ROS significantly suppressed caspase activation and apoptosis induced by PS-341. Consistently, PS-341 could not induce the ER stress-ROS in PS-341-resistant HNSCC cells. Taken together, our results suggest that in addition to the abolishment of the prosurvival NF-kappaB, PS-341 might directly induce apoptosis by activating proapoptotic ER stress-ROS signaling cascades in HNSCC cells, providing novel insights into the PS-341-mediated antitumor activity.
