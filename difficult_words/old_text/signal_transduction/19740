Calcium is an essential second messenger that mediates plant responses to developmental and environmental clues. Specific calcium signatures are sensed and decoded by diverse Ca(2+) sensors to induce appropriate downstream responses. Calmodulin is the most important and conserved Ca(2+) transducer in all eukaryotes. Additional plant-specific sensors are encoded by multigene families, i.e. calcineurin B-like and Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinases. Calcium binding induces structural conformational changes in Ca(2+) sensors, resulting in the modification of protein interaction or enzymatic activity. Activated Ca(2+) sensors subsequently regulate downstream targets which can be involved in signal transduction, like protein kinases and transcription factors, or in direct cell protection from stress damages, like ion transporters or detoxification enzymes. Ca(2+) plays an important role in osmotic signaling triggered by cold, drought and salinity. The multiplicity of plant calcium sensors associated with diverse cellular targets constitute a tightly regulated signaling network that induces specific stress responses to improve plant survival under unfavourable conditions.
