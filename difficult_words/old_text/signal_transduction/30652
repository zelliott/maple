Development of a complex process network by maturing oligodendrocytes is a critical but currently poorly characterized step toward myelination. Here, we demonstrate that the matricellular oligodendrocyte-derived protein phosphodiesterase-Ialpha/autotaxin (PD-Ialpha/ATX) and especially its MORFO domain are able to promote this developmental step. In particular, the single EF hand-like motif located within PD-Ialpha/ATX's MORFO domain was found to stimulate the outgrowth of higher order branches but not process elongation. This motif was also observed to be critical for the stimulatory effect of PD-Ialpha/ATX's MORFO domain on the reorganization of focal adhesions located at the leading edge of oligodendroglial protrusions. Collectively, our data suggest that PD-Ialpha/ATX promotes oligodendroglial process network formation and expansion via the cooperative action of multiple functional sites located within the MORFO domain and more specifically, a novel signaling pathway mediated by the single EF hand-like motif and regulating the correlated events of process outgrowth and focal adhesion organization.
