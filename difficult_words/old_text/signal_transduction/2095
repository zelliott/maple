Subpopulations of olfactory receptor neurons, which are dispersed throughout the olfactory neuroepithelium, express specific cell surface carbohydrates and project to discrete regions of the olfactory bulb. Cell surface carbohydrates such as N-acetyl-lactosamine have been postulated to mediate sorting and selective fasciculation of discrete axon subpopulations during development of the olfactory pathway. Substrate-bound N-acetyl-lactosamine promotes neurite outgrowth by both clonal olfactory receptor neuron cell lines and olfactory receptor neurons in vitro, indicating that cell surface carbohydrates may be ligands for receptor-mediated stimulation of axon growth in vivo. In the present study, the role of transmembrane signaling in N-acetyl-lactosamine-stimulated neurite outgrowth was examined in the clonal olfactory neuron cell line 4.4.2. Substrate-bound N-acetyl-lactosamine stimulated neurite outgrowth which was specifically inhibited by antagonists to N- and L-type calcium channels and to tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. These results indicate that N-acetyl-lactosamine can evoke transmembrane receptor-mediated responses capable of influencing neurite outgrowth.
