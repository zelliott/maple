The Notch family of evolutionarily conserved proteins regulates a broad spectrum of cell-fate decisions and differentiation processes during fetal and post-natal development. The best characterized role of Notch signaling during mammalian hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis is the essential function of the Notch1 receptor in T-cell lineage commitment. More recent studies have addressed the roles of other Notch receptors and ligands, as well as their downstream targets, revealing additional novel functions of Notch signaling in intra-thymic T-cell development, B-cell development and peripheral T-cell function.
