DIXDC1 is the human homolog of Ccd1, a recently identified DIX domain containing protein in zebrafish. It is a positive regulator in the Wnt signaling pathway functioning downstream of Wnt and upstream of Axin. Since Wnt pathway activation is correlated with human colon cancer formation and progression, the biological role of DIXDC1 in human colon cancer was examined. In the current study, up-regulation of DIXDC1 protein was detected in human colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues and was found to be correlated well with high cell proliferation index. Ectopic over-expression of DIXDC1 resulted in increased cell proliferation in vitro and accelerated tumorigenesis on nude mice in vivo. We also showed that DIXDC1 promoted G0/G1 to S phase transition concomitantly with up-regulation of cyclin D1 and down-regulation of p21 protein. DIXDC1 over-expression cells showed activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Both siRNA knockdown of DIXDC1 and blocking the PI3K pathway using a specific inhibitor caused G1/S phase arrest, as well as down-regulation of cyclin D1 and up-regulation of p21 in DIXDC1 over-expression colon cancer cells. Collectively, this study demonstrates that over-expression of DIXDC1 might target p21 and cyclin D1 to promote colon cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis at least partially through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.
