Injury to mature neurites triggers a series of events that have both growth promoting and inhibitory roles. Recent evidence from a variety of experimental models has revealed new neuronal re-growth modulators. The action of these modulators must be precisely regulated both in time and space, and involves multiple cellular processes including retrograde signaling and local translation in the injured neurite. New genetic techniques, in combination with pharmacological approaches, have served to advance mechanistic dissection of neuronal response to injury. Better understanding of the spatio-temporal cues would greatly aid in the development of effective regenerative therapies.
