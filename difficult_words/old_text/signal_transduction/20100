The ubiquitin E3 ligase SIAH2 is an important regulator of the hypoxic response as it leads to the ubiquitin/proteasomal degradation of prolyl hydroxylases such as PHD3, which in turn increases the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α. In the present study, we identify the serine/threonine kinase DYRK2 as SIAH2 interaction partner that phosphorylates SIAH2 at five residues (Ser16, Thr26, Ser28, Ser68, and Thr119). Phosphomimetic and phospho-mutant forms of SIAH2 exhibit different subcellular localizations and consequently change in PHD3 degrading activity. Accordingly, phosphorylated SIAH2 is more active than the wild-type E3 ligase and shows an increased ability to trigger the HIF-1α-mediated transcriptional response and angiogenesis. We also found that SIAH2 knockdown increases DYRK2 stability, whereas SIAH2 expression facilitates DYRK2 polyubiquitination and degradation. Hypoxic conditions cause a SIAH2-dependent DYRK2 polyubiquitination and degradation which ultimately also results in an impaired SIAH2 phosphorylation. Similarly, DYRK2-mediated phosphorylation of p53 at Ser46 is impaired under hypoxic conditions, suggesting a molecular mechanism underlying chemotherapy resistance in solid tumors.
