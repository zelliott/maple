To review the biology of the EGFR, its structure, and the associated signal transduction pathways. To provide an overview of the role of EGFR in normal physiology and the pathophysiology of malignancy. Current anti-EGFR treatments are also discussed.

Research articles.

EGFR is a valid target in the treatment of solid tumors. EGFR abnormalities and dysfunction are involved in various aspects of carcinogenesis and tumor progression, and EGFR is overexpressed in several tumor types. The development of anti-EGFR therapies represents an important advance in cancer therapy.

Anti-EGFR therapy is currently available in the clinical setting. Nurses involved in the care of patients with cancer can benefit from an increased understanding of the normal and abnormal function of EGFR in the body and the mechanisms by which anti-EGFR therapies act.
