Teleocidin, a phorbol ester-type tumor promoter, enhanced actin redistribution, vacuole formation and c-fos expression of PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells. This tumor promoter also inhibited calcium mobilization induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF). Thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, elevated cytosolic calcium, enhanced c-fos expression and antagonized the vacuole formation induced by teleocidin without interfering with actin redistribution and Lucifer yellow uptake. On the other hand, a calcium ionophore ionomycin elevated both cytosolic Ca2+ and c-fos mRNA but could not antagonize the vacuole formation induced by teleocidin. From these results it was speculated that the Ca2+ leak from the endoplasmic reticulum rather than the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ appeared to be responsible for the specific inhibition of vacuole formation by thapsigargin.
