The STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) are latent cytoplasmic proteins that, upon activation by cell surface bound polypeptide ligands, move to the nucleus to direct transcription. A variety of protein-protein interactions that affect the function of STATs has been recently recognized. It has become clear that the STATs are functional mosaics, or mixtures of signal transduction and transcription modules.
