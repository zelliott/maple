The regulator of G‑protein signaling 2 (RGS2) has been shown to be crucial in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. The vascular activities of adrenomedullin (ADM) and adrenotension (ADT), two natural peptides, are dependent upon the modulation of RGS2 expression. However, the effects and pathways involved in their modulation remain unknown. This study aimed to observe the changes of RGS2 expression in response to ADM and ADT in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and to clarify the potential signaling pathways in vitro. In the present study, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were cultured with ADM and ADT of various concentrations for different time periods, and the gene expression of RGS2 was analyzed by PCR. ADM significantly increased the gene expression at 0.5 h to ~35‑fold of that at baseline, whereas ADT marginally increased the expression after 1‑2 h. SQ22,536 and chelerythrine were used to block the protein kinase A (PKA) and PKC pathways activated by incubation with ADM. The gene expression of RGS2 was reduced by SQ22,536 only. Furthermore, when SQ22,536 and chelerythrine were added to the cells incubated with ADT, the gene expression was markedly reduced by both SQ22,536 and chelerythrine. In conclusion, ADM immediately showed a marked increase in the gene expression of RGS2 in cultured VSMCs via a cAMP‑dependent pathway and ADT gradually showed a marginal increase in the gene expression via a cAMP‑dependent pathway and a PKC pathway.
