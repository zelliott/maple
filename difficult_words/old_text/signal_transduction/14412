To investigate the effects of panax notoginosides (PNS) on the proliferation of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and to explore the signaling pathway of the nuclear transcription factor of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR-NTF) initiated by PNS related with the proliferation.

The human CD34+ cells and bone marrow nuclear cells were exposed to PNS at a concentration of 0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/L, respectively, in semi-solid culture system to observe colony forming unite of all lineages, granulocyte, erythrocyte, and megakaryocyte (CFUGEMM, CFU-GM, CFU-E, and CFU-MK). Three lineages of human hematopoietic cell lines, including granulocytic HL-60, erythrocytic K562, megakaryocytic CHRF- 288, and Meg-01 cells were incubated with PNS at 20 mg/L for 14 d. Meanwhile, dexamethasone (Dex) was used as a positive control. The nuclear protein of the cells was analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies against the amino or carboxyl terminus of GR-NTF. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay performed by using the 32P-radiolabeled GR-NTF consensus oligonucleotide.

PNS promoted the proliferation of CD34+ cells and significantly raised the colony numbers of CFU-GEMM by 34.7%+/-16.0% over the non-PNS control (P<0.01). PNS also enhanced the proliferation of CFU-GM, CFU-E, and CFU-MK by 39.3%+/- 5.7%, 33.3%+/-7.3%, and 26.2%+/-3.2%, respectively. GR-NTF protein levels of either the amino or carboxyl terminus in K562, CHRF-288, and Meg-01 treated by PNS increased by 2.4-2.8 fold and 1.3- 3.9 fold over the untreated cells. GR-NTF binding activity, initiated by either PNS or Dex, was apparently elevated to form the complex of GR-NTF with DNA as higher density bands in K562 and CHRF-288 cells, and some activity appeared as a band in HL-60 cells induced by PNS.

PNS displayed the action of hematopoietic growth factor-like or synergistic efficacy to promote proliferation of human progenitor cells, may play a role in the upregulation of gene expression related to proliferation of hematopoietic cells through increasing the GR-NTF synthesis and its DNA binding activity.
