We investigated the molecular mechanism of the glucose effect on the regulation of chondrogenesis. Exposure of chick wing bud mesenchymal cells to high concentrations of glucose stimulated chondrogenesis 2-fold to 2.5-fold without affecting cell proliferation. Glucose increased protein levels and the membrane translocation of protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha), leading to a reduction of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of p38 was also increased in a PKC-independent manner by glucose treatment. Glucose also increased cell adhesion molecules such as fibronectin, integrin beta1, and N-cadherin at early stages and then decreased these adhesion molecules at later stages of chondrogenesis. These alterations in protein level of adhesion molecules and in the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by glucose were blocked by inhibition of PKC or p38 but were synergistically increased by the inhibition of ERK. Therefore, high doses of glucose induce the down-regulation of ERK activity via PKCalpha and the up-regulation of p38 and result in the stimulation of chondrogenesis of chick mesenchymal cells through modulating the expression of adhesion molecules.
