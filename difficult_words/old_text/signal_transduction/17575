This paper compares information/signal processing in synthetic and biological molecules. The role of conformation-based (shape-based) mechanisms and electrostatic interactions in molecular recognition is discussed. In biological electron transfer, the 'electron shuttle'-mediated mechanism is contrasted with the mechanism based on pre-formed 'electron wires'. While biological information processing is thought to be more distributed (less discrete), an example of molecular switch is presented: visual transduction. We further speculate that visual transduction may be implemented in the form of a switch based on electrostatic interactions. The concept of intelligent materials is discussed with the well-known Bohr effect of hemoglobin oxygenation. Based on these examples, we argue that there are no fundamental differences between synthetic and biological molecules in their mode of information processing. In the pursuit of novel paradigms of molecular information processing, we also perceive no conflicts in developing molecular devices that emulate the switching function of conventional microelectronic devices.
