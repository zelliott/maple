Ovarian carcinoma can be subdivided into two categories termed type I and type II. Type I tumours, usually having an indolent clinical behaviour, are often detected in early stage, and rarely harbour p53 gene mutations. Each histological type has a distinct molecular profile with mutations of genes involved in different signalling transduction pathways, such as KRAS, BRAF, CTNNB1, PTEN, PIK3CA and ARID1A. Type II tumours, accounting for 75% of the cases, have a very aggressive biological behaviour, are usually in advanced stage at presentation, harbour p53 gene mutations in 80% of the cases, and sometimes have alterations of homologous recombination (HR). Both type I and type II tumours arise from extra-ovarian precursors. Serous carcinomas derive from tubal epithelium, endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas from endometrial tissue, and mucinous and Brenner tumours from transitional epithelial cells located near the tubo-peritoneal junction. These new concepts on the pathogenesis of ovarian carcinoma could deeply modify both the preventive approach in women with germ-line BRCA₁ or BRCA₂ mutations and the treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent disease. For instance, BRAF inhibitors could be used in low-grade serous carcinomas, PIK3CA inhibitors could be employed in clear cell carcinoma, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors could be used not only in hereditary ovarian carcinoma but also in non-hereditary, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma which sometimes shows defective HR.
