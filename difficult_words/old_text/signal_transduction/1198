Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) phosphorylate diacylglycerol to form phosphatidic acid. In most cases, members of this large family of enzymes appear to bind and regulate proteins activated by either diacylglycerol or phosphatidic acid. Proteins that appear to be regulated, in part, by DGKs include protein kinase Cs, RasGRPs, and phosphatidylinositol kinases. By modulating the activity of these proteins, DGKs potentially affect a number of biological events including-but likely not limited to-cell growth, neuronal transmission, and cytoskeleton remodeling.
