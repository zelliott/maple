A novel isomer of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidyl-scyllo-inositol, was characterized in the aleurone cells of barley seeds. In this investigation, the subcellular localization of scyllo-PI and the relative rates of biosynthesis and accumulation of [32P]phosphoric acid ([32Pi])-labeled scyllo- and myo-phosphoinositides in the plasma membrane and intracellular membrane pools were investigated. About 25% of the [32Pi]-labeled phospholipids were present in plasma membrane and 75% in intracellular membranes. Incorporation of [32Pi] into scyllo-PI was greater than into myo-PI in both the plasma membranes and intracellular membranes at all time points investigated, thus suggesting a higher rate of biosynthesis; however, the data do not preclude reduced breakdown of labeled scyllo-PI as a contributing factor. In vitro studies were conducted to investigate the presence of cytidinediphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DG):scyllo-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase (scyllo-PI synthase) and to optimize enzymatic activity. The inclusion of nonionic detergents (Brij 58 and Triton X-100) effected significant enhancement in the biosynthesis of scyllo-PI, whereas anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic detergents had little or no effect. This is the first evidence for CDP-DG:scyllo-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase activity.
