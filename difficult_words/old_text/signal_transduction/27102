Hormones influence the skin and play a role in normal biologic processes. Keratinocytes can convert and synthesize endocrine hormones. Endocrine dysregulation of the skin and abnormalities of endocrine functions of keratinocytes may produce abnormal changes in the skin. Knowledge of the cutaneous metabolism of thyroid hormones, steroids, peptide hormones, and vitamin A derivatives is being rapidly updated. Skin manifestations of endocrine disorders result from imbalance in feedback loops maintaining endocrine homeostasis. Define molecular mechanisms of hormonal action on target cells underlie functional agonism and antagonism of hormonal signals aimed at governing epidermal turnover. The molecular synergism between vitamin A and other hormones may explain the therapeutic efficiency of combining retinoids with other therapies.
