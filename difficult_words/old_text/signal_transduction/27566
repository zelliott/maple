In the ventral mesencephalon, two neurotrophic factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, have been shown previously to have similar effects on the survival of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we compared the signaling mechanisms for brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, focusing on the mitogen-associated protein kinase and the transcription factor cyclic-AMP responsive element-binding protein. Double-staining experiments indicated that many neurons co-expressed the receptors for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, c-RET and TrkB, suggesting that they are responsive to both brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Although both brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor induced a rapid phosphorylation of mitogen-associated protein kinase and cyclic-AMP, responsive element-binding protein, there were significant differences in the kinetics and pharmacology of the phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of mitogen-associated protein kinase by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor was transient; within 2 h, the level of mitogen-associated protein kinase phosphorylation returned to baseline. In contrast, the effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor was long lasting; the mitogen-associated protein kinase remained phosphorylated for up to 4 h after brain-derived neurotrophic factor treatment. PD098059, a specific inhibitor for mitogen-associated protein kinase kinase, completely blocked the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor signaling through mitogen-associated protein kinase, but had no effect on brain-derived neurotrophic factor-induced mitogen-associated protein kinase phosphorylation. Both brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor induced the phosphorylation of cyclic-AMP responsive element-binding protein in the nuclei of ventral mesencephalon neurons. However, PD098059 blocked the cyclic-AMP responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation induced by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, but not that by brain-derived neurotrophic factor. These results indicate that, although both brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor act on ventral mesencephalon neurons, the two factors have different signaling mechanisms, which may mediate their distinctive biological functions.
