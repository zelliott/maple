Reversible protein phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of many different processes, such as cell growth, differentiation, migration, metabolism, and apoptosis. Identification of differentially phosphorylated proteins by means of phospho-proteomic analysis provides insight into signal transduction pathways that are activated in response to, for example, growth factor stimulation or toxicant-induced apoptosis. This review summarizes recent advances made in the field of phospho-proteomics and provides examples of how phospho-proteomic techniques can be combined to quantitatively investigate the dynamic changes in protein phosphorylation in time. By linking experimental data to clinical data (e.g., disease progression or response to therapy) new disease markers could be identified, which could then be validated for applications in disease diagnosis and progression or prediction of a response to drugs.
