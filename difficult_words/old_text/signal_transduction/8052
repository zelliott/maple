Though phagocytosis of microbes by professional phagocytes such as neutrophils is crucial for the survival of the host, it is still unclear how the apparent 'stretching' of the plasma membrane is achieved. Microscopically, pseudopod extension, particulate engulfment and phagosome closure all require seemingly large expansions of the cell surface area. Although actual membrane stretching can be ruled out on the basis of physical properties of lipid bilayers, the addition of new membrane from within the cell, either by exocytosis or phagosomal fusion with endoplasmic reticulum membrane, might provide an explanation. However, these events do not seem to have major roles during phagocytosis by neutrophils. Instead, neutrophils might use a more primitive mechanism, that is, the unfolding of surface membrane wrinkles, to provide the additional membrane for phagocytosis. Here, we briefly discuss why membrane unwrinkling provides a feasible hypothesis for membrane expansion during neutrophil phagocytosis, and suggest a potential molecular mechanism for neutrophil control over membrane surface wrinkles, and the potential signalling route.
