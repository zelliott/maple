The following is a summary of physiological and pharmacological studies of the regulation of dynein-driven microtubule sliding in Chlamydomonas flagella. The experimental basis for the study is described, and data indicating that an axonemal cAMP-dependent protein kinase can regulate inner arm dynein activity are reviewed. In addition, preliminary data are summarized indicating that an axonemal type 1 phosphatase can also regulate dynein-drive microtubule sliding velocity. It is predicted that the protein kinase, phosphatase, and an inner dynein arm component form a regulatory complex in the axoneme.
