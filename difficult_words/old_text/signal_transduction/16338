The RGS1 gene is associated with celiac disease, multiple sclerosis, and type I diabetes, which are all T cell-mediated pathologies, yet there is no reported analysis of regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)1 biology in human T cells. This study shows that RGS1 expression is substantially higher in T cells from human gut versus peripheral blood and that this can be exaggerated in intestinal inflammation. Elevated RGS1 levels profoundly reduce T cell migration to lymphoid-homing chemokines, whereas RGS1 depletion selectively enhances such chemotaxis in gut T cells and impairs their colitogenic potential. These findings provide a revised framework in which to view the linkage of RGS1 to inflammatory disease.
