Studies of the desensitization of G protein-coupled signal transduction have led to the discovery of a family of guanosine triphosphatase-activating proteins (GAPs) for heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits - the "regulator of G protein signaling" or RGS proteins. In considering both documented and potential functions of several RGS protein family members with demonstrable multidomain compositions (p115RhoGEF, PDZRhoGEF, Axin, Axil/Conductin, D-AKAP2, the G protein-coupled receptor kinases [GRKs], the DEP/GGL/RGS subfamily [RGS6, RGS7, RGS9, RGS11], and RGS12), this review explores the shift in our appreciation of the RGS proteins from unidimensional desensitizing agents to multifocal signal transduction regulators.
