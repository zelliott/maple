Apoptosis is an important mechanism for the preservation of a healthy and balanced immune system in vertebrates. Little is known, however, about how apoptotic processes regulate invertebrate immune defenses. In the present study, we show that noradrenaline, a catecholamine produced by the neuroendocrine system and by immune cells in molluscs, is able to induce apoptosis of oyster Crassostrea gigas hemocytes. The apoptosis-inducing effect of noradrenaline was mimicked by isoproterenol and blocked by propranolol, which indicates that noradrenaline triggers apoptosis via a beta-adrenergic signaling pathway. Exposure to the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK or expression of the caspase inhibitor P35 under the transcriptional control of a mollusc hsp70 gene promoter reduced the number of apoptotic cells among noradrenaline-treated hemocytes. These results suggest that P35-sensitive caspases are involved in the apoptotic process triggered by beta-adrenergic signaling. Complementary experiments suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinases and Rho, a member of the Ras GTPase family, may be involved in antiapoptotic mechanisms that modulate the apoptotic effect of noradrenaline. Taken together, these results provide a first insight into apoptotic processes in mollusc immune cells.
