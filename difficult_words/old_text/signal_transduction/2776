The delta isoform of protein kinase C is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to antigen activation of the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E. While protein kinase C-delta associates with and phosphorylates this receptor, immunoprecipitation of the receptor revealed that little, if any, tyrosine-phosphorylated protein kinase C-delta is receptor associated. In vitro kinase assays with immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein kinase C-delta showed that the modified enzyme had diminished activity toward the receptor gamma-chain peptide as a substrate but not toward histones or myelin basic protein peptide. We propose a model in which the tyrosine phosphorylation of protein kinase C-delta regulates the kinase specificity toward a given substrate. This may represent a general mechanism by which in vivo protein kinase activities are regulated in response to external stimuli.
