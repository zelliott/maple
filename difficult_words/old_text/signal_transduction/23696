The production and processing of ribosomal RNA is a complex and well-coordinated nucleolar process for ribosome biogenesis. Progress in understanding nucleolar structure and function has lead to the unexpected discovery of the nucleolus as a highly sensitive sensor of cellular stress and an important regulator of the tumor suppressor p53. Inhibition of ribosomal RNA metabolism has been shown to activate a signaling pathway for p53 induction. This review elucidates the potential of classical and recently developed chemotherapeutic drugs to stabilize p53 by inhibiting nucleolar functions.
