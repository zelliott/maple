Apoptosis is a biological process necessary for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Several diseases can result if it is deregulated. For example, inhibition of apoptotic signaling pathways is linked to the survival of pathological cells, which contributes to cancer, whereas excessive apoptosis is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, partially via oxidative stress. The activation or restoration of apoptosis via extrinsic or intrinsic pathways combined with cell signaling pathways triggered by reactive oxygen specises (ROS) formation is considered a key strategy by which bioactive foods can exert their health effects. Proanthocyanidins, a class of flavonoids naturally found in fruits, vegetables, and beverages, have attracted a great deal of attention not only because they are strong antioxidants but also because they appear to exert a different modulation of apoptosis, stimulating apoptosis in damaged cells, thus preventing cancer or reducing apoptosis in healthy cells, and as a result, preserving the integrity of normal cells and protecting against neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, proanthocyanidins could provide a defense against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress or directly inhibit apoptosis, and they could also provide a promising treatment for a variety of diseases. Emerging data suggest that proanthocyanidins, especially those that humans can be persuaded to consume, may be used to prevent and manage cancer and mental disorders.
