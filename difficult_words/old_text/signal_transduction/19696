Two-component signal transduction systems enable cells in bacteria, fungi, and plants to react to extracellular stimuli. A sensor histidine kinase (SK) detects such stimuli with its sensor domains and transduces the input signals to a response regulator (RR) by trans-phosphorylation. This trans-phosphorylation reaction requires the formation of a complex formed by the two interacting proteins. The complex is stabilized by transient interactions. The nature of the transient interactions makes it challenging for experimental techniques to gain structural information. X-ray crystallography requires stable crystals, which are difficult to grow and stabilize. Similarly, the mere size of these systems proves problematic for NMR. Theoretical methods can, however, complement existing data. The statistical direct coupling analysis presented in the previous chapter reveals the interacting residues at the contact interface of the SK/RR pair. This information can be combined with the structures of the individual proteins in molecular dynamical simulation to generate structural models of the complex. The general approach, referred to as MAGMA, was tested on the sporulation phosphorelay phosphotransfer complex, the Spo0B/Spo0F pair, delivering crystal resolution accuracy. The MAGMA method is described here in a step-by-step explanation. The developed parameters are transferrable to other SK/RR systems.
