Angiogenesis requires degradation of vascular basement membrane prior to migration and proliferation of endothelial cells; proteinases are essential ingredients in this process. Because of thrombin's multiple effects on endothelium, we have examined its role in matrix metalloproteinase activation using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Gelatin zymography of endothelial conditioned media revealed a prominent 72-kDa progelatinase A band. Addition of alpha-thrombin to endothelial cells resulted in the generation of 64 and 62 kDa gelatinolytic bands which is consistent with the activation of progelatinase A; thrombin had no effect in the absence of cells. This effect requires the proteolytic site of thrombin since progelatinase A activation was abolished by specific inhibitors of thrombin. Matrix metaloproteinase inhibitors diminished thrombin-induced activation of progelatinase A. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with excess tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 or a COOH-terminal fragment of progelatinase A abrogated thrombin-mediated activation of progelatinase A presumably by competing with the COOH terminus of native progelatinase A for interaction with an activator site on endothelial plasma membranes. Although membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase was demonstrated in endothelial cells by Northern and Western blotting, the receptor function of this molecule in thrombin-induced activation of progelatinase A needs to be clarified. Progelatinase A activation did not require intracellular signal transduction events mediated by the thrombin receptor. These data demonstrate that 1) endothelial cells express a novel activation mechanism for progelatinase A, 2) proteolytically active thrombin regulates this activation mechanism, and 3) activation occurs independently of the functional thrombin receptor.
