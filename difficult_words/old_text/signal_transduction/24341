Granzyme B (GrB), acting similar to an apical caspase, efficiently activates a proteolytic cascade after intracellular delivery by perforin. Studies here were designed to learn whether the physiologic effector, GrB-serglycin, initiates apoptosis primarily through caspase-3 or through BH3-only proteins with subsequent mitochondrial permeabilization and apoptosis. Using four separate cell lines that were either genetically lacking the zymogen or rendered deficient in active caspase-3, we measured apoptotic indices within whole cells (active caspase-3, mitochondrial depolarization [DeltaPsim] and TUNEL). Adhering to these conditions, the following were observed in targets after GrB delivery: (a) procaspase-3-deficient cells fail to display a reduced DeltaPsim and DNA fragmentation; (b) Bax/Bak is required for optimal DeltaPsim reduction, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation, whereas BID cleavage is undetected by immunoblot; (c) Bcl-2 inhibits GrB-mediated apoptosis (reduced DeltaPsim and TUNEL reactivity) by blocking oligomerization of caspase-3; and (d) in procaspase-3-deficient cells a mitochondrial-independent pathway was identified which involved procaspase-7 activation, PARP cleavage, and nuclear condensation. The data therefore support the existence of a fully implemented apoptotic pathway initiated by GrB, propagated by caspase-3, and perpetuated by a mitochondrial amplification loop but also emphasize the presence of an ancillary caspase-dependent, mitochondria-independent pathway.
