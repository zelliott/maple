Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is upregulated after arterial injury. Its role in the pathogenesis of neointimal formation after periadventitial injury, however, has not been addressed.

Expression of VEGF and its receptors but not that of placental growth factor markedly increased with the development of neointimal formation in hypercholesterolemic mice after cuff-induced periarterial injury. Transfection with the murine soluble Flt-1 (sFlt-1) gene to block VEGF in vivo in mice inhibited early inflammation and later neointimal formation. The sFlt-1 gene transfer did not affect plasma lipid levels but attenuated increased expression of VEGF, Flt-1, Flk-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and other inflammation-promoting factors. Mice with Flt-1 kinase deficiency also displayed reduced neointimal formation.

Inflammatory changes mediated by VEGF and Flt-1 signals play an important role in the pathogenesis of neointimal formation after cuff-induced periadventitial injury. VEGF might promote neointimal formation by acting as a proinflammatory cytokine.
