We recently reported that heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) via TLR4 signaling activates B cells and induces them to proliferate and secrete IL-10. We now report that HSP60 inhibits mouse B cell apoptosis, spontaneous or induced by dexamethasone or anti-IgM activation. Unlike HSP60 enhancement of B cell proliferation and IL-10 secretion, TLR4 signaling was not required for the inhibition of apoptosis by HSP60; nevertheless, MyD88 was essential. Inhibition of apoptosis by HSP60 was associated with up-regulation of the antiapoptotic molecules Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and survivin, maintenance of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and inhibition of caspase-3 activation. Moreover, B cells incubated with HSP60 manifested prolonged survival following transfer into recipient mice. These results extend the varied role of HSP60 in the innate regulation of the adaptive immune response.
