The induction of cytolytic activity in PC60, a murine T-cell hybridoma, is paralleled by a rise in the level of BLT-esterase (N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl esterase), a serine esterase specific for activated T-cells. Both interleukin-1 (IL-1) and dibutyryl cAMP were albe to increase the esterase activity in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. When added in combination the two activators showed a strong synergism: BLT-esterase levels were up to three times higher than the sum of the levels due to dibutyryl cAMP and IL-1 added separately. Stimulators of the adenylate cyclase, such as forskolin and cholera toxin, induced a similar enhancement of the BLT-esterase response to IL-1. PC60 cells did not produce any cAMP in response to IL-1. When the two stimuli were added sequentially a second effect for cAMP emerged: preincubation with dibutyryl cAMP or activators of the adenylate cyclase for 4 h or longer completely blocked the action of subsequently added IL-1. Taken together, the data demonstrate a dual modulatory role for cAMP in T-lymphocytes activated by IL-1.
