Human thioredoxin is one of the oxidative stress-inducible proteins and has a protective function against oxidant-induced injury. To evaluate the possible involvement of thioredoxin in the cytoprotective function of prostaglandin E1, we analysed the effect of prostaglandin E1 on cellular injury by hydrogen peroxide and intracellular thioredoxin induction. Cellular survival of human retinal pigment epithelial cell line, established from normal retinal pigment epithelial cells, following exposure to hydrogen peroxide was markedly improved by pretreatment of 1 microm prostaglandin E1. Thioredoxin expression was augmented in a dose-dependent manner when retinal pigment epithelial cells were pretreated with 10 nm-1 microm prostaglandin E1 1 hr before the exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Intracellular cyclic AMP level was elevated by Prostaglandin E1 when the cells were simultaneously exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, and dibutylyl cAMP, a cyclic AMP analog, could also induce thioredoxin and extend survival of retinal pigment epithelial cells. On the other hand, thioredoxin induction and cellular protection by prostaglandin E1 was blocked by Rp diastereoisomer of cyclic adenosine 3', 5', monophosphorothioate, a competitive inhibitor of cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase. Thioredoxin induction was augmented significantly by pretreatment with prostaglandin I2, a stimulator of cyclic AMP dependent signal pathway, while treatment with prostaglandin F2alpha, a stimulator of inositol phosphate-dependent signal pathway, failed to enhance thioredoxin. These findings indicate that prostaglandin E1 has a cytoprotective activity against oxidative injury, partly through thioredoxin induction via cyclic AMP dependent pathway.
