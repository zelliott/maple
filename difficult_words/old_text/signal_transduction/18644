Sphingosine-1-phosophate, generated from the phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase enzymes, is suggested to function as an intracellular second messenger for inflammatory mediators, including formyl peptide, C5a, and Fc. More recently, a role for sphingosine kinases during inflammation has also been proposed. Here we show that sphingosine kinase 1 knockout mice exhibit normal inflammatory cell recruitment during thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and that sphingosine kinase 1-null neutrophils respond normally to formyl peptide. In the collagen-induced arthritis model of rheumatoid arthritis, sphingosine kinase 1 knockout mice developed arthritis with normal incidence and severity. Our findings show that sphingosine kinase 1 is dispensable for inflammatory responses and support the need for more extensive studies of sphingosine kinases in inflammation.
