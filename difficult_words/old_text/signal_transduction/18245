Signal transduction by the BCR is critical for progression through developmental checkpoints as well as for immune responses. Recent results obtained in mice deficient either in an adaptor molecule, BLNK (alternatively named SLP-65 or BASH), or in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase have revealed similar - though not identical - phenotypes to those of Btk(-/-) mice, suggesting a functional link between BLNK, Btk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
