Primary thyroid cells are resistant to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Previously we showed that the combination of IL-1beta and TNFalpha facilitated TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in these cells and enhanced cell surface expression of TRAIL receptors. The aim of this study was to further characterize the mechanism by which these cytokines sensitized primary thyroid cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. IL-1beta and TNFalpha increased the concentrations of procaspase-7 and Bid. In contrast, the p44/42 MAPK (Erk) pathway was active in thyroid cells and this activity was significantly decreased after exposure to IL-1beta/TNFalpha. A MAPK kinase inhibitor (U0126) could enhance the cytokine-induced sensitization of thyroid cells to TRAIL, reinforcing the inhibitory role of Erk on TRAIL signaling. In conclusion, IL-1beta/TNFalpha treatment sensitizes human thyroid cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis through increased surface expression of TRAIL receptors, increased expression of procaspase-7 and Bid, and the inhibition of p44/42 MAPK (Erk) pathway.
