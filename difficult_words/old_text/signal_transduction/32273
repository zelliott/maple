To elucidate the molecular basis of early gastric cancer (EGC), the genome-wide             expression pattern of cancer and normal tissues from 27 patients were analyzed             by a microarray-based method. Using an integrative systematic bioinformatics approach,             we classified the differentially expressed genes in EGC. Interestingly, the more             highly expressed genes in EGC exhibited the most significant correlation with             cell migration and metastasis. This implies that, even at the early stage of gastric             cancer, the molecular properties usually observed in late-stage cancer are already             present. Furthermore, we have found a novel association between the expression             pattern and molecular pathways of EGC and estrogen receptor α (ERα)-negative breast             cancer through cross-experimental analysis. These results provide new insights             into the biological properties of EGC, as well as yielding useful basic data for             the study of molecular mechanisms of EGC carcinogenesis.
