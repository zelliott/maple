A more complete understanding of the mechanisms that drive autoimmune diseases has begun to be translated into therapeutic options with significant clinical consequences. A clear example of this is the introduction of biological therapies, which have provided new therapeutic avenues, as well as validated the mediators (TNFalpha, IL-6), mechanisms (T cell costimulation, leukocyte migration), and cellular players (T and B lymphocytes) of the disease process itself. New discoveries into the role of Th17 and regulatory T cells and the epigenetic regulation of cytokine expression may offer novel intervention strategies to satisfy the unmet medical needs that still exist in these diseases.
