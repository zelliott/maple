Agglucetin, a platelet glycoprotein (GP)Ib binding protein from Formosan Agkistrodon acutus (A. acutus) venom, could sustain human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and HUVEC adhering to immobilized agglucetin showed extensive spreading, which was strongly abrogated by integrin antagonists 7E3 and triflavin. Flow cytometric analyses confirmed the expression of GPIb complex on HUVEC is absent and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-agglucetin binds to HUVEC in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. Furthermore, native agglucetin specifically and dose-dependently inhibited the binding of FITC-23C6, an anti-alphavbeta3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), but not antibodies against alpha2 and alpha5, toward HUVEC and purified alphavbeta3 also bound to immobilized agglucetin-beta in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, agglucetin exhibited a pro-angiogenic effect in vitro, as well as the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-associated signaling molecules responsible for HUVEC activation were initiated by agglucetin. In conclusion, agglucetin, acting as a survival factor, promotes endothelial adhesion and angiogenesis by triggering alphavbeta3 signaling through FAK/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway.
