Upon contact with intestinal epithelial cells, Salmonella enterica serovar spp. inject a set of bacterial proteins into host cells via the bacterial SPI-1 type III secretion system. SopE, SopE2 and SopB, activate CDC42 and Rac to initiate actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. SipA and SipC, two Salmonella actin-binding proteins, directly modulate host actin dynamics to facilitate bacterial uptake. SptP promotes the recovery of the actin cytoskeleton rearrangements by antagonizing CDC42 and Rac. Therefore, Salmonella-induced reversible actin cytoskeleton rearrangements are the result of two coordinated steps: (i) stimulation of host signal transduction to indirectly promote actin rearrangements and (ii) direct modulation of actin dynamics.
