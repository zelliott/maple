Autophagy is a process of lysosomal degradation that was originally described as a cellular response to adapt to a lack of nutrients and to enable the elimination of damaged organelles. Autophagy is increasingly recognized as a process that is also involved in innate and adaptive immune responses against pathogens. Studies on the regulation of autophagy have uncovered components of the autophagic cascade that can be manipulated pharmacologically. Approaches to modulate autophagy may result in novel strategies for the treatment and prevention of various infections.
