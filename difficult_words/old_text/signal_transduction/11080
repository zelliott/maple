Cyclic AMP metabolism is essential for the survival of the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum. Three distinct adenylyl cyclases are expressed and required for the normal development of this simple eukaryote. The adenylyl cyclase expressed during aggregation, ACA, is related to the mammalian and Drosophila G protein-coupled enzymes and is responsible for the synthesis of cAMP that is required for cell-cell signaling in early development. ACB harbors histidine kinase and response-regulator domains and is required for terminal differentiation. Finally, the adenylyl cyclase expressed during germination, ACG, acts as an osmosensor and is involved in controlling spore germination. Together, these enzymes generate the various levels of cAMP that are required for D. discoideum to transition from uni- to multi-cellularity. This review will highlight the properties of these enzymes and describe the signaling cascades that lead to their activation.
