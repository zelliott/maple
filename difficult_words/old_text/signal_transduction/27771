Polyomavirus middle T antigen does not overcome p53-mediated G(1) arrest in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Middle T antigen still associates with the signaling molecules phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and SHC and activates the transcriptional activity of c-Myc and AP1 in p53-arrested cells. Examination of cell cycle regulatory proteins indicated that p53 does not interfere with these mitogenic signals but acts later in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle.
