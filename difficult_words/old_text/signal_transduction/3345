We investigate the cell signal transduction pathway protein kinase C (PKC) and the role of NADPH subunits in the process of TNF-α-induced endothelial apoptosis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with one of these: 1 mM PKC β(2) inhibitor CGP53353, 10 mM PKC δ inhibitor rottlerin, combination CGP53353 with rottlerin, 3 ×10(-4)M NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin, 5 × 10(-6)M NADPH oxidase peptide inhibitor gp91ds-tat. The apoptosis process was assessed by Hoechst 33342 stain, flow cytometry and Western blot analysis, while intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was detected by 2,7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). The NADPH oxidase subunit gene and protein expression were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. TNF-α significantly induced HUVEC apoptosis and ROS production, accompanying with dramatic upregulation of NADPH oxidase subunits: NOX2/gp91(phox), NOX4, p47(phox) and p67(phox), whereas these enhancements were abolished by the treatment with PKC inhibitors. High TNF-α level exposure induces HUVEC apoptosis, as well as a ROS generation increase via the PKC β(2)-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase. Although the PKC δ pathway may enhance TNF-α-induced HUVEC apoptosis, it does not involve the ROS pathway. Upregulation of expression of NADPH subunits is important in this process, which leads to a new target in antioxidative therapy for vascular disease prevention.
