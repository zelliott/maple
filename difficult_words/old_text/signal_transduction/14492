Protein kinase C has long been thought to mediate DAG signaling at the synapse. Recently PKC has been supplanted by members of the Unc13 family as the predominant effectors of DAG signaling. Thanks to a study by Wierda and colleagues in this issue of Neuron, PKC returns to reclaim part of the kingdom: both pathways must be active to activate presynaptic potentiation.
