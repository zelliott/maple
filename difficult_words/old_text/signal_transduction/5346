The Wnt signaling pathway regulates cell growth and development in metazoans, and is therefore of interest for drug discovery. By screening a library of 5808 pre-fractionated marine extracts in a cell-based Wnt signaling assay, several signaling activators and inhibitors were observed. LCMS-based fractionation rapidly identified an active compound from Pseudoceratina purpurea as psammaplin A, a known HDAC inhibitor. Other HDAC inhibitors similarly activated signaling in this assay, indicating HDAC inhibitors will be identified through many cell-based reporter assays. In a large scale analysis of P. purpurea, three previously undescribed bromotyrosine based natural products were identified; the structure of one of these was confirmed by synthesis. Additionally, three other derivatives of psammaplin A were prepared: a mixed disulfide and two sulfinate esters. Finally, evidence to support a structural reassignment of psammaplin I from a sulfone to the isomeric sulfinate ester is presented.
