Both prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and low intensity pulsed ultrasound (U/S) exposure have been reported to accelerate fracture repair. We hypothesized that these two pathways are interactive. To verify this hypothesis, we examined the regulation of PGE2 production by U/S exposure (sine wave of 1.5MHz repeating at 1kHz, 30mW/cm2, 20 minutes) in mouse osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1. The production of PGE2 in osteoblasts was augmented by U/S, which was threefold at 60 min. in comparison with unexposed samples. Then we evaluated the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA, which is a critical enzyme for PGE2 production. U/S rapidly up-regulated the expression of COX-2 mRNA in a time dependent manner. In addition, PGE2 production by U/S was drastically suppressed by a selective inhibitor of COX-2. These results provide strong evidence that PGE2 production in osteoblasts is dependent upon the induction of COX-2 mRNA expression by U/S and offer a mechanistic insight into how U/S accelerates fracture repair.
