Exposure to ethanol during development induces severe brain damage, resulting in a number of CNS dysfunctions including microencephaly and mental retardation. Potential targets of ethanol-induced neurotoxicity include neurotrophic factors and their signal transduction pathways. In the present study, rat pups were given ethanol at the dose of 5 g kg(-1) via gavage from postnatal day (PND) 5 to 8, and mRNA expression of nerve growth-factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophic factor-3 (NT-3) in the cerebral cortex was examined, with attention to signal transduction, on PND 8. The mRNA level of BDNF was decreased by ethanol while those of NGF or NT-3 were not changed. Brain weights were decreased and the levels of phospho-MAPK, phospho-p70S6K and phospho Akt were decreased while phosphor-PKCzeta and phospho-CREB remained unchanged. These results suggest that BDNF and its related signal pathways involving Akt, MAPK and p70S6K are potential targets of ethanol-induced developmental neurotoxicity.
