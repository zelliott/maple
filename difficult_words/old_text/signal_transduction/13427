The nonreceptor Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) has been previously shown to associate physically and functionally with members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases in a variety of cell types. Here we show evidence for a novel interaction between Btk and PKCtheta; in platelets activated through the adhesion receptors GP Ib-V-IX and GP VI. Alboaggregin A, a snake venom component capable of activating both receptors in combination, leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk downstream of Src family kinases. Inhibition of Btk by the selective antagonist LFM-A13 causes a reduction in calcium entry, although secretion of 5-hydroxytryptamine is potentiated. Btk is also phosphorylated on threonine residues in a PKC-dependent manner and associates with PKCtheta; upon platelet activation by either alboaggregin A or activation of GP Ib-V-IX alone by von Willebrand factor/ristocetin. PKCtheta; in turn becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in a manner dependent upon Src family and Btk kinase activity. Inhibition of Btk activity by LFM-A13 leads to enhancement of PKCtheta; activity, whereas nonselective inhibition of PKC activity by bisindolylmaleimide I leads to reduction in Btk activity. We propose a reciprocal feedback interaction between Btk and PKCtheta; in platelets, in which PKCtheta; positively modulates activity of Btk, which in turn feeds back negatively upon PKCtheta;.
