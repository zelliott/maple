The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a vital role in various aspects of plant growth and development and in adaptation of plants to various environmental stresses. Cell response to ABA is initiated by ABA perception with a cell receptor. Recently, three distinct ABA receptors have been identified, opening a door to uncover the initial events of ABA signal transduction. The aim of this Botanical Briefing is to present a perspective of the ABA receptors identified.

This Briefing offers an introduction to the three ABA receptors identified and an analysis of the complexity and multiplicity of ABA receptors, and provides some viewpoints on future research.
