Prostaglandins (PGs) of the J2 series form in vivo and exert effects on a variety of biological processes. While most of PGs mediate their effects through G protein-coupled receptors, the mechanism of action for the J2 series of PGs remains unclear. Here, we report the PGJ2 and its derivatives are efficacious activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma (PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma, respectively), orphan nuclear receptors implicated in lipid homeostasis and adipocyte differentiation. The PGJ2 metabolite 15-deoxy-delta 12,14-PGJ2 binds directly to PPAR gamma and promotes efficient differentiation of C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts to adipocytes. These data provide strong evidence that a fatty acid metabolite can function as an adipogenic agent through direct interactions with PPAR gamma and furthermore, suggest a novel mechanism of action for PGs of the J2 series.
