Soluble sugars, especially sucrose, glucose, and fructose, play an obviously central role in plant structure and metabolism at the cellular and whole-organism levels. They are involved in the responses to a number of stresses, and they act as nutrient and metabolite signalling molecules that activate specific or hormone-crosstalk transduction pathways, thus resulting in important modifications of gene expression and proteomic patterns. Various metabolic reactions and regulations directly link soluble sugars with the production rates of reactive oxygen species, such as mitochondrial respiration or photosynthesis regulation, and, conversely, with anti-oxidative processes, such as the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway and carotenoid biosynthesis. Moreover, stress situations where soluble sugars are involved, such as chilling, herbicide injury, or pathogen attack, are related to important changes in reactive oxygen species balance. These converging or antagonistic relationships between soluble sugars, reactive oxygen species production, and anti-oxidant processes are generally confirmed by current transcriptome analyses, and suggest that sugar signalling and sugar-modulated gene expression are related to the control of oxidative stress. All these links place soluble carbohydrates in a pivotal role in the pro-oxidant and antioxidant balance, and must have constrained the selection of adaptive mechanisms involving soluble sugars and preventing de-regulation of reactive oxygen species production. Finally, in line with the specific role of sucrose in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, this role of soluble sugars in oxidative stress regulation seems to entail differential effects of glucose and sucrose, which emphasizes the unresolved issue of characterizing sucrose-specific signalling pathways.
