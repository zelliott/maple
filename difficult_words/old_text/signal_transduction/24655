The input pathway between the blue-light photoreceptor and the circadian oscillator of Neurospora crassa has not yet been identified. To test the hypothesis that an inositol phospholipid signaling system might be involved in blue-light signal transduction, phase resetting by light was assayed in the inositol-requiring inl strain under conditions of inositol depletion. Phase-resetting curves and dose-response curves indicated that cultures maintained on low inositol (25 microM) were several orders of magnitude more sensitive to light than those maintained on high inositol (250 microM). This difference in light sensitivity was a property of inositol auxotrophy and was not seen in the wild type or in an inositol-independent inl+ revertant. Phase resetting by temperature was not affected by inositol depletion, indicating that the effect on light resetting is specific to the light input pathway and is not the result of a change in the amplitude of the oscillator itself. The results indicate an indirect role for inositol metabolites in the light input pathway--one that is not likely to involve direct participation of an inositol phospholipid signal transduction mechanism.
