The regulated release of ATP is a fundamental process in cell-to-cell signaling. The electrogenic translocation of ATP via an anion channel has been suggested as one possible mechanism of the release. In this review, we survey possible candidate channels for this pathway. The maxi-anion channel characterized by an exceedingly large unitary conductance has been a stray channel with regard to its function. A newly discovered property, its ATP conductivity and its activation in response to stress signals, indicates that this channel has a central role in stress-sensory transduction for cell volume regulation and tubuloglomerular feedback.
