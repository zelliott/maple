Oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+ develop in a variety of cells after an induction phase, called latency, the duration of which depends on the magnitude of external stimulation. Experiments in hepatocytes indicate that the period and latency of Ca2+ oscillations both decrease as the level of the stimulus increases. We analyze the correlation between period and latency in a model recently proposed for signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations. We show that the linear relationship between period and latency observed in the experiments arises naturally in this model as a result of the mechanism of Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release on which it is based.
