Adult stem cells act as a pluripotent source of regenerative cells during tissue injury. Despite expanded research in stem cell biology, understanding how growth and migration of adipose-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) are governed by interactions with growth factors is very limited. One important property of ASC is the presence of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and the cellular response to soluble EGF. Expression of the EGF receptor was proven by PCR and Western blotting. Signal transduction was analyzed by Western blotting and PhosFlow assay. EGF caused robust phosphorylation of SHC and ERK1/2, which could be inhibited by EGF receptor antagonist AG1478 and MEK inhibitor PD98059. ASC proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Stem cell migration was analyzed in a modified Boyden chamber. Incubation with EGF led to cell proliferation and induced cell migration, but did not change the undifferentiated state of the cells. In the kidney, injured renal tubular cells express high amounts of EGF. Therefore, our results may highlight a mechanism underlying renal regeneration. Thus, future in vivo studies that focus on the effects of EGF on recruitment of ASC to sites of injury are necessary.
