The bcr-abl oncogene plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The fusion of Bcr sequences to Abl constitutively activates the Abl protein tyrosine kinase. We have recently shown that expression of Bcr-Abl in bone marrow cells by retroviral transduction efficiently induces in mice a myeloproliferative disease resembling human CML and that Abl kinase activity is essential for Bcr-Abl to induce a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. However, it is not known if activation of the Abl kinase alone is sufficient to induce a myeloproliferative disease. In this study, we examined the role of the Abl SH3 domain of Bcr-Abl in induction of myeloproliferative disease and tested whether c-Abl activated by SH3 deletion can induce a CML-like disease. We found that Bcr-Abl with an Abl SH3 deletion still induced a CML-like disease in mice. In contrast, c-Abl activated by SH3 deletion induced only lymphoid malignancies in mice and did not stimulate the growth of myeloid colonies from 5-fluorouracil-treated bone marrow cells in vitro. These results indicate that Bcr sequences in Bcr-Abl play additional roles in inducing myeloproliferative disease beyond simply activating the Abl kinase domain and that functions of the Abl SH3 domain are either not required or redundant in Bcr-Abl-induced myeloproliferative disease. The results also suggest that the type of hematological neoplasm induced by an abl oncogene is influenced not only by what type of hematopoietic cells the oncogene is targeted into but also by the intrinsic oncogenic properties of the particular abl oncogene. In addition, we found that DeltaSH3 c-Abl induced less activation of Akt and STAT5 than did Bcr-Abl, suggesting that activation of these pathways plays a critical role in inducing a CML-like disease.
