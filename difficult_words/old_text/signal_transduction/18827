Thirty-one novel derivatives of carvone, carveol, and limonene were designed and synthesized using L-carvone as a starting material via chlorination, nucleophilic substitution, and reduction. The structures of these derivatives were characterized by MS and 1H NMR. The antiproliferative effect was evaluated in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. L-carvone, L-carveol, and L-limonene were weak cell growth inhibitors and introduction of 4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine to carvone, carveol or limonene significantly increased their antiproliferative effect. The antiproliferative effect was correlated with ERK activation and p21(waf1) induction.
