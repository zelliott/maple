BAFF, a member of the TNF family, is a fundamental survival factor for transitional and mature B cells. BAFF overexpression leads to an expanded B cell compartment and autoimmunity in mice, and elevated amounts of BAFF can be found in the serum of autoimmune patients. APRIL is a related factor that shares receptors with BAFF yet appears to play a different biological role. The BAFF system provides not only potential insight into the development of autoreactive B cells but a relatively simple paradigm to begin considering the balancing act between survival, growth, and death that affects all cells.
