Pathways that regulate the activation of NF-kappaB/Rel transcription factors are known to include signaling through a number of cytokine receptors. Interleukin 7 (IL-7), produced by bone marrow and other stromal cells, is a key factor for differentiation and survival in the lymphoid and other compartments. We found that human recombinant IL-7 induced NF-kappaB/Rel activation, analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes from healthy donors. Induced complexes included p65 and p50 NF-kappaB/Rel subunits. These results demonstrate for the first time that IL-7 can participate in signaling leading to NF-kappaB/Rel activation.
