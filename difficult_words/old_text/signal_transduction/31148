Cadmium (Cd) tolerance seems to be a constitutive species-level trait in Arabidopsis halleri. In order to identify genes potentially implicated in Cd tolerance, a backcross (BC1) segregating population was produced from crosses between A. halleri ssp. halleri and its closest non-tolerant relative A. lyrata ssp. petraea. The most sensitive and tolerant genotypes of the BC1 were analysed on a transcriptome-wide scale by cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). A hundred and thirty-four genes expressed more in the root of tolerant genotypes than in sensitive genotypes were identified. Most of the identified genes showed no regulation in their expression when exposed to Cd in a hydroponic culture medium and belonged to diverse functional classes, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, cellular repair, metal sequestration, water transport, signal transduction, transcription regulation, and protein degradation, which are discussed.
