The thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is increased by norepinephrine (NE) released from sympathetic nerve endings, but the roles of NPY released along with NE are poorly elucidated. Here, we examined effect of NPY on basal and NE-enhanced thermogenesis in isolated brown adipocytes that express Y1 and Y5 receptor mRNA. Treatment of cells with NPY did not influence the basal and NE-enhanced rates of oxygen consumption and cAMP accumulation. Treatment with NPY also failed to induce ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation in the brown adipocytes. In contrast, treatment with NPY increased ERK phosphorylation in cultured stromal vascular cells from the BAT that express Y1 receptor mRNA. In the latter treatment with NPY also increased STAT3 (Ser727) phosphorylation. These results suggest that NPY mainly acts on stromal vascular cells in BAT and plays roles in the regulation of their gene transcription through ERK and STAT3 pathways, while NPY does not affect the thermogenic function of brown adipocytes.
