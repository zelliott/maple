In the insect Drosophila embryo, establishment of maternal transcription factor gradients, rather than cell-cell interactions, is fundamental to patterning the embryonic axes. In contrast, in the chelicerate spider embryo, cell-cell interactions are thought to play a crucial role in the development of the embryonic axes. A grafting experiment by Holm using spider eggs resulted in duplication of the embryonic axes, similar to the Spemann's organizer experiment using amphibian eggs. Recent work using the house spider Achaearanea tepidariorum has demonstrated that the homologs of decapentaplegic (dpp), short gastrulation (sog) and Delta, which encode a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-type ligand, its antagonist and a Notch ligand, respectively, are required in distinct aspects of axis formation. Achaearanea Dpp appears to function as a symmetry-breaking signal, which could account for Holm's results to some extent. Experimental findings concerning Achaearanea sog and Delta have highlighted differences in the mechanisms underlying ventral and posterior development between Drosophila and Achaearanea. Achaearanea ventral patterning essentially depends on sog function, in contrast to the Drosophila patterning mechanism, which is based on the nuclear gradient of Dorsal. Achaearanea posterior (or opisthosomal) patterning relies on the function of the caudal lobe, which develops from cells surrounding the blastopore through progressive activation of Delta-Notch signaling. In this review, we describe the differing strategies for forming the arthropod body plan in the fly and spider, and provide a perspective towards understanding the relationship between the arthropod and vertebrate body plans.
