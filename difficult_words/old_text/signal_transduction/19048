Defects in ubiquitin E3 ligases are implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including cancer, because of their central role in the control of diverse signaling pathways. RING E3 ligases promote the ubiquitination of proteins that are essential to a variety of cellular events. Identification of which ubiquitin ligases specifically affect distinct cellular processes is essential to the development of targeted therapeutics for these diseases. Here we discuss two novel RING E3 ligases, BCA2 and RNF11, that are closely linked to human breast cancer. BCA2 E3 ligase is coregulated with estrogen receptor and plays a role in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) trafficking. RNF11 is a small RING E3 ligase that affects transforming growth factorbeta and EGF-R signaling and is overexpressed in invasive breast cancers. These two proteins demonstrate the complexity of RING E3 ligase interactions in breast cancer and are potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
