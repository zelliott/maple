The alpha-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G13 regulate cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis in different cell types. Expression of the constitutively activated mutant of G(alpha)13 (G(alpha13)QL) increases the expression of Egr-1, an immediate-early response gene that is identified to be involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Here we report that G(alpha13)QL activates the promoter of Egr-1 through specific sequence which includes the characteristic CArG boxes. We also demonstrate that the G(alpha13)QL activation of Egr-1 promoter is mediated by the Ras-like small GTPase Rho.
