We previously reported that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] protects primary human keratinocytes against ultraviolet (UV)B-induced apoptosis. Here, we confirmed the anti-apoptotic effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 in keratinocytes, using cisplatin and doxorubicin as apoptotic triggers. We further showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 activates two survival pathways in keratinocytes: the MEK/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt pathway. Activation of ERK and Akt by 1,25(OH)2D3 was transient, required a minimal dose of 10(-9) M and could be blocked by actinomycin D and cycloheximide. Moreover, inhibition of Akt or ERK activity with respectively a PI-3K inhibitor (LY294002) or MEK inhibitors (PD98059, UO126), partially or totally suppressed the anti-apoptotic capacity of 1,25(OH)2D3. Finally, 1,25(OH)2D3 changed the expression of different apoptosis regulators belonging to the Bcl-2 family. Indeed, 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment increased levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreased levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad in a time- and dose-dependent way. Induction of Bcl-2 by 1,25(OH)2D3 was further shown to be mediated by ERK and, to a lesser extent, by Akt. In conclusion, 1,25(OH)2D3 clearly protects keratinocytes against apoptosis (1) by activating the MEK/ERK and the PI-3K/Akt survival pathways and (2) by increasing the Bcl-2 to Bax and Bad ratio.
