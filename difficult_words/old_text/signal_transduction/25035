The two-component regulatory system PhoPQ has been identified in many bacterial species. However, the role of PhoPQ in regulating virulence gene expression in pathogenic bacteria has been characterized only in Salmonella species. We have identified, cloned, and sequenced PhoP orthologues from Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica. To investigate the role of PhoP in the pathogenicity of Y. pestis, an isogenic phoP mutant was constructed by using a reverse-genetics PCR-based strategy. The protein profiles of the wild-type and phoP mutant strains, grown at either 28 or 37 degrees C, revealed more than 20 differences, indicating that PhoP has pleiotrophic effects on gene expression in Y. pestis. The mutant showed a reduced ability to survive in J774 macrophage cell cultures and under conditions of low pH and oxidative stress in vitro. The mean lethal dose of the phoP mutant in mice was increased 75-fold in comparison with that of the wild-type strain, indicating that the PhoPQ system plays a key role in regulating the virulence of Y. pestis.
