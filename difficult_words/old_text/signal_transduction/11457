Dark-grown transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing the C-terminal domains (CCT) of the cryptochrome (CRY) blue light photoreceptors exhibit features that are normally associated only with light-grown seedlings, indicating that the signaling mechanism of Arabidopsis CRY is mediated through CCT. The phenotypic properties mediated by CCT are remarkably similar to those of the constitutive photomorphogenic1 (cop1) mutants. Here we show that Arabidopsis cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) and its C-terminal domain (CCT1) interacted strongly with the COP1 protein. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that CRY1 was bound to COP1 in extracts from both dark- and light-grown Arabidopsis. An interaction also was observed between the C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis phytochrome B and COP1, suggesting that phytochrome signaling also proceeds, at least in part, through direct interaction with COP1. These findings give new insight into the initial step in light signaling in Arabidopsis, providing a molecular link between the blue light receptor, CRY1, and COP1, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis.
