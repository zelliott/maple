Many bacterial pathogens produce diffusible signal factor (DSF)-type quorum sensing (QS) signals in modulation of virulence and biofilm formation. Previous work on Xanthomonas campestris showed that the RpfC/RpfG two-component system is involved in sensing and responding to DSF signals, but little is known in other microorganisms. Here we show that in Burkholderia cenocepacia the DSF-family signal cis-2-dodecenoic acid (BDSF) negatively controls the intracellular cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) level through a receptor protein RpfR, which contains Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS)-GGDEF-EAL domains. RpfR regulates the same phenotypes as BDSF including swarming motility, biofilm formation, and virulence. In addition, the BDSF(-) mutant phenotypes could be rescued by in trans expression of RpfR, or its EAL domain that functions as a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase. BDSF is shown to bind to the PAS domain of RpfR with high affinity and stimulates its phosphodiesterase activity through induction of allosteric conformational changes. Our work presents a unique and widely conserved DSF-family signal receptor that directly links the signal perception to c-di-GMP turnover in regulation of bacterial physiology.
