Available treatments for depression have significant limitations, including low response rates and substantial lag times for response. Reports of rapid antidepressant effects of a number of compounds, including the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine, have spurred renewed translational neuroscience efforts aimed at elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of action that result in rapid therapeutic response. This perspective provides an overview of recent advances utilizing compounds with rapid-acting antidepressant effects, discusses potential mechanism of action and provides a framework for future research directions aimed at developing safe, efficacious antidepressants that achieve satisfactory remission not only by working rapidly but also by providing a sustained response.
