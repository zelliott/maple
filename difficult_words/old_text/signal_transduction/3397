Tissue stem cells are found in specialized microenvironments (niches) where they are exposed to diverse systemic and local signals that are integrated with cell intrinsic factors to regulate stem cell behavior. In general, systemic signals are utilized to coordinate the response of tissues to acute or long-term changes that affect the whole organism, such as variations in nutrient availability or aging. In contrast, local signaling regulates tissue maintenance by balancing stem cell self-renewal with differentiation under homeostatic conditions and in response to local damage. In this review, we highlight the role of the JAK-STAT pathway in two Drosophila stem cell systems, the testis and intestine, and compare and contrast how activation of this pathway leads to tissue maintenance under both homeostatic conditions and in response to stress or injury.
