Through acute enteric infection, Salmonella invades host enterocytes and reproduces intracellularly into specialized vacuolae. This involves changes in host cell signaling elicited by bacterial proteins delivered via type III secretion systems (TTSS). One of the two TTSSs of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity island-1, triggers bacterial internalization. Among the effector proteins translocated by this TTSS, the GTPase modulator SopE/E2 and the phosphoinositide phosphatase SigD are known to play key roles in these processes. To better understand their contribution to re-programming host cell pathways, we used ZeptoMARK reverse-phase protein array technology, which allows printing 32-sample lysate arrays that can be analyzed with phospho-specific antibodies to evaluate the phosphorylation of signaling proteins. Lysates were obtained at different times after infection of HeLa cells with WT, TTSS-deficient, sopE/E2 and sigD single and double deletants, as well as different sigD Salmonella mutants. Our analysis detected activation of p38, JNK and ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases, mainly dependent on SopE/E2, as well as SigD-dependent phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and its targets GSK-3beta and FKHR/FoxO. This is the first time that reverse-phase protein array technology is used in the cellular microbiology field, demonstrating its value to screen for host signaling events through bacterial infection.
