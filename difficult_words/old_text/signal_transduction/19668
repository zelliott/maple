A number of intracellular kinase components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway have been targeted over the past few years, leading to a new generation of anticancer agents that effectively and specifically disrupt this pathway in tumor cells. Here, progress in the identification and clinical evaluation of compounds designed to modulate the enzymatic activity of PI3K, Akt, mTOR, and Hsp90 is reviewed.
