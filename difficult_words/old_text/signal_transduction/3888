We have previously reported the isolation of two distinct populations of detergent resistant membrane complexes (DRMC's) from day-old chick brain (Henke et al.: J Neurosci Res 45:617-630, 1996). We now show that the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins Thy-1 and AvGp50 are associated in a signalling complex with c-Fyn, the heterotrimeric G alpha i subfamily members G alpha i-3, G alpha z, and G alpha o, alpha and beta tubulin, and a number of other phosphoproteins in immunocomplexes isolated from both populations of DRMC's. Activation of this signalling complex via Thy-1 monoclonal antibody incubation with chick forebrain cells, elicited a decrease in total phosphoprotein profile and tyrosine kinase activity present in DRMC fractions isolated from these cells, while AvGp50 and control antibodies had no effect. Down-regulation of the DRMC phosphoprotein profile was accompanied by an increase in the Thy-1-associated signalling complex, suggesting that activation of this complex initiates the decreases seen in overall DRMC kinase activity. This signalling complex provides the basis for GPI-anchored protein-mediated signal transduction within the unique plasma membrane domains represented by DRMC's.
