These studies investigate the role of mitoK(ATP) channels, protein kinase C (PKC) and Mitogen activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) on the cardioprotection of ischemic (IP) and pharmacological preconditioning (PP) of the human myocardium and their sequence of activation.

Right atrial appendages from patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were equilibrated for 30 min and then subjected to 90 min of simulated ischemia followed by 120 min reoxygenation. At the end of each protocol creatinine kinase leakage (CK U/g wet wt) and the reduction of MTT to formazan dye (mM/g wet wt) were measured. Similar protection was obtained with alpha1 agonist phenylephrine, adenosine and IP and their combination did not afford additional cardioprotection. Blockade of mitoK(ATP) channels with 5-hydroxydecanoate, PKC with chelerythrine, or p38MAPK with SB203580 abolished the protection of IP and of PP. In additional studies, the stimulation of mitoK(ATP) channels with diazoxide or activation of PKC with PMA or p38MAPK with anisomycin induced identical protection to that of IP and PP. The protection induced by diazoxide was abolished by blockade of PKC and by blockade of p38MAPK. Furthermore, the protection induced by PMA was abolished by SB203580 but not by 5-hydroxydecanoate, whereas the protection induced by anisomycin was unaffected by either 5-hydroxydecanoate or chelerythrine.

Opening of mitoK(ATP) channels and activation of PKC and p38MAPK are obligatory steps in the signal transduction cascade of IP and PP of the human myocardium with PKC activation being downstream of the opening of mitoK(ATP) channels and upstream of p38MAPK activation.
