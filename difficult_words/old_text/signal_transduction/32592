Induction of Fas expression by DNA-damaging agents is dependent on the expression of functional p53, and has been suggested to play an important role in apoptosis induction. JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), which is capable of phosphorylating p53, is also involved in apoptotic signaling induced by various apoptotic stimuli. Here, we report that although Fas induction is closely linked to the expression of wild type p53, it is not correlated with JNK activation induced by apoptotic stimuli. JNK activation does not necessarily lead to Fas expression, even in cells containing wild type p53. In addition, Fas expression can be induced without significant JNK activation. Furthermore, induction of Fas expression is not sufficient for apoptosis induction; however, it may sensitize cells to Fas-ligation induced apoptosis.
