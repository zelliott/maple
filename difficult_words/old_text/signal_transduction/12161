We try to find out the influence of traditional Chinese Medicine Astragali-Cordyceps Mixtura (ACM) on TGF-beta/Smad signal pathway in the lung of asthma airway remodeling.

Mice were sensitized and challenged by OVA to establish a model of asthma. To assess the effects of ACM on the mice, animals of the ACM groups were treated with ACM. Data were achieved by using techniques as follow: counting cell number of BALF, assaying the amount of collagen deposition by Masson's staining, performing RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry for mRNA and protein expression of TGF-beta1, Smad3 and Smad7.

The depositions of collagen in airway wall greatly increased at the model group compared with that of the normal group. In contrast, these decreased at the ACM groups. As compared with the control group, TGF-beta1 expression also decreased at both mRNA and protein level at the ACM-M group versus increased both at the model group. Whereas, Smad7 significantly decreased only at the model group and partly restored at the ACM-M group.

ACM greatly improves the symptoms of asthma airway remodeling by inhibiting the expression of TGF-beta1 and upregulating the amount of Smad7.
