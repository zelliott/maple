Nicotine to nornicotine conversion in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is regulated by an unstable converter locus which in its activated state gives rise to a high nornicotine, low nicotine phenotype in the senescing leaves. In plants that carry the high nornicotine trait, nicotine conversion is primarily catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 protein, designated CYP82E4 whose transcription is strongly upregulated during leaf senescence. To further investigate the regulation of CYP82E4 expression, we examined the spatiotemporal distribution and the stress- and signaling molecule-elicited expression patterns of CYP82E4 using alkaloid analysis and a fusion construct between the 2.2 kb upstream regulatory region of CYP82E4 and the beta-glucurodinase (GUS) gene. Histochemical and fluorometric analyses of GUS expression revealed that the CYP82E4 promoter confers high levels of expression in the senescing leaves and flowers, and in the green stems of young and mature plants, but only very low activity was detected in the roots. In the leaves, GUS activity was strongly correlated with the progression of senescence. Treatments of leaf tissue with various signaling molecules including abscisic acid, ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and yeast extract; and stresses, such as drought, wounding and tobacco mosaic virus infection did not enhance nicotine conversion or GUS activity in the green leaves, but an increase in CYP82E4 expression was observed in response to ethylene- or tobacco mosaic virus-induced senescence. These results suggest that the expression of CYP82E4 is senescence-specific in the leaves and the use of the CYP82E4 promoter could provide a valuable tool for regulating gene expression in the senescing leaves.
