Hematopoiesis is a complex process in which mature myeloid and lymphoid cells are produced from a small population of pluripotent stem cells within the bone marrow. Blood cell formation occurs, in part, by progenitor cell exposure to humoral growth regulators, known as hematopoietic cytokines, as well as by the regulated expression of genes by transcription factors. In this paper, we review two important nuclear proteins, the serum response factor and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein, as downstream targets of mitogens, with a specific focus on hematopoietic cytokine signaling and the role these proteins play in gene regulation.
