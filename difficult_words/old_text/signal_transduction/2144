Palmitoylation of the alpha subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gz inhibited by more than 90 percent its response to the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-accelerating activity of Gz GAP, a Gz-selective member of the regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Palmitoylation both decreased the affinity of Gz GAP for the GTP-bound form of Galphaz by at least 90 percent and decreased the maximum rate of GTP hydrolysis. Inhibition was reversed by removal of the palmitoyl group by dithiothreitol. Palmitoylation of Galphaz also inhibited its response to the GAP activity of Galpha-interacting protein (GAIP), another RGS protein, and palmitoylation of Galphai1 inhibited its response to RGS4. The extent of inhibition of Gz GAP, GAIP, RGS4, and RGS10 correlated roughly with their intrinsic GAP activities for the Galpha target used in the assay. Reversible palmitoylation is thus a major determinant of Gz deactivation after its stimulation by receptors, and may be a general mechanism for prolonging or potentiating G-protein signaling.
