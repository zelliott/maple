In the mammalian olfactory bulb, signal processing is mediated by synaptic interactions between dendrites. Glutamate released from mitral cell dendrites excites dendritic spines of granule cells, which in turn release GABA back onto the mitral cell dendrites, forming a reciprocal synaptic pair. This feedback synaptic circuit was shown to be mediated predominantly by NMDA receptors. We further utilized caged Ca2+ compounds to obtain insight into the mechanism that couples NMDA receptor activation to GABA release. Feedback inhibition elicited by photo-release of caged Ca2+ in mitral cell secondary dendrites persisted when voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were blocked by cadmium (Cd2+) and nickel (Ni2+). These results indicate that Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors can directly trigger presynaptic GABA release for local dendrodendritic feedback inhibition.
