Notch signaling plays a central role in cell-fate determination, and its role in lateral inhibition in angiogenic sprouting is well established. However, the role of Notch signaling in lymphangiogenesis, the growth of lymphatic vessels, is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate Notch pathway activity in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), as well as induction of delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) and Notch target genes on stimulation with VEGF or VEGF-C. Suppression of Notch signaling by a soluble form of Dll4 (Dll4-Fc) synergized with VEGF in inducing LEC sprouting in 3-dimensional (3D) fibrin gel assays. Expression of Dll4-Fc in adult mouse ears promoted lymphangiogenesis, which was augmented by coexpressing VEGF. Lymphangiogenesis triggered by Notch inhibition was suppressed by a monoclonal VEGFR-2 Ab as well as soluble VEGF and VEGF-C/VEGF-D ligand traps. LECs transduced with Dll4 preferentially adopted the tip cell position over nontransduced cells in 3D sprouting assays, suggesting an analogous role for Dll4/Notch in lymphatic and blood vessel sprouting. These results indicate that the Notch pathway controls lymphatic endothelial quiescence, and explain why LECs are poorly responsive to VEGF compared with VEGF-C. Understanding the role of the Notch pathway in lymphangiogenesis provides further insight for the therapeutic manipulation of the lymphatic vessels.
