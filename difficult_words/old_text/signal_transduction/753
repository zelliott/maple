Human-amniotic WISH cells express the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor, LPA(1), LPA(2) but not LPA(3). When WISH cells were stimulated with LPA, phospholipase D (PLD) activation was dramatically induced via a cytosolic calcium increase and protein kinase C activation. We also found that LPA stimulated two kinds of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 kinase via PLD-dependent signaling pathways in WISH cells. In terms of the LPA-mediated functional modulation of WISH cells, we observed that LPA stimulates the induction of two early genes (c-Jun and c-Fos) and cellular proliferation in WISH cells. We examined the signaling pathways involved in LPA-mediated cellular responses. LPA-induced early gene induction was completely blocked by normal butanol (n-butanol) but not by t-butanol, suggesting that PLD activity is essentially required for the process. PD98059 (2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone) but not SB203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole) also significantly blocked LPA-induced early gene induction, suggesting a crucial role for ERK. Pertussis toxin (PTX) did not affect on the LPA-induced early gene induction and ERK activation, ruling out the role of Gi/o protein(s) in the process. The cellular proliferation of WISH cells was also dramatically inhibited by n-butanol or PD98059. This study demonstrates the physiological role of LPA on the modulation of early gene induction and on WISH cell proliferation, and the crucial role played by PLD in the process.
