Midlife weight gain occurs in many species, suggesting that leptin signaling is impaired at middle age. To test this hypothesis, we measured changes in food intake and body composition in young (Y) and middle-aged (MA) C57BL/6 male mice infused subcutaneously with phosphate-buffered saline or leptin. Leptin-induced decreases in food intake and body fat were delayed in MA mice and associated with catabolism after longer treatment periods. Endogenous plasma leptin levels did not correlate with body fat in MA mice. Calorie restriction (CR) reduced body fat, plasma leptin, and insulin in MA mice to levels in Y mice but did not upregulate leptin sensitivity. CR mice did not respond to leptin doses that inhibited food intake in MA mice and reduced food intake and body fat in Y mice significantly below levels in CR mice. Plasma corticosterone was significantly higher in leptin-treated CR vs. MA mice. We conclude that MA C57BL/6 mice exhibit impaired leptin signaling and that CR, possibly by elevating glucocorticoids, impairs appetite control without improving the metabolic actions of leptin.
