The effects of aging were studied on both early and late [subsequent to activation of protein kinase C (PKC)] events of signal transduction in mouse T cell subsets. Aged C57Bl/6 mice showed significant suppression of Con A-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in both CD4+ and CD8+T cells compared to young mice. When early signaling was bypassed by stimulating cells with the combination of a calcium ionophore and a phorbol ester. [3H]thymidine incorporation was comparable between young and aged mice while Con A-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake remained depressed in aged mice. These results suggest that impairment of early (but not late) events may be responsible for the suppression of T cell proliferation in aged animals. Further, aged mice exhibited a significant increase in spontaneous proliferation resulting in a robust reduction of the stimulation index of both Con A and PMA/A23187-induced proliferation. Similarly, aged mice exhibited a significant increase in spontaneous IL-2R expression in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. No differences in IL-2 secretion were found between young and aged mice. The change in IL-2R expression was positively correlated with increased spontaneous proliferation. Overall these results suggest that: 1) impaired early (pre-PKC) rather than later (post-PKC) events of signaling may be responsible for poor proliferation of T cells, and 2) endogenous activation of cells related to increased level of IL-2R expression may play an important role in aging-associated immunosuppression.
