Nitric oxide (NO) induces apoptotic cell death in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. To elucidate the inhibitory effects of protein kinase C (PKC) on NO-induced apoptosis, we generated clones of RAW 264.7 cells that overexpress one of the PKC isoforms and explored the possible interactions between PKC and three structurally related mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in NO actions. Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO-generating agent, activated both c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and p38 kinase, but did not activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1 and ERK-2. In addition, SNP-induced apoptosis was slightly blocked by the selective p38 kinase inhibitor (SB203580) but not by the MAP/ERK1 kinase inhibitor (PD098059). PKC transfectants (PKC-beta II, -delta, and -eta) showed substantial protection from cell death induced by the exposure to NO donors such as SNP and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). In contrast, in RAW 264.7 parent or in empty vector-transformed cells, these NO donors induced internucleosomal DNA cleavage. Moreover, overexpression of PKC isoforms significantly suppressed SNP-induced JNK/SAPK and p38 kinase activation, but did not affect ERK-1 and -2. We also explored the involvement of CPP32-like protease in the NO-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of CPP32-like protease prevented apoptosis in RAW 264.7 parent cells. In addition, SNP dramatically activated CPP32 in the parent or in empty vector-transformed cells, while slightly activated CPP32 in PKC transfectants. Therefore, we conclude that PKC protects NO-induced apoptotic cell death, presumably nullifying the NO-mediated activation of JNK/SAPK, p38 kinase, and CPP32-like protease in RAW 264.7 macrophages.
