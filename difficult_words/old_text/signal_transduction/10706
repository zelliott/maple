Prolactin (PRL) induces cell proliferation and cell differentiation through the well-known mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways, depending on the cell line. MAPKs play a central role in signaling transduction mechanisms that transmit mitogenic or differentiation signals from an activated receptor to the intracellular machinery. All of the cytokine receptors that activate the JAK/STAT pathway also activate the MAPK pathway. The aim of the present study was to delineate the signal pathways implicated in IL-8 release by THP-1 cells, pretreated with PRL, after stimulation with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or porins from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. PRL activates the JAK2/STAT1-3 signaling pathway, while LPS or porins from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium does not induce any phosphorylation of this pathway. However, in THP-1 cells, the combination of PRL followed by either S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LPS or porins produced a greater MEK1-MEK2/MAPKs activation response than treatment with PRL alone. Similarly, PRL pretreatment of THP-1 cells resulted in an increase in IL-8 release in response to stimulation with either LPS or porins. This additive effect on IL-8 release was reduced when the cells were also treated with PD-098059, a selective inhibitor of the MEK1 activator and the MAPK cascade, or SB203580, a specific inhibitor of the p38 pathway, or AG490, a specific JAK/STAT pathway inhibitor, providing evidence that there are different signal pathways activated which have a cumulative effect.
