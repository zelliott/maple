Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) regulates diverse physiological responses by binding to its specific guanylyl cyclase-A receptor (Npra) which synthesizes the intracellular second messenger cGMP. To understand the molecular mechanisms of cellular signaling of ANP, we have studied its effect on the enzymatic activity of overexpressed protein kinase C (PKC) in murine Leydig tumor (MA-10) cells which were transfected with PKC-alpha cDNA. Treatments with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), angiotensin II (ANG II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) stimulated the PKC activity by 4-5-fold in PKC-alpha cDNA transfected MA-10 cells. The pretreatment of PKC-alpha transfected cells with ANP significantly inhibited the TPA-, ANG II- and ET-1-stimulated PKC activity. The agonist-stimulated PKC activity was also inhibited in the presence of 8-bromo-cGMP, however, cAMP had no effect on stimulatory PKC activity. The exposure of cells to Npra- antagonist A71915, which blocks the production of cGMP, significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of ANP on agonist-stimulated PKC activity and accumulation of intracellular cGMP in MA-10 cells. Similarly, inhibition of cGMP-dependent protein kinase by KT5823, restored the stimulatory levels of PKC activity in the presence of ANP. These results provide direct evidence that ANP antagonizes the agonist-stimulated PKC activity in MA-10 cells, involving the specific receptor Npra, its second messenger cGMP and cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Together, these findings implicate that ANP may act as a negative mediator of 'cross-talk' between PKC-alpha and Npra signaling pathway in MA-10 cells.
