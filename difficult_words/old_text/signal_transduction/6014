Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor suppressor gene syndrome affecting about 1 in 6000 to 10000 individuals. The genes, TSC1, encoding hamartin, and TSC2, encoding tuberin are responsible for TSC. Since their identification 1997 and 1993 respectively, a variety of different functions have been described for the TSC gene products. Hamartin and tuberin form a complex, providing a tentative explanation for the similar disease phenotype in TSC patients with mutations in either of these genes. In addition, associations of hamartin or tuberin with several different proteins have been demonstrated. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on hamartin- and tuberin-interacting proteins and discuss their role for the understanding of the functions of the TSC gene products.
