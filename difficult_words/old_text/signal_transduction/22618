T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement results in the activation of Src family (Lck and Fyn) and ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinases, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular substrates including the complex adapter protein c-Cbl. Moreover, Cbl is tyrosine phosphorylated upon engagement of growth factor receptors, cytokine receptors, and immunoreceptors and functions as a negative regulator of tyrosine kinase signalling pathways. Cbl associates via its phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain to the ZAP-70 pY292 negative regulatory phosphotyrosine. We recently demonstrated that the oncogenic Cbl mutant, 70Z Cbl, requires its PTB domain to upregulate NFAT in unstimulated Jurkat T cells. Here, we demonstrate that kinase-dead but not wild-type forms of Fyn, Lck, and ZAP-70 block 70Z Cbl-mediated NFAT activation. Moreover, 70Z Cbl does not upregulate NFAT in the ZAP-70-deficient P116 Jurkat T-cell line. The requirement for Fyn, Lck, and ZAP-70 is not due to tyrosine phosphorylation of 70Z Cbl, as mutation of all tyrosines in, or deletion of, the C-terminal region of 70Z Cbl (amino acids 655 to 906) blocks 70Z Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation but enhances 70Z Cbl-mediated NFAT activation. Further, 70Z Cbl does not cooperate with ZAP-70 Y292F to upregulate NFAT, indicating that 70Z Cbl and ZAP-70 do not activate parallel signalling pathways. Finally, the upregulation of NFAT observed upon ZAP-70 overexpression is blocked by Cbl in a PTB domain-dependent manner. We conclude that oncogenic 70Z Cbl acts as a dominant negative to block the PTB domain-dependent negative regulatory role of endogenous Cbl on ZAP-70, leading to constitutive ZAP-70 signalling and activation of transcription factors.
