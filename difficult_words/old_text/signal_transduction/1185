The invasive potential is increased by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. We researched whether the signaling pathway activated by GDNF correlates with the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in human pancreatic cancer cell lines and whether the inhibition of NF-kappaB activity is associated with suppression of invasive potential.

Proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2) was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays (MTT assay). NF-kappaB activity was examined by dual luciferase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In addition, to investigate the invasive potential, an in vitro invasion assay was performed.

Proliferation of both cell lines was decreased by a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, in a dose-dependent manner, but proliferation of control and IkappaBalphaM vector-transfected BxPC-3 cells was similar. The invasion cell number and the NF-kappaB activity were increased by GDNF stimulation. However, in the presence of MG132 or IkappaBalphaM, which blocks the nuclear localization of NF-kappaB, both were significantly suppressed. Furthermore, reduced activity of both remained unchanged by GDNF stimulation.

These results indicate that GDNF promotes NF-kappaB activation and that the latter is involved in the invasive potential of human pancreatic cancer cells.
