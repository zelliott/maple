Innate immunity induces rapid responses to fight invading pathogens. To eliminate intracellular bacteria or viruses, innate cellular responses lead to the production of nuclear factor-ÎºB-dependent inflammatory cytokines, inflammasome activation, type I interferon synthesis, and/or eventually death of the infected cells. Autophagy emerged as another component of innate immunity, as it offers an immediate autonomous cell defense mechanism by degrading intracellular pathogens. In addition, autophagy participates in the regulation of immune and inflammatory cell responses. Instead of providing a comprehensive status of the art that has already been addressed elsewhere, we chose to highlight some recent issues brought up in the field.
