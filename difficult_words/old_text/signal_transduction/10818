Stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 constitute a novel family of fasciclin domain-containing hyaluronan receptor homologues recently described by us. Whereas stabilin-1 is expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells and in macrophages in vivo, stabilin-2 is absent from the latter. In the present study, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of stabilin-1 in primary human macrophages. Using flow cytometry, expression of stabilin-1 was demonstrated on the surface of interleukin-4/dexamethasone-stimulated macrophages (MPhi2). By immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we established that stabilin-1 is preferentially localized in early endosome antigen-1-positive early/sorting endosomes and in recycling endosomes identified by transferrin endocytosis. Association of stabilin-1 was infrequently seen with p62 lck ligand-positive late endosomes and with CD63-positive lysosomes but not in lysosome-associated membrane protein-1-positive lysosomes. Stabilin-1 was also found in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) but not in Golgi stack structures. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay revealed that the cytoplasmic tail of stabilin-1 but not stabilin-2 binds to recently discovered Golgi-localized, gamma-ear-containing, adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribosylation factor-binding (GGA) adaptors GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3 long, mediating traffic between Golgi and endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Stabilin-1 did not bind to GGA3 short, which lacks a part of the Vps27p/Hrs/STAM domain. Deletion of DDSLL and LL amino acid motifs resulted in decreased binding of stabilin-1 with GGAs. A small portion of stabilin-1 colocalized with GGA2 and GGA3 in the TGN in MPhi2. Treatment with brefeldin A resulted in accumulation of stabilin-1 in the TGN. Our results suggest that stabilin-1 is involved in the GGA-mediated sorting processes at the interface of the biosynthetic and endosomal pathways; similarly to other GGA-interacting proteins, stabilin-1 may thus function in endocytic and secretory processes of human macrophages.
