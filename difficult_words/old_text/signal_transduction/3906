Dopamine receptors belong to a large super-gene family of receptors which are linked to their signal transduction pathways through heterotrimeric G proteins. A variety of signalling events are known to be regulated by dopamine receptors including adenylate cyclase and phospholipase activities and various ion channels. Prior to the advent of molecular cloning technology, dopamine receptors were believed to belong to two subtypes, D1 and D2. This distinction was based on both pharmacological and functional criteria. We now know that at least five different dopamine receptors exist although they can still be described as to belonging within "D1" and "D2" subfamilies. The D1 subfamily consists of two receptors-the D1 and D5, whereas the D2, D3 and D4 receptors comprise the D2 subfamily. The cloning and molecular characteristics of these five receptors are described in this review.
