The effects of several antidepressants, amitriptyline, citalopram, desipramine, fluoxetine, maprotiline, mianserin, nialamide, nomifensine, tranylcypromine and viloxazine, on the accumulation of cyclic AMP and inositol monophosphates were studied in rat cerebral cortical slices. The two enzymatic systems were stimulated either by adrenergic agonists or by forskolin. Cyclic AMP and inositol monophosphates (IPs) formed were determined by a double label method. In vitro all drugs, except inhibitors of monoamine oxidase, nialamide and tranylcypromine, inhibited alpha 1-agonist-mediated production but did not modify the cyclic AMP accumulation. Otherwise, chronic desipramine but not citalopram administration decreased the accumulation of cyclic AMP (-39%) elicited by beta-adrenoceptor agonists; no change was observed in inositol phosphate metabolism after administration of these two drugs. These data support previous investigations showing a decrease in cyclic AMP production after chronic treatment with norepinephrine uptake blockers but do not confirm the hypothesis of a modification of alpha 1-adrenoceptor-stimulated inositol phosphate metabolism.
