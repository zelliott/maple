There is evidence of aberrations in the vitamin D-endocrine system in subjects with respiratory diseases. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in patients with respiratory diseases, and patients who receive vitamin D have significantly larger improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and maximal oxygen uptake. Studies have provided an opportunity to determine which proteins link vitamin D to respiratory pathology, including the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, vitamin D receptor, vitamin D-binding protein, chromosome P450, Toll-like receptors, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Vitamin D also exerts its effect on respiratory diseases through cell signaling mechanisms, including matrix metalloproteinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide synthase. In conclusion, vitamin D plays a significant role in respiratory diseases. The best form of vitamin D for use in the treatment of respiratory diseases is calcitriol because it is the active metabolite of vitamin D3 and modulates inflammatory cytokine expression. Further investigation of calcitriol in respiratory diseases is needed.
