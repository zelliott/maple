Protein phosphorylation is the most common post-translational modification and plays a role in all known pathways of signal transduction. Net phosphorylation is a result of the balance of activities of protein kinases and phosphatases. There is increasing evidence that the regulated removal of phosphate groups from proteins, catalyzed by protein phosphatases, is required for the downstream activation of other signalling proteins.
