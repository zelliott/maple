Much work has been done to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IL-13 has emerged as an important cytokine effective in ulcerative colitis (UC) and fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD). IL-13 is a T helper 2-type cytokine with pleiotropic effects, involved in parasite expulsion, asthma pathophysiology, natural history of cancer and other human pathologies. Great interest has therefore been developed in inhibiting its function as a therapeutic intervention in these diseases. The multifunctional properties of IL-13, with particular emphasis on its role in both CD and UC, as well as current developing pharmacologic agents inhibiting the IL-13 signaling pathway have been reviewed. Anti-IL-13 agents seem to be promising therapeutic strategies for the future management of IBD and other human diseases.
