To evaluate the effects of Fasudil on the production of proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglia cells.

The BV-2 cells cultured in vitro were divided into PBS control group, LPS stimulation group and LPS plus Fasudil group. The production of TNF-α and IL-1β was measured by ELISA. The release of NO was checked by Griess reagent assay. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 expressions were determined by flow cytometry.

The stimulation of LPS significantly increased the production of TNF-α, IL-1β and NO as well as TLR4 protein expression in BV-2 cells. Fasudil attenuated NO production, and reduced the release of TNF-α and IL-1β in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells. Interestingly, Fasudil also decreased TLR4 expression.

Fasudil can suppress the production of TNF-α, IL-1β and NO of microglia cells induced by LPS, which may be associated with the down-regulation of TLR4 pathway.
