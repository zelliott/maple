Cortactin, an actin filament-binding protein and target of multiple kinases, has emerged as a central element connecting signaling pathways with cytoskeleton restructuring. It is involved in a perplexingly diverse array of cellular processes, including cell motility, invasiveness, synaptogenesis, endocytosis, intercellular contact assembly, and host-pathogen interactions, where the common denominator appears to be a role in the coordination of membrane dynamics with cytoskeletal remodeling. Although in recent years our knowledge about cortactin has increased exponentially, the exact mechanisms underlying its fundamental roles remain to be defined.
