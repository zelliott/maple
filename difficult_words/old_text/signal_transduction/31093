Using subtractive hybridization technique in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing constitutively active SREBP2, we have identified a DnaJ/Hsp40 chaperone, DnaJA4, as a new SREBP-responsive gene. SREBP2 regulation was demonstrated by changes in DnaJA4 mRNA under conditions of altered sterol status that were strictly parallel to that of well-characterized SREBP targets (LDL receptor and HMG-CoA reductase). The role of SREBP2 was further established using adenoviral overexpression of a dominant negative SREBP2, which abolished cholesterol-regulated changes in DnaJA4 expression. To determine the functional significance of this regulation, DnaJA4 was overexpressed in COS cells, which induced a specific increase in the synthesis of cholesterol from acetate. We also observed that DnaJA4 overexpression increased the activity and the protein content of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme in this pathway. At the molecular level, DnaJA4 overexpression did not alter HMG-CoA reductase stability or mRNA levels, suggesting a co-translational effect of the chaperone. In the DnaJ/Hsp40 family, DnaJA4 uniquely exhibited SREBP-regulated expression, and also responded to heat shock. Through its responsiveness to SREBP, and its stimulatory effect on cholesterol synthesis, the DnaJA4 chaperone can be viewed as a new player in cholesterol synthesis. These data suggest a link between molecular chaperones, heat stress and cholesterol synthesis.
