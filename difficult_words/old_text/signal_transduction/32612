Traditionally, methods designed to impair translation through direct interactions with target messenger RNA (mRNA) have been designated as "antisense" strategies because of their reliance on the formation of reverse complementary (antisense) Watson-Crick base pairs between the targeting oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and the mRNA whose function is to be disrupted. Proof of putative "antisense effects," and other mechanistic studies, would be greatly facilitated by the ability to directly demonstrate hybridization between an antisense (AS) ODN and its mRNA target in vivo. In addition, evidence of AS activity by demonstrating reduced levels of RNA or protein or by showing cleaved target molecules would lend proof of the concept. In this article we discuss how AS ODN may be used to down-regulate target gene expression with an emphasis on those targets chosen for our investigations, and we summarize the methods employed for this type of study.
