Human sex hormone-binding globulin inhibits the effects of estradiol on proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells. We report here the effect of sex hormone-binding globulin on estradiol regulation of gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using a selected set of genes. Estradiol upregulates genes that are positive regulators of proliferation (e.g., bcl-2, c-fos, c-myc, cyclin D) or/and related to more aggressive form of breast cancer (e.g. BRCA-1, EGF-R) and downregulates two genes (c-jun and ERalpha). Sex hormone-binding globulin modulates only a selected group of estradiol-controlled genes (inhibiting upregulation of bcl-2, c-myc, EGF-R, PR, and downregulation of ERalpha), starting 48 hours after treatment. Our study demonstrates that in breast cancer cells, sex hormone-binding globulin is effective on few selected genes which are involved in cell growth and apoptosis or related to cell estrogen-dependence and that the protein regulation of estradiol effect is selected and specific. Sex hormone-binding globulin action in estrogen breast cancer cells is strongly associated to cell growth and estrogen-sensitivity.
