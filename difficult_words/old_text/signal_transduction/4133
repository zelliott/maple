Direct and modulate effects of platelet activating factor (PAF), its structural analogues and ATP on primary and second processes at peritoneal neutrophils and P388D1 cells activation has been studied. The effect of compounds was evaluated on changes in Ca2+ transport and generation of reactive oxygen species. It was shown, that the synthetic analogues of MS series interact with PAF receptor, mobilize Ca2+ from thapsigargin-dependent intracellular stores and inhibit Ca2+ response on PAF in both types of cells. Unlike PAF the analogues do not induce the formations of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils and inhibit the PMA-induced respiratory burst. The activation of pyrinoreceptor of P388D1 cells by exogenous ATP does not inhibit PAF induced Ca2+ rise in cytoplasm, though partly releases Ca2+ from the same store.
