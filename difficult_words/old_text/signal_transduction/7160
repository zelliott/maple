The modulation of cardiac growth by estrogen in healthy mice is not completely understood. The aim was to investigate the effects of estrogen on cardiac growth in healthy mice lacking either estrogen receptor (ER) α or β. Wild-type (WT), ERα knockout (ERKO) and ERβ knockout (BERKO) 2-month-old mice were ovariectomized and randomly assigned to groups receiving an estradiol (E2)-containing or soy-free (control, CON) diet (n=5-7/group). After three months of E2 administration, WT and BERKO mice had significantly lower body weight, higher relative uterus and heart weight than CON mice, while there was no major E2 effect in ERKO mice. Furthermore, there was a higher concentration of E2-responsive genes Igf1 and Myocd in WT and BERKO but not in ERKO mice. Together, these findings indicate that the estrogenic regulation of cardiac growth in healthy mice is primarily mediated through ERα and not ERβ.
