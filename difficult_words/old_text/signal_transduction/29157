Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a recognized pathogenic mediator in a number of chronic and acute inflammatory diseases. Antibodies targeting TNF have significantly improved therapy of chronic inflammatory diseases, in particular rheumatoid arthritis. Despite this success, anti-TNF treatment shows clinical efficacy only in part of the patients and is often transient, necessitating the development of alternative reagents to combat TNF action. We here describe humanization and functional properties of a TNFR1-specific, monovalent antibody fragment, designated IZI-06.1, which binds to the cysteine-rich domain 1 of TNFR1 with high affinity and competes ligand binding. IZI-06.1 serves as a receptor-selective inhibitor of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic TNF actions, revealed from complete blockage of TNFR1-dependent apoptosis and interleukin-6 induction in Kym 1 and HeLa cells, respectively, whereas TNFR2-mediated signals remained intact, evident from TNF and interleukin-2-mediated costimulation of interferon-gamma production in T cells. Accordingly, IZI-06.1 is a TNFR1-selective TNF antagonist and holds great promise to be developed into a clinically applicable therapeutic. IZI-06.1 could be a useful therapeutic alternative in all diseases already known to clinically respond to anti-TNF treatment and particularly in those diseases, where anti-TNF treatment has failed because of complete blockade of TNF action.
