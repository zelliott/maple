Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are involved in the negative regulation of cytokine-induced STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) factor signaling. We cloned genomic regions of SOCS1 and SOCS2 genes and mapped these genes to chromosome 16p12-p13.1 and chromosome 12q21.3-q23 regions, respectively, by cytogenetic and radiation hybrid mapping. In addition, we mapped SOCS2 by yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) pool screening to YAC contig WC 12.5 on chromosome 12 with an unambiguous hit to CHLC.ATA19H12 and WI-5940, which is 461.5 cR from the top of the map.
