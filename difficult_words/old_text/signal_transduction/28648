The interaction between phosphatidylserine and its receptor on phagocytic cells plays a critical role in the clearance of apoptotic bodies under normal physiological condition. A specific receptor for phosphatidylserine (PSR) has recently been identified by phage display and shown to mediate phosphatidylserine dependent phagocytosis. Here we show that the protein encoded by the PSR cDNA is localized in the nuclei through multiple nuclear localization signals. First, a fusion between PSR and GFP is localized in the nuclei of transfected cells, suggesting that PSR have intrinsic nuclear localization capability. Indeed, affinity-purified anti-PSR antibodies identified a 47 kDa protein species in cells transfected with untagged PSR and localized this protein in the nuclei by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. In NIH3T3 cells, which express endogenous PSR mRNA, a similar 47 kDa species was detected and localized in the nuclei. Finally, multiple nuclear localization signals were identified in PSR sequence, each capable of targeting GFP to the nuclei. Together, these results suggest that PSR may serve a dual role both on the cell surface and in the nuclei.
