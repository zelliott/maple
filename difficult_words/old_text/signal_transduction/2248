Stimulation of large (100 microns) human myeloid cells with immune complexes resulted in Ca2+ spiking. Both global and regional changes in the intracellular cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration were detected in response to immune complex stimulation. The regional changes were mediated by release of Ca2+ from stores, whereas global changes were mediated by Ca2+ influx. They occurred independently of each other, with release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores being separated from transmembrane influx of Ca2+. Bromophenacyl bromide, an 1-plastin binding agent, inhibited store release without preventing transmembrane influx of Ca2+. The large size of the myeloid cells used here allowed the visualisation of the spatial and temporal separation of store release from transmembrane influx of Ca2+, providing further evidence for the existence of independent Ca2+ store release and Ca2+ influx mechanisms in these cells.
