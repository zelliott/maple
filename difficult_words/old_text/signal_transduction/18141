The radiosensitizing effects of caffeine on two rat yolk sac tumor cell lines with a different p53 status were investigated. A reduction of radiation-induced G(2) arrest was caused by caffeine at a concentration of 2 mM in both cell lines. The reduction of survival was observed in a combination of radiation and 2 mM caffeine only in a lower radiation dose range, but not in a higher dose range in NMT-1 with a wild type p53. Radiosensitization of caffeine was recognized even in a higher dose range for cells with a mutant-type p53. Apoptosis, which was not prominent after irradiation alone or caffeine treatment alone, was induced by irradiation in combination with caffeine in cells with a mutant-type p53 through a p53-independent pathway.
