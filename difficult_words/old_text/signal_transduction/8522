Cell adhesion is regulated by a variety of Ca2+-regulated pathways that depend on Ca2+-binding proteins. One such protein is calreticulin, an ER-resident protein. Calreticulin signalling from within the ER can affect processes outside the ER, such as expression of several adhesion-related genes, most notably vinculin and fibronectin. In addition, changes in the expression level of calreticulin strongly affect tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, which is known to affect many adhesion-related functions. While calreticulin has been localized to cellular compartments other than the ER, it appears that only the ER-resident calreticulin affects focal-contact-dependent adhesion. In contrast, calreticulin residing outside the ER may be involved in contact disassembly and other adhesion phenomena. Here, we review the role of calreticulin in focal contact initiation, stabilization, and turnover. We propose that calreticulin may regulate cell-substratum adhesion by participating in an "ER-to-nucleus" signalling and in parallel "ER-to-cell surface" signalling based on posttranslational events.
