Association of gangliosides with specific proteins in the central nervous system was examined by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-ganglioside antibody. Protein kinase activity was detected in precipitates with monoclonal antibody to ganglioside GD3 (R24) from membranal fraction of rat brain. Using in vitro kinase assay, several phosphorylated proteins of 40, 53, 56, and 80 kDa were isolated by gel electrophoresis. Of these proteins, the proteins of 53 and 56 kDa (p53/56) were identified as two isoforms of Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn, based on co-migration during gel electrophoresis, comparative peptide mapping, and sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-Lyn antibody. The identification was confirmed using a cDNA expression system in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which express solely ganglioside GM3, the enzymatic substrate of GD3 synthase. In co-transfection with GD3 synthase and Lyn expression plasmids, R24 immunoprecipitated Lyn and anti-Lyn antibody immunoprecipitated GD3. R24 treatment of rat primary cerebellar cultures induced Lyn activation and rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates including mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, sucrose density gradient analysis showed that Lyn of cerebellum and CHO transfectants were detected in a low density light-scattering band, i.e. the caveolae membrane fraction. R24 immunoprecipitated caveolin from Triton X-100 extract of CHO transfectants. These observations suggest that GD3 may regulate Lyn in a caveolae-like domain on brain cell membranes.
