We evaluated the contribution of calcium-sensing receptor (CaR)-mediated G(i)-coupled signaling to TNF production in medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) cells. A selective G(i) inhibitor, pertussis toxin (PTX), but not the inactive B-oligomer binding subunit, abolished CaR-mediated increases in TNF production. The inhibitory effect of PTX was partially reversed by using an adenylate cyclase inhibitor. CaR-mediated TNF production also was partially reversed by a cAMP analog, 8-Br-cAMP. IP(1) accumulation was CaR dependent and blocked by PI-PLC; partial inhibition also was observed with PTX. CaR increased calcineurin (CaN) activity by approximately threefold, and PTX prevented CaR-mediated increases in CaN activity, an nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-cis reporter construct, and a TNF promoter construct. The interaction between G(i) and PKC was determined, as we previously showed that CaR-mediated TNF production was CaN and NFAT- mediated and G(q) dependent. CaR activation increased PKC activity by twofold, an effect abolished by transient transfection with a dominant negative CaR construct, R796W, or pretreatment with PTX. Inhibition with the pan-specific PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (20 nM) abolished CaR-mediated increases in activity of CaN, an NFAT reporter, and a TNF promoter construct. Collectively, the data suggest that G(i)-coupled signaling contributes to NFAT-mediated TNF production in a CaN- and PKC-dependent manner and may be part of a CaR mechanism to regulate mTAL function. Moreover, concurrent G(q) and G(i) signaling is required for CaR-mediated TNF production in mTAL cells via a CaN/NFAT pathway that is PKC dependent. Understanding CaR-mediated signaling pathways that regulate TNF production in the mTAL is crucial to defining novel mechanisms that regulate extracellular fluid volume and salt balance.
