Since the first reports of endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling in 2001, great advances have been made toward understanding the molecular basis and functions of the endocannabinoid system. Electrophysiological studies have revealed that the endocannabinoid system is functional at various types of synapses throughout the brain. Basic mechanisms have been clarified as to how endocannabinoids are produced and released from postsynaptic neurons and regulate neurotransmitter release through activating presynaptic cannabinoid CB(1) receptors, although there remain unsolved questions and some discrepancies. In addition to this major function, recent studies suggest diverse functions of endocannabinoids, including control of other endocannabinoid-independent forms of synaptic plasticity, regulation of neuronal excitability, stimulation of glia-neuron interaction, and induction of CB(1)R-independent plasticity. Using recently developed pharmacological and genetic tools, behavioral studies have elucidated the roles of the endocannabinoid system in various aspects of neural functions. In this review, we make a brief overview of molecular mechanisms underlying the endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic modulation and also summarize recent findings, which shed new light on a diversity of functional roles of endocannabinoids.
