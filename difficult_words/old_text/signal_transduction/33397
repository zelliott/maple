Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and serum, but not epidermal growth factor (EGF), stimulated sphingosine kinase activity in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and increased intracellular concentrations of sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP), a sphingolipid second messenger (Olivera, A., and Spiegel, S. (1993) Nature 365, 557-560). We report herein that DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine (DHS), a competitive inhibitor of sphingosine kinase that prevents PDGF-induced SPP formation, specifically inhibited the activation of two cyclin-dependent kinases (p34(cdc2) kinase and Cdk2 kinase) induced by PDGF, but not by EGF. SPP reversed the inhibitory effects of DHS on PDGF-stimulated cyclin-dependent kinases and DNA synthesis, demonstrating that the DHS effects were mediated via inhibition of sphingosine kinase. DHS also markedly reduced PDGF-stimulated but not EGF-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and DNA binding activity of activator protein-1. Examination of the early signaling events of PDGF action revealed that DHS did not affect PDGF-induced autophosphorylation of the growth factor receptor or phosphorylation of the SH2/SH3 adaptor protein Shc and its association with Grb2. This sphingosine kinase inhibitor did not abrogate activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by PDGF. In agreement, treatment with SPP had no effect on these responses but did, however, potently stimulate phosphorylation of Crk, another SH2/SH3 adaptor protein. Moreover, DHS inhibited PDGF-stimulated, but not EGF-stimulated, Crk phosphorylation. Thus, regulation of sphingosine kinase activity defines divergence in signal transduction pathways of PDGF and EGF receptors leading to mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.
