The mitogen-activated protein kinase appears to be regulated by another growth factor regulated kinase, the mitogen-activated protein kinase activator. In the past year, much progress has been made in purifying and characterizing the mitogen-activated protein kinase activator, in determining its primary structure, and in identifying another protein kinase that may function upstream to regulate its activity.
