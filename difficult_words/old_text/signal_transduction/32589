Osteoclasts, the multinucleated giant cells that resorb bone, develop from monocyte-macrophage lineage cells. Osteoblasts or bone marrow stromal cells have been suggested to be involved in osteoclastic bone resorption. The recent discovery of new members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-ligand family has elucidated the precise mechanism by which osteoblasts/stromal cells regulate osteoclast differentiation and function. Osteoblasts/stromal cells express a new member of the TNF-ligand family "osteoclast differentiation factor(ODF)/osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL)/TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE)/receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL)" as a membrane associated factor. Osteoclast precursors which possess RANK, a TNF receptor family member, recognize ODF/OPGL/TRANCE/RANKL through cell-to-cell interaction with osteoblasts/stromal cells, and differentiate into osteoclasts in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Mature osteoclasts also express RANK, and their bone-resorbingactivity is also induced by ODF/OPGL/TRANCE/RANKL which osteoblasts/stromal cells possess. Osteoprotegerin (OPG)/osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (OCIF)/TNF receptor-like molecule 1 (TR1) is a soluble decoy receptor for ODF/OPGL/TRANCE/RANKL. Activation of NF-kB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase through the RANK-mediated signaling system appears to be involved in differentiation and activation of osteoclasts.
