Although normal breast tissue and breast cancer estrogens are known to be elevated compared with plasma estrogen levels, the mechanism behind this phenomenon has been an issue of debate for 2 decades. If local estrogen aromatization were to be confirmed as the main estrogen source in breast cancer tissue, tissue-specific inhibition of estrogen production, avoiding systemic side effects, would become a potentially attractive option for breast cancer treatment and prevention. Based on recent results from our groups exploring tissue estrogens, together with estrogen-synthesizing and estrogen-regulated gene expression levels, we propose a new model to explain elevated breast tissue estrogen levels. Although local estrogen production may be important, the local contribution is overruled by rapid plasma-to-tissue equilibration, including active uptake of circulating estrogens or enhanced tissue binding. As for breast cancer tissue levels, elevated levels of estradiol may be explained to a large extent by estrogen receptor binding and local conversion of estrone into estradiol. This model indicates that effective suppression of benign and malignant tissue estrogens as a treatment for ER+ breast cancer requires systemic suppression and will not be markedly affected by local enzyme targeting.
