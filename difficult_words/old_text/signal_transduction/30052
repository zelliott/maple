RAV1 is a novel DNA-binding protein with two distinct DNA-binding domains unique in higher plants, but its role in plant growth and development remains unknown. Using cDNA array, we found that transcription of RAV1 is down-regulated by epibrassinolide (epiBL) in Arabidopsis suspension cells. RNA gel blot analysis revealed that epiBL-regulated RAV1 transcription involves neither protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation nor newly synthesized protein, and does not require the functional BRI1, suggesting that this regulation might be through a new BR signaling pathway. Overexpressing RAV1 in Arabidopsis results in a retardation of lateral root and rosette leaf development, and the underexpression causes an earlier flowering phenotype, implying that RAV1 may function as a negative regulatory component of growth and development.
