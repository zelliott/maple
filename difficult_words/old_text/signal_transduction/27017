In previous papers we started to investigate the possible relationship existing between cell proliferation and cell death. We reported that in rat thymocytes, undergoing cell proliferation upon stimulation with Concanavalin A or cell death following dexamethasone treatment, an induction of c-fos and c-jun occurs with different but partially overlapping kinetics (Grassilli et al., BBRC, 1992, 188, 1261-1266). To test the hypothesis that, in both processes, the early induction of these nuclear oncogenes is necessary to allow the induction of later-expressed genes regulated at the transcriptional level by AP-1 complex, AP-1 DNA-binding activity was investigated in the aforementioned model. Indeed, we found that AP-1 is activated not only in proliferating but also in apoptotic cells, with a kinetics in accord with our data about c-fos and c-jun mRNA accumulation in the same experimental model. Moreover, our findings suggest that an interaction between AP-1 and glucocorticoid receptor also occurs in our model of dexamethasone-mediated apoptosis.
