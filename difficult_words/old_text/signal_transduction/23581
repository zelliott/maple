Much of what is known about mammalian cell regulation has been achieved with the aid of transiently transfected cells. However, overexpression can violate balanced gene dosage, affecting protein folding, complex assembly and downstream regulation. To avoid these problems, genome engineering technologies now enable the generation of stable cell lines expressing modified proteins at (almost) native levels.
