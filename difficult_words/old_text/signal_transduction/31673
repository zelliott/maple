The available estimate of the energy expended for signaling in rat neocortex is refined to examine the separate contribution of spiking and synaptic activity as a function of average neuronal firing rate. By taking into account a phenomenological model of short-term synaptic plasticity, we show that the transition from low to high cortical activity is accompanied by a substantial increase in relative energy consumed by action potentials vs. synaptic potentials. This consideration might be important for a deeper understanding of how information is represented in the cortex and which metabolic pathways are upregulated to sustain cortical activity.
