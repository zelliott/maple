Monokaryotic mycelia of several wild-type strains of the homobasidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea form abundant numbers of oidia both in the light and dark due to the regulation of oidia production by the A and B mating type genes. Nevertheless, little is known about whether and how the mating type loci and light signal regulate the oidiation in C. cinerea. Herein, the experimental results demonstrated that the self-compatible homokaryon AmutBmut strain, the mycelia whose nuclei carry mutations in both the A and B loci, can produce only a few oidia in the dark, whereas the formation of numerous numbers of oidia is induced by the light. The semi-compatible homokaryon AmutB, but not ABmut, has the production and behavior of oidia formation similar to those of AmutBmut. These findings indicated that in AmutBmut strain the mutation at the A locus results in repression of oidiation in the dark and the blue light alleviates this effect, whereas the mutated B genes function has no effects. Since, the oidia production relies on both A and light signal, it is possible that A locus might be linked to the blue light receptor genes. The present results demonstrated for the first time that the secondary hyphal knot formation (skn1), fruiting body maturation (mat) and basidiospore formation (bad) genes which are essential in the C. cinerea fruiting pathway are not involved in the regulation of asexual sporulation. In addition, the positive light effect on oidiation could also occur in C. cinerea dikaryons.
