The recently cloned gene Nogo, whose alternative splice products correspond to the antigenic target of the central nervous system (CNS) regeneration enhancing monoclonal antibody IN-1, codes for membrane proteins enriched in brain, particularly in oligodendrocytes. The 66-amino acid extracellular domain of Nogo (Nogo-66) interacts with a high-affinity receptor (NgR), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein with multiple leucine-rich repeats. The amino terminal cytoplasmic domain of Nogo appears to have a general cellular growth inhibitory effect. Nogo-66, on the other hand, specifically retards neurite outgrowth and induces growth cone collapse, possibly through its interaction with NgR and as yet unidentified transmembrane coreceptors. Recent results also suggest that Nogo expression may induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Together, these proteins provide new molecular handles for the design of therapeutic interventions for CNS injuries and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as possible leads to anticancer strategies.
