There are now known to exist seven phosphoinositides all derived through various metabolic routes from the parent lipid phosphatidylinositol. With one additional metabolite, diacylglycerol, these represent a rich resource of bioactive lipids responsible for recruiting protein effectors and marking membrane compartments. The metabolic map of this pathway and the nature of the binding partner interactions are reviewed.
