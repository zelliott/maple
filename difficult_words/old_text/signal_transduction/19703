In eukaryotes, two-component regulatory systems have been demonstrated to regulate phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Here, we describe a method implementing preparation of a protein extract under denaturing conditions, followed by Western analysis using MAPK antibodies that can be used to observe the effects of components of two-component signaling pathways or other proteins on the phosphorylation status of MAPKs. The protein extraction method presented may also be used to concentrate cellular proteins for additional applications, such as metabolic labeling or analysis of other posttranslational modifications.
