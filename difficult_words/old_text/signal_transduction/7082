Patients with age related macular degeneration (AMD) will develop vision loss in the center of the visual field. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell apoptosis is an important contributor of AMD. In this study, we explored the pro-survival effect of α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) on oxidative stressed RPE cells. We found that α-MSH receptor melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) was functionally expressed in primary and transformed RPE cells. RPE cells were response to α-MSH stimulation. α-MSH activated Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Erk1/2 signalings in RPE cells, which were inhibited by MC1R siRNA knockdown. α-MSH protected RPE cells from hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)-induced apoptosis, an effect that was almost abolished when MC1R was depleted by siRNA. α-MSH-mediated S6K1 activation and pro-survival effect against H₂O₂ was inhibited by Akt inhibitors (perifosine, MK-2206 and LY294002). Further, mTOR inhibition by rapamycin, or by mTOR siRNA knockdown, diminished α-MSH's pro-survival effect in RPE cells. Thus, Akt and its downstream mTOR signaling mediates α-MSH-induced survival in RPE cells. In summary, we have identified a new α-MSH-MC1R physiologic pathway that reduces H₂O₂-induced RPE cell damage, and might minimize the risk of developing AMD.
