In monolayer culture, fibroblasts secrete all matrix metalloproteinases, including gelatinase A (72-kDa type IV collagenase), as inactive zymogens. Whereas limited proteolysis by plasmin or other matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can accomplish the extracellular activation of other proenzymes in this family, gelatinase A proenzyme is uniquely refractory to cleavage by such proteinases. Previously it has been shown that fibroblasts cultured in the presumably more physiologic culture milieu of a type I collagen lattice can be induced to secrete active gelatinase A. In monolayer culture, however, the plant lectin concanavalin A will induce gelatinase A activation. Here we show that in monolayer culture activation of gelatinase A by normal fibroblasts is also induced by the sodium ionophore monensin. The monensin response is dose-dependent, time-dependent, requires protein synthesis, and is specific to gelatinase A among the secreted matrix metalloproteinases. The activator appears to be associated with cell membranes and may be membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase 1(MT-MMP1). Both mRNA and immunodetectable protein of MT-MMP1 are increased with monensin treatment while message for the protein inhibitor of gelatinase A, TIMP-2, is unchanged. The monensin-induced signal transduction pathway leading to gelatinase activation in monolayer culture appears to be different from the integrin-mediated pathway operative in the collagen lattice system. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocks monensin activation of gelatinase A in monolayer culture. In contrast, genistein has no effect on proenzyme activation in the collagen lattice. Likewise, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin abrogates the monensin effect in monolayer culture and can be reversed by addition of exogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Neither indomethacin nor PGE2 affects activation of gelatinase A in the collagen lattice.
