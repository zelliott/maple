Atherosclerosis is the primary ischaemic vascular condition underlying a majority of cardiovascular disease related deaths. Endothelin-1 is a vasoactive peptide agent upregulated in atherosclerosis and in conjunction with its G protein-coupled receptors exerts diverse actions on all cells of the vasculature in particular vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). The effects of endothelin-1 include cell proliferation, migration and contraction, and the induction of extracellular matrix components and growth factors. VSMC as the major component of the neointima in atherosclerotic plaques accordingly play a key role in atherogenesis. In this review we examine classic and novel signalling pathways activated by endothelin-1 in VSMC (including phospholipase C, adenylate cyclase, Rho kinase, transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases, mitogen activated protein kinase cascades and beta-arrestin) and their likely impact on the development and progression of atherosclerosis.
