Insulin administration attenuates cardiac ischemia-reperfusion apoptosis via activation of Akt-mediated cell-survival signaling. As p70s6 kinase is a cognate Akt-mediated phosphorylation target we evaluated whether p70s6 kinase activation is a functional requirement in insulin-mediated cell survival program during post-ischemic reoxygenation. Human cardiac-derived girardi cells were subjected to 6h of simulated ischemia and 2h of reoxygenation+/-insulin treatment [0.3mU/ml]. Concurrently, cells were pre-treated with anti-sense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) corresponding to the initiation start-site of human p70s6 kinase mRNA. Sense ODN and scrambled ODN were used as controls. Cell viability was measured using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and propidium iodide (PI) exclusion. Insulin at reoxygenation enhanced cell viability with attenuated LDH release (>or=50% , p<0.001 vs. ischemic controls) and reduced PI uptake by >or=30% vs. ischemic controls. The protection afforded by insulin was abolished by anti-sense ODN targeting p70s6 kinase, but not by the sense or scrambled ODNs. In parallel, insulin administration at reoxygenation significantly increased p70s6 kinase levels and activity compared with controls. P70s6 kinase activity was abolished by pre-treatment with anti-sense ODNs. Collectively, these data demonstrate that p70s6 kinase activation is a functional target of Akt following insulin-activated cytoprotection during ischemia-reoxygenation-induced injury.
