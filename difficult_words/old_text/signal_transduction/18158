An imbalance between proliferation and apoptosis is an important causal factor for disorders involving abnormal cell accumulation. The role and mechanism of how G protein-coupled receptors are linked to apoptosis are poorly understood. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a 21-amino acid peptide that binds to G protein-coupled receptors with mitogenic and vasoconstricting activities, suppressed apoptosis of human prostatic smooth muscle cells induced by paclitaxel treatment or serum withdrawal. Serum withdrawal or paclitaxel (1-10 microM) treatment for 48 h resulted in DNA fragmentation, a characteristic of apoptosis. The addition of ET-1 attenuated DNA fragmentation. The attenuating effect of ET-1 on DNA fragmentation was not affected by wortmannin, bisindolylmaleimide I, tyrphostin AG490, or AG1478. However, PD98059, an inhibitor for the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase, induced apoptosis, potentiated the effect of serum withdrawal on inducing apoptosis, and blocked the antiapoptotic effect of ET-1. The ERK1/2 activity in these cells decreased rapidly after paclitaxel treatment or serum withdrawal, but was maintained at a 2-fold higher level in the presence of ET-1 for at least 4 h. These results suggest that the ERK1/2 pathway is activated by ET-1, and blocking this pathway abolishes the antiapoptotic effect of ET-1.
