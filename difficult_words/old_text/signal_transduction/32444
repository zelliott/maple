The structural and functional characterization of neural cell-cell adhesion molecules continues to progress at a rapid rate, exposing the complex nature of these large multidomain receptors and their intricate relationship with the cell. Over the past year, significant progress has been made in the description of multiple binding activities, signaling potentials, and cytoplasmic associations of cell-cell adhesion molecules. In addition, new modes for developmental regulation of adhesion molecule function have been identified.
