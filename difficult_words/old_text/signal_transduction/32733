Blood platelets have recently been shown to express PYK2, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the FAK gene family. In this study, we examined the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in PYK2-related responses in human platelets. While PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by thrombin was inhibited by preincubation of platelets with PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and Ro31-8220, PYK2 association with Src was markedly enhanced under the same conditions. Platelet intracellular Ca2+ mobilization induced by thrombin was hardly inhibited by these PKC inhibitors. p130Cas is a docking protein that associates with FAK or PYK2 through the SH3 domain. Although we identified p130Cas in platelets for the first time, this docking protein failed to interact with PYK2. These results suggest that PKC activation (but not Ca2+ mobilization) is involved in PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation and that PYK2 associates with Src without PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation or p130Cas involvement in platelets.
