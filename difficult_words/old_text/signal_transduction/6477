The molecular basis of the genetic vulnerability underlying the most common form of clinical tuberculosis (TB) remains largely unknown. We speculated that mild genetic defects in the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signalling pathway caused a subtle functional impairment of IFN-gamma which would explain susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical TB.

A case-control study.

We evaluated functional responsiveness to IFN-gamma in monocytes from patients with clinical TB (n = 10), and analysed the genetic sequences of the IFN-gamma receptor 1 (IFN-gammaR1) and STAT1 genes in patients with disseminated TB (n = 18). IFN-gamma stimulated an increase in the expression of HLA-DR and CD64 on monocytes of both controls and patients; the rate of increase in expression was the same in both groups. Treatment with IFN-gamma before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation further increased tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production as compared to TNF-alpha production with LPS stimulation alone; the rate of increase in TNF-alpha production was the same in both groups. The known mutations in the coding sequences of the IFN-gammaR1 and STAT1 genes were not found in the patients with disseminated tuberculosis.

These results suggest that impairment of the IFN-gamma signalling pathway did not account for cases of clinical TB in this study.
