With favorable regenerative and immunotolerant profiles, patient-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are increasingly considered in cell therapy. Derived from bone marrow (BM) and standardized with culture in fetal bovine serum (FBS), translation of hMSC-based approaches is impeded by protracted expansion times, risk of xenogenic response, and exposure to zoonoses. Here, human platelet lysate adherent to good manufacturing practices (GMP-hPL) provided a nonzoonotic adjuvant that enhanced the capacity of BM-hMSC to proliferate. The nurturing benefit of GMP-hPL was generalized to hMSC from adipose tissue evaluated as an alternative to bone marrow. Long-term culture in GMP-hPL maintained the multipotency of hMSC, while protecting against clonal chromosomal instability detected in the FBS milieu. Proteomic dissection identified TGF-Î², VEGF, PDGF, FGF, and EGF as highly ranked effectors of hPL activity, revealing a paradigm of healing that underlies platelet lysate adjuvancy. Thus, GMP-adherent human platelet lysate accelerates hMSC proliferation with no chromosomal aberrancy, through an innate repair paradigm.
