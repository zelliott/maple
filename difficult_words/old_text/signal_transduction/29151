Little is known about the glycosylation of the isotype switched B cell receptor (BCR) in multiple myeloma, and the way it might affect receptor function. In this work IgG BCRs isolated from the individual lysates of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of 32 patients with IgG multiple myeloma and healthy controls were investigated for the expression of sialic acid (SA), galactose (Gal) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), the sugars known to specify the glycoforms of human serum IgG. The degree of glycosylation and signaling status of all 32 isolated myeloma IgG BCRs were correlated and compared with the glycosylation of the IgG paraproteins isolated from sera of the same patients. It was shown that BCR IgG in myeloma is more heavily sialylated when compared with normal controls, that the increased sialylation of IgG BCR is associated with higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation (signaling activity) of the IgG BCR supramolecular complex and that BCR IgG and serum IgG paraprotein from the same patient differed in all cases in the levels of terminal sugar expression. The results suggest that the development of the malignant clone in MM from post-switch B cells expressing IgG BCR at their surfaces to plasma cells secreting IgG paraprotein may be followed by permanent glycosylation changes in the IgG molecules.
