Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a lipid mediator that has been implicated in a variety of keratinocyte functions. Keratinocytes express the specific receptor for PAF (PAF-R), a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor. Although PAF-R-dependent stimulation of numerous signal transduction pathways has been shown in a variety of cell types, to date there has been no analysis of PAF-R signal transduction in human epidermal cells. There is also contradictory evidence that PAF acts as either a suppressor or activator of keratinocyte proliferation. Using a model system created by retroviral-mediated transduction of the PAF-R into the PAF-R-negative epidermal cell line KB, we now demonstrate that the activation of the epidermal PAF-R results in the activation of both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38, but not the jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways. Additionally, we show that the activation of the PAF-R stimulates the replication of epidermal cells. The activation of the ERK signal transduction pathway, as well as the PAF-dependent increase in cell proliferation, was dependent on the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R). PAF-R-induced transactivation of the EGF-R was blocked by pharmacologic inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), and specific inhibitors of the EGF-R tyrosine kinase. Activation of p38 MAP kinase by the PAF-R was not dependent on EGF-R activation and represents a distinct pathway of PAF-R-mediated signal transduction. In summary, these studies provide a mechanism whereby the PAF-R can exert proliferative effects through the activation of the EGF-R.
