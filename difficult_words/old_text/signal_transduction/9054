Coiled-coil DIX1 (Ccd1) is a positive regulator that activates the canonical Wnt signalling pathway by inhibiting the degradation of the key signal transducer β-catenin. The C-terminal DIX domain of Ccd1 plays an important role in the regulation of signal transduction through homo-oligomerization and protein complex formation with other DIX domain-containing proteins, i.e. axin and dishevelled proteins. Here, the expression, purification, crystallization and X-ray data collection of the Ccd1 DIX domain are reported. The crystals of the Ccd1 DIX domain belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a=72.9, b=75.7, c=125.6 Å. An X-ray diffraction data set was collected at 3.0 Å resolution.
