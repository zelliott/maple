Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is an early signaling molecule that regulates cell growth and cell cycle entry. PI3K is activated immediately after growth factor receptor stimulation (at the G(0)/G(1) transition) and again in late G(1). The two ubiquitous PI3K isoforms (p110alpha and p110beta) are essential during embryonic development and are thought to control cell division. Nonetheless, it is presently unknown at which point each is activated during the cell cycle and whether or not they both control S-phase entry. We found that p110alpha was activated first in G(0)/G(1), followed by a minor p110beta activity peak. In late G(1), p110alpha activation preceded that of p110beta, which showed the maximum activity at this time. p110beta activation required Ras activity, whereas p110alpha was first activated by tyrosine kinases and then further induced by active Ras. Interference with p110alpha and -beta activity diminished the activation of downstream effectors with different kinetics, with a selective action of p110alpha in blocking early G(1) events. We show that inhibition of either p110alpha or p110beta reduced cell cycle entry. These results reveal that PI3Kalpha and -beta present distinct activation requirements and kinetics in G(1) phase, with a selective action of PI3Kalpha at the G(0)/G(1) phase transition. Nevertheless, PI3Kalpha and -beta both regulate S-phase entry.
