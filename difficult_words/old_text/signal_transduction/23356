Cells can respond to damage and stress by activating various repair and survival pathways. One of these responses can be induced by preconditioning the cells with sublethal stress to provoke a prosurvival response that will prevent damage and death, and which is known as hormesis. Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein recognized by its antioxidant and prosurvival functions, has been documented to play an important role during oxidative-conditioning hormesis. Using an oxidative-hormetic model, which was previously established in the L929 cell line by subjecting the cells to a mild oxidative stress of 50 μM H₂O₂ for 9 h, we identified two different transductional mechanisms that participate in the regulation of Bcl-2 expression during the hormetic response. These mechanisms converge in activating the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB. Interestingly, the noncanonical p50 subunit of the NF-κB family is apparently the subunit that participates during the oxidative-hormetic response.
