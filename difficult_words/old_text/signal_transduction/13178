Neurons in vivo are exposed to a variety of different growth factors and cytokines. A principal signalling pathway for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)-like cytokines is the Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) system of kinases and transcription factors. In the human cell line (SH-SY5Y), STAT1 and STAT3 activation by CNTF-like cytokines showed tyrosine phosphorylation peaking at 0.5 h and inactivating within 2 h. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak2 showed a similar time course of activation and inactivation in response to CNTF. The STAT1 response to the non-CNTF-like cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) did not inactivate. Inactivation to CNTF was not due to a decrease in CNTF receptor subunit gp130 or in levels of Jak1 or Jak2. STAT inactivation was inhibited by the protein kinase blocker H7 and a tyrosine phosphatase blocker, but not by inhibitors of protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase, mTOR-P70/S6 kinase or phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI-3 kinase). Surprisingly, CNTF caused only a minor increase in levels of suppressors of cytokine signalling, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3. CNTF pretreatment desensitized the cells to the CNTF-like cytokines, leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin-M but not to IFN-gamma. These results reveal a complex level of regulation of shared signalling pathways for cytokines that is dependent on both the type of cell and cytokine.
