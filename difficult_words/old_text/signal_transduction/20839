In vivo administration of superantigens leads to activation and subsequent depletion or anergy of T cells expressing defined V beta-T cell receptors (TCR). Superantigens have therefore become intensively studied tools for examining parameters of immunoregulation and they may represent model antigens for pathogenic agents. An HIV-encoded superantigen has for example been implicated in the dramatic loss of helper T cells in AIDS. We investigated the response of V beta 8+ T cells in mice after primary and secondary exposure to the superantigen Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B (SEB).
