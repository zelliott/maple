The balance between specific signals from different growth factors dictates the biological response of mammalian cells including cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. PC12 cells represent a model of choice to compare the signalling of differentiative growth factors, as NGF, and of mitogenic growth factors, as EGF. In these cells the prolonged activity of the ERK kinase dictates the decision of cells to differentiate. Here we focused on the cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 as an established regulator of the Ras-ERK cascade, to elucidate its involvement in determining the stimulation-dependent PC12 cell fate. To this end, we generated PC12 derived cell lines that express the interfering mutant of Shp2 under a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Our findings show that Shp2 participates to the opposite effects induced in PC12 cells by EGF and NGF and that the interactions with the multidocking Gab2 protein mediate such effects.
