Fanconi anemia (FA) is a fatal genetic disorder associated with pancytopenia and cancer. Cells lacking functional FA genes are hypersensitive to bifunctional alkylating agents, and are deficient in DNA double-strand break repair. Multiple genes with FA-causing mutations have been cloned, however, the molecular basis for FA remains obscure. The results presented herein indicate that a Rad50-dependent end-joining process is non-functional in diploid fibroblasts from FA patients. Introduction of anti-Rad50 antibody into normal fibroblasts sensitized them to DNA damaging agents, whereas this treatment had no effect on fibroblasts from FA patients. The DNA end-joining process deficient in FA cells also requires the Mre11, Nbs1 and DNA ligase IV proteins. These data reveal the existence of a previously uncharacterized Rad50-dependent DNA double-strand break repair pathway in mammalian somatic cells, and suggest that failure to activate this pathway is responsible, at least in part, for the defective DNA end-joining observed in FA cells.
