Most of the phospholipids in the nuclear envelope are contained in the double nuclear membrane, and this has an active lipid metabolism consistent with its origins as a component of the endoplasmic reticular system. However, even after removal of the nuclear membrane with detergents, some phospholipids, mostly of unknown location and function, remain. Amongst these are all of the components of what appears to be a nuclear polyphosphoinositide signalling system, distinct from the well-established inositide pathway found in the plasma membrane. The consequences for nuclear function of the activation of these two inositide pathways are discussed, with a detailed consideration of proposed intranuclear functions for protein kinase C, and the maintenance of nuclear Ca2+ homoeostasis.
