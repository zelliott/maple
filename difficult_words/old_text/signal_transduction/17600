In order to get an insight into the evolutionary aspect of metabolic pathways, especially of the ubiquitous glycolytic pathway, we have carried out an extensive search of sense-sense and sense-antisense similarities for enzyme proteins in the glycolytic pathway, the pentose phosphate cycle, alcohol and lactate fermentation pathways and the TCA cycle. This investigation of amino acid sequences reveals a curious pattern of similarity relations; no similarity can be found between the enzyme proteins in a section of the glycolytic pathway where the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate or even glycerol-3-phosphate is converted into the pyruvate while many examples of sense-sense and sense-antisense similarities are found even between enzyme proteins in distant blocks, e.g. between the proteins in the TCA cycle and those in the pentose phosphate cycle, as well as between the functionally associated proteins in each of these blocks. Complementary to this characteristic pattern of amino acid sequence similarity, the search for similarities of nucleotide sequences also finds that the similarities of glycolytic enzyme genes, some sense-sense and others sense-antisense similarities, are concentrated on the nucleotide sequences of prokaryotic 16S or eukaryotic 18S ribosomal RNA gene with its flanks, although some of the copy sequences are also found in transfer RNA genes as well as in 23S or 26S ribosomal RNA gene. These results strongly suggest that the metabolic pathways have been developed by the chance assembly of enzyme proteins generated from the sense and antisense strands of pre-existing genes, e.g. the fermentation pathways and pentose phosphate cycle by the proteins from the genes of enzymes in the glycolytic pathway and the TCA cycle from all these successively increased genes, ascribing the origin of metabolic enzyme genes to the close relation between the glycolytic enzyme protein genes and the RNA gene cluster.
