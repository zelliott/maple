Ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces severe alterations in the molecular and cellular components of normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells by disrupting many intracellular transduction cascades. Although UV responses have been well documented at the genome and proteome levels, UV protective effects have not been elucidated at these levels. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate that arctiin, a phytochemical isolated from the plant Arctium lappa, induced a protective effect against UVB radiation by changing microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles. Using flow cytometry, and water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1)-based cell viability, wound healing, and DNA repair assays we showed that pretreatment with arctiin prior to UVB irradiation reduced UVB-induced apoptosis, cell migration defects, and DNA damage in NHDF cells. It was also found that arctiinâ€‘induced UVB protection is associated with altered miRNA expression profiles. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the deregulated miRNAs were functionally involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and cancer signaling pathways. The results suggest that arctiin acts as a UVB protective agent by altering specific miRNA expression in NHDF cells.
