Gas6 (growth arrest-specific gene 6) is the last addition to the family of plasma vitamin K-dependent proteins. Gas6 was cloned and characterized in 1993 and found to be similar to the plasma anticoagulant protein S. Soon after it was recognized as a growth factor-like molecule, as it interacted with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of the TAM family; Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK. Since then, the role of Gas6, protein S, and the TAM receptors has been found to be important in inflammation, hemostasis, and cancer, making this system an interesting target in biomedicine. Gas6 employs a unique mechanism of action, interacting through its vitamin K-dependent Gla module with phosphatidylserine-containing membranes and through its carboxy-terminal LG domains with the TAM membrane receptors. The fact that these proteins are affected by anti-vitamin K therapy is discussed in detail.
