Protein ubiquitination is an important post-translational modification that regulates almost every aspect of cellular function and many cell signaling pathways in eukaryotes. Alterations of protein ubiquitination have been linked to many diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, immunological disorders and inflammatory diseases. To understand the roles of protein ubiquitination in these diseases and in cell signaling pathways, it is necessary to identify ubiquitinated proteins and their modification sites. However, owing to the nature of protein ubiquitination, it is challenging to identify the exact modification sites under physiological conditions. Recently, ubiquitin-remnant profiling, an immunoprecipitation approach, which uses monoclonal antibodies specifically to enrich for peptides derived from the ubiquitinated portion of proteins and mass spectrometry for their identification, was developed to determine ubiquitination events from cell lysates. This approach has now been widely applied to profile protein ubiquitination in several cellular contexts. In this review, we discuss mass-spectrometry-based methods for the identification of protein ubiquitination sites, analyze their advantages and disadvantages, and discuss their application for proteomic analysis of ubiquitination.
