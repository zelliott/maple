Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, plays an essential role in the maintenance of normal body weight and energy expenditure, as well as glucose homeostasis. Indeed, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are obese with profound hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and often hyperglycemia. Interestingly, low doses of exogenous leptin can reverse the hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in these animals without altering body weight. The hyperinsulinemia in ob/ob mice may result directly from the absence of leptin signaling in pancreatic Î²-cells and, in turn, contribute to both obesity and insulin resistance. Here, we acutely attenuated endogenous leptin signaling in normal mice with a polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated mouse leptin antagonist (PEG-MLA) to determine the contribution of leptin signaling in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. PEG-MLA was either injected or continuously administered via osmotic minipumps for several days, and various metabolic parameters were assessed. PEG-MLA-treated mice had increased fasting and glucose-stimulated plasma insulin levels, decreased whole-body insulin sensitivity, elevated hepatic glucose production, and impaired insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production. Moreover, PEG-MLA treatment resulted in increased food intake and increased respiratory quotient without significantly altering energy expenditure or body composition as assessed by the lean:lipid ratio. Our findings indicate that alterations in insulin sensitivity occur before changes in the lean:lipid ratio and energy expenditure during the acute disruption of endogenous leptin signaling.
