The effects of modifying membrane fatty acid composition on cell growth, phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC) activities, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secretion were investigated. Hormone responsive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were incubated in a serum-free medium containing epidermal growth factor and supplemented with physiologic concentrations (0.18-1.78 x 10(-5) M) of linoleic acid (LA) or conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Linoleic acid stimulated cancer cell growth, while CLA was inhibitory. Supplementation with LA or CLA altered cell membrane composition. Linoleic acid stimulated PLC activity with or without GTP gamma (S), and tended to increase membrane PKC activity. However, CLA supplementation did not modify membrane PLC or PKC activity. Prostaglandin E2 secretion was not influenced by LA or CLA. These data show that growth inhibition by CLA was not mediated through PLC-, PKC- or PGE2-dependent signal transduction pathways, suggesting that another inhibitory mechanism may be involved. Although biological differences appeared to be modest (5-20% of control), the fact that LA and CLA treatment resulted in significant biological effects at physiologic concentrations is relevant, since most human cancers require years to develop.
