ADP-ribosyl cyclase (ADPR cyclase) and ryanodine receptors (RyR) participate in calcium transduction in isolated afferent arterioles. We hypothesized that this signaling pathway is activated by ETA and ETB receptors in the renal vasculature to mediate vasoconstriction in vivo. To test this, we measured acute renal blood flow (RBF) responses to ET-1 in anesthetized rats and mice in the presence and absence of functional ADPR cyclase and/or RyR. Inhibitors of ADPR cyclase (nicotinamide) or RyR (ruthenium red) reduced RBF responses to ET-1 by 44% (P < 0.04 for both) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Mice lacking the predominant form of ADPR cyclase (CD38-/-) had RBF responses to ET-1 that were 47% weaker than those seen in wild-type mice (P = 0.01). Selective ETA receptor stimulation (ET-1+BQ788) produced decreases in RBF that were attenuated by 43 and 56% by nicotinamide or ruthenium red, respectively (P < 0.02 for both). ADPR cyclase or RyR inhibition also reduced vasoconstrictor effects of the ETB receptor agonist sarafotoxin 6c (S6c; 77 and 54%, respectively, P < 0.02 for both). ETB receptor stimulation by ET-1 + the ETA receptor antagonist BQ123 elicited responses that were attenuated by 59 and 60% by nicotinamide and ruthenium red, respectively (P < 0.01 for both). Nicotinamide attenuated RBF responses to S6c by 54% during inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis (P = 0.001). We conclude that in the renal microcirculation in vivo 1) ET-1-induced vasoconstriction is mediated by ADPR cyclase and RyR; 2) both ETA and ETB receptors activate this pathway; and 3) ADPR cyclase participates in ETB receptor signaling independently of NO.
