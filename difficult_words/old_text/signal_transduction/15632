Proteases control many vital aspects of humoral and cellular immune responses, including the maturation of cytokines and the killing of target cells. Recently, it has become evident that triggering of the T-cell receptor controls T-cell proliferation through proteases such as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) and Caspase-8 that act both as adapters and enzymes. Here, we discuss the role of these and other proteases that are relevant to the control of the T-cell response and represent interesting targets of therapeutic immunomodulation.
