One of alpha-RNP proteins (38 kDa alpha-protein) has been revealed as a target of the EGF receptor-associated protein kinase. A specific association of alpha-RNP complexes with the EGF receptor has been demonstrated. The involvement of alpha-RNP in the transduction of the EGF-induced signal has been suggested.
