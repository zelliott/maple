Transcriptional regulation plays a significant role in the biological response of bacteria to changing environmental conditions. Therefore, mapping transcriptional regulatory networks is an important step not only in understanding how bacteria sense and interpret their environment but also to identify the functions involved in biological responses to specific conditions. Recent experimental and computational developments have facilitated the characterization of regulatory networks on a genome-wide scale in model organisms. In addition, the multiplication of complete genome sequences has encouraged comparative analyses to detect conserved regulatory elements and infer regulatory networks in other less well-studied organisms. However, transcription regulation appears to evolve rapidly, thus, creating challenges for the transfer of knowledge to nonmodel organisms. Nevertheless, the mechanisms and constraints driving the evolution of regulatory networks have been the subjects of numerous analyses, and several models have been proposed. Overall, the contributions of mutations, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer are complex. Finally, the rapid evolution of regulatory networks plays a significant role in the remarkable capacity of bacteria to adapt to new or changing environments. Conversely, the characteristics of environmental niches determine the selective pressures and can shape the structure of regulatory network accordingly.
