The expression of alpha s, alpha i1 and alpha i2 G-protein subunits measured by immunoblot increased in the rat prostate during sexual maturation, supporting their involvement in proliferation/differentiation. Northern blotting gave transcripts of 1.8 and 4 kb for alpha s, 1.4 and 4.5 kb (mainly) for alpha i1, and 2.4 kb for alpha i2 with levels suggesting a differential regulation (at transcription or post-transcription for alpha s, transcription for alpha i1, and translation for alpha i2). The stimulatory effects of forskolin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and isoproterenol on adenylyl cyclase activity increased between 0.5-3 mo, remained constant up to 12 mo and decreased thereafter, conceivably following the expression of VIP and beta-adrenergic receptors. However, G-protein activation of adenylyl cyclase (by GTP and Gpp[NH]p) was maximal at 0.5 mo and then decreased as it occurred with toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribose incorporation to alpha subunits suggesting that other factors are also involved in the regulation of G-protein activity during rat prostatic development.
