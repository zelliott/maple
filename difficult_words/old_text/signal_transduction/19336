Longitudinal axons grow long distances along precise pathways to connect major CNS regions. However, during embryonic development, it remains largely undefined how the first longitudinal axons choose specific positions and grow along them. Here, we review recent evidence identifying a critical role for Slit/Robo signals to guide pioneer longitudinal axons in the embryonic brain stem. These studies indicate that Slit/Robo signals from the floor plate have dual functions: to repel longitudinal axons away from the ventral midline, and also to maintain straight longitudinal growth. These dual functions likely cooperate with other guidance cues to establish the major longitudinal tracts in the brain.
