There is little question but that bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) remain one of the most potent stimuli which can affect macrophage activation. Although the precise biochemical mechanisms responsible for this remain to be fully defined, there is now evidence accumulating from a number of laboratories that functional receptors for these bacterial products do exist and may contribute to the initial triggering event. Unfortunately, there is currently no consensus as to which of the candidate receptors identified to date serves as the primary binding target for LPS, and it is possible that the difference in macrophage cell types, LPS probes, and detection systems will all influence the nature of the binding. At the present time, therefore, macromolecules of 96-kDa, 95-kDa (adhesion beta chain), 80-kDa, 65-kDa, and 55-kDa may be considered as possible LPS targets. With the exception of the 96-kDa protein identified by Hampton and his co-workers, there exists some experimental evidence for a functional role for each of the molecules so far identified. It is apparent that the molecular cloning and sequencing and subsequent biochemical characterization of these LPS receptors will be required to determine unequivocally their role in LPS-mediated triggering events. Such information will be invaluable in sorting out the relevant biochemical second signals involved in macrophage activation. Although much new information has recently been accumulated on potential signaling pathways for LPS, the definitive events remain far from unequivocally established. In view of the obvious importance of LPS-macrophage interactions in the overall capacity of the mammalian host to respond appropriately to the potentially hostile prokaryotic environment, a precise delineation of LPS-mediated macrophage activation is critical to our understanding of this important inflammatory mediator cell.
