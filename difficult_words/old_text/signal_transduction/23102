Resistance against environmental stress is a crucial factor in determining the lifespan of organisms. A central role herein has been recently attributed to the transport and storage of lipids with the vitellogenin family emerging as a potential key factor. Here we show that the knockdown of one out of five functional vitellogenin genes, encoding apolipoprotein B homologues, results in a reduced survival of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans at 37 °C subsequent to infection with the bacterial pathogen Photorhabdus luminescens. An active steroid-signaling pathway, including supply of cholesterol by vitellogenins, steroid ligand formation by the cytochrome P450 dependent DAF-9, and activation of the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12, in the presence of pathogenic bacteria was associated with reduced nuclear translocation of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16 and increased antioxidative capacity. Taken together, the study provides functional evidence for a crucial role of vitellogenins and the steroid-signaling pathway in determination of resistance against bacteria.
