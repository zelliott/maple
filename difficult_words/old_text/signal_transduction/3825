Activation of cAMP signaling pathway was shown to inhibit some pathobiologic processes in mesangial cells (MC). We investigated whether adrenomedullin (ADM), a potent agonist of adenylate cyclase, is synthesized in MC and whether it can, via cAMP, suppress the generation of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) and proliferation of cells in glomeruli. With the use of an immunohistologic technique ADM was detected in mesangial and microvascular areas of rat glomeruli. MC grown in primary culture synthesized ADM, and the synthesis was stimulated by TNF alpha and IL-1 beta but not by PDGF and EGF. ADM inhibited ROM generation in MC dose-dependently and caused in situ activation of protein kinase A (PKA). In macrophages (cell line J774) ROM generation was about four times higher than in MC and was inhibited by ADM in a similar way as in MC. The rate of MC proliferation, measured by [3H]-incorporation, and the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) stimulated by PDGF and EGF were dose-dependently inhibited by ADM; the maximum inhibition (at 10 nM ADM) was about -80%. Mitogenesis of MC and MAPK activity when stimulated to a similar extent by endothelin (ET-1) was inhibited by ADM to a significantly (P < 0.01) lesser degree (-30%). Further, ADM inhibited PDF-stimulated mitogenesis and activation of MAPK in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). The inhibition of PDGF-activated MAPK by ADM in VSMC was reversed by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H89. Taken together, results indicate the adrenomedullin (ADM) generated in mesangial cells (MC) can suppress, via activation of the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) generation in MC and infiltrating macrophages as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated mitogenesis in MC and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). We suggest that introglomerular ADM may serve as a cytoprotective autoacoid that suppresses pathobiologic processes evoked by immuno-inflammatory injury of glomeruli.
