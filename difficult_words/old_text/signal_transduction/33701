Endothelin-1 (1-31) [ET-1 (1-31)], a novel member of the ET family, comprises 31 amino acids and is derived from the selective hydrolysis of big ET-1 by chymase. Although ET-1 (1-31) reportedly exerts biological effects by direct or indirect [via its conversion to ET-1 (1-21)] mechanisms, it is unclear whether in diabetes the vascular effects of ET-1 (1-31) display gender differences. We investigated this question by exposing mesenteric artery rings to ET-1 (1-31), using arteries from mice in the early or chronic phase of diabetes. In the early stage of diabetes, the ET-1 (1-31)-induced contraction was similar between age- and sex-matched control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. In the chronic stage of diabetes, the ET-1 (1-31)-induced contraction was enhanced in diabetic female mice, but not in diabetic male mice (vs. both age-matched control and early-stage diabetic mice). This enhancement was largely prevented by Y27632 (Rho kinase inhibitor), PD98059 [inhibitor of extracellular signal related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)], or SP600125 [C-jun terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor]. These data indicate that the ET-1 (1-31)-induced vasoconstriction in the mesenteric artery may be specifically enhanced in established diabetic female mice, and that this enhancement may be due to alterations in the activities of Rho/Rho kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase.
