A gene expression time course in the juvenile mouse testis was established using cDNA microarrays derived from a variety of isolated testis cell types. In conjunction with the use of four germ cell-deficient mouse models, a stage and cell-type classification over nine time points has been obtained and analyzed for differential expression of genes. The expression profiles have been clustered into nine groups and subjected to detailed analysis of associated gene ontology. This has allowed the correlation of particular cellular processes and functions with different expression clusters. Focused analysis of transcripts involved in cell number regulation (apoptosis and proliferation) and their spatiotemporal expression patterns are presented. The findings indicate that for genes involved in both apoptosis and proliferation, several distinct pathways regulating these processes are active in somatic and germ cell lineages.
