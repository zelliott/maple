This review examines the functional role of phospholipase D in the neutrophil. Phospholipase D is emerging as an important component in the signal transduction pathways leading to granulocyte activation. Through the second messenger it produces, phosphatidic acid, phospholipase D plays an active role in the regulation of granulocyte NADPH oxidase activation and granular secretion. Many factors from both the cytosol and the membrane are necessary for maximal phospholipase D activation. This paper will focus on the regulation of phospholipase D by low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, tyrosine kinases, and protein kinase C.
