Mast cells are key effectors in inflammation and contain proteinases that are released on activation. This study investigates associations between extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2, nuclear factor (NF)-κB, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 in mast cells infected with Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites. T. gondii infection led to increased mast cell degranulation. Phosphorylated (p)-Erk1/2 and p-NF-κB were increased significantly in mast cells infected with T. gondii. Pretreatment with the Erk kinase inhibitor PD98059 significantly decreased the expression of p-Erk1/2, p-NF-κB, MMP-2 and MMP-9. Treatment with MG132, an indirect NF-κB inhibitor, effectively reduced p-IκBα, p-NF-κB, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Collectively, these data show that suppression of an Erk1/2/NF-κB signalling pathway caused a reduction in MMP-2 and -9 activities. Inhibiting this signalling pathway for MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression might offer a potential way to control early T. gondii infection. This pathway for the generation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 is important for mast cell secretion and the NF-κB/Erk1/2 signalling pathway may be key in MMP-2 and MMP-9 production in host defense against toxoplasmosis.
