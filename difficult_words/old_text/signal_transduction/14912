Cystic fibrosis lung disease is characterized by a self-propagating cycle of obstruction, infection, and inflammation. The inflammatory response, which accounts for the majority of the morbidity and mortality of the disease, begins early in life, becomes persistent, and is excessive relative to the bacterial burden. Therapies aimed at decreasing the inflammatory response represent a relatively new strategy for treatment. This article reviews the current state of the art of anti-inflammatory therapy in cystic fibrosis and introduces clinical trials that are underway.
