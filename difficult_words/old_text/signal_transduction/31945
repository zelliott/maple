Human reproduction is complex and prone to failure. Though causes of miscarriage remain unclear, adenosine, a proangiogenic nucleoside, may help determine pregnancy outcome. Although adenosine receptor (AR) expression has been characterized in euploid pregnancies, no information is available for aneuploidies, which, as prone to spontaneous abortion (SA), are a potential model for shedding light on the mechanism regulating this event. AR expression was investigated in 71 first-trimester chorionic villi (CV) samples and cultured mesenchymal cells (MC) from euploid and TR21 pregnancies, one of the most frequent autosomal aneuploidy, with a view to elucidating their potential role in the modulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO). Compared to euploid cells, reduced A(1) and A(2B) expression was revealed in TR21 CV and MCs. The non-selective adenosine agonist 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) increased NO, by activating, predominantly, A(1)AR and A(2A)AR through a molecular pathway involving hypoxia-inducible-factor-1 (HIF-1Î±), and increased VEGF, mainly through A(2B). In conclusion the adenosine transduction cascade appears to be disturbed in TR21 through reduced expression of A(2B) and A(1)ARs. These anomalies may be implicated in complications such as fetal growth restriction, malformation and/or SA, well known features of aneuploid pregnancies. Therefore A(1) and A(2B)ARs could be potential biomarkers able to provide an early indication of SA risk and their stimulation may turn out to improve fetoplacental perfusion by increasing NO and VEGF.
