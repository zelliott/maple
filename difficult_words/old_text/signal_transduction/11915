In this study, we examined whether granulosa cell autophagy during follicular development and atresia was regulated by the class I phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, which is known to control the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a major negative regulator of autophagy. Ovaries and granulosa cells were obtained using an established gonadotropin-primed immature rat model that induces follicular development and atresia. Autophagy was evaluated by measuring the expression level of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II) using western blots and immunohistochemistry. The activity of AKT and mTOR was also examined by observing the phosphorylation of AKT and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) respectively. After gonadotropin injection, LC3-II expression was suppressed and phosphorylation of AKT and S6K increased in rat granulosa cells. By contrast, gonadotropin withdrawal by metabolic clearance promoted LC3-II expression and decreased phosphorylation of AKT and S6K. In addition, in-vitro FSH treatment of rat granulosa cells also indicated inhibition of LC3-II expression accompanied by a marked increase in phosphorylation of AKT and S6K. Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation using AKT inhibitor VIII suppressed FSH-mediated phosphorylation of S6K, followed by an increase in LC3-II expression. Furthermore, co-treatment with FSH and AKT inhibitor increased the levels of apoptosis and cell death of granulosa cells compared with the single treatment with FSH. Taken together, our findings indicated that AKT-mediated activation of mTOR suppresses granulosa cell autophagy during follicular development and is involved in the regulation of apoptotic cell death.
