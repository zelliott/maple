The Alphaherpesvirinae are large DNA viruses and represent the largest subfamily of the Herpesviridae with closely related members of man and animal, including herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, pseudorabies virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, and many others. The viral envelope proteins of alphaherpesviruses are remarkably diverse and are incorporated in the ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane of infected cells. The cytoplasmic domain of many of these envelope proteins contain specific tyrosine-based amino acids. During recent years, accumulating evidence indicates that these tyrosine-based motifs serve different important functions during the virus life cycle, and are implicated in endocytosis processes, intracellular trafficking, basolateral and axonal sorting, and signal transduction events. The current minireview will discuss the functions associated with these tyrosine-based motifs in alphaherpesvirus envelope proteins.
