Signal transduction proteins that can integrate multiple upstream signals play a critical role in the complex regulatory circuits that control cellular behavior. The two signaling node proteins cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and the actin regulator neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein have qualitatively similar signaling properties. Recent studies, however, reveal that these proteins utilize distinct mechanisms of signal integration, leading to subtle but important quantitative differences in behavior.
