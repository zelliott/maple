Although the microbiota has been shown to drive production of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) from T helper 17 cells to promote cell proliferation and tumor growth in colorectal cancer, the molecular mechanisms for microbiota-mediated regulation of tumorigenesis are largely unknown. Here, we found that the innate-like cytokine IL-17C was upregulated in human colorectal cancers and in mouse intestinal tumor models. Alterations in the microbiota drove IL-17C upregulation specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) through Toll-like receptor (TLR)-MyD88-dependent signaling during intestinal tumorigenesis. Microbiota-driven IL-17C induced Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression in IECs in an autocrine manner to promote cell survival and tumorigenesis in both chemically induced and spontaneous intestinal tumor models. Thus, IL-17C promotes cancer development by increasing IEC survival, and the microbiota can mediate cancer pathogenesis through regulation of IL-17C.
