In the polychaete Platynereis dumerilii exactly four primordial germ cells (PGCs) arise in early development and are subject to a transient mitotic arrest until the animals enter gametogenesis. In order to unravel the mechanisms controlling the number of PGCs in Platynereis, we tested whether the steroid 17Î²-estradiol (E2) is able to induce PGC proliferation, as it had been described in other species. Our data provide strong support for such a mechanism, showing that E2 significantly increases the occurrence of larvae with supernumerary PGCs in Platynereis in a dose dependent manner. E2 responsiveness is restricted to early developmental stages, when the PGCs are specified. During these stages, embryos exhibit high expression levels of the estradiol receptor (ER). The ER transcript localizes to the yolk-free cytoplasm of unfertilized eggs and segregates into the micromeres during cleavage stages. Nuclear ER protein is found asymmetrically distributed between daughter cells. Neither transcript nor protein is detectable in PGCs at larval stages. Addition of the specific estradiol receptor inhibitor ICI-182,780 (ICI) abolishes the proliferative effect of E2, suggesting that it is mediated by ER signaling. Our study reports for the first time an ER mediated proliferative effect of E2 on PGCs in an invertebrate organism.
