The beta(2)-integrins on leukocytes can serve as a signaling unit during cell adhesion and locomotion, and to further clarify this important property we investigated the possible mechanisms of beta(2)-integrin-induced activation of PtdIns 3-kinase. It has previously been demonstrated that clustering of beta(2)-integrins activates p21(ras) by a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway, and here we show that active p21(ras) interacts with its downstream target, PtdIns 3-kinase. Engagement of beta(2)-integrins also activates the tyrosine kinases p58(c-fgr) and p59/61(hck) and causes them to associate with the p85 subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase. These findings suggest a mechanism whereby p58(c-fgr) and p59/61(hck) are directly involved in the activation of PtdIns 3-kinase. No coupling between p58(c-fgr) and p59/61(hck) could be detected; hence these kinases probably trigger independent but parallel signals to PtdIns 3-kinase. The effect of beta(2)-integrin clustering on PtdIns 3-kinase activity was monitored as the activation of protein kinase B (PKB). Stimulation of PKB by beta(2)-integrins was abolished by genistein and wortmannin but not by using methyl transferase inhibitors to abrogate the influence of p21(ras)-related proteins. Thus, even if PtdIns 3-kinase is not activated by p21(ras), it can maintain full enzyme activity due to the mentioned interaction with p58(c-fgr) or p59/61(hck). These tyrosine kinases apparently activate similar pathways that operate in parallel and therefore have the potential to substitute for each other in mediating adhesion and regulating cell locomotion.
