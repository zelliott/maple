Epithelial cell differentiation and morphogenesis are crucial in many aspects of metazoan development. Recent genetic studies in Drosophila have revealed that the conserved Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway regulates epithelial morphogenesis during the process of embryonic dorsal closure and participates in the control of planar polarity in several tissues. Importantly, these studies have linked the JNK pathway to the decapentaplegic and Frizzled pathways in these processes, suggesting a high degree of integrative signaling during epithelial morphogenesis.
