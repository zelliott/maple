Interactions and signaling between mesenchymal and epithelial cells are essential for morphogenesis, organogenesis, cell differentiation, and growth of cornea and eyelids during embryogenesis. These bidirectional interactions are mediated by complex regulatory networks that coordinate the proliferation, differentiation, and cell fate determination involved in tissue morphogenesis. All the signaling pathways involved are indispensable, but it is not clear whether each acts alone or whether they integrate to control events in various aspects of ocular surface development. This review discusses known signaling transduction pathways involved in the morphogenesis of the cornea and eyelids during embryonic development and homeostasis in adults, using genetically modified experimental animal models.
