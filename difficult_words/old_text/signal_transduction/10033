Aralar, the neuronal Ca(2+)-binding mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier, has Ca(2+) binding domains facing the extramitochondrial space and functions in the malate-aspartate NADH shuttle (MAS). Here we showed that MAS activity in brain mitochondria is stimulated by extramitochondrial Ca(2+) with an S(0.5) of 324 nM. By employing primary neuronal cultures from control and aralar-deficient mice and NAD(P)H imaging with two-photon excitation microscopy, we showed that lactate utilization involves a substantial transfer of NAD(P)H to mitochondria in control but not aralar-deficient neurons, in agreement with the lack of MAS activity associated with aralar deficiency. The increase in mitochondrial NAD(P)H was greatly potentiated by large [Ca(2+)](i) signals both in control and aralar-deficient neurons, showing that these large signals activate the Ca(2+) uniporter and mitochondrial dehydrogenases but not MAS activity. On the other hand, small [Ca(2+)](i) signals potentiate the increase in mitochondrial NAD(P)H only in control but not in aralar-deficient neurons. We concluded that neuronal MAS activity is selectively activated by small Ca(2+) signals that fall below the activation range of the Ca(2+) uniporter and plays an essential role in mitochondrial Ca(2+) signaling.
