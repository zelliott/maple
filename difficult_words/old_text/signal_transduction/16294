CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) have recently been the subject of intense research due to their strong immunosuppressive effect. Increasing evidence suggests that IL-15 plays an important role in Tregs biology. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which IL-15 performs this function remains to be fully elucidated. To address this question, we isolated Tregs from human peripheral blood, and utilized IL-15, dendritic cells (DCs), or DCs combined with IL-15, to examine the proliferation of Tregs and to explore related molecular mechanisms. Here, we show that IL-15 can induce the proliferation of Tregs in the presence of DCs. The induction is mediated by DCs presenting IL-15 in trans to Tregs. Simultaneously, DCs-derived IL-2, regulated by IL-15, may also play a supportive role. After IL-15 withdrawal, IL-15 trans-endosomal recycling in DCs contributes to the proliferation of Tregs. The activation of Akt, Erk1/2 and STAT(5), and the degradation of p27(kip1) may be involved in this process. These findings might explain the proliferation of Tregs in the absence of IL-2 in vivo and provide a novel method to achieve large-scale proliferation of Tregs in vitro in order to obtain cell numbers sufficient for immunotherapy.
