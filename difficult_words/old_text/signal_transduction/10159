The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) can selectively and dynamically recruit a number of proteins including p53 to form a sub-nuclear multiprotein chamber named PML-NBs. In DNA damage response, p53 is recruited into PML-NBs and modified by phosphorylations and acetylations, which in turn potentiate its transcriptional and pro-apoptotic activities. In contrast, in carcinoma cells, the role of PML in the irradiation induced p53-mediated apoptosis is not precisely understood. In this study, we have used the breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, and stably suppressed the expression of PML. Inhibition of PML expression had no detectable effect on the expression of endogenous p53 at the mRNA level; however, a significant decrease of p53 protein was observed. There was also an increase in the p53-MDM2 complexes, which may facilitate p53 protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, also in irradiation treated cells. The p53 transcriptional activity was attenuated both in unstressed and 10 Gy irradiation treated cells. Moreover, inhibition of PML expression in MCF-7 cells significantly reduced p53 downstream genes, cell cycle arrest gene p21(WAF/cip-1) and pro-apoptotic gene Bax expression, then irradiation-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that PML is a key regulator in the irradiation activated p53 apoptotic pathway in breast carcinoma cells.
