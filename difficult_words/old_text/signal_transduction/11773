Poly(A)+ RNA from the GH4C1 rat pituitary cell line elicited a thyrotropin releasing hormone response in Xenopus laevis oocytes which could be measured as a change in membrane current by the voltage-clamp method. Oocytes injected with Poly(A)+ RNA from GH12C1 cells which do not bind thyrotropin releasing hormone or with buffer solution alone did not show this response. Size fractionation of total poly(A)+ RNA by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation shows two response maximal representing various mRNA fractions larger than 18S. These results indicate the presence of thyrotropin releasing hormone receptor mRNA heterogeneity where the smallest mRNA is at least 2 kb.
