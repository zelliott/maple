This study was designed to determine whether theophylline would augment granulocyte apoptosis via a mechanism of adenosine A2A receptor antagonism. A selective adenosine A2 receptor agonist (CGS-21680, 1 microM) exhibited the most efficient potency for decreasing neutrophil apoptosis for 16 h from 63+/-5 to 19+/-4% (P < 0.001); it exerted poor and adverse effects on eosinophil survival. A selective protein kinase A inhibitor KT-5720 (10 microM) reversed the capacity of dibutyryl cAMP but not CGS-21680 to induce an inhibitory effect on neutrophil apoptosis, suggesting that occupancy of adenosine A2 receptors inhibit neutrophil apoptosis by a cAMP-independent mechanism. Theophylline derivatives show the following pattern of potency for inducing neutrophil apoptosis competing with CGS-21680: 8-phenyltheophylline = 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline > theophylline >> enprofylline. This pattern is consistent with the affinity established for A2A receptors. Theophylline demonstrated an additive effect to that of anti-Fas antibody (CH11, 1 microg/mL) in inducing neutrophil apoptosis, but not to that of adenosine deaminase or KF-17837 (a selective A2 receptor antagonist; 1 microM), suggesting conflicting effects on the receptor antagonism. These findings suggest that theophylline has an immunomodulatory action on neutrophil apoptosis via a mechanism of A2A antagonism.
