The NDR/LATS family of kinases is a subgroup of the AGC group of protein kinases and is conserved from lower eukaryotes to humans. Like other AGC kinases, NDR/LATS kinases require phosphorylation of conserved Ser/Thr residues for activation. On the one hand, binding of the coactivator MOB to NDR/LATS allows autophosphorylation. On the other hand, MST kinases directly phosphorylate NDR/LATS kinases. In addition to our understanding of the molecular activation mechanisms, recent studies have shown that LATS kinases play a central role in Hippo/SWH (Salvador/Warts/Hippo) tumor suppressor pathways, which coordinate cell proliferation and apoptosis by regulating proto-oncogenes, such as YAP and TAZ. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of Merlin/MST/SAV/MOB/LATS/NDR/YAP/TAZ networks (also termed mammalian Hippo signaling) and their roles in mammalian cellular transformation.
