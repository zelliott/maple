Many epithelial cells are polarized along the plane of the epithelium, a property termed planar cell polarity. The Drosophila wing and eye imaginal discs are the premier models of this process. Many proteins required for polarity establishment and its translation into cytoskeletal polarity were identified from studies of those tissues. More recently, several vertebrate tissues have been shown to exhibit planar cell polarity. Striking similarities and differences have been observed when different tissues exhibiting planar cell polarity are compared. Here we describe a new tissue exhibiting planar cell polarity - the denticles, hair-like projections of the Drosophila embryonic epidermis. We describe in real time the changes in the actin cytoskeleton that underlie denticle development, and compare this with the localization of microtubules, revealing new aspects of cytoskeletal dynamics that may have more general applicability. We present an initial characterization of the localization of several actin regulators during denticle development. We find that several core planar cell polarity proteins are asymmetrically localized during the process. Finally, we define roles for the canonical Wingless and Hedgehog pathways and for core planar cell polarity proteins in denticle polarity.
