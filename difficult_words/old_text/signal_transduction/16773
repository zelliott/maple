Replicative senescence and stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) cells are known to share certain traits. However, whether these cells are different at the protein level is unclear. Thus, this study has utilized proteomics to identify differences in the proteomes of replicative senescence and SIPS cells compared to normal cells. Replicative senescence was induced by serial passage of normal cells in culture. SIPS was established by exposure to H2 O2 at a subcytotoxic concentration of 20 Î¼M for two weeks. Following 2DE, protein profiles were compared and protein spots that changed in abundance were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was then performed to evaluate the transcript expression of selected altered proteins. A total of 24 and 10 proteins were found to have changed in abundance in replicative senescence and SIPS cells, respectively, when compared to young cells. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that nine genes showed the same direction of change as observed in the proteomics analysis. Very little overlap was observed between proteins that changed in replicative senescence and SIPS cells, suggesting that although both SIPS and replicative senescence cells share hallmarks of cellular senescence, they were different in terms of proteins that changed in abundance.
