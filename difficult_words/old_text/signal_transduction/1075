Genes encoding for receptors of the innate immune system are potential candidates for susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease, e.g., mutations in the cytosolic receptor NOD2/CARD15 were associated with Crohn's disease. Herein, two mutations of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 gene (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) resulting in impaired lipopolysaccharide signaling, the -159C/T promotor polymorphism of the CD14 gene, polymorphisms of the lipopolysaccharide binding protein gene and the bactericidal permeability increasing protein gene were evaluated in 102 patients with Crohn's disease, 98 patients with ulcerative colitis and 145 healthy controls. The allele and carrier frequencies for the Thr399Ile mutation in TLR4 gene were significantly increased in ulcerative colitis when compared to the controls (P = 0.014 and P = 0.018, respectively). None of the other five polymorphisms was associated with inflammatory bowel disease. In conclusion, a novel association between a functional polymorphism in TLR4 and ulcerative colitis is reported. This observation underscores the importance of impaired innate immunity in inflammatory bowel disease.
