Analysis of the Ah Receptor Signal Transduction Pathway (Michael S. Denison, Jane M. Rohers, S. Renee Rushing. Carol L. Jones, Selwyna C. Tetangico, and Sharon Heath-Pagliuso, University of California, Davis, California).The protocols in this unit will allow researchers to detect the Ah receptor and characterize its functional activities (i.e., ligand binding, transformation and DNA binding, and gene expression) in their biological test system and to use these methods to detect chemical and biochemical events that affect this signaling system.
