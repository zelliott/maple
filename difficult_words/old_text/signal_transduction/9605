There is a growing concern about the effects of chemicals on the developing nervous system. Chemical exposure at critical periods of development can be associated with effects ranging from subtle to profound on the structure and/or function of the nervous system. Understanding critical biological molecular targets, which underlie chemical-induced neurotoxicity, will provide a scientific basis for risk assessment. Cell signaling molecules such as protein kinase C (PKC) have been shown to play critical roles in motor activity, development of the nervous system, and in learning and memory. PKC also has been shown to be associated with several neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, status epilepticus, and cerebellar ataxia. In the literature, there is abundant information linking PKC to cognitive function, long-term potentiation, or brain structural changes. Here, we show the relationship between changes in PKC (as assayed using radioactive material or by western blots) and the neurotoxic effects caused by environmental chemicals in vitro and in vivo.
