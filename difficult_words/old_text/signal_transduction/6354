Mycoplasma bovis can cause arthritis or mastitis following pneumonia and mycoplasmemia in cattle. Interactions with pulmonary vascular endothelium have been recorded as localized vasculitis, perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrations, and accumulation of inflammatory cells in lesions. We compared adhesion mediators and cytokine gene expression as well as cytotoxicity of cultured primary bovine aortic and bovine pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (BPMEC) challenged with M. bovis. We also tested if abscess-forming ability of strains of M. bovis is associated with changes on endothelial cells. Increased VCAM-1 surface expression was found in both cell types, while only infected BPMEC increased MCP-1 transcription, both mediators specific for mononuclear cell transmigration. Given no induction of ICAM-1 mRNA in either cell type, induction of IL-8 mRNA by BPMEC suggested that neutrophil transmigration was signaled in microvascular areas. Infected BPMEC showed early induction of IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA. Excepting VCAM-1, differential strain effects were limited to BPMEC and not correlated with their abscess-forming capability. In addition, only strain DSA16 had minor cytotoxic effect on both cell types. We thus show that BPMEC are more susceptible than aortic cells to M. bovis-induced activation. Activation preferentially yielded signals for mononuclear cell transmigration, correlating well with in vivo observations of infiltrating cells at pulmonary sites.
