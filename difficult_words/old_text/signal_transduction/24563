Endothelins are produced in neuronal, pituitary and peripheral endocrine cells, and act through specific endothelin receptors (predominantly the ETA subtype) that are widely distributed in the neuroendocrine system. Endothelin receptors share a common signal transduction pathway with other Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptors, and endothelins induce IP3 and diacylglycerol production, and elevation of [Ca2+]i in many cell types, with kinetics similar to the cognate agonists. As reviewed here by Stanko StojilkoviÄ‡ and Kevin Catt, the physiological consequences of endothelin-mediated cell signalling are relevant to the control of several neuroendocrine and endocrine activities including neuropeptide release, pituitary hormone secretion, gonadal and placental function, fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and glycogenolysis.
