One of the fundamental questions in neural development is how neurons form synapses of the appropriate size for the efficient transfer of information across neural circuits. Here we investigated the mechanisms that bring about the size correlation between synapses and postsynaptic cells during development of Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). To do this, we made use of a unique system in which two neighboring muscles (M6 and M7) are innervated by the same neurons. In mature NMJs, synaptic size on M6 is normally larger than that on M7, in accordance with the difference in muscle volume; this ensures the same extent of contraction of both muscles, and we refer to this correspondence as "matching". We found that matching was apparent in larvae 8 h after hatching, but not in newly hatched larvae despite the difference in muscle volume. When sensory inputs were suppressed by the expression of tetanus toxin in sensory neurons, matching did not occur, although synapses were able to grow. Matching was also suppressed by the inhibition of motoneuronal activity. These results suggest that matching is induced by regulating the rate of synaptic growth on M6 and M7 in an experience- and activity-dependent manner. It seems most likely that retrograde signals from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell convey the information about muscle cell size. We thus examined whether a candidate of retrograde signaling in NMJs, BMP signaling, is involved in matching. However, there was no effect on matching in BMP type II receptor gene mutants, suggesting that other experience-driven mechanisms besides BMP signaling are involved in the proper development of synapses.
