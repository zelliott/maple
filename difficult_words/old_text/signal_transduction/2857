Members of the hedgehog gene family encode a novel class of secreted proteins and are expressed in embryonic cells known to possess important signalling activities in organisms as diverse as flies and chickens. Proteins of the hedgehog family act in these different developmental contexts as both permissive and instructive signals. How this signalling activity is transduced is (as yet) poorly understood, but recent studies point to the involvement of protein kinase A in both Drosophila and vertebrates.
