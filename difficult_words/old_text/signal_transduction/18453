In this study we analysed the effect of overexpressing novel protein kinase C delta isoform (n-PKC delta) on melanin synthesis and metastatic potential in the highly metastatic BL6 murine melanoma cells. The proliferative capacity in vitro and into matrigel in vivo were also examined. Although murine melanocytes express the n-PKC delta isoform, BL6 cells do not express this isoform at levels detectable by Western blot analysis. In untransfected and transfected cells we also studied the effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a modulator of specific isoforms of PKC, and of bryostatin 1, a potent immunomodulator and antineoplastic drug and a partial agonist of PKC. Our results demonstrate a pivotal role for this isoform in melanin synthesis and the close relationship between n-PKC delta expression and its association with the particulate fraction, melanogenesis and metastatic potential. In fact, heterogeneous BL6 cells overexpressing n-PKC delta and all the clones isolated showed increased intracellular melanin and metastatic capacity. TPA and bryostatin 1 decreased n-PKC delta expression, the intracellular melanin level and metastatic capacity in both cell lines. Therefore both treatments were able to abolish the effects of overexpressing n-PKC delta.
