In response to biotic and abiotic stresses, plants induce a complex array of pathways and protein phosphorylation cascades which generally lead to a response aimed at mitigating the particular insult. In many cases, H2O2 has been implicated as the signalling molecule, but, although progress has been made in assembling the downstream components of these signalling pathways, far less is known about the mechanism by which the signal is perceived. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Hardin et al. provide evidence for a plausible mechanism by which plants perceive H2O2. Evidence is presented for chemical oxidation of methionine residues by H2O2 at critical hydrophobic positions within the canonical motifs that define the phosphorylation sites of a number of enzymes, thus inhibiting binding of protein kinases. This process is reversible by MSR (methionine sulfoxide reductase) activity in vivo. Using synthetic peptides for a number of enzymes which are phosphorylated by families of protein kinases, including the CDPK (calcium-dependent protein kinase) and AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) families, coupled with in vivo studies of assimilatory plant nitrate reductase, the authors demonstrate that this mechanism regulates the ability of kinases to bind the target protein, directly linking oxidative signals to changes in protein phosphorylation. These results may have widespread implications for the perception of redox signalling in plants and animals.
