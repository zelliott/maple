Murine Prickle1 and Prickle2 belong to the planar cell polarity genes. Prickle2 but not Prickle1 gene expression was induced in C1300 neuroblastoma cells during neurite-like process formation induced by retinoic acid (RA). Over-expression of Prickle1 or Prickle2 in C1300 cells induced striking neurite-like process formation in the absence of RA. Since Prickle binds to Dishevelled (Dvl) to induce its degradation in Drosophila, we examined the participation of Dvl protein in the neurite-like process formation of C1300 cells. Upon induction of the neurite-like process formation, the amount of Dvl1 protein decreased. Prickle1 and Prickle2 could associate with Dvl1 and over-expression of Prickle1 or Prickle2 resulted in the reduction of Dvl1 protein in C1300 cells. Furthermore, over-expression of Dvl1 in C1300 cells prevented the neurite-like process formation induced by Prickle1 or Prickle2 over-expression. Thus, Prickle1 and Prickle2 promote neurite-like process formation of C1300 cells via the Dvl1 dependent mechanism.
