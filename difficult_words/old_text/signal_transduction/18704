The dysregulation of specific cellular functions in adipocytes, muscle cells, beta cells, and the liver leads to changes in systemic metabolic processes and ultimately to the pathophysiological manifestations that cause type 2 diabetes. The underlying cellular mechanisms are complex. The two meetings summarized here aimed to highlight the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of feeding and nutrient storage and on the molecular consequences of obesity in terms of promoting risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
