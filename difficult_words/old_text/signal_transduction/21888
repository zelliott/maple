Opiates have been shown to inhibit cell growth and trigger apoptosis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We have previously shown that morphine induces Fas expression and promotes Fas-mediated apoptosis. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which morphine modulates apoptosis in human Jurkat cells. Morphine-induced apoptosis was inhibited by transfection with a dominant negative Fas-associated death domain (FADD) plasmid, revealing that morphine-induced apoptosis is dependent on FADD. Furthermore, suppression of endogenous p53 expression by RNA interference technology considerably attenuated the morphine-induced apoptosis. In addition, morphine-induced apoptosis seems to be dependent on the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), as PI3K inhibition by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly enhanced morphine-induced apoptosis. Moreover, inhibition of Akt or nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) expression by RNA interference technology also dramatically increased morphine-induced apoptosis. Our study thus demonstrates that morphine induces Jurkat cell apoptosis through FADD/p53, anti-apoptotic PI3K/Akt and NF-kappaB pathways.
