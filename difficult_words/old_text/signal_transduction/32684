Melatonin is synthesized and secreted during the dark period of the light/dark cycle. The rhythmic nocturnal melatonin secretion is directly generated by the circadian clock, located within the suprachiasmatic nuclei in mammals and is entrained to a 24-hour period by the light-dark cycle. The periodic secretion of melatonin may be used as a circadian mediator to any system that can 'read' the message. Melatonin seems to act as an arm of the circadian clock, giving a time-related signal to a number of body functions; one of these, the circadian organization of the defense of the organism, is discussed in some detail as an example.
