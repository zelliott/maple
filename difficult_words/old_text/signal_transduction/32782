The CKI1-encoded choline kinase (ATP:choline phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.32) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was phosphorylated in vivo on multiple serine residues. Activation of protein kinase A activity in vivo resulted in a transient increase in the phosphorylation of choline kinase. This phosphorylation was accompanied by a stimulation in choline kinase activity. In vitro, protein kinase A phosphorylated choline kinase on a serine residue with a stoichiometry (0.44 mol of phosphate/mol of choline kinase) consistent with one phosphorylation site/choline kinase subunit. The major phosphopeptide derived from the enzyme phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase A was common to one of the major phosphopeptides derived from the enzyme phosphorylated in vivo. Protein kinase A activity was dose- and time-dependent and dependent on the concentrations of ATP (Km 2.1 microM) and choline kinase (Km 0.12 microM). Phosphorylation of choline kinase with protein kinase A resulted in a stimulation (1.9-fold) in choline kinase activity whereas alkaline phosphatase treatment of choline kinase resulted in a 60% decrease in choline kinase activity. The mechanism of the protein kinase A-mediated stimulation in choline kinase activity involved an increase in the apparent Vmax values with respect to ATP (2.6-fold) and choline (2.7-fold). Overall, the results reported here were consistent with the conclusion that choline kinase was regulated by protein kinase A phosphorylation.
