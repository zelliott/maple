Norepinephrine (NE) is involved in many cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure. We have recently reported that NE had a comitogenic effect in isolated cardiac fibroblasts, and that it activated p42/p44 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). This study was designed to characterize a possible mechanism involved in the proliferative effect of NE. Isolated rat cardiac fibroblasts were exposed to NE (10 microM) for up to 8 h, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression was measured by Ribonuclease Protection Assay and Western blotting. The activity of p42/p44MAPK was analyzed by Western blotting. Cell number was assessed by use of a Coulter Counter. IL-6/GAPDH mRNA was increased by NE in a time-dependent manner reaching 23 fold stimulation after 1 h compared to untreated samples. Immunoreactivity to IL-6 was not found in controls. After 16 h of exposure to NE, IL-6 protein was detected. It further increased up to 48 h. The effect of NE on IL-6 mRNA was abolished by the beta-adrenoceptor blockers propranolol, metoprolol (beta1) and ICI 118.551 (beta2), but not by the alpha-adrenoceptor blockers prazosin (alpha1) and yohimbine (alpha2). The MAPK-inhibitor PD98059 suppressed the NE-induced MAPK activation in a concentration-dependent fashion after 5 min, attenuated the NE-induced IL-6 expression after 2 h, and suppressed the proliferative effect of NE from 53 to 18% after 48 h. Recombinant IL-6 caused an increase in proliferation by 31% after 48 h. Simultaneous application of the IL-6 antibody reduced the NE-induced proliferation to 34%, and completely prevented the IL-6 induced effect. These results suggest that NE induces proliferation of rat cardiac fibroblasts in part by increasing the expression of IL-6 through regulation of MAPK.
