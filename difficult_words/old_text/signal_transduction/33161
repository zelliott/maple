The pathogenesis of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection is emerging as a paradigm for a multistage microorganism-host cell interaction. Both type IV fimbriae and a type III secretion apparatus play principal roles in interactions between the bacteria and host cells. Recent data suggest that bacteria-induced signal transduction activates the receptor that allows tenacious adherence of the bacteria to the host cell surface.
