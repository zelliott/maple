ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases are membrane-bound receptors that possess intrinsic, ligand-activated, tyrosine kinase activity. Binding of growth factors to these receptors induces the formation of ErbB homo- and heterodimers and initiates a signalling cascade that traverses the cytoplasm to communicate with the nucleus and the cytoskeleton. The effect of this cascade is the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration and adhesion. Although ErbB signalling is important for normal growth and development in the breast, a dysregulation of ErbB activity can lead to tumourigenesis. This review will focus on the role of ErbB signalling in both normal mammary gland development and breast cancer, with an emphasis on the mechanisms behind receptor activation and the therapeutic agents designed to inhibit ErbB activity.
