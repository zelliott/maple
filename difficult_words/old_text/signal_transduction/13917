The receptor tyrosine kinase MET is a prime target in clinical oncology due to its aberrant activation and involvement in the pathogenesis of a broad spectrum of malignancies. Similar to other targeted kinases, primary and secondary mutations seem to represent an important resistance mechanism to MET inhibitors. Here, we report the biologic activity of a novel MET inhibitor, EMD1214063, on cells that ectopically express the mutated MET variants M1268T, Y1248H, H1112Y, L1213V, H1112L, V1110I, V1206L, and V1238I. Our results show a dose-dependent decrease in MET autophosphorylation in response to EMD1214063 in five of the eight cell lines (IC50 2-43 nmol/L). Blockade of MET by EMD1214063 was accompanied by a reduced activation of downstream effectors in cells expressing EMD1214063-sensitive mutants. In all sensitive mutant-expressing lines, EMD1214063 altered cell-cycle distribution, primarily with an increase in G1 phase. EMD1214063 strongly influenced MET-driven biologic functions, such as cellular morphology, MET-dependent cell motility, and anchorage-independent growth. To assess the in vivo efficacy of EMD1214063, we used a xenograft tumor model in immunocompromised mice bearing NIH3T3 cells expressing sensitive and resistant MET-mutated variants. Animals were randomized for the treatment with EMD1214063 (50 mg/kg/d) or vehicle only. Remarkably, five days of EMD1214063 treatment resulted in a complete regression of the sensitive H1112L-derived tumors, whereas tumor growth remained unaffected in mice with L1213V tumors and in vehicle-treated animals. Collectively, the current data identifies EMD1214063 as a potent MET small-molecule inhibitor with selective activity towards mutated MET variants.
