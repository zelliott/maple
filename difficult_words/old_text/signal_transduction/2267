Cross-linking CD40 mediates B lymphocyte growth and differentiation and regulates cell death pathways by an unknown mechanism. Previous reports have suggested that protein tyrosine kinase activity is critical for CD40-mediated biologic responses. We show here that CD40 engagement on murine B cells results in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the STAT6 transcription factor and the transactivation of a reporter gene containing an IFN-regulatory factor-1 STAT-binding site. In earlier studies, surface Ig engagement was found to produce rapid activation of STAT6 accompanied by later induction of STAT1, which is not observed after CD40 ligation. Thus, these results define mitogenic receptor-specific induction of STAT proteins in B cells and identify a novel and direct signal transduction pathway from the cell surface to the nucleus activated in B cells stimulated through CD40 that regulates a gene previously shown to be involved in oncogenesis and programmed cell death.
