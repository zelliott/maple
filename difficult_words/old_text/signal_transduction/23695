Planar and apical-basal cellular polarization of epithelia and endothelia are crucial during morphogenesis. The establishment of these distinct polarity states and their transitions are regulated by signaling networks that include polarity complexes, Rho GTPases, and phosphoinositides. The spatiotemporal coordination of signaling by these molecules modulates cytoskeletal remodeling and vesicle trafficking to specify membrane domains, a prerequisite for the organization of tissues and organs. Here we present an overview of how activation of the WASp/Arp2/3 pathway of actin remodeling by Nck coordinates directional cell migration and speculate on its role as a signaling integrator in the coordination of cellular processes involved in endothelial cell polarity and vascular lumen formation.
