In this paper, we show that mutants in the gene stambhA (stmA), which encodes a putative phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate-diacylglycerol lipase, exhibit a significant reduction in the amplitudes of odor-evoked responses recorded from the antennal surface of adult Drosophila. This lends support to previously published findings that olfactory transduction in Drosophila requires a phospholipid intermediate. Mutations in stmA also affect the olfactory behavior response of larvae. Moreover, there is a requirement for G(q)alpha and phospholipase Cbeta function in larval olfaction. The results suggest that larval olfactory transduction, like that of the adult, utilizes a phospholipid second messenger, generated by the activation of G(q)alpha and Plcbeta21c, and modulated by the stmA gene product.
