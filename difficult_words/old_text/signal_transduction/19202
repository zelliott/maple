The canonical Wnt signaling is concurrently important for osteoblast differentiation and myeloma cell proliferation. Its activation in myeloma cells and its inhibition in osteoblasts and their progenitors have been identified in the previous studies. Osteoblast progenitors and myeloma cells from a myeloma patient share the same bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, but respond differently to DKK-1 secreted by myeloma cells. The mechanisms remain unclear.

Primary multiple myeloma (MM) cells were isolated from BM mononuclear cells of 12 MM patients. Human bone marrow stromal cells (SCs) were obtained from BM adherent cells of these MM patients and 10 healthy donors. The mRNA expression levels of DKK-1 binding receptor LRP5/6 and Kremen1/2 (Krm1/2) were analyzed by Real-time PCR in human myeloma cell line (HMCL) RPMI-8226, NCI-H929, U266, LP-1, CZ-1, KM-3, Sko-007, primary myeloma cells and SCs from 12 MM patients and SCs from 10 healthy donors. The binding capability of DKK-1 binding receptors to DKK-1 on primary myeloma cells and SCs was detected by flow cytometry assay.

The mRNA expression levels of DKK-1 binding receptor LRP5/6 and Krm1/2 in SCs from patients with MM were significantly higher than those in myeloma cells and in SCs from healthy donors. The binding capability to DKK-1of DKK-1 binding receptors on SCs from MM patients was obviously higher than those on myeloma cells and SCs from healthy donors by flow cytometry assay. Similar to the effects of coculture with rhDKK1, coculture of SCs from healthy donors with myeloma cells in the presence or absence of a Transwell insert did up-regulate SCs' mRNA levels of LRP5/6 and Krm1/2, and down-regulate their mRNA levels of Î²-catenin.

Compared with myeloma cells, the SCs from MM patients overexpress DKK-1 binding receptors LRP5/6 and Krm1/2 in response to DKK-1 secreted by myeloma cells, which results in intracellular Wnt signaling inhibition. Our study provides a novel insight into mechanisms of myeloma associated osteolytic lesions.
