Chronic overexpression of the oncogenic form of Ras is a potent inhibitor of skeletal myogenesis. However, the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the repressive actions of Ras on myogenic differentiation have yet to be identified. We examined the role of Raf-mediated signaling as a modulator of avian myogenesis. Raf overexpression elicited pronounced effects on both myoblasts and mature myocytes. Most notably, the embryonic chick myoblasts overexpressing a constitutively active form of Raf (RCAS-Raf CAAX or RCAS-Raf BXB) fail to form the large multinucleated myofibers characteristic of myogenic cultures. While residual myofibers were apparent in the RCAS-Raf BXB and RCAS-Raf CAAX infected cultures, these fibers had an atrophic phenotype. The altered morphology is not a result of reinitiation of the myonuclei cell cycle nor is it due to apoptosis. Furthermore, the mononucleated myoblasts misexpressing Raf BXB are differentiation-defective due to overt MAPK activity. Supplementation of the culture media with the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, caused a reversal of the phenotype and allowed the formation of multinucleated myofibers at levels comparable to controls. Our results indicate that the Raf/MEK/MAPK axis is intact in chick myoblasts and that persistent activation of this signaling cascade is inhibitory to myogenesis.
