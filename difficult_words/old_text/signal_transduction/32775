We have examined the role of Ras in integrin expression in ECV304 endothelial cells. Among the integrins examined in stable ECV304 transfectants expressing dominant active H-Ras (DAR-ECV), expression of alpha3beta1 integrin showed a prominent reduction in all the DAR-ECV clones when compared to the parental ECV304 cells. This implies that H-Ras negatively regulates the expression of alpha3beta1 integrin in ECV304 cells. When treated with inhibitors of the Ras downstream pathway (LY294002, PD98059, SB203580), the expression of alpha3beta1 integrin was up-regulated most significantly by LY294002, suggesting that among the downstream pathways of Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is a major determinant. With the application of blocking antibody to alpha3beta1 integrin (2 - 2 x 10(4) nM), migration of ECV304 cells was enhanced to maximal (18%) at 20 nM. These results suggest that migration of endothelial cells could be modulated by H-Ras via alteration of the expression levels of alpha3beta1 integrin.
