There is growing awareness that endocytic trafficking plays a critical role in cell-cell communication during animal development. We are beginning to understand how endocytosis can initiate, modulate or terminate signaling. In contrast, our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in secreting signaling peptides remains more limited, particularly when it comes to secretion at the apical surface in epithelial cells. In this study, we review the mechanisms that control secretion in Caenorhabditis elegans, focusing on the role of Patched family members and the V0 complex of the vacuolar-adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) in secreting Hedgehog-related peptides and of MIG-14/Wls and the retromer complex in secreting EGL-20/WNT.
