Calcium spikes established by IP(3) receptor-mediated Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are transmitted effectively to the mitochondria, utilizing local Ca(2+) interactions between closely associated subdomains of the ER and mitochondria. Since the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) has been thought to be freely permeable to Ca(2+), investigations have focused on IP(3)-driven Ca(2+) transport through the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Here we demonstrate that selective permeabilization of the OMM by tcBid, a proapoptotic protein, results in an increase in the magnitude of the IP(3)-induced mitochondrial [Ca(2+)] signal. This effect of tcBid was due to promotion of activation of Ca(2+) uptake sites in the IMM and, in turn, to facilitation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake. In contrast, tcBid failed to control the delivery of sustained and global Ca(2+) signals to the mitochondria. Thus, our data support a novel model that Ca(2+) permeability of the OMM at the ER- mitochondrial interface is an important determinant of local Ca(2+) signalling. Facilitation of Ca(2+) delivery to the mitochondria by tcBid may also support recruitment of mitochondria to the cell death machinery.
