HIF-1 is a key factor in cancer progression. Efforts are underway to identify and develop small molecules that inhibit HIF-1 transcriptional activity. What are the best targets and the best ways to develop HIF-1 inhibitors are open questions. However, several "nonselective" HIF-1 inhibitors have been identified, which are either in the clinic or under development. In this article, we discuss how topoisomerase I poisons, which inhibit HIF-1a protein accumulation and transcriptional activity, can be "rationally" used to target HIF-1 for cancer therapy.
