It has been systematized modern data on the preconditioning at a distance and a tolerance of a heart, a brain and other organs to ischemia-reperfusion injury. It has been performed an analysis of the published works on the role of autonomic nervous system and humoral factors in the development of resistance to pathogenic action of ischemia and reperfusion. It has been shown that adenosine, bradykinin, opioid peptides, calcitonin gene-related peptide and also signaling cascade involved nitric oxide, free radicals, protein kinases, mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ -channel, mitochondrial permeability transition pore play an important role in the mechanism of cardioprotective action of remote preconditioning.
