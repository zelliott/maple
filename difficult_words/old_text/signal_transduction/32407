Single cochlear spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) were isolated using enzymatic and mechanical techniques. Intracellular free calcium ion concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in the SGCs were measured using a digital imaging microscope and the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescence dye fura-2. In the presence of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (1 microM), there was an irreversible increase in [Ca2+]i. Depolarization by high K+ (150 mM) led to an increase in [Ca2+]i in SGCs, and this effect was reversible. The SGCs apparently possess voltage-gated calcium channels.
