Chemokines are now known to function as regulatory molecules in leukocyte maturation, in traffic and homing of lymphocytes, and in the development of lymphoid tissues. Besides these functions in the immune system, certain chemokine receptors also function as co-receptors for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) entry into CD4+ lymphocytes. CCR5 and CXCR4 are the major co-receptors for macrophage tropic and T-cell line tropic viral isolates, respectively. Here, we review recent studies on the relationship between chemokine receptors and HIV-1 infection. Elucidating the roles that chemokines and chemokine receptors play in the course of HIV-1 infection may substantially enhance our understanding on the HIV-1 pathogenesis, and perhaps help the discovery of drug candidates for therapeutic intervention of HIV infection.
