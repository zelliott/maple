Seedlings of a transgenic Arabidopsis line (ABO) that overexpresses phytochrome B (phyB) display enhanced deetiolation specifically in red light. To identify genetic loci necessary for phytochrome signal transduction in red light, we chemically mutagenized ABO seeds and screened M2 seedlings for revertants of the enhanced deetiolation response. One recessive, red light-specific extragenic revertant, designated red1, was isolated. The mutant phenotype was expressed in the original ABO background as well as in the nontransgenic Nossen (No-0) progenitor background. red1 is also deficient in several other aspects of red light-induced responses known to be mediated by phyB, such as inhibition of petiole elongation and the shade avoidance response. red1 was mapped to the bottom of chromosome 4 at a position distinct from all known photoreceptor loci. Together with complementation analysis, the data show that red1 is a novel photomorphogenic mutant. The evidence suggests that red1 represents a putative phytochrome signal transduction mutant potentially specific to the phyB pathway.
