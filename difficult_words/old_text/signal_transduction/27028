Cells in multicellular organisms coordinate their functions by signalling molecules serving as means of communication. Specific receptors enable transduction of chemical information from extracellular environment into a cell. Inside the cell the signal is multiplied and transduced further by intracellular signalling molecules and enzymatic cascades. Phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine, serine or threonine residues, guanosine triphosphate binding by special G proteins and regulation of DNA transcription seem to be the most important biochemical mechanisms of signal transduction. Products of cellular protooncogenes are involved in all levels of signal transduction, the detailed knowledge of signal pathways is therefore important for our understanding of pathophysiology of malignant disease and strategies for the therapeutic use of growth factors in oncology and haematology.
