We identified a chalcone, 2',4'-dihydroxy-6'-methoxy-3'-methylchalcone (stercurensin), as an active compound isolated from the leaves of Syzygium samarangense. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of stercurensin were examined using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and mice. To determine the effects of stercurensin in vitro, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression were analyzed by RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and its upstream signaling cascades were also investigated using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation. To verify the effects of stercurensin in vivo, the mRNA expression levels of iNOS and COX-2 were evaluated in isolated mouse peritoneal macrophages by quantitative real-time PCR, and the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1β were assessed in serum samples from mice using a Luminex system. Pretreatment with stercurensin reduced LPS-induced iNOS and COX-2 expression, thereby inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) production, respectively. In addition, an inhibitory effect of stercurensin on NF-κB activation was shown by the recovery of LPS-induced inhibitor of κB (I-κB) degradation after blocking the transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)/I-κB kinase signaling pathway. In mouse models, stercurensin negatively regulated NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines. These results demonstrate that stercurensin modulates NF-κB-dependent inflammatory pathways through the attenuation of TAK1-TAB1 complex formation. Our findings demonstrating the anti-inflammatory effects of stercurensin in vitro and in vivo will aid in understanding the pharmacology and mode of action of stercurensin.
