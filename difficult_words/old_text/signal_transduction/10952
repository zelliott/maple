Living cells rival computers in their ability to process external information and make complex behavioral decisions. Many of these decisions are made by networks of interacting signaling proteins. Ongoing structural, biochemical and cell-based studies have begun to reveal several common principles by which protein components are used to specifically transmit and process information. Recent engineering studies demonstrate that these relatively simple principles can be used to rewire signaling behavior in a process that mimics the evolution of new phenotypic responses.
