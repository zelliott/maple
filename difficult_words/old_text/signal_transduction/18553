Endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO), by increasing cGMP, is a major physiological regulator of vascular tone and of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) adhesion, chemotaxis, and proliferation. Thrombospondin-1 is a potent antagonist of NO/cGMP signaling in endothelial cells. Because endothelial and VSMC typically exhibit opposing responses to thrombospondin-1, we examined thrombospondin-1 effects on NO signaling in VSMC.

Effects of exogenous thrombospondin-1 on human VSMC adhesion, chemotaxis, proliferation, and cGMP signaling were examined. Endogenous thrombospondin-1 function was characterized by comparing NO signaling in VSMC from wild type and thrombospondin-1 null mice.

Picomolar concentrations of exogenous thrombospondin-1 prevented adhesive, chemotactic, and proliferative responses of human aortic VSMC stimulated by low dose NO. A recombinant CD36-binding domain of thrombospondin-1 or antibody ligation of CD36 similarly inhibited NO-stimulated VSMC responses. Thrombospondin-1 and CD36 ligation inhibited NO responses in VSMC by preventing cGMP accumulation. Thrombospondin-1 null VSMC responses to NO and cGMP signaling were enhanced relative to wild type murine VSMC.

In the presence of NO, thrombospondin-1 is converted from a weak stimulator to a potent inhibitor of VSMC responses. Both exogenous and endogenous thrombospondin-1 inhibit NO signaling in VSMC. This activity is mediated by the type 1 repeats and utilizes the same CD36-dependent cGMP signaling pathway in endothelial and VSMC.
