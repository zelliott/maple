The multifunctionality of plant annexins and their importance for coordinating development and responses to biotic and abiotic environment have been largely reviewed. We recently described a tobacco annexin, named Ntann12, which is mainly localized in the nucleus of root cells when the plant is grown under light conditions. We also found that auxin and polar auxin transport are essential for Ntann12 accumulation in root cells. Under dark condition, Ntann12 is no longer detected in the root system. In the present addendum, light, regulating auxin signaling, is evidenced as an essential determinant for the synchronization of growth and development between the shoot and the root during light/dark cycle. A speculative model for Ntann12 is described and discussed with regards to relevant literature data.
