Gibberellins (GA) are phytohormones controlling major aspects of plant lifecycle including seed germination, growth and flower development. GA signaling is also involved in resistance to adverse conditions, thus providing a mechanism for environmentally responsive growth regulation. We recently characterized the function of a core component of the GA signal transduction pathway: RGL3. RGL3 belongs to the DELLA family of negative GA response regulators. Jasmonate (JA) rapidly induces RGL3 expression, which in turn enhances the expression of JA-responsive genes by inhibiting the activity of key repressors of JA signaling, the JAZ proteins. JA and ethylene (ET) are well known to play synergistic roles in plant disease resistance. Accordingly, we showed that RGL3 regulates plant defense responses by modulating JA/ET-mediated defense signaling pathway.
