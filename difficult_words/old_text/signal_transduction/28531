In addition to replicative senescence, normal diploid fibroblasts undergo stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) in response to DNA damage caused by oxidative stress or ionizing radiation (IR). SIPS is not prevented by telomere elongation, indicating that, unlike replicative senescence, it is triggered by nonspecific genome-wide DNA damage rather than by telomere shortening. ATM, the product of the gene mutated in individuals with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), plays a central role in cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Whether ATM also mediates signaling that leads to SIPS was investigated with the use of normal and AT fibroblasts stably transfected with an expression vector for the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT). Expression of hTERT in AT fibroblasts resulted in telomere elongation and prevented premature replicative senescence, but it did not rescue the defect in G(1) checkpoint activation or the hypersensitivity of the cells to IR. Despite these remaining defects in the DNA damage response, hTERT-expressing AT fibroblasts exhibited characteristics of senescence on exposure to IR or H(2)O(2) in such a manner that triggers SIPS in normal fibroblasts. These characteristics included the adoption of an enlarged and flattened morphology, positive staining for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, termination of DNA synthesis, and accumulation of p53, p21(WAF1), and p16(INK4A). The phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), which mediates signaling that leads to senescence, was also detected in both IR- or H(2)O(2)-treated AT and normal fibroblasts expressing hTERT. These results suggest that the ATM-dependent signaling pathway triggered by DNA damage is dispensable for activation of p38 MAPK and SIPS in response to IR or oxidative stress.
