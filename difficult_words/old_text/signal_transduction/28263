Several recent breakthroughs have filled in key details of the brassinosteroid (BR) response. Identification of BAK1, a BRI1 interacting protein, the negative regulator BIN2, as well as direct targets of BIN2, BZR1 and BES1, provide a link between BR perception at the cell surface and regulation of gene expression in the nucleus. Global expression studies further defined the downstream events in this pathway, confirming the role of several factors acting in negative feedback regulation on BR levels. New links to the plant hormone, auxin, were also uncovered.
