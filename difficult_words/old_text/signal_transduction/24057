To establish infections, viruses use various strategies to suppress the host defense mechanism, such as interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral state. We found that cells infected with a wild strain of measles virus (MeV) displayed nearly complete suppression of IFN-alpha-induced antiviral state, but not IFN-gamma-induced state. This phenomenon is due to the suppression of IFN-alpha-inducible gene expression at a transcriptional level. In the IFN-alpha signal transduction pathway, Jak1 phosphorylation induced by IFN-alpha is dramatically suppressed in MeV-infected cells; however, phosphorylation induced by IFN-gamma is not. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies against type 1 IFN receptor chain 1 (INFAR1) and antibody against RACK1, which is reported to be a scaffold protein interacting with type I IFN receptor chain 2 and STAT1. These experiments indicated that IFNAR1 forms a complex containing the MeV-accessory proteins C and V, RACK1, and STAT1 in MeV-infected cells but not in uninfected cells. Composition of this complex in the infected cells altered little by IFN-alpha treatment. These results indicate that MeV suppresses the IFN-alpha, but not IFN-gamma, signaling pathway by inhibition of Jak1 phosphorylation. Our data suggest that functional disorder of the type I IFN receptor complex is due to "freezing" of the receptor through its association with the C and/or V proteins of MeV.
