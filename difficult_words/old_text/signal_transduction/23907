Regardless of cell type, the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is tightly linked to vital biological properties such as polarity, motility, cell-cell contact, exocytosis and proliferation. In the immune system, where rapid and efficient response to antigen-provoked stimuli is crucial, an overwhelming amount of data implicate the actin cytoskeleton and its regulators as central to immune function. Increasingly, the cytoskeleton is considered an essential amplification step in T cell receptor (TCR)-, costimulatory-, and integrin-mediated signaling. Advances in genetic manipulation and confocal imaging have led to a keener appreciation of the importance of TCR signal integration by the actin cytoskeleton. This review outlines recent advances in elucidating the regulation of T cell function through the actin cytoskeleton. We also examine intriguing parallels between the immune system and other models of cytoskeletal regulation.
