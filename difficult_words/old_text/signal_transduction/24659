We demonstrate an example of signal transduction by an integrin and have begun to define the pathway through which this signaling is achieved. We constructed a stably transfected derivative of 293 cells (ATCC 1573) that expresses the platelet integrin GPIIbIIIa (alpha IIb beta 3). This cell line, clone B, adheres to and spreads on fibrinogen, a ligand for alpha IIb beta 3, while the parent cell line does not. Stimulation of these cells either by adhesion to fibrinogen or with antiserum directed against alpha IIb beta 3 results in induction of calcium oscillations, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of at least one protein of molecular weight approximately 125 kDa. We establish that this phosphorylation, as well as the morphological rearrangements, requires the mobilization of calcium.
