Cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (DOX) has long been a major impediment of clinical applications of this effective anticancer agent. Previous studies have shown that cardiac-specific metallothionein (MT)-overexpressing transgenic mice are highly resistant to DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. To investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms by which MT participates in this cytoprotection, transgenic mice containing high levels of cardiac MT and non-transgenic controls were treated intraperitoneally with DOX at a single dose of 15 mg/kg and sacrificed on the 4th day after treatment. Myocardial apoptosis was detected by a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay and confirmed by electron microscopy of immunogold staining of apoptotic nuclei. Dual staining of cardiac alpha-sarcomeric actin using an immunohistochemical method further identified apoptotic myocytes. Apoptosis was significantly inhibited in the transgenic myocardium. The anti-apoptotic effect of MT was further revealed in primary cultures of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, DOX activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which was critically involved in the apoptotic process, as demonstrated by inhibition of DOX-induced apoptosis by a p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580. Both DOX-induced p38 MAPK activation and apoptosis were dramatically inhibited in the transgenic cardiomyocytes. The results thus demonstrate that DOX induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes both in vivo and in vitro and MT suppresses this effect through at least in part inhibition of p38 MAPK activation.
