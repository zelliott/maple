A set of early response genes has been identified whose transcription in fibroblasts is rapidly induced in response to growth factors. Prototype members of this group, c-fos and c-jun, encode products that form a heterodimer and have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression and cell growth. It is thought that other early response genes also encode critical mediators of the cell's response to external stimuli. We have used PC12 pheochromocytoma cells as a model system to test the hypothesis that different extracellular signals induce distinct patterns of expression of early response genes. Our results indicate that membrane depolarization, induced either by potassium chloride or by the neurotransmitter analog nicotine, activates a program of gene expression distinct from that activated by nerve growth factor or epidermal growth factor. Notably, c-fos and c-jun activation can be dissociated; whereas c-jun is coinduced with c-fos and jun-B after growth factor stimulation, membrane depolarization activates c-fos and jun-B without stimulating c-jun. Fos may therefore form transcription complexes with alternative cofactors under different stimulation conditions. nur/77 and zif/268, which encode putative transcription factors, also show markedly different responses to growth factors and depolarization. We conclude that multiple nonconvergent signal transduction pathways control early response gene expression. Our findings also indicate that the diversity and specificity of cellular response to environmental change can be accounted for by the differential combinatorial induction of a relatively small number of early response genes.
