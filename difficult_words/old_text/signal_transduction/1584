Hyperoxia and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) are two canonical signals centrally involved in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury. We have attempted to elucidate the effects of these two stimuli on the signal transduction pathways of lung parenchymal cells. In cultured human lung epithelial cells, exposure to hyperoxia alone (95% oxygen) did not affect NF-kappaB activation or degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitory protein, IkappaB alpha. Stimulation with TNFalpha alone increased NF-kappaB activation within 1 h and induced IkappaB alpha degradation within 0.5 h. After TNFalpha alone, NF-kappaB activation returned to baseline within 2 h and this corresponded with near complete IkappaB alpha resynthesis within 1 h of stimulation. In contrast, simultaneous exposure to hyperoxia and TNFalpha prolonged NF-kappaB activation up to 4 h, and IkappaB alpha degradation up to 2 h after stimulation. Hyperoxia did not affect TNFalpha-mediated resynthesis of IkappaB alpha mRNA. Hyperoxia alone did not induce IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity, but significantly prolonged TNFalpha-mediated activation of IKK activity. Hyperoxia alone did not activate the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) promoter, but augmented TNFalpha-mediated activation of the ICAM-1 promoter. These data demonstrate that while hyperoxia alone does not affect activation of NF-kappaB, hyperoxia prolongs TNFalpha-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. The mechanism of this effect involves, in part, prolonged degradation of IkappaB alpha resulting from prolonged activation of IKK.
