Bone morphogenetic proteins, members of the TGFbeta superfamily have been implicated in a variety of roles in the developing and mature nervous system. These divergent functions are a reflection of the closely defined spatial and temporal expression of BMPs in the CNS, and the potential interactions of the BMP signaling pathway with the STAT and MAP kinase pathways. In this review we discuss the roles of BMPs in early patterning of the CNS, determination of neural cell fate, and regulation of oligodendrocyte maturation during CNS development. Additional functions for members of the TGFbeta superfamily in CNS injury responses are emerging suggesting these molecules represent useful targets for manipulating neural responses to CNS insults.
