The interaction of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) with a variety of kinases variously involved in cell signaling is now a matter of active investigation. In particular, findings with regard to the effect of HNE on different components of the protein kinase C family and the mitogen-activated protein kinase complex already provide reliable indications of a potential role of this aldehyde as a cell signal messenger. Such a role appears further supported by the clear-cut evidence of up-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases and down-regulation of the nuclear factor kappa B system, produced by HNE concentrations actually detectable in pathophysiology.
