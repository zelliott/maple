To clarify the cytoprotective effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling in conditions of glucose toxicity in vivo, we performed murine isogenic islet transplantation with and without exendin-4 treatment. When a suboptimal number of islets (150) were transplanted into streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, exendin-4 treatment contributed to the restoration of normoglycemia. When 50 islets expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were transplanted, exendin-4 treatment reversed loss of both the number and mass of islet grafts one and 3 days after transplantation. TUNEL staining revealed that exendin-4 treatment reduced the number of apoptotic beta cells during the early posttransplant phase, indicating that GLP-1R signaling exerts its cytoprotective effect on pancreatic beta cells by inhibiting their apoptosis. This beneficial effect might be used both to ameliorate type 2 diabetes and to improve engraftment rates in clinical islet transplantation.
