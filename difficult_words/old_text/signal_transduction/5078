Apoptosis plays an essential role in the removal of activated CD8 T cells that are no longer required during or postinfection. The Bim-dependent intrinsic pathway of apoptosis removes effector CD8 T cells upon clearance of viral infection, which is driven by withdrawal of growth factors. Binding of Fas ligand to Fas mediates activation-induced T cell death in vitro and cooperates with Bim to eliminate CD8 T cells during chronic infection in vivo, but it is less clear how this pathway of apoptosis is initiated. In this study, we show that the costimulatory TNFR CD27 provides a dual trigger that can enhance survival of CD8 T cells, but also removal of activated CD8 T cells through Fas-driven apoptosis. Using in vitro stimulation assays of murine T cells with cognate peptide, we show that CD27 increases T cell survival after stimulation with low doses of Ag, whereas CD27 induces Fas-driven T cell apoptosis after stimulation with high doses of Ag. In vivo, the impact of constitutive CD70-driven stimulation on the accumulation of memory and effector CD8 T cells is limited by Fas-driven apoptosis. Furthermore, introduction of CD70 signaling during acute infection with influenza virus induces Fas-dependent elimination of influenza-specific CD8 T cells. These findings suggest that CD27 suppresses its costimulatory effects on T cell survival through activation of Fas-driven T cell apoptosis to maintain T cell homeostasis during infection.
