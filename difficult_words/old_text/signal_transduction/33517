TNF-alpha plays an important role in immune regulation, inflammation, and autoimmunity. Chronic TNF exposure has been shown to down-modulate T cell responses. In a mouse T cell hybridoma model, TNF attenuated T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. We have confirmed that chronic TNF and anti-TNF exposure suppressed and increased T cell responses, respectively. In adult TCR (BDC2.5) transgenic nonobese diabetic mice, DNA microarray analysis of global gene expression in BDC2.5 CD4(+) T cells in response to chronic TNF or anti-TNF exposure showed that genes involved in functional categories including T cell signaling, cell cycle, proliferation, ubiquitination, cytokine synthesis, calcium signaling, and apoptosis were modulated. Genes such as ubiquitin family genes, cytokine inducible Src homology 2-containing genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21, p57, calmodulin family genes (calmodulin-1, -2, and -3) and calcium channel voltage-dependent, N type alpha1B subunit (CaV2.2) were induced by TNF, whereas Vav2, Rho GTPase-activating protein, calcium channel voltage-dependent, L type alpha1C subunit (CaV1.2), IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 and -2, and IL enhancer binding factor 3 were reduced by TNF. Genes such as CaV1.2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, repressed by TNF, were induced by anti-TNF treatment. Further, we showed that chronic TNF exposure impaired NF-kappaB and adaptor protein 1 transactivation activity, leading to T cell unresponsiveness. Thus, our results present a detailed picture of transcriptional programs affected by chronic TNF exposure and provide candidate target genes that may function to mediate TNF-induced T cell unresponsiveness.
