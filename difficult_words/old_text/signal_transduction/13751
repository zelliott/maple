CD4+ T lymphocytes play a major role in the pathophysiology of sarcoidosis. Many studies have investigated the immunological and genetic abnormalities in this disease. There are few studies concerning the metabolic pathways. Essentially they concern the pathways: STAT1, MAPK38, NF-ÎºB, Galphai, cAMP and cGMP PDE and PEMT1. Using studies in the literature and results of our own work concerning some metabolic aspects of T lymphocytes in sarcoidosis, we present a revue of the various hypotheses, which involve dysfunction of cAMP signaling pathways, such as RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK in T lymphocytes, leading to a disorder of immunity.
