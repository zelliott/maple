Endometriosis, an oestrogen-dependent disorder, is related to inflammation, p38 Mitogen activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) can be activated by sex hormone and inflammatory factors, which plays an important role in many cellular reactions such as apoptosis, proliferation, inflammation and stresses, etc. Many studies showed that p38 MAPK was participated directly in regulating the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The special regulatory action of p38 MAPK on sex hormone and inflammation may help us to understand the intricate endometriosis pathological hypothesis. p38 MAPK inhibitors play a key role in the the study of endometriosis, and show great promise for the future. Blocking and regulating the expression of p38 MAPK on the signal transduction pathway level may hope to be a new strategy to prevent and treat endometriosis.
