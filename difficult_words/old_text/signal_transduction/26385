A further investigation of the lipolysis induced by medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) was conducted on C57BL/6J mice fed with a diet containing 2% MCT or 2% long-chain triglyceride (LCT). Blood norepinephrine, body fat and blood lipid variables, and the protein or mRNA expression of the genes relevant to lipolysis were measured and analyzed in the white and brown adipose tissue (WAT, BAT). Decreased body fat and improved blood lipid profiles attributable to MCT were confirmed. A higher level of blood norepinephrine was observed with the MCT diet. The adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) activity and its mRNA expression, the expression of protein and mRNA of the beta 3 adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) in both WAT and BAT, and the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) activity and its mRNA expression in BAT were significantly increased in the mice with MCT feeding. The lipolysis induced by MCT might be partially mediated by increasing norepinephrine, thereafter signaling the up-regulation of β3-AR, ATGL, and HSL in WAT and BAT.
