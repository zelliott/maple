The low-affinity receptor for IgG, Fc gamma RIIB, is expressed widely in the immune system and functions to attenuate Ag-induced immune responses. In mast cells, coaggregation of Fc gamma RIIB with the high-affinity IgE receptor, Fc epsilon RI, leads to inhibition of Ag-induced degranulation and cytokine production. Fc gamma RIIB inhibitory activity requires a conserved motif within the Fc gamma RIIB cytoplasmic domain termed the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif. When coaggregated with an activating receptor (e.g., Fc epsilon RI, B cell Ag receptor), Fc gamma RIIB is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine and recruits the SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP). However, the mechanisms by which SHIP mediates Fc gamma RIIB inhibitory function in mast cells remain poorly defined. In this report we demonstrate that Fc gamma RIIB coaggregation with Fc epsilon RI stimulates enhanced SHIP tyrosine phosphorylation and association with Shc and p62(dok). Concurrently, enhanced p62(dok) tyrosine phosphorylation and association with RasGAP are observed, suggesting that SHIP may mediate Fc gamma RIIB inhibitory function in mast cells via recruitment of p62(dok) and RasGAP. Supporting this hypothesis, recruitment of p62(dok) to Fc epsilon RI is sufficient to inhibit Fc epsilon RI-induced calcium mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. Interestingly, both the amino-terminal pleckstrin homology and phosphotyrosine binding domains and the carboxyl-terminal proline/tyrosine-rich region of p62(dok) can mediate inhibition, suggesting activation of parallel downstream signaling pathways that converge at extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. Finally, studies using gene-ablated mice indicate that p62(dok) is dispensable for Fc gamma RIIB inhibitory signaling in mast cells. Taken together, these data suggest a role for p62(dok) as a mediator of Fc gamma RIIB inhibition of Fc epsilon RI signal transduction in mast cells.
