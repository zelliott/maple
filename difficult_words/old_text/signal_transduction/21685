The role of ethylene in the hormonal regulation of plant development has been well established. In addition, it has been implicated in biotic stress, both as a virulence factor of fungal and bacterial pathogens and as a signaling compound in disease resistance. This apparent discrepancy has stimulated research on the effects of various types of pathogens on mutant and transgenic plants that are impaired in ethylene production or perception. It has become clear that ethylene differentially affects resistance against pathogens with different lifestyles and plays an important role in mediating different types of induced resistance.
