Here we investigate the structural and functional basis of the interactions between Notch and Wingless signalling in Drosophila. Using yeast-two-hybrid and pull-down assays we show that Notch can bind directly a form of Dishevelled that is stabilized upon Wingless signalling. Moreover, we show that the mechanism by which Wingless signalling is able to downregulate Notch is by promoting its ligand-independent traffic to a compartment where it is degraded and that this activity depends on Dishevelled.
