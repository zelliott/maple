JAK/STAT is one of the conservative signaling pathways in higher eukaryotes which plays a critical role in different ontogenesis processes. This article gives a review of the pathway structure at the molecular level, mainly in a model organism Drosophila. There are data about relationship of the signaling pathway and transcription machinery of higher eukaryotes.
