Systemic candidasis is a life-threatening complication of antibiotic and immunosuppressive therapies and can alter host defense mechanisms through pathways that are poorly understood. Promotion of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemotaxis by beta-glucan towards fMLP or IL-8 gradients demonstrates a fundamental effect on host defenses by pathogenic fungi. The aim of the present study was to determine whether recognition of beta-glucan is sufficient to alter PMN motility in the absence of agonists of G-coupled protein chemotactic receptors. Present findings demonstrate a profound increase in PMN motility by beta-glucan supplementation of a fibronectin substratum in an underagarose migration assay. Motility on beta-glucan included a 3-fold increase in distance of migration, as well as a 5-fold increase in the number of PMNs recruited into the motile phase as compared to motility on fibronectin alone. This promotion of motility is determined by the beta2 integrin complement receptor 3 (CR3) (CD11b/CD18) rather than the beta1 integrin very late antigen 3 (VLA-3), which mediates chemotaxis on beta-glucan-supplemented matrix towards fMLP. PMN motility on beta-glucan-supplemented fibronectin was selectively decreased by inhibitors of pp60 src and ras, whereas motility was promoted by inhibition of p38-MAPK. No effect of these inhibitors was seen on PMNs migrating on fibronectin alone. Migration on beta-glucan-supplemented fibronectin, but not on fibronectin alone, was negatively regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) or cAMP activation. These findings indicate that beta-glucan is sufficient to alter the migratory capacity of PMN in the absence of costimulation by fMLP. Enhanced PMN migration on beta-glucan is mediated through specific integrins and second messenger pathways that are distinct from those utilized by PMNs migrating in the absence of beta-glucan.
