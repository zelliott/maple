Remodeling of fibrous and vascular tissues in the periodontal ligament (PDL) around the tooth root was observed during tooth movement by orthodontic force application. We previously demonstrated that a single cell-derived culture (SCDC) of primarily cultured PDL fibroblasts, called SCDC2, has an endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-like character and can form endothelial cell (EC) marker-positive blood vessel-like structures. However, the types of molecular mechanisms that control the in vivo kinetic properties and the differentiation of the PDL-derived EPC-like cells into myofibroblasts (MFs), which are known to expand fibrous tissues, require clarification.

Using specific mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, we examined how epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated MAPK signals affected the proliferation, migration, and MF differentiation of these cells.

EGF induced SCDC2 cell proliferation in MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)- and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent manners. In addition, EGF suppressed the expression of MF differentiation markers in these cells in a MEK/ERK-dependent manner, and, moreover, stimulated the cell migration in a MEK/ERK-dependent manner.

EGF regulates fibrous tissue remodeling in PDLs through MEK/ERK- and JNK-mediated signals by affecting the proliferation, migration, and MF differentiation of the PDL-derived EPC-like cells.
