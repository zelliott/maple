The present study is designed to investigate the effect of pre-conditioning with 35% O2 on PC12 cell death induced by hypoxia. This study investigated whether 35% O2 pre-conditioning for 3 h, followed by 12 h recovery, can protect PC12 cells against death induced by subsequent exposure to hypoxia for 72 h. The result showed that pre-conditioning with 35% O2 partly blocked the decrease in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction induced by hypoxia in PC12 cells. PC12 cells pre-conditioned with 35% O2 could generate a small quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathway, then the over-expression of the B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 (Bcl-2) was induced, which subsequently protected PC12 cell against death resulting from hypoxia exposure. In conclusion, 35% O2 pre-conditioning could protect PC12 cells against hypoxic insult.
