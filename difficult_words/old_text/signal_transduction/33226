An immunochemical approach was used to detect the expression of putative guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins), arrestin, and nucleoside diphosphate kinases during wheat (Triticum aestivum) tissue culture initiated from immature embryos. Both the soluble and membrane extracts from the immature embryos revealed bands of 58, 40, and 16 kD with antibodies to G-protein (alpha subunit), arrestin, and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, respectively. These proteins were overexpressed in vitro in both nonembryogenic callus and embryogenic cultures. An additional soluble protein (32 kD) was detected by anti-G alpha antibodies in cultured tissues but not in immature embryos, suggesting a possible function in cell multiplication. Moreover, somatic embryogenesis was associated with the appearance of a 29-kD protein reactive with anti-arrstin antibodies, both in soluble and membrane fractions. Tissue-cultured genetic stocks of Chinese Spring wheat, including the disomic, 36 ditelosomic, and 6 nullisomic-tetrasomic wheat lines, were used to ascertain the chromosomal location of the genes encoding the 29-kD arrestin-like protein. The lack of a signal with the nonembryogenic ditelosomic 3 D short chromosome arm line suggests that the 3 D long chromosome arm possesses at least one gene involved in the expression of the 29-kD protein. The putative role of the 29-kD protein in signal-transduction regulating embryogenesis is discussed.
