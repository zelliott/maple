Exocytosis of granules containing apoptosis-inducing proteins is one mechanism of target cell killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Granules containing perforin and granzymes are redistributed to the area of cell contact initiated by specific interactions between surface ligands on a target cell and receptors on an effector lymphocyte. The formation of a stable conjugate between a cytotoxic lymphocyte and its potential target cell, followed by the directed delivery of granule components to the target cell are prerequisites of lymphocyte-mediated killing. Critical to understanding the development of cytotoxic function by CTLs and NK cells is the delineation of the second messenger pathways that specifically control the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The low molecular weight guanosine 5'-triphosphate-binding proteins of the Rho family play a central role in these regulatory events controlling cytotoxic lymphocyte activation.
