The Lck tyrosine kinase is involved in signaling by T cell surface receptors such as TCR/CD3, CD2, and CD28. As other downstream protein-tyrosine kinases are activated upon stimulation of these receptors, it is difficult to assign which tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins represent bona fide Lck substrates and which are phosphorylated by other tyrosine kinases. We have developed a system in which Lck can be activated independently of TCR/CD3. We have shown that activation of an epidermal growth factor receptor/Lck chimera leads to the specific phosphorylation of Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) and two RasGAP-associated proteins, p56(dok) and p62(dok). Activation of the chimeric protein correlates with an increase in cellular Ca(2+) in the absence of ZAP-70 and phospholipase Cgamma1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we have found that p62(dok) co-immunoprecipitates with the activated epidermal growth factor receptor/LckF505 and that phosphorylated Dok proteins bind to the Src homology 2 domain of Lck in vitro. In addition, we have shown that activation via the CD2 but not the TCR/CD3 receptor leads to the phosphorylation of p56(dok) and p62(dok). Using JCaM1.6 cells, we have demonstrated that Lck is required for CD2-mediated phosphorylation of Dok proteins. We propose that phosphorylation and Src homology 2-mediated association of p56(dok) and p62(dok) with Lck play a selective function in accessory receptor signal transduction mechanisms.
