In rat neonatal myocytes, a constitutively active G alpha(q) causes cellular injury and apoptosis. However, stimulation of the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor, one of the G(q) protein-coupled receptors, with phenylephrine for 48 h causes little cellular injury and apoptosis. Expression of the G beta gamma-sequestering peptide beta ARK-ct increases the phenylephrine-induced cardiac injury, indicating that G beta gamma released from G(q) counteracts the G alpha(q)-mediated cellular injury. Stimulation with phenylephrine activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt, and activation is significantly blunted by beta ARK-ct. Inhibition of Akt by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase increases the cellular injury induced by phenylephrine stimulation. In contrast to the inhibition of Akt, inhibition of ERK does not affect the phenylephrine-induced cardiac injury. These results suggest that G beta gamma released from G(q) upon alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor stimulation activates ERK and Akt. However, activation of Akt but not ERK plays an important role in the protection against the G alpha(q)-induced cellular injury and apoptosis.
