The paper contains current data on the different ways of the liver regeneration. There is still not enough data about control of the regeneration processes in the liver. However nuclear phosphatidylinositols and sphingomyelins have been shown to play a potent role of messengers signaling. The lipid messengers may be potent factors affecting process of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.
