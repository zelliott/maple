Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) have been shown to play crucial roles in not only lung and heart development, but also in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular remodeling in pulmonary hypertension (PH). We therefore hypothesized that BMP signaling could be altered in nitrofen-induced congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and associated PH.

Pregnant rats were exposed to either 100Â mg nitrofen or vehicle on embryonic day (E) 9.5. On E17 and E21, fetuses were delivered by cesarean section, killed and checked for left-sided CDH. The tissue was then harvested for pathobiological evaluation.

In nitrofen-induced CDH, pulmonary expressions of BMP4, BMP receptor (BMPR) type 2 and Id1 decreased on E17 and E21. On E17, pulmonary gremlin-1 expression increased, while BMP7 decreased. In the lungs, Id1 expression was correlated to BMP4 and BMPR2 and inversely correlated to gremlin-1 expression. Myocardial expressions of BMPR2, BMPR1A, BMP7 and SERCA-2A decreased, while gremlin-1 and noggin expressions increased on E17. On E21, myocardial expressions of Id1 and SERCA-2A decreased, while gremlin-1 expression increased. Moreover, BMPR2 and BMPR1A expressions were correlated to SERCA-2A expression and inversely correlated to pro-apoptotic Bax/Bcl2 ratio within the myocardium.

Downregulation of BMP signaling seems to contribute to pulmonary and myocardial anomalies observed in nitrofen-induced CDH.
