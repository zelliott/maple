The formation of morphologically and functionally mature dendrites is a key event in neuronal maturation and the establishment of functional neuronal networks, but the signals that regulate mammalian dendritic development remain poorly understood. Here we show that the erbB receptor signalling pathway, which modulates expression of several neurotransmitter receptors, also regulates dendritic development of cerebellar granule cells in the intact cerebellum. These results suggest that neuregulin-erbB signalling may control a program of postsynaptic development, from initiating dendrite morphogenesis to the formation and maturation of the postsynaptic apparatus.
