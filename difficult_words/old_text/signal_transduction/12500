Adrenal medullary chromaffin cells are a major peripheral output of the sympathetic nervous system. Catecholamine release from these cells is driven by synaptic excitation from the innervating splanchnic nerve. Acetylcholine has long been shown to be the primary transmitter at the splanchnic-chromaffin synapse, acting through ionotropic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to elicit action potential-dependent secretion from the chromaffin cells. This cholinergic stimulation has been shown to desensitize under sustained stimulation, yet catecholamine release persists under this same condition. Recent evidence supports synaptic chromaffin cell stimulation through alternate transmitters. One candidate is pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP), a peptide transmitter present in the adrenal medulla shown to have an excitatory effect on chromaffin cell secretion. In this study we utilize native neuronal stimulation of adrenal chromaffin cells in situ and amperometric catecholamine detection to demonstrate that PACAP specifically elicits catecholamine release under elevated splanchnic firing. Further data reveal that the immediate PACAP-evoked stimulation involves a phospholipase C and protein kinase C-dependent pathway to facilitate calcium influx through a Ni2+ and mibefradil-sensitive calcium conductance that results in catecholamine release. These data demonstrate that PACAP acts as a primary secretagogue at the sympatho-adrenal synapse under the stress response.
