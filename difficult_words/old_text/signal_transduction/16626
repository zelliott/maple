Recent work from our laboratory has revealed that isoactin cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics are coordinately regulated. In this chapter, we review some of the recent and relevant scientific literature focusing on key aspects of cytoskeletal and membrane-mediated signal transduction. Additionally, we highlight some of the strategic molecular, biochemical, and cell-based methodologies that we have either developed or implemented in our efforts aimed at revealing the pivotal role(s) that the actin isoforms play in controlling cell shape and motility during developmental and/or disease-associated events. Furthermore, we address the central position of beta-actin and its barbed end-specific capping protein, betacap73, in modulating nonmuscle cell membrane dynamics and cell migration. In studying the molecular mechanisms mediating these cytoskeletal protein interactions, we have recently recognized that cell motility and beta-actin dynamics are controlled by the direct association of betacap73 with the plasma membrane- and endosome-associated protein, ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6).
