The term olfactory transduction refers to the mechanisms that transform chemical information into electrical signals. With the patch-clamp technique it is possible to record those signals and to infer something about the mechanism that produced them. The direct activation of a cation-permeable channel by cAMP is the final step in producing the odour-induced ionic current. Because it occupies a critical position in the transduction process, measurements of the ion channel's activity provide useful insights into the molecular processes underlying olfactory transduction. In addition to its activation by cAMP and cGMP, the channel is modulated by both extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ ions and by extracellular Mg2+ ions, all at physiological concentrations. These effects are probably important in promoting signal reliability. An unusual feature of this channel is its termination kinetics--it can remain active for hundreds of milliseconds after the agonist has been removed. This is likely to add to the integrating properties of the olfactory sensory neuron.
