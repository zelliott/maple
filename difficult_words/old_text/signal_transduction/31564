Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)is the richest neurophin in brain tissue and may act as an activity-dependent neuronal survival factor. In vitro, BDNF plays an important role in preventing cortical neurons from hypoxia-induced neurotoxicity. It could induce a variety of cellular responses such as cell growth, survival, differentiation, and anti-apoptosis mainly via activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) signaling pathways. And among these multiple signaling pathways there is growing evidence of complicated cross talk.
