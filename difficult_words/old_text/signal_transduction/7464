Biochemical cues are critical to control stem cell function and can be utilized to develop smart biomaterials for stem cell engineering. The challenge is to deliver these cues in a restricted manner with spatial and temporal control. Here we have developed bilayer films of mesoporous silica nanoparticles for delayed cellular delivery of Notch modulators to promote muscle stem cell differentiation. We demonstrate that drug-loaded particles are internalized from the particle-covered surface, which allows for direct delivery of the drug into the cell and a delayed and confined drug release. Substrates of particles loaded with Î³-secretase-inhibitors, which block the Notch signalling pathway, promoted efficient differentiation of myoblasts. The particle substrates were fully biocompatible and did not interfere with the inherent differentiation process. We further demonstrate that impregnating commercially available, biocompatible polymer scaffolds with MSNs allows for a free standing substrate for cell directed drug delivery.
