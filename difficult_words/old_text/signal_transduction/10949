Cells have several sensory systems that detect energy and metabolic status and adjust flux through metabolic pathways accordingly. Many of these sensors and signaling pathways are conserved from yeast to mammals. In this review, we bring together information about five different nutrient-sensing pathways (AMP kinase, mTOR, PAS kinase, hexosamine biosynthesis and Sir2), highlighting their similarities, differences and roles in disease.
