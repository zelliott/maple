Groucho functions as a general corepressor by modulating chromatin structure and has a widespread role in many developmental processes. Here we show that Groucho may also interact with the basal transcriptional machinery. Mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans groucho interact with mutations in components of the transcriptional Mediator complex, resulting in synthetic lethality and loss of male sensory neurons.
