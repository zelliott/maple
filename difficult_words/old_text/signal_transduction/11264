E-selectin is a cytokine-inducible adhesion molecule that is expressed by activated endothelial cells at sites of inflammation. In addition to supporting rolling and stable arrest of leukocytes, there is increasing evidence that E-selectin functions in transmembrane signaling into endothelial cells during these adhesive interactions. We have previously shown that adhesion of HL-60 cells (which express ligands for E-selectin), or antibody-mediated cross-linking of E-selectin, results in formation of a Ras/Raf-1/phospho-MEK macrocomplex, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) activation, and c-fos up-regulation. All of these downstream signaling events appear to require an intact cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin. Here we demonstrate that tyrosine 603 in the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin is required for the E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation. Tyrosine 603 plays an important role in mediating the association of E-selectin with SHP2, and the catalytic domain of SHP2 is, in turn, critical for E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation. An adapter protein complex consisting of Shc.Grb2.Sos bridges between SHP2 and the Ras.Raf.phospho-MEK macrocomplex. These molecular events thus outline a mechanism by which cross-linking of E-selectin by engagement of ligands on adherent leukocytes can initiate a multifunctional signaling pathway in the activated endothelial cell at sites of inflammation.
