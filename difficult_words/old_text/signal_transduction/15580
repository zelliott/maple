Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and Staufen1-mediated mRNA decay are mechanistically related pathways that serve distinct purposes. In the present article, we give an overview of each pathway. We describe how a factor that is common to both pathways results in their competition. We also explain how competition between the two pathways contributes to the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to multinucleated myotubes.
