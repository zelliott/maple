Cadherins play important roles in cell-cell adhesion during tissue differentiation. Cadherins are linked to the actin cytoskeleton by catenins (beta-catenin/armadillo, plakoglobin, and alpha-catenin). Recent results show that beta-catenin also binds to another cytoskeletal complex containing the adenomatous polyposis coli protein and microtubules, and interacts with several signaling pathways that include tyrosine kinases and phosphatases and Wnt/Wingless. Interplay between these cytoskeletal complexes and signaling pathways may regulate morphogenesis.
