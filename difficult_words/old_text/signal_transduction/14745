It is known that free fatty acid (FFA) contributes to the development of insulin resistance and type2 diabetes. However, the underlying mechanism in FFA-induced insulin resistance is still unclear. In the present investigation we have demonstrated that palmitate significantly (p <0.001) inhibited insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PDK1, the key insulin signaling molecule. Consequently, PDK1 phosphorylation of plasma membrane bound PKCepsilon was also inhibited. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of cytosolic PKCepsilon was greatly stimulated by palmitate; this was then translocated to the nuclear region and associated with the inhibition of insulin receptor (IR) gene transcription. A PKCepsilon translocation inhibitor peptide, epsilonV1, suppressed this inhibitory effect of palmitate, suggesting requirement of phospho-PKCepsilon migration to implement palmitate effect. Experimental evidences indicate that phospho-PKCepsilon adversely affected HMGA1. Since HMGA1 regulates IR promoter activity, expression of IR gene was impaired causing reduction of IR on cell surface and that compromises with insulin sensitivity.
