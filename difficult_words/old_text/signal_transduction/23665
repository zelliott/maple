An improved understanding of the factors that regulate the migration of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) would provide new insights into human heart development and suggest novel strategies to improve their electromechanical integration after intracardiac transplantation. Since nothing has been reported as to the factors controlling hESC-CM migration, we hypothesized that hESC-CMs would migrate in response to the extracellular matrix and soluble signaling molecules previously implicated in heart morphogenesis. To test this, we screened candidate factors by transwell assay for effects on hESC-CM motility, followed by validation via live-cell imaging and/or gap-closure assays. Fibronectin (FN) elicited a haptotactic response from hESC-CMs, with cells seeded on a steep FN gradient showing nearly a fivefold greater migratory activity than cells on uniform FN. Studies with neutralizing antibodies indicated that adhesion and migration on FN are mediated by integrins α-5 and α-V. Next, we screened 10 soluble candidate factors by transwell assay and found that the noncanonical Wnt, Wnt5a, elicited an approximately twofold increase in migration over controls. This effect was confirmed using the gap-closure assay, in which Wnt5a-treated hESC-CMs showed approximately twofold greater closure than untreated cells. Studies with microfluidic-generated Wnt5a gradients showed that this factor was chemoattractive as well as chemokinetic, and Wnt5a-mediated responses were inhibited by the Frizzled-1/2 receptor antagonist, UM206. In summary, hESC-CMs show robust promigratory responses to FN and Wnt5a, findings that have implications on both cardiac development and cell-based therapies.
