The regulation of larval development by starved adults occurs in both freshwater snails, Helisoma trivolvis and marine polychaetes, Platynereis dumerilii. Serotonin (5-HT) links this environmental signal which is detected by larval apical sensory neurons to changes in larval development. A profile of the stage-dependent expression of 5-HT receptors and coupled G proteins is essential in this regulatory mechanism. The final effect on development depends on the modulation of the activity of the larval digestive system.
