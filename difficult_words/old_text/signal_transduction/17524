Altered immune response and transmembrane signaling with aging has previously been demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to characterize PMNLs and lymphocyte G proteins and to determine whether their relative amounts are altered with aging. First we studied the effects of FMLP on PMNLs IP3 formation. It was found that in any group of elderly the PMNLs IP3 formation was significantly decreased compared to that of young subjects. In FMLP receptor binding affinity no measurable difference exists in either low- or high-affinity FMLP receptors. The autoradiogram of 32P-ADP-ribosylated proteins by CT in lymphocytes of young individuals showed a major polypeptide of 40 kDa, and two much less prevalent components of 52 and 45 kDa. In contrast, in lymphocytes of elderly subjects the major polypeptide was 45 kDa, and the two others were very weakly labeled. In PMNLs, CT labeled the 45-kDa band quite strongly, mainly in the elderly, and the 52- and 40-kDa bands were very weakly labeled, mainly in young subjects. When PT was used, no age-related pattern changes could be demonstrated, while differences could be observed between the two types of cells.
