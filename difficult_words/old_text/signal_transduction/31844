Th17 cells that produce interleukin (IL)-17 play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammation. Among the various cytokines that are involved in the IL-17 pathway, members of the IL-1Î² family, including IL-18, have recently gained attention. In this study, we stimulated synovial fibroblasts with a combination of IL-17 and IL-18 and quantified their stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and their transcript levels by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Both IL-17 and IL-18 significantly increased the level of SDF-1, not only individually but also synergistically (P< 0.05). The synergism was effectively suppressed by anti-IL-17 and -IL-18 antibodies, and a PI3K inhibitor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of PI3K-dependent synergism between IL-18 and IL-17, and this work adds a novel perspective of the role of IL-18 in immune regulation. The individual effects of these two cytokines, and their interactions, suggest an interrelationship between the IL-1 family and IL-17.
