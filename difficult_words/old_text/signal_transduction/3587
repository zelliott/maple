Despite the high prevalence of metastatic cancers and the poor outcome for patients, the processes of tumor metastasis still remain poorly understood. It has been shown that cell-surface carbohydrates attached to proteins through the amino acids serine or threonine (O-glycans) are involved in tumor metastasis, with the roles of O-glycans varying depending on their structure. Core2 O-glycans allow tumor cells to evade natural killer (NK) cells of the immune system and survive longer in the circulatory system, thereby promoting tumor metastasis. Core3 O-glycans or O-mannosyl glycans suppress tumor formation and metastasis by modulating integrin-mediated signaling. Here, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the detailed molecular mechanisms by which O-glycans promote or suppress tumor metastasis.
