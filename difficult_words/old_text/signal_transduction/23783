Although K-Ras, Cdc42, and PAK4 signaling are commonly deregulated in cancer, only a few studies have sought to comprehensively examine the spectrum of phosphorylation-mediated signaling downstream of each of these key signaling nodes. In this study, we completed a label-free quantitative analysis of oncogenic K-Ras, activated Cdc42, and PAK4-mediated phosphorylation signaling, and report relative quantitation of 2152 phosphorylated peptides on 1062 proteins. We define the overlap in phosphopeptides regulated by K-Ras, Cdc42, and PAK4, and find that perturbation of these signaling components affects phosphoproteins associated with microtubule depolymerization, cytoskeletal organization, and the cell cycle. These findings provide a resource for future studies to characterize novel targets of oncogenic K-Ras signaling and validate biomarkers of PAK4 inhibition.
