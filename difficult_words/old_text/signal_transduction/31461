Several variants of growth hormone (GH) are found in the retina and vitreous of the chick embryo, where they appear to act as cell survival factors, having neuroprotective effects on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms of the anti-apoptotic effect of GH in cultured RGCs. GH treatment increased Akt phosphorylation in these cells, which is an anti-apoptotic event. Whereas unphosphorylated Akt was detected in both nucleus and cytoplasm of RGCs by immunocytochemistry, the phosphorylated form of Akt (Akt-phos) was located primarily in the cytoplasm of both normal and apoptotic cells, although levels were markedly lower in the latter. It was found that GH treatment of RGCs reduced Akt levels, while concomitantly raising Akt-phos levels, consistent with a role for Akt signaling pathways in GH neuroprotective action. This was substantiated using Wortmannin, which, like GH antiserum, inhibited Akt phosphorylation and initiated apoptosis. The addition of Wortmannin to RGC cultures simultaneously with GH significantly reduced the anti-apoptotic effect of GH. The induction of apoptosis by GH antiserum was clearly accompanied by an increase in caspase-3 activation and PARP-1 cleavage, both of which were significantly reduced in the presence of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, Q-VD-OPh, which itself had a dramatic neuroprotective effect on cultured RGCs. Calpain activation appeared to be a major caspase-independent pathway to PARP-1 cleavage and apoptosis in these cells. Calpain inhibitor III (MDL 28170) was able to reduce PARP-1 cleavage and abrogate the apoptogenic effect of GH antiserum. The results support the view that caspase and calpain inhibitors are major neuroprotective agents for RGCs, and that pathways that activate both caspases and calpains are important for the anti-apoptotic actions of GH in these cells.
