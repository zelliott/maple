MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a novel class of small RNA molecules that play a crucial role as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. As evidence for the involvement of miRNAs in various cellular processes increases, it is important to examine how miRNAs regulate gene expression. In the pituitary, aberrant miRNA expression is strongly linked with neoplasia, thus suggesting they play a role in the control of cell proliferation in adenomas. Research has built fundamental connections between aberrant miRNA expression and clinicopathological features of pituitary adenomas. Moreover, deregulated expression of miRNA target genes is often implicated in important biological pathways and thus provides significant insight into the role of miRNAs in tumorigenesis. This review will assess the significance of miRNAs in pituitary pathology.
