Integrin-mediated cell adhesion regulates multiple cellular processes crucial for development, physiology, and pathology. Since integrins lack enzymatic activity they need to recruit adaptor and signaling proteins to mediate their functions. The cytoplasmic proteins kindlins and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) associate with integrin tails and thereby link integrins with the actin cytoskeleton and various signaling pathways. In comparison to their role in regulating integrin function in cell-matrix adhesions, less is known about the functions of kindlins and ILK in other cellular compartments, such as cell-cell contacts and in the nucleus.
