The large molecular diversity of receptors and their subtypes means that the pharmacologist is faced with many puzzling characterization questions. First, the molecular diversity of the receptors is deciphered only in part by a pharmacological approach, which precludes a satisfactory receptor classification based solely on pharmacological characteristics. Second, the physiological counterpart of the numerous subtypes of receptors specifically activated by single endogenous ligands remains unclear. Here, Philippe Vernier and colleagues use the example of the bioamine G protein-coupled receptors to show that many of the apparent inconsistencies that emerge from pharmacological and molecular characterizations of receptors can be better understood if the evolutionary history of the receptors is taken into account.
