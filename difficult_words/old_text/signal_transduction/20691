In guinea-pig gallbladder epithelium, cAMP converts electroneutral HCO3- secretion into an electrogenic process. The effects of blood side Ba2+ (5 mmol/l) on HCO3- transport were investigated in vitro, using pH-stat and voltage clamp techniques to determine unidirectional fluxes of HCO3- and transepithelial electrical characteristics. Serosal, not mucosal addition of Ba2+ elevated short-circuit current (Isc), transepithelial potential difference, and tissue conductance; it inhibited the absorptive HCO3- flux while leaving the secretory flux unchanged. The Isc effect of Ba2+ was inhibited or prevented by tetrodotoxin; D- and L-propranolol; the Cl- channel blocker 4-N-methyl-N-phenylaminothiophene-3-carboxylic acid; the intracellular Ca2+ antagonist, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)ocytl ester; noradrenaline, by a yohimbine-sensitive action; somatostatin; HCO3(-)-free solutions. Thus Ba2+ appeared to release a neurotransmitter that gives rise to cAMP synthesis sufficient to turn part of electroneutral HCO3- secretion electrogenic. In a search for the involved signalling pathways, the H1-receptor antagonist, cetirizine, largely and hexamethonium, atropine, atenolol, indomethacin, and trifluoperazine entirely failed to antagonize the Isc effect of Ba2+. Similarly, carbachol, dobutamine, salbutamol, and serotonin were unable to mimic the action of Ba2+ and Isc effects of histamine were small and short-lived. By contrast, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; 3 x 10(-7) mol/l) completely transformed HCO3- secretion into an electrogenic process. The VIP receptor antagonist (4Cl-DPhe6, Leu17) VIP, delayed and reduced the Isc responses to Ba2+ and VIP. As guinea-pig gallbladder epithelial cells possess cAMP-coupled VIP receptors close to VIPergic neurons, Ba2+ is likely to act by releasing VIP from neural terminals.
