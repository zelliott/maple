The ability of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) to infect an extensive range of cell types has complicated efforts to identify cellular receptors for this significant pathogen. Recent findings demonstrate that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) serves also as a receptor for HCMV. Additional evidence has shown that HCMV entry occurs in concert with immune detection through toll-like receptors. Here, the implications of EGFR activation, the existence of other receptors and the coordination of entry with the innate sensing are discussed.
