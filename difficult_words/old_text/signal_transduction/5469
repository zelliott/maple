To investigate the expression of PI3K p85alpha in normal colorectal tissue, colorectal adenoma and primary colorectal carcinoma and explore its significance in the progression of colorectal cancer.

The expression of PI3K p85alpha was detected in 116 normal colorectal tissue, colorectal adenoma and primary colorectal carcinoma specimens using immunohistochemical staining, and the relationship between the expression of PI3K p85alpha protein and the clinicopathological factors was analyzed.

The positivity rates of the expression of PI3K p85alpha protein increased gradually in the progression of colorectal cancer and showed significant differences between the tissues (P<0.05). A significant difference was also noted in the positivity rates of the PI3K p85alpha expression in colorectal carcinoma tissues at different Dukes' stages (P<0.05). No obvious correlation was found between PI3K p85alpha expression and the degree of the tumor differentiation.

Abnormal PI3K p85alpha expression occurs in the progression of colorectal cancer in close relation to the clinical stage, and the PI3K/AKT pathway plays an important role in the progression of colorectal cancer.
