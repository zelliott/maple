Wnts compromise a large family of secreted and hydrophobic glycoproteins that control a variety of developmental and adult processes in all metazoan organisms. Recent advances in the field of Wnt signalling have revealed that Wnt activates multiple intracellular cascades, resulting in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration and polarity. However, it is not clear how Wnt activates these pathways after it binds to the receptors. It has been shown that Wnt and its antagonist Dickkopf are internalized with their receptors. This review highlights distinct endocytic pathways correlate with specificity of Wnt signalling events.
