Many lines of evidence indicate the importance of the Rho family guanine nucleotide triphosphatases (GTPases) in directing axon extension and guidance. The signaling networks that involve these proteins regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics in navigating neuronal growth cones. However, the intricate patterns that regulate Rho GTPase activation and signaling are not yet fully defined. Activity and subcellular localization of the Rho GTPases are regulated by post-translational modification. The addition of a geranylgeranyl group to the carboxy (C-) terminus targets Rho GTPases to the plasma membrane and promotes their activation by facilitating interaction with guanine nucleotide exchange factors and allowing sequestering by association with guanine dissociation inhibitors. However, it is unclear how these modifications affect neurite extension or how subcellular localization alters signaling from the classical Rho GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42). Here, we review recent data addressing this issue and propose that Rho GTPase geranylgeranylation regulates outgrowth.
