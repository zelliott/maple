Temperature is a critical and ubiquitous environmental signal that governs the development and virulence of diverse microbial species, including viruses, archaea, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Microbial survival is contingent upon initiating appropriate responses to the cellular stress induced by severe environmental temperature change. In the case of microbial pathogens, development and virulence are often coupled to sensing host physiological temperatures. As such, microbes have developed diverse molecular strategies to sense fluctuations in temperature, and nearly all cellular molecules, including proteins, lipids, RNA, and DNA, can act as thermosensors that detect changes in environmental temperature and initiate relevant cellular responses. The myriad of molecular mechanisms by which microbes sense and respond to temperature reveals an elegant repertoire of strategies to orchestrate cellular signaling, developmental programs, and virulence with spatial and temporal environmental cues.
