Activation of T cells results in the production of lymphokines and cellular proliferation. Protein kinase C (PKC) plays a key role in this process. It has been shown that this enzyme is essential to elicit a response to Con A or specific antigen in CD4+ T helper type 1 (Th 1) cells that secrete IL-2. We have now explored the signal transduction pathway that leads to transcription of the IL-4 gene and proliferation in murine CD4+ T helper type 2 (Th 2) cells. Surprisingly, we have found in two independently derived Th 2 clones that neither cellular proliferation nor IL-4 lymphokine production is affected by blocking or depletion of PKC. This differential mechanism of signal transmission leading to cellular activation implies a new distinction between murine Th 1 and Th 2 cells.
