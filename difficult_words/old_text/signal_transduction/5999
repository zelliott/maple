Platelet is activated through signal transduction, that mainly includes phospholipase-beta (PLCbeta) pathway, protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) pathway, phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) pathway and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) pathway. This article focuses on the relationship between signal transduction and platelet activation.
