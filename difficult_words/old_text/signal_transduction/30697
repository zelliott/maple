Degranulation of mast cells in response to Ag or the calcium mobilizing agent, thapsigargin, is dependent on emptying of intracellular stores of Ca(2+) and the ensuing influx of external Ca(2+), also referred to as store-operated calcium entry. However, it is unlikely that the calcium release-activated calcium channel is the sole mechanism for the entry of Ca(2+) because Sr(2+) and other divalent cations also permeate and support degranulation in stimulated mast cells. In this study we show that influx of Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) as well as degranulation are dependent on the presence of the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channel protein TRPC5, in addition to STIM1 and Orai1, as demonstrated by knock down of each of these proteins by inhibitory RNAs in a rat mast cell (RBL-2H3) line. Overexpression of STIM1 and Orai1, which are known to be essential components of calcium release-activated calcium channel, allows entry of Ca(2+) but not Sr(2+), whereas overexpression of STIM1 and TRPC5 allows entry of both Ca(2+) and Sr(2+). These and other observations suggest that the Sr(2+)-permeable TRPC5 associates with STIM1 and Orai1 in a stoichiometric manner to enhance entry of Ca(2+) to generate a signal for degranulation.
