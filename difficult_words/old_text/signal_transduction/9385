While endothelin-1 and its receptors have traditionally been associated with mediating vasoreactivity, we have recently shown that the vast majority of endothelin receptor A expression following traumatic brain injury is localized within the neuron. While it has been suggested that endothelin receptor A plays a role in influencing neuronal integrity, the significance of neuronally expressed endothelin receptor A remains unclear. One report suggests that endothelin-1 signaling mediates diffuse axonal injury. Therefore, this work sought to determine whether treatment with BQ-123, a selective endothelin receptor A antagonist, diminishes the extent of diffuse axonal injury following trauma.

A total of 12 male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400 g) were used in this study. Two groups (n = 6 per group) were generated as follows: sham operation and traumatic brain injury+1·0 mg/kg BQ-123 delivered intravenously 30 minutes prior to the injury. Trauma was induced using a weight acceleration impact device. Animals were terminated 24 or 48 hours after trauma, and a series of six coronal sections through the entire anterior-posterior extent of the corpus callosum were selected from each brain for quantification of diffuse axonal injury by beta-amyloid precursor protein immunostaining.

Our data indicated that animals treated with BQ-123 30 minutes prior to trauma showed a significant reduction in diffuse axonal injury in corpus callosum at both 24 and 48 hours post-injury.

The results show that endothelin receptor A antagonism reduced the extent of diffuse axonal injury, demonstrating a potential influence of the endothelin system on the intra-axonal cascade of molecular events underlying diffuse axonal injury.
