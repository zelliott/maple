The mTOR signaling pathway plays a very important role in the transmission of signals for initiation of mRNA translation and protein expression in mammalian cells. mTOR activates various downstream effectors to promote initiation of cap-dependent mRNA translation and mediate pro-mitogenic and pro-survival signals. Recent evidence has implicated effectors of this signaling cascade in mRNA translation for interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). In addition, it was recently shown that AKT/mTOR-mediated signals play important roles in the generation of IFN-dependent antiviral and growth inhibitory responses, suggesting that mTOR and its effectors can mediate diverse biological responses, depending on the cellular context and the triggering stimuli. In this review, the regulatory effects of various growth suppressive cytokines on the mTOR pathway are summarized and the emerging new functions of mTOR are discussed.
