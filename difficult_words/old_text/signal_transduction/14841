Although embryonic development is inevitably affected by biophysical or biomechanical processes, it has yet to be elucidated to what extent molecular mechanisms of development are modulated by such physical factors. The hedgehog family, including Sonic hedgehog (Shh), is the most well-known morphogens involved in the developmental pattern formation of various organs, such as the nervous system, face, limbs, and skin appendages. There are several unique features in hedgehog signaling including long-range diffusion or positive and negative feedback loops, suggesting the possible modification of hedgehog signaling by biophysical or biomechanical factors. Especially, the period of embryonic day 8-10 is characterized by various biomechanically regulated processes in mouse development, such as axial rotation and vasculoangiogenesis. We executed a series of experiments using a mouse whole embryo culture system to investigate the biomechanical roles of hedgehog signaling during this period. In this review, we examine various examples in which biophysical and biomechanical aspects of hedgehog signaling in development are revealed, including our own data using the mouse whole embryo culture system.
