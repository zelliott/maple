Data on membrane-bound biochemical mechanisms of control of plant dormancy and resistance to phytopathogens are discussed. Phytohormones are involved in the control of plant dormancy by the modification of activity of membrane-bound enzymes and ion channels. Similar constituents of the plasma membrane are influenced by fungal extracellular metabolites. Proposed interconnections between plasmalemma-bound signaling mechanisms responsible for plant resistance to infection and dormancy regulation are illustrated by a scheme.
