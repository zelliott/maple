Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) is a potent regulator of many cellular functions and phenomena, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, adhesion, migration, motility and apoptosis, and processes such as limb formation, wound healing, tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and blood vessel remodeling. In the adult myocardium, FGF-2 is expressed by various cell types, including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. The biological effects of FGF-2 in the myocardium are mediated by the high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor FGFR-1, the major FGF receptor in the heart. Here, we give an overview of current insights into the multiple roles of FGF-2 in the myocardium, as they pertain to two basic phenomena: ischemia-reperfusion injury and cardiac hypertrophy. The first category includes roles for FGF-2 in cardioprotection, the inflammatory response, angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, while the second includes myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and gap junction functioning (conduction). Given the strong evidence for FGF-2 as both a cardioprotective and angiogenic agent, the therapeutic potential of FGF-2 in the ischemic myocardium is discussed.
