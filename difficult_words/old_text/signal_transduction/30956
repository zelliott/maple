Unlike most somatic cells, leukocytes are constitutively non-adherent. However, adhesive interactions are not only a required step in essentially all effector functions performed by leukocytes, but they also relay increasingly well-defined intracellular signals that affect the leukocyte as well as the surrounding tissues. Dissecting such signals in leukocytes has provided a wealth of information that contributes to our understanding of how adhesion controls higher-order biological responses, ranging from cell migration to proliferation, differentiation and survival.
