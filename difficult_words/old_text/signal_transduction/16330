Paeoniae Rubra Radix (root of Paeonia lactiflora) has been frequently employed in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as and anti-diabetic therapy to enhance blood circulation and dissipate stasis.

Previously, we identified a novel hypoglycemic action of a crude extract from Paeoniae Rubra Radix, which also suppressed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene transcription. Therefore, the current investigation intended to elucidate potential active bio-constituents of this herb and mechanisms of action.

Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) nuclear localization, the PEPCK messenger (m)RNA level, pregnane X receptor (PXR) mRNA expression, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) serine phosphorylation and DNA binding were evaluated in dexamethasone (Dex) and 8-bromo-cAMP (CA)-stimulated H4IIE cells, while efficacy of agents was assessed in a stable cell line containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter driven by the PEPCK promoter. HPLC profiling, colorimetric assays, and NMR analysis were employed for chemical characterization purpose.

An extract of Paeoniae Rubra Radix lacking the insulin mimetic compound, 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose (PGG), and termed the non-PGG fraction (NPF), consisting of tannin polymers, suppressed PEPCK expression in the presence of an insulin receptor antagonist (HNMPA-AM(3)), suggesting the action of this fraction is independent of the insulin receptor. Furthermore, Dex-stimulated GR nuclear localization and transactivation were prevented by the NPF. Similarly, CA-stimulated CREB serine phosphorylation and DNA binding were also inhibited by the NPF in H4IIE cells. Hence NPF antagonizes both signaling pathways that induce PEPCK gene transcription.

In conclusion, the current study proposes that the potent suppressive activity on PEPCK gene transcription observed with Paeoniae Rubra Radix extract, can be attributed to at least two distinct components, namely PGG and NPF.
