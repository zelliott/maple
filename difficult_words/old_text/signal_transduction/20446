Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are induced by a variety of endogenous and exogenous sources. At pathologically high levels, ROS cause damage to biological molecules, including DNA. The damage sustained by DNA likely plays a key role in the pathogenesis of aging and carcinogenesis. Extensive research has established in detail the mechanism of cellular response to oxidative stress. Attention is now focused on identifying the molecular contributions of the key DNA damage response kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) in the oxidative stress response. In this review, we will provide an update of the current evidence regarding the involvement of these related DNA damage response kinases in oxidative DNA lesion repair and signaling responses. The growing understanding of the involvement of ATM, DNA-PKcs, and ATR in the oxidative stress response will offer new possibilities for the treatment of ROS-related diseases.
