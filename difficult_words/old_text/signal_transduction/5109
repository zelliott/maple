Cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for periodontal disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of nicotine, a major component of cigarette smoke, on interleukin-8 (IL-8) production and cellular signalling via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs).

Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of nAChR subunits in three different HGEC lines (epi 4, Tfx and E6E7) was assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). HGECs were stimulated by 1×10(-3)M nicotine in the presence or absence of IL-1β or Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS). IL-8 production was then examined using real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nicotine-mediated signalling in the epi 4 cell line was also evaluated by Western blotting.

HGECs expressed several nAChR subunits. Nicotine increased the secretion of IL-8 from HGECs that were cultured in the presence of IL-1β or P. gingivalis LPS and also induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in epi 4. Pretreatment with non-selective nAChR antagonist or intracellular calcium chelator reduced the nicotine-induced phosphorylation of ERK. Furthermore, nicotine-induced IL-8 secretion was decreased by pretreatment with non-selective nAChR antagonist, ERK1/2 inhibitor or intracellular calcium chelator.

These findings indicate that nicotine increases IL-8 production in gingival epithelial cells via ERK phosphorylation following Ca(2+) signalling after nAChR activation.
