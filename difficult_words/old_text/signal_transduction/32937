We report here that at least one major pHi-regulatory mechanism, the HCO3-/Cl- exchanger, is quiescent in unfertilized mouse eggs but becomes fully activated during early development following fertilization. Zygotes (8-12 h postfertilization) exhibited a marked intracellular alkalinization upon external Cl- removal, which is indicative of active HCO3-/Cl- exchangers, in contrast to the very small response observed in eggs. In addition, efflux of Cl- from eggs upon external Cl- removal was much slower than that from zygotes, indicating additional pathways for Cl- to cross the plasma membrane in zygotes. Furthermore, while zygotes quickly recovered from an induced alkalosis, eggs exhibited only a slow, incomplete recovery. Following in vitro fertilization (IVF), increased HCO3-/Cl- exchanger activity was first detectable about 4 h postfertilization and reached the maximal level after about 8 h. The upregulation of HCO3-/Cl- exchanger activity after fertilization appeared to occur by activation of existing, inactive exchangers rather than by synthesis or transport of new exchangers, as the increase in activity following IVF was unaffected by inhibition of protein synthesis or by disruption of the Golgi apparatus or the cytoskeleton. This activation may depend on the Ca2+ transients which follow fertilization, as suppression of these transients, using the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, reduced subsequent upregulation of HCO3-/Cl- exchanger activity by about 50%. Activation of pHi-regulatory systems may be a widespread feature of the earliest period of embryonic development, not restricted to species such as marine invertebrates as previously believed.
