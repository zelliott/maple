Among the numerous steroid and orphan nuclear receptors encoded within mammalian genomes, several are involved in regulating immune system functions. We review here recent studies on the glucocorticoid receptor and the orphan receptors Nur77 and RORgamma. These molecules play key roles in the development and the effector functions of T lymphocytes.
