The functions of nonpregnant woman neutrophils in the presence of chorionic gonadotropin (CG) have been studied, as well as possible mechanisms of intracellular hormone signaling. Expression of adhesion molecule CD18 and phagocyte activity of the cells are shown to be inhibited by a high dose of CG (100 IU/ml). Oxygen metabolite production by activated neutrophils decreases almost in a half in the presence of hormone, irrespective of the dose. Synthesis of nitric oxide, an oxidant and effective regulator molecule, is also suppressed by CG. Neutrophil incubation with hormone induces a dose-dependent modulation of intracellular cAMP level. The effect of CG is most strongly expressed for a low hormone dose (10 IU/ml), implying the presence of high affinity hormone-binding structures on the cell membrane. Judging from the correlation of data obtained, the functional effects of CG cannot be attributed to the regulation of adenylatcyclase activity and suggests that this is not the major mechanism of hormone signal transduction. Neutrophil sensitivity to suppressive CG effects is one of the ways of regulating nonspecific defence reactions in different physiological and/or pathological states connected with the presence of this hormone in the organism.
