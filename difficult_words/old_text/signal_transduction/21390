Although clock genes are the hallmark of circadian rhythms, they are also currently considered as transcription factors that have a prominent role in the pharmacology of the CNS. The expression of these transcription factors in the mammalian brain is not only intrinsically rhythmic but is also modulated by external inputs and hormones. An altered expression of clock genes, as evidenced in transgenic mice, has a profound influence on the behavioral effects of psychoactive drugs. Focusing on clock genes expressed in the brain might lead to the discovery of novel drug-target pathways.
