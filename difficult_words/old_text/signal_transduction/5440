The RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway has been known to play a critical role in Ca(2+)-sensitization of smooth muscle contraction. In this study, we investigated the role of ROCK in feline esophageal body smooth muscle contraction induced by electrical field stimulation and exogenous acetylcholine in vitro. Y-27632 [(+)-(R)-trans-4-(1-aminoethyl)-(4-pyridyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide dihydrochloride], ROCK inhibitor, and specific antibodies to ROCK1 and ROCK2 proteins, which are two isoforms of ROCK, were used. Electrical field stimulation induced off-contraction and on-contraction in the presence of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester, originating from the cholinergic nerve. Y-27632 inhibited both excitatory contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. Exogenous acetylcholine concentration-dependently induced two types of contractions: an initial contraction which occurred immediately after the addition of acetylcholine during short periods, and a sustained contraction which sluggishly continued after the initial contraction. Maximal initial and sustained contractions were reached at 10(-5) M acetylcholine. Y-27632 significantly inhibited both acetylcholine-induced contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis revealed that acetylcholine maximally increased the level of phosphorylation in the 20 kDa regulatory light chain of myosin II (MLC(20)) at Ser(19) from 0.25 min to 1 min, and then declined after 2 min. The level changes of MLC(20) phosphorylation during the 5 min paralleled with those of acetylcholine-induced contractions. The expression of ROCK1 and ROCK2 in membrane fractions of muscle was increased by acetylcholine; more specifically, ROCK2 continually expressed up to 5 min. Taken together, ROCK may be involved in neural-evoked and acetylcholine-induced contraction via translocation to the membrane in feline esophageal smooth muscle.
