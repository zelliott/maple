Phosphoinositides are short-lived lipids, whose production at specific membrane locations in the cell enables the tightly controlled recruitment or activation of diverse cellular effectors involved in processes such as cell motility or phagocytosis. Bacterial pathogens have evolved molecular mechanisms to subvert phosphoinositide metabolism in host cells, promoting (or blocking) their internalization into target tissues, and/or modifying the maturation fate of their proliferating compartments within the intracellular environment.
