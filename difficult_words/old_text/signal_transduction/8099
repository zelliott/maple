The study was aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA-induced apoptosis of acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60. The effect of SAHA on HL-60 cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay and the cell morphological changes were observed with Wright-Giemsa and Hoechst33342 staining. The cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry and the expression of cell signaling proteins were detected by Western-blot analysis. The results showed that SAHA inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners, after 2 micromol/L SAHA exposure for 12 - 48 hours, the cell cycle was arrested at G(0)/G(1) phase and apoptotic cell death was confirmed by either defined apoptotic bodies stained by Hoechst33342, Western blot showed cleaved-PARP, which represents the activation of caspase 3. The Western blot analysis indicated the activation of two important survival signal pathways after SAHA treatment, the phosphorylation of Raf and its downstream ERK kinases were remarkable downregulated, whereas the phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream molecular mTOR were not changed. It is concluded that SAHA-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells is mediated by inactivation of p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway.
