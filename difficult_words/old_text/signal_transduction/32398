The novelty of applying three-dimensional graphic capabilities involving area and vector changes was used to understand variations in inositol derivatives and their comodulating influence on calcium (Ca2+) in skeletal muscle under the duress of burn trauma. Burn injury was achieved by scalding of predefined areas (0, 20% and 50%) on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of mice. At day 21, 45Ca2+ influx and efflux procedures were performed. Through multiple regression, the dependency of intracellular Ca2+ was determined with respect to three polyinositol forms each representing independence simultaneously. The contribution of each of these parameters was assigned to a three-dimensional axis. Vector analysis determined the relationship of intracellular Ca2+ to each of the independent parameters in control, 20% and 50% burn groups. Such vector analysis allows for a clear visualization of the interrelationships that exist between secondary (viz, IP3) and tertiary (viz, Ca2+) messenger systems. This clear visualization may allow for a greater understanding of messenger systems that may lead to more effective treatment of the systemic effects of severe burn trauma.
