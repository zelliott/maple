Anaphase is the stage of the cell cycle when the duplicated genome is separated to opposite poles of the cell. The irreversible nature of this event confers a unique burden on the cell and it is therefore not surprising that the regulation of this cell cycle stage is complex. In budding yeast, a signaling network known as the Cdc fourteen early anaphase release (FEAR) network and its effector, the protein phosphatase Cdc14, play a key role in the coordination of the multiple events that occur during anaphase, such as partitioning of the DNA, regulation of spindle stability, activation of microtubule forces, and initiation of mitotic exit. These functions of the FEAR network contribute to genomic stability by coordinating the completion of anaphase and the execution of mitotic exit.
