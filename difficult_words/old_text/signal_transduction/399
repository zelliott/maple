Similarly to humans, healthy, wild-type mice develop osteoarthritis, including of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), as a result of aging. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNFalpha, are known to contribute to the development of osteoarthritis, whereas TGFbeta has been associated with articular regeneration. We hypothesized that a balance between IL-1beta and TGFbeta underlies the development of TMJ osteoarthritis, whereby IL-1beta signaling down-regulates TGFbeta expression as part of disease pathology. Our studies in wild-type mice, as well as the Col1-IL1beta(XAT) mouse model of osteoarthritis, demonstrated an inverse correlation between IL-1beta and TGFbeta expression in the TMJ. IL-1beta etiologically correlated with joint pathology, whereas TGFbeta expression associated with IL-1beta down-regulation and improvement of articular pathology. Better understanding of the underlying inflammatory processes during disease will potentially enable us to harness inflammation for orofacial tissue regeneration.
