We have produced three forms of human Fas: full-length Fas, Fas with a C-terminal deletion, and a chimera between extracellular Fas and the intracellular domain of the tumor necrosis factor receptor I p55 subunit. We transfected cell lines with these constructs to compare the relative capacity of antibody agonists and the physiological Fas ligand (FasL) to stimulate death. With two agonistic antibodies, the chimera is 100- to 1000-fold more sensitive to induction of death than the full-length Fas. The C-terminal deletion mutant also shows greatly enhanced death in comparison to the wild-type receptor. In contrast, when FasL is used to trigger the Fas pathway, wild-type Fas and the deletion mutant are similarly sensitive, whereas the chimera is 100-fold less susceptible to ligand-mediated killing than Fas. This demonstrates that antibody agonists and natural ligand can stimulate different signaling pathways and emphasizes the limitations of defining physiologically important signaling pathways solely by antibody agonists.
