Chemokines are potent chemoattractants for immune and hematopoietic cells. In the central nervous system, chemokines play an important role in inflammatory responses through activation of infiltrating leukocytes and/or resident glial cells. We previously demonstrated that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-evoked neuronal injury induced astrocytic production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2) via sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in rat organotypic slice cultures. In the present study, we examined mRNA expression and protein production of macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α, CCL3) induced by NMDA-evoked neuronal injury in the slice cultures. MIP-1α mRNA expression was transiently increased by NMDA treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Double-fluorescence immunohistochemistry revealed that MIP-1α was produced predominantly in microglia. Depletion of microglial cells from the slice cultures by pretreatment with liposome-encapsulated clodronate abrogated the increase in MIP-1α mRNA expression after NMDA treatment. NMDA-induced MIP-1α mRNA expression was partially but significantly inhibited by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125; conversely, the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor SB203580 enhanced it. U0126, a MAP kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor, did not affect mRNA expression. These results, combined with our previous findings, demonstrate that NMDA-evoked neuronal injury differentially induces MIP-1α and MCP-1 production in microglia and astrocytes, respectively, through activation of different intracellular signaling pathways.
