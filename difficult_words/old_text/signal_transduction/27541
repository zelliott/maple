Inhibition of protein synthesis leads to apoptosis in the undifferentiated neuroblastic layer of the retina of newborn rats. We have shown previously that an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP prevented apoptosis induced in the retinal neuroblastic layer by inhibition of protein synthesis. In this study, we tested the effects of dopamine on retinal apoptosis and related these effects to the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP. Both dopamine (100 microM) and the D1-like agonists SKF-38393, 6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (6-Cl-PB), and (+/-)-2-amino-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (100 microM) blocked apoptosis induced in the neuroblastic layer by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. The antiapoptotic effects of the D1-like agonists were not reversed by the D1-like antagonist SCH-23390 (5-100 microM). Both dopamine and D1-like agonists induced a five- to sevenfold increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP in the retina of newborn rats. The concentration of cyclic AMP induced by the D1-like agonists in the presence of 100 microM SCH-23390 was still at least two- to threefold as high as control values, showing that the activation of adenylyl cyclase by D1-like agonists was reversed only partially by the specific antagonist. The isoquinolinesulfonamide H-89 (20 microM), an inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, partially prevented the antiapoptotic effect of 6-Cl-PB. The data show that an early effect of dopamine in the developing retina is the control of programmed cell death. The antiapoptotic effect of dopamine is mediated, at least in part, through an atypical D1-like receptor coupled to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, followed by activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.
