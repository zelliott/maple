Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) and TLR-7 may have a role in the production of anti-DNA and anti-RNA autoantibodies, respectively, but murine models do not clearly demonstrate their contribution to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Herein we describe a patient with SLE who had long-lasting remission of her autoimmune disease after development of an antibody deficiency resembling common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). After CVID had developed, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies disappeared, although antinuclear antibodies remained positive for >10 years. In vitro studies revealed that the patient's B cells proliferated poorly and failed to differentiate into plasmablasts after stimulation of either TLR-9 or TLR-7, providing evidence for an acquired defect of the signaling pathway downstream of these TLRs. These observations suggest, although indirectly, that signaling through TLR-9 and TLR-7 is important in the pathogenesis of human SLE, and indicate that investigation of potential treatment strategies with TLR antagonists is warranted.
