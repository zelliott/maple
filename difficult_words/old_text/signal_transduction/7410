The study of abiotic stress response of plants is important because they have to cope with environmental changes to survive. The plant genomes have evolved to meet environmental challenges. Salt, temperature, and drought are the main abiotic stresses. The tolerance and response to stress vary differently in plants. The idea was to analyze the genes showing differential expression under abiotic stresses. There are many pathways connecting the perception of external stimuli to cellular responses. In plants, these pathways play an important role in the transduction of abiotic stresses. In the present study, the gene expression data have been analyzed for their involvement in different steps of signaling pathways. The conserved genes were analyzed for their role in each pathway. The functional annotations of these genes and their response under abiotic stresses in other plant species were also studied. The enzymes of signal pathways, showing similarity with conserved genes, were analyzed for their role in different abiotic stresses. Our findings will help to understand the expression of genes in response to various abiotic stresses. These genes may be used to study the response of different abiotic stresses in other plant species and the molecular basis of stress tolerance.
