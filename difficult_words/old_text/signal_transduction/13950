Overwhelming evidence shows that oxidative stress is a major cause in development of brain disorders. Low activity of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-degrading system as well as high levels of oxidative damage markers have been observed in brain tissue of patients with neurodegenerative and other brain diseases to a larger extent than in healthy individuals. Many studies aimed to develop effective and safe antioxidant strategies for the therapy or prevention of brain diseases. Nevertheless, it became clear that rigorous suppression of ROS is deleterious for normal cell functioning. Thus, approaches that can regulate the ROS levels over a wide range, from inhibition to induction, will be a powerful tool for neuroprotection. A most prominent target for such ROS management is the family of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). All three members (PPAR-α, -β/δ and -γ) of this nuclear receptor subfamily form a tightly connected triad. For individual PPAR isoforms, neuroprotective properties have been well proven. Their involvement in regulation of ROS production and degradation underlies the therapeutic effects. Nevertheless, the current paradigms of the involvement of PPAR in neuroprotective therapy ignore such interconnections of PPARs and aim at antioxidant effects of individual PPAR isoforms, but do not take into account the necessity of careful regulation of ROS levels. The present review (i) summarizes the data, which support the concept of the PPAR triad in brain, (ii) demonstrates that usage of the PPAR triad allows the regulation of PPAR-dependent genes over a wide range, from inhibition to upregulation, and (iii) summarizes the known data concerning the PPAR triad involvement in regulation of ROS. Our report opens new directions in the field of PPAR/ROS-related neuroscience research.
