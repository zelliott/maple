The Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium is one of the largest regular conferences devoted to breast cancer research and treatment. In particular, it provides a forum in which to discuss the more translational aspects of current basic research, and the 2002 meeting was no exception. Growth factor pathways and endocrine resistance, cancer genomics and the clinical applications of proteomics were three of the major topics for discussion. Presentations on genetic susceptibility and the development of prognostic and predictive markers also created much interest.
