Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for approximately 85% of cases. A significant proportion of NSCLC cases are not diagnosed until a late stage, when aggressive treatments are required but often prolong survival only modestly. Recent advances in molecular characterization of NSCLC have enabled identification of numerous cell growth and proliferation pathways that are disrupted in these tumors. This knowledge has provided insight into the mechanisms of tumor development in various histologic subtypes of NSCLC and has pointed the way toward targeted treatment strategies. In this review, we highlight literature findings of somatic mutations in genes involved in cell growth and proliferation that are commonly found in the various subtypes of NSCLC, and we discuss how these findings may relate to treatment strategies.
