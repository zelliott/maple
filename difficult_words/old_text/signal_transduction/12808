Granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an important hematopoietic growth factor. Mesenchymal cells produce abundant GM-CSF in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF). We wished to determine (1) what cellular pathways enhanced levels of GM-CSF mRNA, and (2) if TNF used any of these pathways. Modulation in levels of GM-CSF mRNA in human fibroblasts (WI-38) was studied by using Northern blot analysis. Markedly increased levels of GM-CSF mRNA occurred in these cells after exposure to sodium fluoride (NaF) and the effect of NaF was slightly enhanced by aluminum chloride; these results suggest that accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA can occur by activating a G-binding protein. Stimulators of protein kinase C dramatically increased levels of GM-CSF mRNA; however, blockade of protein kinase C activity did not attenuate accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA stimulated by TNF and NaF. Exposure to ouabain increased levels of GM-CSF mRNA and this effect was prominently enhanced in the presence of low concentrations of extracellular K+ and was almost abolished in high concentrations of extracellular K+. A monovalent ionophore (monensin) also increased levels of GM-CSF mRNA. Both ouabain and monensin can increase intracellular Ca++ concentration (Cai++) through Na+-Ca++ exchange. A calcium channel blocker (diltiazem) blocked the increased levels of GM-CSF mRNA mediated by ouabain, but could not block the stimulation mediated by TNF alpha. Ca++ ionophores also increased levels of GM-CSF mRNA and rapidly increased levels of Cai++. TNF did not increase Cai++ and, moreover, was able to stimulate accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA in the absence of extracellular Ca++. Taken together, we have found that several different cellular pathways can lead to prominent accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA in mesenchymal cells including (1) activation of protein kinase C, (2) increase in Cai++, and (3) stimulation of G-binding protein. Our studies show that TNF appears to increase levels of GM-CSF mRNA independent of protein kinase C activity or levels of Cai++.
