The cell surface receptor for IgG Fc domain (Fc gamma RIIIA, CD16) is present as a multimeric complex on human NK cells and is essential for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Although CD16 engagement induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates, the intracytoplasmic domains of the CD16 molecule lack intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase consensus sequences. We report here that, in human NK cells, engagement of the CD16 receptor induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p56lck tyrosine kinase. CD16 triggering through anti-receptor antibody enhances in vitro kinase activity of phosphotyrosyl proteins and autophosphorylation activity of anti-lck immunoprecipitates. Similar results were obtained after stimulation with IL-12. In vivo labeling experiments showed that CD16 cross-linking primarily induces in vivo phosphorylation of p56lck at the tyr-394 autophosphorylation site. Using in vitro kinase assay of CD16 immunoprecipitates from lysates of human NK cells, we demonstrated that a phosphorylated protein of 62 to 65 kDa was co-precipitated with CD16. Reprecipitation experiments also suggested that a small amount of p56lck may interact with this complex. These results indicate that CD16 triggering involves p56lck and that this kinase is therefore involved in the signaling pathways regulating NK cell cytolytic functions. However, additional kinases not yet identified are also likely to play a role in the early signaling events through CD16.
