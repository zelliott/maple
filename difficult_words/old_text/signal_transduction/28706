Signaling through the highly conserved Wingless/Wnt pathway plays a crucial role in a diverse array of developmental processes, many of which depend upon the precise regulation of Wingless/Wnt signaling levels. Recent evidence has indicated that the intracellular trafficking of Wingless/Wnt signaling components can result in significant changes in the level of signaling. Here, we examine three mechanisms through which intracellular trafficking might regulate Wingless signaling--the degradation of Wingless, its transport and the transduction of its signal. The intracellular trafficking of several Wingless/Wnt signaling components, including LRP5, LRP6, Dishevelled and Axin, as well as the functional implications of protein localization on Wingless/Wnt signaling, will be discussed.
