Metastatic cells switch between different modes of migration through supramolecular plasticity mechanism(s) still largely unknown. The aim of the present paper was to clarify some molecular aspects of the epigenetic control of migration of 1833-bone metastatic cells compared to MDA-MB231-parental mammary carcinoma cells. Active c-Src overexpression enhanced 1833-cell spontaneous migration and CXCR4-mediated chemoinvasion toward CXCL12 ligand. Only in metastatic cells, in fact, c-Src seemed to stabilize nuclear CXCR4-protein receptor possibly due to tyrosine phosphorylation, by impairing protein-degradative smear and causing instead an electrophoretic-mobility shift; the cytosolic steady-state level of CXCR4 was enhanced, and the protein appeared also phosphorylated. These findings suggested the triggering of unique signaling pathways in metastasis for homing of breast-cancer cells to congenial environment of specific organs. Microenvironmental stimuli activating c-Src might influence Ets1 binding to CXCR4 promoter and consequent transactivation, as well as CXCR4 post-translational regulatory mechanisms such as phosphorylation. Enhancement of Ets1 activity and CXCR4 induction by c-Src overexpression were prevented by histone deacetylase (HDAC) blockade. In contrast, HDAC inhibition with trichostatin A increased cytosolic phosphorylated CXCR4 expression in MDA-MB231 cells, but Ets1 involvement was practically unneeded. c-Src might be suggested as a bio-marker predicting metastasis sensitivity patterns to HDAC inhibitors. Rationally designed and individualized therapy may become possible as more is learned about the target molecules of HDAC's inhibitory agents and their roles, as undertaken for CXCR4 that is likely to be crucial for homing, angiogenesis and survival in a c-Src-dependent manner in bone-metastatic mammary cells.
