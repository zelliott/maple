Colonization with helminthic parasites induces mucosal regulatory cytokines, like IL-10 or TGF-beta, that are important in suppressing colitis. Helminths induce mucosal T cell IL-10 secretion and regulate lamina propria mononuclear cell (LPMC) Th1 cytokine generation in an IL-10-dependent manner in WT mice. Helminths also stimulate mucosal TGF-beta release. As TGF-beta exerts major regulatory effects on T lymphocytes, we investigated the role of T lymphocyte TGF-beta signaling in helminthic modulation of intestinal immunity. T cell TGF-beta signaling is interrupted in TGF-beta receptor II dominant negative (TGF-betaRII DN) mice by T-cell-specific over-expression of a TGF-betaRII DN. We studied LPMC responses in WT and TGF-betaRII DN mice that were uninfected or colonized with the nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus. Our results indicate an essential role of T cell TGF-beta signaling in limiting mucosal Th1 and Th2 responses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that helminthic induction of intestinal T cell IL-10 secretion requires intact T cell TGF-beta-signaling pathway. Helminths fail to curtail robust, dysregulated intestinal Th1 cytokine production and chronic colitis in TGF-betaRII DN mice. Thus, T cell TGF-beta signaling is essential for helminthic stimulation of mucosal IL-10 production, helminthic modulation of intestinal IFN-gamma generation and H. polygyrus-mediated suppression of chronic colitis.
