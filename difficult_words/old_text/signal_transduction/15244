Early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1) and osteopontin (OPN) play important roles in the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), but little is known about their relationship. Therefore, we transfected VSMCs with either Egr-1 cDNA, Opn cDNA, a DNA enzyme designed to target Egr-1 (ED5), or antisense Opn oligodeoxynucleotides and examined changes in Egr-1 and OPN expression at the mRNA and protein levels. OPN expression levels were increased in cells that were stably transfected with Egr-1 cDNA. By contrast, both Egr-1 and OPN expression were reduced when ED5 was transfected into Egr-1-expressing cells. Similarly, Opn transfection upregulated Egr-1 levels, while Opn anti-sense oligodeoxynucleotide transfection decreased Egr-1 expression. ChIP analysis showed that Egr-1 binds to the Opn gene promoter. Furthermore, treatment with the extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK) inhibitor PD98059 inhibited the upregulation of Egr-1 by OPN. We find that Egr-1 and OPN positively regulate each other in VSMCs.
