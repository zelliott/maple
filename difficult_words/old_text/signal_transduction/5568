Parathyroid hormone (PTH) activates multiple signaling pathways following binding to the PTH1 receptor in osteoblasts. Previous work revealed a discrepancy between cAMP stimulation and CRE reporter activation of truncated PTH peptides, suggesting that additional signaling pathways contribute to activation of the CRE. Using a CRE-Luciferase reporter containing multiple copies of the CRE stably transfected into the osteoblastic cell line Saos-2, we tested the ability of modulators of alternative pathways to activate the CRE or block the PTH-induced activation of the CRE. Activators of non-cyclic AMP pathways, that is, EGF (Akt, MAPK, JAK/STAT pathways); thapsigargin (intracellular calcium pathway); phorbol myristate acetate (protein kinase C, PKC pathway) induced minor increases in CRE-luciferase activity alone but induced dramatic synergistic effects in combination with PTH. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 (10 microM) almost completely blocked PTH-induced activation of the CRE-reporter. Adenylate cyclase inhibitors SQ 22536 and DDA had profound and time-dependent biphasic effects on the CRE response. The MAPK inhibitor PD 98059 partially inhibited basal and PTH-induced CRE activity to the same degree, while the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (BIS) had variable effects. The calmodulin kinase II inhibitor KN-93 had no significant effect on the response to PTH. We conclude that non-cAMP pathways (EGF pathway, calcium pathway, PKC pathway) converge on, and have synergistic effects on, the response of a CRE reporter to PTH.
