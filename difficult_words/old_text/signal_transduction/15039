Notch signaling plays an essential role in diverse biological processes during development and in pathogenesis of diseases ranging from cancer to cerebrovascular disorders. Precise regulation of Notch signaling is essential for normal function and requires both timely activation and inactivation of the intracellular domain (ICD) of Notch receptors. In addition, inappropriate buildup of Notch3 ectodomain is a hallmark pathological feature of the stroke and dementia disorder cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Thus, a clear understanding of mechanisms of Notch protein turnover is essential for understanding normal and pathological mechanisms of Notch function. Previous studies showed that the degradation of ICDs of Notch1 and Notch4 is controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), though more recent work demonstrated that Notch1 ICD is also controlled by lysosomal degradation. The mechanism of degradation of Notch3 has not yet been identified. Here we report that the degradation of ICD of Notch3 (N3-ICD) is mediated by lysosomes. Lysosome inhibitors chloroquine and NH(4)Cl led to the accumulation of transfected N3-ICD in 293 cells and endogenous N3-ICD in C2C12, H460, and HeLa cell lines; in addition, inhibition of lysosome function by chloroquine and NH(4)Cl delayed the degradation of N3-ICD. In contrast, N3-ICD was not affected by proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin. Furthermore, we find that the Notch3 extracellular domain (N3-ECD) is also subjected to lysosome-dependent degradation. In sum, our experiments demonstrate a critical role for lysosomes in the degradation of Notch3, which distinguishes it from Notch1 and Notch4.
