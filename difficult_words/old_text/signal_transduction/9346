Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessels formation, is a critical step for wound healing, tumour growth and metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, etc. The present study was designed to investigate whether c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) is critical for regulating basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF)-induced angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our results showed that bFGF-induced HUVECs proliferation, migration and tube formation with a concentration-dependent manner. Further results showed that bFGF induced the phosphorylation of JNK/SAPK at 15 min. Both JNK/SAPK inhibitor SP600125 and JNK/SAPK peptide inhibitor 420116 could inhibit bFGF-induced HUVECs proliferation, migration and tube formation, so did JNK/SAPK-specific siRNA. Moreover, when HUVECs were stimulated with bFGF, upstream signals of JNK/SAPK, SEK1/MKK4 and MKK7 were both activated at 2 min. In summary, our results indicate that JNK/SAPK signal pathway plays an important role in regulating bFGF-mediated angiogenesis in HUVECs, which may therefore be a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of angiogenesis-associated diseases.
