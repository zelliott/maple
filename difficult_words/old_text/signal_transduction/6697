IFNs are a family of proteins produced by various cells following stimulation by biological or synthetic inducers. The interaction with the membrane receptor is followed by the activation of the expression of particular genes that are responsible for their antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory properties. Initiation of transcription is an early and critical event in the control of eukaryotic gene expression. In this review we will briefly discuss the mechanisms exploited by IFNs to control at transcriptional level the expression of inducible genes. In particular we will focus on some characteristics if cis-acting DNA elements that are located upstream from the initiation site for RNA transcription and of nuclear trans-acting factors that are required for modulation of gene expression by IFNs.
