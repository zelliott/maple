We studied the effects of Lyn ablation on the survival of drug-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) blast crisis cells using siRNA. Lyn siRNA reduced Lyn protein in both normal hematopoietic cells and BCR-ABL1-expressing (BCR-ABL1(+)) blasts by 80-95%. Within 48 h, siRNA-treated BCR-ABL1(+) blasts underwent apoptosis, whereas normal cells remained viable. This increased dependence on Lyn signaling for BCR-ABL1(+) blast survival provides the basis for rational treatment of drug-resistant CML blast crisis, particularly when lymphoid in nature.
