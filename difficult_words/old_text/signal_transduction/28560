Recently, we reported that thrombin specifically stimulates protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) signaling in RPE entailing inhibition of Sp1 dependent HCMV replication. We now studied whether thrombin modulates the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine/chemokines IL-6 and IL-8 in mock- and cytomegalovirus-infected human retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). Our data show that thrombin/PAR-1 stimulates IL-6 and IL-8 gene transcription and protein secretion in both mock- and HCMV-infected RPE. Thrombin/PAR-1-mediated signaling stimulated PKC and NF-kappaB-dependent IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression via phosphoinositide 3-kinase and further downstream via p42/44 and p38 MAPKs. Thus, thrombin/PAR-1-mediated IL-6/IL-8 gene expression is uncoupled from Sp1 inhibition and may support proinflammatory pathomechanisms probably involved in hemorrhage/HCMV retinitis progression.
