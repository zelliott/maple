We have demonstrated that calcium concentration is under local control in two different systems: hippocampal pyramidal cell dendritic spines, and developing grasshopper pioneer neuron axons. Controllable, photoinduced damage to fura-2 filled processes was used for generating defined, reliable cytoplasmic calcium transients to demonstrate these local calcium regulatory compartments.
