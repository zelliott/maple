The avian Low Score Normal (LSN) genetic muscle weakness is phenotypically characterized by a reduction in the ability of the birds to right themselves from a supine position. Compared to normal skeletal muscle, LSN muscle has normal myosin isoform switching and cell-cell recognition, elevated glycosaminoglycan and decorin levels at embryonic Day 20, and a large increase in collagen crosslinking at 6 wk posthatch. To begin to determine the biological mechanism involved in the elevated decorin protein concentration at embryonic Day 20, the steady-state levels of transcripts encoding both decorin and collagen Type I at embryonic Days 14, 19, and 20, and at 1 d and 6 wk posthatch were measured. On embryonic Day 20, collagen Type I transcripts were not different from the control but there was a significant elevation in decorin transcript levels. At 1 d and 6 wk posthatch, transcript levels of decorin and collagen Type I were not different between LSN and controls. The change in decorin transcript steady-state levels is limited to late embryonic development and suggests an alteration in a signal transduction pathway regulating decorin transcription.
