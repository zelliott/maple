CD40 is essential for efficient humoral immune responses. CD40 has two cytoplasmic domains required for binding of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAF). The TRAF6-binding site is within the membrane proximal cytoplasmic (Cmp) region, while a PXQXT motif in the membrane distal cytoplasmic (Cmd) region needs to engage TRAF2/3/5. To dissect CD40 signals necessary for B cell differentiation, we generated transgenic mice expressing wild-type and mutant human CD40 (hCD40) molecules in a mouse CD40-deficient (mCD40(-/-)) background. The B cell-specific expression of hCD40 in mCD40(-/-) mice resulted in T-dependent antibody responses including germinal center (GC) formation. Mutant hCD40 molecules that carry either a point mutation of the TRAF2/3/5-binding site or a deletion of the Cmd region rescued extrafollicular B cell differentiation but not GC formation. A mutant hCD40 that comprises of only the TRAF2/3/5-binding site in the cytoplasmic region also rescued low but significant titers of antigen-specific IgG1 without GC formation. These results demonstrated that two distinct signals either from the Cmp or from the Cmd region induced the extrafollicular B cell differentiation and Ig class switching; however, GC formation required both. We conclude that combinations of these two signals determine which of the extrafollicular or the follicular (GC) differentiation pathway B cells enter.
