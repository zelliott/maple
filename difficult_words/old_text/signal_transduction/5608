The serine/threonine kinase MEKK3, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3, is a critical activator of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in innate immunity. However, the physiological function of MEKK3 in adaptive immunity is unclear. Here we report that following TCR signaling, MEKK3 positively regulated the kinase, IkappaB kinase, leading to NF-kappaB activation. T cells lacking MEKK3 were defective in TCR-induced and cytokine-induced responses. Furthermore, T cell-specific deletion of MEKK3 resulted in reduced numbers of thymocytes and peripheral T cells. Thus, our results provide genetic evidence that MEKK3 plays a crucial role in adaptive immunity.
