The metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is central to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Recent data have linked APP and presenilin to the Wnt/wingless signaling pathway. To assess affects of Wnt stimulation on APP isoform expression, we infected PC12 cells and C57MG cells with a retrovirus containing murine Wnt-1. In PC12 cells, Wnt-1 expression is associated with induction of exon 15 deletion from APP mRNA and expression of L-APP. Our data suggest that APP isoform expression is regulated, in part, by the Wnt/wingless signaling pathway.
