Caveolae and the caveolae coat proteins, caveolins, are putatively implicated in many cellular processes, including transcytosis of macromolecules, cholesterol transport, and signal transduction. Recent insights into the physiological and pathophysiological roles of these organelles and the caveolins from genetically modified mice suggest that they may be profoundly important for postnatal cardiovascular function, including endothelial barrier function, regulation of nitric oxide synthesis, cholesterol metabolism, and cardiac function.
