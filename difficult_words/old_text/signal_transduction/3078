Several groups of author have published that, in most cases of carcinoma, circulating lymphocytes are unable to carry out immune functions successfully. A molecular mechanism responsible for T lymphocytes defective reactivity in cancer patients is not completely defined. We evaluated whether the impaired function of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from ovarian cancer patients could be associated with signaling elements such as JAK3, STAT3 and CD3-zeta chain. The study addressed to the simultaneous expression and phosphorylation status of mentioned molecules evaluation in regard to lymphocyte function in patients with advanced ovarian cancer has not yet been demonstrated by others. We found that PBLs of cancer patients showed lower JAK3, CD3-zeta molecules expression levels, as well as lower STAT3 and CD3-zeta phosphorylation levels than cells of control. The lower proliferative response and IL-2 production capacity of cancer patients PBLs in comparison with that of the control group cells were the functional consequences of reported in this study signaling abnormalities.
