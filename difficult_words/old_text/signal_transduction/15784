N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) catalyzes the β1,6 branching of N-acetylglucosamine on N-glycans. GnT-V expression is elevated during malignant transformation in various types of cancer. However, the mechanism by which GnT-V promotes cancer progression is unclear. To characterize the biological significance of GnT-V, we established GnT-V transgenic (Tg) mice, in which GnT-V is regulated by a β-actin promoter. No spontaneous cancer was detected in any organs of the GnT-V Tg mice. However, GnT-V expression was up-regulated in GnT-V Tg mouse skin, and cultured keratinocytes derived from these mice showed enhanced migration, which was associated with changes in E-cadherin localization and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Further, EMT-associated factors snail, twist, and N-cadherin were up-regulated, and cutaneous wound healing was accelerated in vivo. We further investigated the detailed mechanisms of EMT by assessing EGF signaling and found up-regulated EGF receptor signaling in GnT-V Tg mouse keratinocytes. These findings indicate that GnT-V overexpression promotes EMT and keratinocyte migration in part through enhanced EGF receptor signaling.
