In this issue of Neuron, Granseth et al. re-examine the mechanism of endocytosis at hippocampal synapses using a new optical reporter, sypHy. They conclude that only a single slow mode of endocytosis operates at this synapse and that retrieval after physiological stimuli is largely, if not solely, dominated by the clathrin-mediated pathway. These conclusions dispute previous assertions that "kiss-and-run" is a major mechanism of vesicle recycling at hippocampal synapses.
