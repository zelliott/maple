The photosystem II (PSII) reaction center protein D1 undergoes rapid light-dependent turnover, which is caused by photoinhibition. To identify the photoreceptor(s) involved in the light-dependent expression of the psbA gene encoding the D1 protein, we determined the action spectra of psbA transcription, PSII activity, photosynthesis and photoinhibition in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In accordance with its phycobilisome antenna, PSII showed the highest activity in the spectral region from yellow to red and only low activity in the ultraviolet-A (UV-A) to green region. Photoinhibition, in turn, was fastest in UV-A to violet light and a minor peak was found in the orange region. The action spectrum of psbA transcription resembled closely that of photoinhibition, suggesting that photoinhibition creates a signal for up-regulation of the psbA gene.
