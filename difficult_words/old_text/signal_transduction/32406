Genistein, an isoflavanoid compound, a selective inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK), inhibited PHA-stimulated bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation (PBMC), interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, phosphorylation of PTK p56lck. Further, genistein also inhibited leukotriene B4 production from A-23187 stimulated cultures. Our data suggest that the PTK plays an important role in the signal transduction of bovine PBMC proliferation.
