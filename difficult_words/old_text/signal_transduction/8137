In confluent primary cultures of rat hepatocytes,hypertonic stress leads to cell shrinkage and activates non-selective cation channels as the main mechanism of regulatory cell volume increase. The process is found to employ the exocytotic insertion of channels into the plasma membrane and (in addition to PKC) PLC, tyrosine kinases and G proteins, but not PI 3-kinase are part of the signalling network. Furthermore, hypertonic stress leads to the formation of stress fibres and significantly alters the activity of RhoA, Rac and Cdc42. These latter effects, however, are likely to reflect the restoration of cell shape rather than the regulation of cell volume, both most probably converging at the level of focal adhesions and integrins.
