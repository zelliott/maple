Conditional deletion of fibroblast growth factor receptors (Fgfrs) 1 and 2 in the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) of mice leads to a virtual absence of MM and unbranched ureteric buds that are occasionally duplex. Deletion of Fgfr2 in the MM leads to kidneys with cranially displaced ureteric buds along the Wolffian duct or duplex ureters. Mice with point mutations in Fgfr2's binding site for the docking protein Frs2α (Fgfr2(LR/LR)), however, have normal kidneys; the roles of the Fgfr2/Frs2α signaling axis in MM development and regulating the ureteric bud induction site are incompletely understood. Here, we generated mice with both Fgfr1 deleted in the MM and Fgfr2(LR/LR) point mutations (Fgfr1(Mes-/-)Fgfrf2(LR/LR)). Unlike mice lacking both Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 in the MM, these mice had no obvious MM defects but had cranially displaced or duplex ureteric buds, probably as a result of decreased Bmp4 expression. Fgfr1(Mes-/-)Fgfr2(LR/LR) mice also had subsequent defects in ureteric morphogenesis, including dilated, hyperproliferative tips and decreased branching. Ultimately, they developed progressive renal cystic dysplasia associated with abnormally oriented cell division. Furthermore, mutants had increased and ectopic expression of Ret and its downstream targets in ureteric trunks, and exhibited upregulation of Ret/Etv4/5 signaling effectors, including Met, Myb, Cxcr4, and Crlf1. These defects were associated with reduced expression of Bmp4 in mesenchymal cells near mutant ureteric bud tips. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Fgfr2/Frs2α signaling in the MM promotes Bmp4 expression, which represses Ret levels and signaling in the ureteric bud to ensure normal ureteric morphogenesis.
