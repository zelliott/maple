Bacterial communities usually develop biofilms abound in nature niche. The development of biofilm is a highly dynamic and complex process coordinated by multiple mechanisms, of which two-component system and quorum sensing are two well-defined systems. Biofilm is involved in the virulence of many pathogens. Therefore, targeting the key factors involved in the biofilm formation represents a novel and promising avenue for developing better antibiotics.
