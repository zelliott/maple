In this study we investigated the differential effect of the co-stimulatory receptor ligand molecules CD2/LFA-3, LFA-1/ICAM-1, and CD28/B7 on microbial superantigen mediated activation of CD4+ T cells. Highly purified CD4+ T cells, depleted of antigen presenting cells (APCs), do not proliferate in response to the superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). However, CD4+ T cells do respond to SEB in the presence of the LFA-3, ICAM-1, and B7 positive erythroleukemic cell line K562, murine L cells, human B7 transfected L cells or CD28 mAb. The K562 plus SEB induced response can be inhibited by combinations of mAbs to CD2 and LFA-1, and to LFA-3, ICAM-1, and B7. Addition of CD28 mAb to the CD2 and LFA-1 inhibited cultures could restore the response. Furthermore, soluble CD28 mAb alone is able to synergize with SEB to induce a proliferative CD4+ T cell response. CD4+ T cells depleted of APCs could also be activated by a pool of four mAbs directed to the V beta 5, V beta 6, V beta 8, and V beta 12 region of the TCR when a co-stimulatory signal was provided by the CD28 mAb, while the V beta mAbs alone or in combination are unable to activate CD4+ T cells in the absence of APCs. In contrast, addition of soluble mAbs to CD2 and LFA-1 molecules failed to co-stimulate SEB activated CD4+ T lymphocytes. The kinetics of the different modes of activation are distinct. SEB induced proliferation is most efficient in the presence of autologous APCs with maximal proliferation at a log4 lower SEB concentration than when CD28 mAbs were used. SEB plus K562 activation peaks on day 7, while SEB plus CD28 mAb induced proliferative responses do not peak until day 9. Thus, superantigen mediated activation of CD4+ T cells requires co-stimulatory signals, among which CD28 has distinct and unique effects.
