The reciprocal influence and bidirectional cross-talk between bone and energy metabolism is a recent finding, since the discovery that the product of osteoblasts osteocalcin increases pancreatic Î²-cell proliferation, insulin secretion and sensitivity. Conversely, the anabolic effect of insulin is crucial for osteoblast function, as suggested by severe osteopenia and increased incidence of fracture in insulin-deficient diabetic patients. The Insulin Receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase, which is commonly expressed in the insulin-sensitive liver, muscle, and adipose tissues, is also found in animal and human bone. Here we show that in human bone two insulin receptor isoforms (IR-A and IR-B) are differently expressed. Mature human osteoblasts predominantly express IR-B, whereas IR-A is mainly expressed in osteoblast precursors, and IR-B/IR-A mRNA ratio significantly increases along the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal precursors. Moreover, transfected osteoprogenitors overexpressing IR-A show an increased proliferation rate. In contrast, when transfected with and overexpressing IR-B, their proliferation rate is reduced, corresponding to a more differentiated phenotype. In conclusion, the fine regulation of the expression of different isoforms of IR during osteogenic differentiation confirms the important role played by IR in bone homeostasis, providing the basis for new perspectives on the various involvements of IR isoforms in bone pathophysiology.
