A solution phase parallel synthesis approach was undertaken to rapidly explore the structure-activity relationship of an inhibitor of the Ras/Raf protein interaction identified from a small molecule compound library. Evaluation of the MAPK pathway signaling inhibitory activity of the synthesized analogues as well as their antiproliferative activity and ability to inhibit soft agar growth were performed.
