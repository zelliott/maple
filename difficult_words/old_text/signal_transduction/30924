The fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20) and monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) genes are associated with Parkinson Disease (PD) risk and both are in the dopamine bio-pathway. Therefore, we investigated the joint effect between polymorphisms in the FGF20 and MAOB genes for evidence of interaction contributing to PD risk. Fourteen polymorphisms (eight for FGF20, six for MAOB) were genotyped in 736 families and analyzed using conditional logistic regression (CLR). Significant two-locus interactions were found in females between the polymorphisms rs1721100 of FGF20 and rs1799836 of MAOB, and between the polymorphisms rs1721082 of FGF20 and rs1799836 of MAOB. The risk alleles for each SNP identified from CLR, rs1721100 C, rs1721082 T and rs1799836 A, are consistent with previous reports. Using indicator variables for the SNP genotypes, rs1721100 GC with rs1799836 AA showed significant interaction (P = 0.021), compared with the reference group rs1721100 GG with rs1799836 GG. Using an allele-dose model for the risk alleles, rs1721100 and rs1799836 showed significant interaction (P = 0.019). We found similar interaction results between rs1721082 and rs1799836. In conclusion, variants in FGF20 and MAOB show evidence of statistical interactions, which emphasizes the importance of considering them jointly in genetic analysis of PD and illustrates potential patterns of biological interaction contributing to PD risk.
