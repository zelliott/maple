Plant architecture is a major trait for plant survival and plant fitness and has a huge influence on the agronomical value for most crops. The classical theory of apical dominance based on decapitation experiments suggested that two major plant hormones, auxin and cytokinins, were acting antagonistically on bud outgrowth to promote or repress branching. However this theory was challenged in the late 1930's by Snow who suggested the existence of a second messenger to auxin, as auxin was not acting directly to repress branching. The use of branching mutants in pea, Arabidopsis and rice led to the discovery of a new carotenoid-derived signal repressing branching. Genes involved in synthesis (RMS1, RMS5) as well as in response (RMS4) to this new signal have been identified and have given rise to a new model of the branching control. Two independent group have recently shown, one on pea, the other on rice, that strigolactones correspond to this novel signal which represses branching and to the secondary messenger in the theory of apical dominance. Strigolactones have been first identified for their role in germination of parasitic plants like Striga or Orobanche. They also play a critical role in the widespread association between 80% of plants and fungi, the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, as they are necessary for interaction between certain plants and fungi in the rhizosphere.
