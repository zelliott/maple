We have recently demonstrated that multiple signalling pathways are involved in thrombin-induced proliferation in rat astrocytes. Thrombin acts by protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Signalling includes both Gi/(betagamma subunits)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and a Gq-phospholipase C/Ca2+/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. In the present study, we investigated the possible protein tyrosine kinases which might be involved in thrombin signalling cascades. We found that, in astrocytes, thrombin can evoke phosphorylation of proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) via PAR-1. This process is dependent on the increase in intracellular Ca2+ and PKC activity. Moreover, in response to thrombin stimulation Pyk2 formed a complex with Src tyrosine kinase and adapter protein growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), which could be coprecipitated. Furthermore, both thrombin-induced Pyk2 phosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation can be attenuated by Src kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine. From these data we conclude that PAR-1 uses Ca2+- and PKC-dependent Pyk2 to activate Src, thereby leading to ERK1/2 activation, which predominantly recruits Grb2 in rat astrocytes.
