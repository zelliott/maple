Activation of the platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) in macrophages is associated with suppressor phenotype. Here, we investigated the PAFR in murine dendritic cells (DC). Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BALB/c) were cultured with GM-CSF and maturation was induced by LPS. The PAFR antagonists (WEB2086, WEB2170, PCA4248) and the prostaglandin (PG) synthesis inhibitors (indomethacin, nimesulide and NS-398) were added before LPS. Mature and immature DCs expressed PAFR. LPS increased MHCII, CD40, CD80, CD86, CCR7 and induced IL-10, IL-12, COX-2 and PGE2 expression. IL-10, COX-2 and PGE2 levels were reduced by PAFR antagonists and increased by cPAF. The IL-10 production was independent of PGs. Mature DCs induced antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation. PAFR antagonists or PG-synthesis inhibitors significantly increased lymphocyte proliferation. It is proposed that PAF has a central role in regulatory DC differentiation through potentiation of IL-10 and PGE2 production.
