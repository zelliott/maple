Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway controls differentiation of various cells by regulating the expression of target genes. beta-Catenin plays a central role in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of fate determination in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs), we investigated effects of Wnt3a and beta-catenin, two key members of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, in adipogenic differentiation of porcine AMSCs. We demonstrated that Wnt3a protein can inhibit the adipogenic differentiation of porcine AMSCs in vitro culture. By stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin with continuous treatment by LiCl, the adipogenic differentiation of AMSCs was also suppressed and the osteogenesis was stimulated. In contrast, a loss of beta-catenin in AMSCs enhanced the adipogenic differentiation and rescued LiCl-induced anti-adipogenesis. In addition, the mutual activation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) were repressed in the presence of Wnt3a or LiCl, but increased in the gene silencing of beta-catenin. Taken together, our study indicated that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway inhibited the adipogenic differentiation potential and alter the cell fate from adipocytes to osteoblasts.
