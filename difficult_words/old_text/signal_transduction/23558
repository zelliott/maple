Activation of astrocytes is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Proinflammatory molecules produced by activated astrocytes contribute to neuronal damage in AD. Moreover, dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) has been reported to attenuate astroglial activation and exert neuroprotective effects in AD transgenic mice. However, the mechanism by which NBP inhibits activated astrocytes is poorly understood.

In this study, the primary astrocytes were obtained from the cerebral cortices of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The levels of GFAP, COX-2, NF-κB, and IκBα were examined by Western blotting and the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were determined by ELISA.

NBP inhibited the amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced activation of astrocytes and the up-regulation of proinflammatory molecules. Importantly, NBP markedly suppressed Aβ-induced IκBα degradation and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) translocation.

Our results suggest that NBP attenuates Aβ-induced activation of astrocytes and neuroinflammation via inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway.
