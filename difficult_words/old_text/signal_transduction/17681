For more than a decade it has been known that certain growth factors inhibit apoptosis in genetically determined and experimental models of inner and outer retinal degeneration. The molecular mechanisms underlying these protective effects and the signaling that supports the survival of photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells in these models have recently come under more in depth investigation. This paper reviews our current understanding of the balance of pro- and antiapoptotic signals that determine cell fate in the retina and how the activation of key signal transduction pathways by specific classes of neurotrophins protects retinal neurons.
