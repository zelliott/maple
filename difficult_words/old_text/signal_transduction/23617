Altered maternal nutrition and metabolism, restricted utero-placental blood flow, and other perturbations in the maternal compartment may disturb critical periods of fetal development resulting in increased susceptibility to develop disease in childhood and adult life. In response to these perturbations, changes in placental structure and function occur, which influence the supply of nutrients, oxygen, and methyl donors and alter the secretion of hormones and other signaling molecules into the fetal circulation. Thus, the placenta plays a critical role in modulating maternal-fetal resource allocation, thereby affecting fetal growth and the long-term health of the offspring.
