Previous studies have shown that human airway epithelial cells (AEC) can stimulate allogeneic peripheral blood T-lymphocyte (PBT) proliferation. We now sought to determine which AEC surface molecule/T-cell coreceptors are involved in this process. AEC-induced PBT proliferation was inhibited by 25 microM genestein or herbamycin A (0.9 and 1.8 microM), both tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots performed on PBT lysates after coculture with AEC demonstrated phosphorylation of 56kD and 60kD bands. To determine whether CD3 associated p59fyn, or CD4 and CD8 associated p56lck phosphotyrosine kinases (PTK) were involved, we assayed kinase activity in lymphocyte lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-p56lck and p59fyn mAbs. PBT cells or murine T-cell line transfectants expressing human CD4 (3G4) or human CD8alpha (3G8) were cocultured with AEC or A549, an alveolar-like cell line lacking class II Ag expression. After A549 or AEC coculture, p56lck activity in PB T-cells peaked at 2 min whereas p59fyn kinase activity continued to rise at 8 min. AEC (expressing class II Ags) stimulate PTK activity in both 3G8 and 3G4 cells. A549 stimulated p56lck in 3G8, but not in 3G4 cells. This activation of p56lck was not blocked by preincubation of A549 with anti-class I or anti-CD1d mAbs. An antibody generated in our laboratory, which recognizes an epithelial specific surface molecule (mAb L12) and which blocks AEC driven PBT proliferation, was shown to block PTK activity of peripheral blood T-cell lysates, though not of 3G8 lysates. These studies suggest that AEC are capable of stimulating CD4 and CD8 associated lck and CD3 associated fyn kinases through class II dependent and independent pathways.
