The characteristics in seedling development, vegetative growth and fruit ripening of Epinastics (Epi) mutant overproducing ethylene and its wild type VFN8 tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) were systematically investigated. Epi overproduced ethylene during vegetative growth and fruit development. Incomplete triple response in etiolated seedling, strong petiole episnasty in adult plant, and accelerated abscission and fruit ripening displayed enhanced ethylene response, consistent with the known mode of ethylene response. Significant apical dominance and compact vegetative shape in Epi suggested an important role of ethylene in the regulation of apical dominance. The characteristics such as inhibited apical hook formation in etiolated seedling and delayed senescence of leaves and petals in Epi, which were not typical of symptoms induced by ethylene, suggest that different growth and developmental characteristics are possibly regulated through different signal transduction pathways.
