Laminin-111, a multifunctional matrix protein, has diverse biological functions. Previously, we have identified various biologically active sequences in laminin-111 by a systematic peptide screening. We also demonstrated that peptide-conjugated chitosan matrices enhance the biological functions of the active sequences and are useful as a scaffold. Here, we conjugated sixty biologically active laminin-111 peptides onto chitosan matrices. The twenty-nine peptide-chitosan matrices promoted various biological activities, including cell attachment, spreading, and neurite outgrowth. The biological activities of peptide-chitosan matrices depend on the peptide. These peptide-chitosan matrices are categorized into six groups depending on their biological activities. Next, we conjugated five active peptides, which showed strong cell attachment activity in the each group, onto a single chitosan matrix to mimic the multiple activities of laminin-111. The mixed peptides-chitosan matrix significantly promoted cell attachment and cell spreading over that observed with the individual peptides. We also demonstrated that a mixed peptides-chitosan matrix, using four neurite outgrowth-promoting peptides each from a different group, enhanced the activity. These data suggest that the mixed peptides synergistically induce laminin-like biological activities on a chitosan matrix. The active peptides-chitosan matrices described here have potential for use as biomaterial for tissue engineering and regeneration.
