We have explored the possible involvement of the phosphoinositide (PI) cycle and protein kinase C (PKC) in the phytochrome (Pfr)-mediated light signal transduction pathway using nitrate reductase (NR) and phytochrome-I (PhyI) genes as model systems. We have shown earlier that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) completely replaces the red light effect in stimulating nitrate reductase activity and transcript levels in maize. In this paper, we present detailed evidence to show that PMA mimics the red light effect and follows similar kinetics to enhance NR steady-state transcript accumulation in a nitrate-dependent manner. We also show that PMA inhibits phyI steady-state transcript accumulation in a manner similar to red light, indicating that a PKC-type enzyme(s) may be involved in mediating the light effect in both cases. Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), a stimulator of PI turnover, was also found to mimic the red light effect in enhancing NR transcript levels and inhibiting phyI transcript accumulation, indicating the role of the PI cycle in generating second messengers for regulating the two genes. These results indicate that phytochrome-mediated light regulation of NR and phyI gene expression may involve certain common steps in the signal transduction pathway such as the PI cycle and protein phosphorylation by a PKC-type enzyme.
