Acidocalcisomes of Trypanosoma cruzi are acidic calcium-containing organelles rich in phosphorus in the form of pyrophosphate (PP(i)) and polyphosphate (poly P). Acidification of the organelles is driven by vacuolar proton pumps, one of which, the vacuolar-type proton pyrophosphatase, is absent in mammalian cells. A calcium ATPase is involved in calcium uptake, and an aquaporin is important for water transport. Enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of PPi and poly P are present within the organelle. Acidocalcisomes function as storage sites for cations and phosphorus, participate in PP(i) and poly P metabolism and volume regulation and are essential for virulence. A signalling pathway involving cyclic AMP generation is important for fusion of acidocalcisomes to the contractile vacuole complex, transference of aquaporin and volume regulation. This pathway is an excellent target for chemotherapy as shown by the effects of phosphodiesterase C inhibitors on parasite survival.
