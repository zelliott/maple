c-fos gene has a close relationship with the osteoblasts. Mechanical signal effect on osteoblasts would change the expression level of c-fos. Authors introduce the signal pathways of four cis-response elements on the promoter of c-fos, that is, CRE (cAMP responsive element), FAP-1 (Fbs-AP-1 site), SRE (serum response element), and SIE (sis-inducible element), as the regulatory mechanism for c-fos gene expression following various stimuli.
