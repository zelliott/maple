Endothelium is a single layer of cells lining each blood vessel that accomplishes a vast variety of specialized functions, which variations are implicated in the development of many cardiovascular diseases. Mitochondria are found in most human cells, however the ATP synthesis in endothelium occurs in a major part via a glycolytic pathway. The relatively slight dependence of endothelial cells on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation could suggest that mitochondria play no significant role in endothelium. Several recent observations clearly indicate that endothelial mitochondria not only can contribute to ATP generation but also are involved in maintaining the fine regulatory balance among mitochondrial calcium concentration, reactive oxygen species production and NO production. The endothelial mitochondria may function as a sensor of alternations in the local environment, contributing to survival of endothelial cells under oxidative stress. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species are significant signaling molecules in endothelium. Endothelial mitochondria may play a central role in many cardiovascular disease.
