The hematopoietically expressed product of the vav proto-oncogene, Vav, shared homology with guanine nucleotide releasing factors (GRFs) [also called guanosine diphosphate-dissociation stimulators (GDSs)] that activate Ras-related small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins. Human T cell lysates or Vav immunoprecipitates possessed GRF activity that increased after T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-CD3 triggering; an in vitro-translated Vav fragment that contained the putative GRF domain was also active. Vav-associated GRF stimulation after TCR-CD3 ligation paralleled its tyrosine phosphorylation; both were blocked by a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor. Vav also was a substrate for the p56lck PTK. Thus, Vav is a PTK-regulated GRF that may be important in TCR-CD3-initiated signal transduction through the activation of Ras.
