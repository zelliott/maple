The ability of the closely related beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenergic receptors (AR) to form hetero-oligomers was assessed by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. Quantitative bioluminescence resonance energy transfer titration curves revealed that the beta(2)AR has identical propensity to hetero-oligomerize with the beta(3)AR than to form homo-oligomers. To determine the influence of heterooligomerization, a HEK293 cell line stably expressing an excess of beta(3)AR over beta(2)AR was generated so that all beta(2)AR are engaged in hetero-oligomerization with beta(3)AR, providing a tool to study the effect of hetero-oligomerization on beta(2)AR function in the absence of any beta(2)AR homooligomer. The hetero-oligomerization had no effect on the ligand binding properties of various beta(2)AR ligands and did not affect the potency of isoproterenol to stimulate adenylyl cyclase. Despite the unaltered ligand binding properties of the beta(2/3)AR hetero-oligomer, the stable association of the beta(2)AR with the beta(3)AR completely blocked agonist-stimulated internalization of the beta(2)AR. Given that the beta(3)AR is resistant to agonist-promoted endocytosis, the results indicate that the beta(3)AR acted as a dominant negative of the beta(2)AR endocytosis process. Consistent with this notion, the beta(2/3)AR hetero-oligomer displayed a lower propensity to recruit beta-arrestin-2 than the beta(2)AR. The hetero-oligomerization also led to a change in G protein coupling selectivity. Indeed, in contrast to beta(2)AR and beta(3)AR, which regulate adenylyl cyclase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity through a coupling to G(s) and G(i/o), no G(i/o) coupling was observed for the beta(2/3)AR hetero-oligomer. Together, these results demonstrate that hetero-oligomerization between beta(2)AR and beta(3)AR forms a beta-adrenergic signaling unit that possesses unique functional properties.
