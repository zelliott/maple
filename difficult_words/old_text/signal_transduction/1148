The present study deals with the investigation of mechanisms involved in the synergistic interaction between epinephrine and arachidonic acid (AA).

Venous blood was taken from healthy human volunteers reported to be free of medications for one week. Platelet aggregation was monitored at 37 degree using Dual-channel Lumi-aggregometer. The resulting aggregation was recorded for 5 min by the measurement of light transmission as a function of time.

The data show that a synergism in platelet aggregation mediated by subthreshold concentrations of epinephrine (1 micromol/L) and AA (0.2 micromol/L) was inhibited by the alpha2-receptor antagonist (yohimbine, IC50)=0.6 micromol/L) and an inhibitor of AA-cyclooxygenase (COX), indomethacin (IC50=0.25 micromol/L). In examining receptor influence on intraplatelet signalling pathways, it was found that the synergistic effect was inhibited by calcium channel blockers, verapamil (IC50=0.4 micromol/L) and diltiazem (IC50=2.5 micromol/L), as well as by low concentrations of inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC) (U73122; IC50=0.2 micromol/L) and mitogens activated protein kinase (MAPK) (PD 98059; IC50=3.8 micromol/L). Herbimycin A, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine light chain kinase (TLCK), showed inhibition at IC50 value of 15 micromol/L, whereas chelerythrine, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, had no effect up to 20 micromol/L.

These data suggest that synergism between epinephrine and AA in platelet aggregation is triggered through receptors coupled to G-protein, which in turn, activate PLC, COX, and MAP kinase-signaling pathways.
