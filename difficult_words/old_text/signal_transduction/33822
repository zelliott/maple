To effectively defeat viral infection, a mammalian host must detect the presence of viruses and activate a robust antiviral response, which is mediated by cytokines known as type I interferons (IFNs). Much excitement has been generated by the discovery of the retinoic acid-induced gene 1-like helicase (RLH) pathway, which detects RNA-containing viruses in the cytoplasm and activates the type I IFN response. A study now describes a role for the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated death domain (TRADD) in the antiviral response and sheds new light on how the RLH signaling complex is organized upon viral infection.
