Thioredoxins are a class of small redox-regulating proteins that appear to play a crucial role in many oxidative stress-inducible degenerative diseases. A recent study demonstrated a reduction of thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) protein in the ischemic reperfused myocardium. When the same heart was adapted to ischemic stress by preconditioning with repeated cyclic episodes of small duration of ischemia and reperfusion, there was an increased induction of Trx1 expression. Inhibition of Trx1 expression resulted in reduced postischemic ventricular recovery and increased myocardial infarct size in the preconditioned heart. Corroborating these findings, transgenic mouse hearts overexpressing Trx1 were resistant to ischemic reperfusion injury as compared with the hearts from wild-type mice. Thus, it appears that thioredoxin plays a crucial role in cardioprotection induced by preconditioning.
