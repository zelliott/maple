Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major global health problem, which has a grave morbidity and mortality. Over the past few decades, no effective systemic therapeutic modalities have been established for patients with the unresectable HCC in advanced stage. Sorafenib is a small molecule that blocks cancer cell proliferation by targeting the intracellular signaling pathway at the level of Raf-1 and B-Raf serine-threonine kinases, and exerts an anti-angiogenic effect by targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, 2 and 3, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta tyrosine kinases. Recently, two clinical successful applications, SHARP and Asia-Pacific trial, of multikinase inhibitor sorafenib represent a significant advance in the treatment of advanced HCC patients without a curative chance. However, because the results of clinical trials show diverse responses in a subset of HCC patients, a molecular classification of HCC through the excavation of specific biomarkers related to its biological behavior is necessary for sorting HCC patients to each group with a biological homogeneity, ultimately leading to the most suitable individualization of molecular targeted therapy in HCC.
