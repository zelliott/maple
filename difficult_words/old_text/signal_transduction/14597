To reveal the biological and pathological roles of anti-GM1 antibody in Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), we examined its effects on nerve growth factor (NGF) induced TrkA autophosphorylation (NGF-TrkA signaling) in PC12 cells, a sympathetic nerve cell line. The NGF-TrkA signaling is enhanced by exogenous GM1 ganglioside and this phenomenon is regarded as one of the functional aspects of GM1. The IgGs purified from patients' sera inhibited the NGF-TrkA signaling in GM1 pre-incubated PC12 cells. The degrees of inhibition by IgGs from patients paralleled their immunological reactivity to GM1. In addition, the IgGs also inhibited the neurite outgrowth of NGF-treated PC12 cells. Immunoglobulins in the rabbit sera, which were immunized by GM1, also caused a similar suppressive phenomenon. These results suggested that the anti-GM1 antibody could play roles in pathophysiology in anti-GM1 antibody positive GBS through interfering with the neurotrophic action of NGF and GM1 mediated signal modulation including NGF-TrkA signaling. It is suggested that the modulation of GM1 function is one important action of antibodies and could be one of the important mechanisms in GBS.
