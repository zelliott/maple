Over the past decade, the Notch signaling pathway has been shown to be crucially important for normal metazoan development and to be associated with several human inherited and late onset diseases. The realization that altered Notch signaling contributes at various levels to human disease lead in May to the first meeting dedicated solely to Notch signaling in vertebrate development and disease in Madrid, Spain. Hosted by the Cantoblanco Workshops on Biology and organized by Tom Gridley, José Luis de la Pompa and Juan Carlos Izpisúa Belmonte, the meeting covered diverse aspects of this important signaling pathway.
