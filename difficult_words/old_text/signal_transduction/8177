Development of the central nervous system is coordinated by intercellular signalling centres established within the neural tube. The isthmic organizer (IsO), located between the midbrain and anterior hindbrain, is one such centre. Important signal molecules secreted by the IsO include members of the fibroblast growth factor and Wnt families. These signals are integrated with dorsally and ventrally derived signals to regulate development of the midbrain and rhombomere 1 of the hindbrain. The IsO is operational for a remarkably long period of time. Depending on the developmental stage, it controls a variety of processes such as cell survival, cell identity, neural precursor proliferation, neuronal differentiation and axon guidance. This review focuses on the fibroblast growth factor signalling, its novel molecular regulatory mechanisms and how this pathway regulates multiple aspects of cell behaviour in the developing midbrain and anterior hindbrain.
