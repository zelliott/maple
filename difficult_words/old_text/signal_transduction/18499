Population and environmental pressure have imposed a great challenge on agriculture in China to explore innovative and effective solutions to its pressing plant nutritional problems. Plant nutriomics is a new frontier in plant biology that can provide innovative solutions for improving plant nutrient efficiency, thus increasing crop productivity through genetic and molecular approaches.

This review summarizes current efforts and progress in plant nutriomic research in China with examples from several case studies. It also points out potential obstacles and depicts future perspectives in this emerging frontier of plant nutrition.

Although plant nutriomics is still at a conceptual stage, substantial efforts are being made in China aimed at increasing plant nutrient efficiency through a nationwide, co-ordinated project on plant nutriomics. Future studies involving both national and international collaborations are needed to develop nutrient-efficient, stress-tolerant and high-quality crop varieties for both China and elsewhere.
