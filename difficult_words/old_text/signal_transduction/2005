The importance of Jak-Stat pathway signaling in regulating cytokine-dependent gene expression and cellular development/survival is well established. Nevertheless, advances continue to be made in defining Jak-Stat pathway effects on different cellular processes and in different organisms. This review focuses on recent advances in the field and highlights some of the most active areas of Jak-Stat pathway research.
