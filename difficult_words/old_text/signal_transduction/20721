Phosphatidic acid (PA) induced a rapid dose-dependent increase in production of inositol phosphates in cultured adult human keratinocytes, peaking at 30 s. Natural and dioleoyl PA were equally effective, while other phospholipid classes had no effect. Lipid A was also active. Lyso-PA also induced inositol phosphate production, but contamination of the PA preparation by lyso-PA could not account for the effect of PA. The effect of PA could not be reproduced by treatment of cells with calcium ionophore. PA-induced inositol phosphate production could be inhibited (> 50%) by pre-treatment of cells with either pertussis toxin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, suggesting the involvement of a GTP-binding protein and a protein kinase C-mediated negative feedback mechanism. PA also stimulated release of arachidonic acid from keratinocytes. Treatment of cells with exogenous phospholipase D similarly induced inositol phosphate production in the keratinocytes. Since PA may be formed by receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase D, or by phosphorylation of diacylglycerol, the results suggest that PA may play a significant role in signalling mechanisms of human keratinocytes.
