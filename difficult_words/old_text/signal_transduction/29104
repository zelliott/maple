We investigated the role of Src family kinases (SFKs) in the regulation of STAT activation in myeloid leukemia cells. Two of 6 AML cell lines displayed constitutive STAT5 activation, whereas four cell lines had constitutive SFK activity. Treatment with the SFK inhibitors suppressed STAT5 activation and decreased viability. Akt phosphorylation and Mcl-1 expression decreased after SFK inhibition accompanied by apoptosis induction. In primary AML specimens, SFK inhibitors suppressed proliferation in 5 of 14 specimens. These data indicate that Src-STAT5 and Src-Akt pathways are integral survival signal pathways in AML cells. Src inhibition may represent a novel treatment strategy for investigation in AML.
