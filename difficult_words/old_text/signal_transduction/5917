Although peptidoleukotriene (LTC4, LTD4) receptors have been characterized by radioligand binding studies, pathways of transmembrane signaling by activated leukotriene receptors remain obscure. We employed [3H]LTD4 binding studies and fluorescent measurements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) and pH to identify LTD4 receptors and mechanisms of transmembrane signaling in cultured human mesangial cells. Mesangial cells expressed a single class of saturable, specific binding sites for [3H]LTD4. Kinetic, competition, and saturation analyses gave an average KD of approximately 12.0 nM with a Bmax of 987 fmol/mg protein. LTC4 competed with high affinity for [3H]LTD4 binding sites, as did LTB4 but with much lower affinity. [3H]LTD4 binding was blocked by a specific LTD4 receptor antagonist, SKF 102922. LTD4 and LTC4 also evoked a rapid (2-3 s), transient increase in intracellular [Ca2+], followed by a second, sustained increase. The transient phase was independent of extracellular Ca2+, whereas the sustained phase was dependent on extracellular Ca2+. Intracellular [Ca2+] was unaffected by LTB4. The LTD4-stimulated Ca2+ transients were dose dependent (1 nM-1 microM) and, similar to [3H]LTD4 binding, Ca2+ transients were inhibited by LTD4 receptor antagonists. We also report evidence that LTD4 affects intracellular pH and activates Na+-H+ exchange. Specifically, LTD4 induced an initial acidification within 1-2 min, followed by net alkalinization at 5 min. Alkalinization was due to activation of an amiloride-inhibitable Na+-H+ exchanger. LTD4 receptors were apparently not coupled to adenylate cyclase or phospholipase A2 as we detected no changes of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) or prostanoids. Thus we conclude that [3H]LTD4 binding sites on human mesangial cells are coupled to a Ca2+-signaling system and Na+-H+ exchange. Moreover LTD4, a potent inflammatory mediator, failed to stimulate cAMP or prostaglandin E2/prostaglandin I2, two counterregulatory autacoids that preserve normal mesangial function.
