Cardiac contraction is regulated by a number of Ca(2+)-mediated processes. Here we consider the effects of modification imposed on the Ca(2+)-signalling mechanism by evolutionary developments and transgenic manipulations. Ca(2+)-signalling appears to be mediated via influx of Ca2+ through the DHP receptor in preference to the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange protein, and activates the ryanodine receptor and the Ca2+ release from the SR. Here we report on functional consequences of overexpression of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger and calsequestrin. The data does not support a physiological role for the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger in signalling Ca2+ release, but can serve to modify ionic currents which determine the duration of the action potential.
