Growth hormone (GH) plays a significant role in normal growth and development. Signaling to the cell is believed to require growth hormone receptor (GHR) dimerization, which occurs following binding of a single growth hormone molecule to each of two receptors. We have developed human growth hormone receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies, one of which was used here to characterize hormone/receptor interactions. This antibody, GHR05, is directed against the hinge spanning subdomains I and II of the receptor's extracellular region. Antibody binding to the cell surface receptor increases upon receptor binding to growth hormone, but not when it binds a mutant form, hGHG120R, which does not trigger receptor activation. Growth hormone binding thus appears to lead to a conformational change in the receptor epitope recognized by GHR05, giving rise to the active dimer configuration, necessary for signal transduction. Using a chimeric receptor-expressing, growth hormone-dependent murine cell line, we find that GHR05 binds to the receptor in the absence of human GH and delivers a signal leading to cell proliferation. Finally, GHR05 treatment of IM-9 cells, a human cell line expressing a functional human GHR, leads to cell proliferation mediated by the generation of GH-specific signals, including phosphorylation of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase and activation of STAT5.
