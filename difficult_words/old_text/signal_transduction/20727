Cellular oscillations of cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) have been observed in many cell types in response to cell surface receptor agonists acting through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). In a number of cases where appropriate spatial and temporal resolution have been used to examine these [Ca2+]i oscillations, they have been found to be organized as repetitive waves of Ca2+ increase that propagate through the cytosol of individual cells. In some cases Ca2+ waves also occur as a single pass through stimulated cells. This review discusses the factors underlying the spatial organization of [Ca2+]i signals in the form of Ca2+ waves. In addition, potential mechanisms for the initiation and subsequent propagation of these Ca2+ waves are described.
