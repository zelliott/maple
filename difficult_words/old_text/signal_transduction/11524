Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) encodes a type III secretion system that is required for virulence during the intestinal phase of infection. The expression of SPI1 genes is controlled by many global regulatory pathways that affect the expression/activity of transcriptional regulators encoded on SPI1.
