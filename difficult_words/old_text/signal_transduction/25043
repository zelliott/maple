The Seventh International Cytokine Society Meeting, held in December 1999 at Hilton Head, provided once more an ideal setting for an intense discussion and remodeling of concepts regarding the biology and molecular biology of cytokines and chemokines. Approximately 400 scientists gathered at the beach-side resort, forgoing the beauty of the ocean to listen to their colleagues in the field, in a program ably organized by Jan Vilcek, Scott Durum, Bruce Beutler and Ann Richmond. Here, we attempt to cover some of the highlights on gene regulation, T helper cell differentiation, signal transduction, receptor trafficking, chemokines, apoptosis, disease models, and new cytokines.
