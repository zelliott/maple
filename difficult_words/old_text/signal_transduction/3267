Microtubule-based mRNA transport participates in the establishment of cell asymmetries. An in vitro reconstitution assay demonstrates that localization signals present in an mRNA influence motor copy number on single RNA molecule cargoes, ultimately leading to highly polarized distributions of transcripts.
