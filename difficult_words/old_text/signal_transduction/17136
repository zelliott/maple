By integrating stress signals with inputs from other cellular organelles, eukaryotic mitochondria are dynamic sensing systems that can confer substantial impact on innate immune signaling in both health and disease. This review highlights recently discovered elements of innate immune receptor signaling (TLR, RLR, NLR, and CLR) associated with mitochondrial function and discusses the role of mitochondria in the initiation and/or manifestation of inflammatory diseases and disorders. We also highlight the role of mitochondria as therapeutic targets for inflammatory disease.
