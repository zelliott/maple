We previously demonstrated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces a several-fold increase in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and the steady-state level of ODC mRNA in cultured SV40-transformed human keratinocytes (1). Pretreatment of cell cultures with ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation resulted in a reduction of EGF-induced ODC activity. To determine whether UVB inhibits the accumulation of ODC mRNA by EGF, cells were pretreated with 20 mJ/cm2 UVB or sham-irradiated and then incubated with 100 ng/ml EGF. Northern blot analysis revealed that UVB irradiation entirely blocked the EGF induction of ODC mRNA. Since the binding of EGF to its plasma membrane receptor is the first step in initiating a biological response, the effect of UVB on EGF binding was evaluated. UVB treatment of cultured keratinocytes resulted in an immediate and dose-dependent reduction of EGF binding. Scatchard analysis revealed that the reduction of EGF binding was due to a 52% decrease in the number of available receptors, from 6.2 x 10(4)/cell to 3.0 x 10(4)/cell. However, UVB decreased the EGF-binding affinity very little (Kd = 0.60 nM in control and Kd = 0.75 nM in UVB-treated Z114 cells). In addition, UVB did not alter the rate of EGF internalization. These data suggest that UVB blocks the signal transduction pathway of EGF that is involved in regulation of ODC gene expression. Immunoblot analysis of extracts from irradiated cells showed that UVB induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and that the quantity of EGFR protein was unaffected by UVB treatment. Phosphorylation of EGFR may be responsible for decreased binding of EGF to its receptor.
