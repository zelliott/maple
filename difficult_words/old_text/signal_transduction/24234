T cell antigen receptor-induced signals are required for normal T cell development and function. Recent studies have investigated the mechanism(s) by which signals of different strengths are converted into distinct cellular fates during thymocyte development. These studies indicate the importance of the strength and duration of signals activated through PLC and PKC pathways in shaping the mature TCR repertoire.
