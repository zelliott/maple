As personalized medicine becomes more applicable to oncologic practice, image-guided biopsies will be integral for enabling predictive and pharmacodynamic molecular pathology. Interventional radiology has a key role in defining patient-specific management. Advances in diagnostic techniques, genomics, and proteomics enable a window into subcellular mechanisms driving hyperproliferation, metastatic capabilities, and tumor angiogenesis. A new era of personalized medicine has evolved whereby clinical decisions are adjusted according to a patient's molecular profile. Several mutations and key markers already have been introduced into standard oncologic practice. A broader understanding of personalized oncology will help interventionalists play a greater role in therapy selection and discovery.
