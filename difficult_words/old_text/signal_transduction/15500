Bone is a connective tissue and guarantees protection and support of organ function. Contrary to the common view, bone is a dynamic tissue that constantly undergoes turnover in order to maintain stability and integrity. In this process called bone turnover or bone remodelling, two effector cell types are involved. Osteoclasts, specialised for bone resorption, and osteoblasts, responsible for bone formation, are key players in bone turnover. In the past decade, a lot of information about signal pathways, osteoblast-osteoclast communication and osteoclast activation concerning bone remodelling has arisen. In this publication, we aim to review molecular and biochemical insights with respect to the bone remodelling process. The bone remodelling process is of fundamental importance for craniofacial growth, orthodontic tooth movement and regenerative dentistry.
