The thromboxane A(2) receptor (TP), one of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), consists of two splicing variants, TPalpha and TPbeta, which differ in their C-terminal regions. In the present study, we investigated whether TPalpha and TPbeta formed homo- or hetero-dimers and whether the dimerization changed the function of TP. The immunofluorescent analysis using human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing either FLAG-tagged TPalpha or TPbeta showed that TPalpha is mainly distributed on plasma membranes and TPbeta existed on plasma membranes and within the cells. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis using HEK293 cells expressing both TPalpha and TPbeta showed that TPalpha and TPbeta formed homo- and hetero-dimers. U46619, a TP agonist, caused phosphoinositide hydrolysis and elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) in a concentration-dependent manner in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing TPalpha or TPbeta. The responses were observed to a greater extent in the cells expressing TPalpha than TPbeta. In the cells expressing both TPalpha and TPbeta, U46619-induced responses were observed to a lesser extent than in the cells expressing TPalpha alone. Furthermore, [(3)H]SQ29548 binding showed that the level of the cell surface expression of TP was the following order: the cells expressing TPalpha > TPalpha and TPbeta > TPbeta. These results indicate that TPalpha and TPbeta formed homo- and hetero-dimers, and TP-mediated signaling may be regulated by the hetero-dimer.
