The production of a viable oocyte is dependent upon the critical influences of gonadotrophins on follicular development, granulosa cell maturation, ovulation, and luteinization. While the effects of LH and FSH are due in large part to cyclic AMP-dependent signalling mechanisms, it is clear that a number of other factors modulate the actions of gonadotrophins on the ovary via activation of alternative signalling pathways. In this regard, recent studies indicate that the second messenger guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) mediates a wide range of influences on the ovary. Nitric oxide (NO) is a major regulator of cGMP production via its action on soluble guanylyl cyclase, while natriuretic peptides activate receptors with intrinsic guanylyl cyclase activities. In addition, other factors known to influence ovarian functions are now recognized to act via NO/cGMP pathways. This report will review these previous findings and present new data demonstrating the inhibitory influence of cGMP on cAMP-stimulated LH receptor expression in cultured granulosa cells.
