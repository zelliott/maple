The c-Src kinase regulates cancer cell invasion through inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation 1 (ID1). Src and ID1 are frequently overexpressed in human lung adenocarcinoma. The current study aimed at identifying microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the Src-ID1 signaling in lung cancer. Incubation of lung cancer cells with the Src inhibitor saracatinib led to the upregulation of several miRNAs including miR-29b, which was the most highly upregulated miRNA with predicted binding to the ID1 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Luciferase reporter assays confirmed direct binding of miR-29b to the ID1 3'-UTR. Expression of miR-29b suppressed ID1 levels and significantly reduced migration and invasion. Expression of antisense-miR-29b (anti-miR-29b), on the other hand, enhanced ID1 mRNA and protein levels, and significantly increased lung cancer cell migration and invasion, a hallmark of the Src-ID1 pathway. The ectopic expression of ID1 in miR-29b-overexpressing cells was able to rescue the migratory potential of these cells. Both, anti-miR-29b and ID1 overexpression diminished the effects of the Src inhibitors saracatinib and dasatinib on migration and invasion. Saracatinib and dasatinib decreased c-Myc transcriptional repression on miR-29b and led to increased ID1 protein levels, whereas forced expression of c-Myc repressed miR-29b and induced ID1. In agreement, we showed direct recruitment of c-Myc to the miR-29b promoter. miR-29b was significantly downregulated in primary lung adenocarcinoma samples compared with matched alveolar lung tissue, and miR-29b expression was a significant prognostic factor for patient outcome. These results suggest that miR-29b is involved in the Src-ID1 signaling pathway, is dysregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and is a potential predictive marker for Src kinase inhibitors.
