Our laboratory focuses on the study of the molecular regulation of T lymphocyte homeostasis, particularly as it relates to immunological tolerance, apoptosis, and autoimmune diseases. Through intense molecular research on the regulation of lymphocyte fate, the Fas receptor and other tumor necrosis factor receptors as well as their ligands have emerged as key regulators of T lymphocyte apoptosis. We are studying genetic abnormalities of this death pathway, particularly in the context of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and other non-ALPS conditions affecting lymphocyte homeostasis. These studies have led to further investigations of the regulation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, the molecular basis for programed cell death and viral cytopathicity, mechanisms of autoimmunity, and the regulation of mature T-cell tolerance. Our investigations promise to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the regulation of immune response and contribute to the development of novel diagnostic and treatment methods for autoimmune diseases.
