Pituitary gonadotropins are critical regulators of gonadal development and function. Expression and secretion of the mature hormones are regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is itself secreted from the hypothalamus. GnRH stimulation of gonadotropin expression and secretion occurs through the G-protein-linked phospholipase C/inositol triphosphate intracellular signaling pathway, which ultimately leads to protein kinase C (PKC) activation and increased intracellular calcium levels. Transcription factors mediating the effects of GnRH-induced signals on transcription of gonadotropin genes have not yet been identified. Recent studies have identified key factors involved in luteinizing hormone beta (LHbeta) gonadotropin gene transcription: the nuclear receptor SF-1, the bicoid-related homeoprotein Ptx1 (Pitx1), and the immediate-early Egr-1 gene. We now show that GnRH is a potent stimulator of Egr-1, but not Ptx1 or SF-1, expression. Further, Egr-1 activation of the LHbeta promoter is specifically enhanced by PKC, in agreement with a role for Egr-1 in mediating a GnRH effect on transcription. Egr-1 interacts directly with Ptx1 and with SF-1, leading to an enhancement of Ptx1- and SF-1-induced LHbeta transcription. Thus, Egr-1 is a likely transcriptional mediator of GnRH-induced signals for activation of the LHbeta gene.
