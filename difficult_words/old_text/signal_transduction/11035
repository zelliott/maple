The high incidence of overexpression of some members of the Rho family of GTPases in human tumors suggests that (1) these proteins are involved in cancer onset, and (2) they are potential candidates for a therapeutic intervention. In recent years, the characterization of downstream effectors to Rho GTPases has provided crucial clues on the general cellular effects that permit aberrant proliferation and adhesiveness of tumor cells. The activation of many of these effector proteins in turn results in the modulation of the activity of several transcription factors that play an important role at various levels of Rho signaling. The precise mechanisms by which Rho GTPases participate in carcinogenesis are still not fully understood. However, it is becoming more evident that the specific role of Rho overexpression in tumor initiation, progression and metastasis, as well as the nature and cause of such overexpression in specific human tumors (i.e., transient or stable; tumor environment-regulated; genetic or epigenetic) may be linked to the activation of specific signaling pathways that result in transcriptional regulation. In this review, we summarize the functions of Rho proteins in the regulation of several transcription factors and their relationship to tumor biology.
