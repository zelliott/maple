Proteins containing a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) play pivotal roles in signal transduction leading to apoptosis and NF-kappaB activation and inflammation. Here we identify and characterize human and mouse CARD protein 6 (CARD6), CARD-containing proteins of unique structure. CARD6 associates with microtubules and interacts with receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-like interacting caspase-like apoptosis regulatory protein kinase (RICK), a CARD-containing member of the RIP family of protein kinases. These kinases are involved in multiple NF-kappaB signaling pathways important for innate and adaptive immune responses. Surprisingly, the CARDs of CARD6 and RICK were not required for their interaction; instead, mutational analysis revealed that the CARD of CARD6 negatively controls the association of these molecules. CARD6 also binds to RIP1, a RIP kinase homologue that lacks a CARD but contains a C-terminal death domain. Coexpression of RICK targets CARD6 to aggresomes via a mechanism that requires the CARD of RICK. Importantly, CARD6 expression has a synergistic effect on NF-kappaB activation induced by several independent signal transduction pathways. In summary, our results indicate that CARD6 is a regulator of NF-kappaB activation that modulates the functions of RIP kinase family members.
