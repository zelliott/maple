Breast cancer has a predilection for spreading to bone. Accumulating data suggest that the interactions between breast cancer cells and bone-resorbing osteoclasts mediated initially by bone-derived growth factors and consequently by RANKL in osteoblasts and RANK in pre-osteoclasts are critical to the development and progression of bone metastases. In addition, recent studies have revealed that breast cancer cells strongly express RANK and thereby can be directly influenced by osteoblast-derived RANKL. These results warrant the use of the humanized anti-RANKL neutralizing antibody (denosumab) as a specific and more effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of bone metastasis in breast cancer patients.
