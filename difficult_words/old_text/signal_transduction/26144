Signaling via pro-growth G protein coupled receptors triggers phosphorylation of HDAC5 on two serine residues (Ser₂₅₉ and Ser₄₉₈), resulting in nuclear export of HDAC5 and de-repression of downstream target genes. In the previous paper we reported the important role of PKD isozymes in the regulation of HDAC5 by phosphorylating Ser₄₉₈ of HDAC5 [Q.K. Huynh, T.A. Mckinsey, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 450 (2006) 141-148]. In the present paper, we provide evidence that PKCδ can directly phosphorylate Ser₂₅₉ of HDAC5. The evidence is based on the following facts (a) isolated kinase fraction from human failing heart tissues contained PKCδ that phosphorylated HDAC5 Ser₂₅₉ peptide and no significant activity was found for the unbound fraction after they were immunoprecipitated with PKCδ specific antibody; (b) specific inhibitors for PKCδ inhibited kinase activity from isolated fraction and recombinant human PKCδ with similar IC₅₀ values; (c) recombinant human PKCδ can directly phosphorylate full length Ser₂₅₉ HDAC5 protein and HDAC5 Ser₂₅₉ peptide. The results suggest that in addition to activation of protein kinase D isozymes by phosphorylating Ser₇₄₄ and Ser₇₄₈ at their activation sites, PKCδ may also play a role in the regulation of HDAC5 by phosphorylation of Ser₂₅₉.
