To date, not much has been known regarding the role of CD80 and CD86 molecules in signaling of B cells. The CD28/CTLA4 ligands, CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), are expressed on the surface of freshly isolated splenic B cells, and their expression is up-regulated by lipopolysaccharides. In the present study, we have investigated whether signaling via CD80/CD86 could alter the proliferation and immunoglobulin synthesis of B cells. Splenic B cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides in the presence of anti-B7-1 (16-10A1) and anti-B7-2 (GL1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Exciting features observed during the study were that cross-linking of CD86 with GL1 enhanced the proliferation and production of IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes. In contrast, anti-B7-1 (16-10A1) mAb could efficiently block the proliferation and production of IgG1 and IgG2a. Furthermore, GL1 mAb could also induce the secretion of IgG isotypes from B cell lymphomas. Importantly, 16-10A1 could retard the growth of lymphomas and favored the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic molecules caspase-3, caspase-8, Fas, FasL, Bak, and Bax and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-x(L). In contrast, GL1 augmented the level of anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-w and Bcl-x(L) and decreased the levels of pro-apoptotic molecule caspase-8, thereby providing a novel insight into the mechanism whereby triggering through CD80 and CD86 could deliver regulatory signals. Thus, this study is the first demonstration of a distinct signaling event induced by CD80 and CD86 molecules in B cell lymphoma. Finally, the significance of the finding is that CD80 provided negative signal for the proliferation and IgG secretion of normal B cells and B cell lymphomas. In contrast, CD86 encouraged the activity of B cells.
