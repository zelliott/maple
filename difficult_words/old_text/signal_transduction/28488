Dorsoventral patterning in Drosophila has long been known to involve a cascade of proteases, held in the inactive zymogen state prior to signaling. At long last, the prediction that a protease inhibitor is involved in this pathway has been shown to be true, with the identification of a serpin that plays a key part in Drosophila embryonic patterning.
