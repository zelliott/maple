Evidence that the serotonergic neuronal system is associated with memory and learning is discussed. It is proposed that the serotonergic neuronal system has the capacity to generate very high oscillatory frequencies which propagate signals along the microtubule cytoskeletal structure of this neuronal system. A mechanism whereby the very high frequencies couple in a co-operative and synchronous fashion with sensory and event related signals in frequency specific channels is described. The specific and discrete frequency channels involve the receptor areas of serotonergic activity in a model of information storage and retrieval.
