The superoxide anion generation in Ehrlich ascites tumour (EAT) cells increased more than two-fold in the presence of the tumour promoter, tetradecanoyl phorbol myristate acetate (TPA). Epinephrine and dibutryl cAMP (Bt2 cAMP) inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, both basal and TPA-triggered superoxide generation in EAT cells. The kinetics of inhibition of superoxide generation showed a maximum inhibition between 30 and 40 min of preincubation with epinephrine or Bt2 cAMP of EAT cells and coincided with an increase in activity of a phosphoprotein phosphatase. In TPA-treated EAT cells, epinephrine or Bt2 cAMP increased the phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro EGTA, EDTA and sodium fluoride inhibited phosphatase activity. Superoxide generation in response to TPA in Triton-permeabilized EAT cells was inhibited by inclusion of the phosphatase in the assay. Taken together, these results clearly suggest that the phosphatase activity in EAT cells develops as a result of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of the phosphatase which then mediates dephosphorylation of the PKC-triggered phosphorylation of proteins to inhibit respiratory burst. A cross-talk between PKA and PKC pathways negatively modulates superoxide generation in EAT cells.
