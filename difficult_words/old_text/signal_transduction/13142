We show that treatment of cerebellar granules with interleukin-8 (IL-8), growth-related gene product beta (GRObeta) or AMPA induced activation of PI3-K/Akt and of ERK pathways, the latter being independent of PI3-K and dependent on PTX-sensitive G proteins. We also show that AMPA-mediated neuron survival was abolished both by ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 and AMPA-Rs blocker CNQX, and that chemokine-mediated survival was blocked by the PI3-K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin. We conclude that the neurotrophic effects of AMPA need the contemporary activation of ERKs and stimulation of AMPA-Rs, and that PI3-K/Akt activation is a determinant pathway for the IL-8/GRObeta anti-apoptotic activity.
