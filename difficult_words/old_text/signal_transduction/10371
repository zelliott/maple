The relative role of Btk-dependent B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in the induction of antipolysaccharide (anti-PS) and antiprotein immunoglobulin (Ig) responses to an intact extracellular bacterium in vivo is unknown. Btklow mice exhibit reduced BCR signaling but largely restore B-cell development. Btklow mice immunized with intact Streptococcus pneumoniae elicit reduced anti-PS but normal antiprotein Ig responses. Immunization of Btklow mice with PS-protein conjugate in saline results in an even more profound defect in the anti-PS but not antiprotein response, which is largely restored by use of a CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotide as an adjuvant. These data demonstrate a greater dependence on Btk-mediated BCR signaling for physiologic anti-PS relative to antiprotein responses, as well as the existence of a compensatory Toll-like-receptor-mediated signaling pathway naturally triggered in response to intact bacterial pathogens.
