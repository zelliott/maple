Our aim was to investigate the influence of silencing poly-(ADP-ribose)glycohydrolase (PARG) in human colon carcinoma LoVo cells on the ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration, proliferation and its possible mechanisms. PARG mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcriptase (RT) and real-time-PCR. PARG, poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), p38, p-p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p-ERK, nuclear factor (NF)-κB, phosphorylated IκBα (p-IκBα), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 expressions were detected by western blot. The influence of PARG-short hairpin (sh)RNA on the ability of HUVEC migration and proliferation were observed by transwell migration and Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Both RT-PCR and western blot results showed that the expression of PARG in PARG-shRNA cells was decreased and expressions of PARP, p38, p-p38, ERK, p-ERK, NF-κB, p-IκBα, VEGF, b-FGF, ICAM-1 and MMP-9 in those cells were lower than that in the untransfected and control-shRNA groups (P<0.05). Migration assay showed that migratory inhibition rate for HUVEC was decreased (55.23%) in cocultured PARG-shRNA cells; moreover, CCK-8 assay showed that the proliferation of HUVECs cultured with the supernatant of PARG-shRNA cells was also comparatively lower. Hence, concluding that PARG silencing could inhibit the ability of HUVEC migration and proliferation by downregulating the activity of NF-κB in LoVo cells that in turn decreases angiogenic factors such as VEGF, b-FGF, ICAM-1, MMP-9, as well as phosphorylation of p38 and ERK.
