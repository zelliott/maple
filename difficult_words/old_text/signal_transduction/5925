To clarify the possible role of protein kinase C in the control of parathyroid hormone (PTH)-degrading activity (PTHDA) in a PTH-responsive opossum kidney (OK) cell line, we investigated the effects of protein kinase C activators, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (OAG), and 4 beta-phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate (4 beta-PDD). TPA, OAG, and 4 beta-PDD enhanced PTHDA in a dose-dependent fashion (10-50 ng/ml, 10-100 microgram/ml, and 10-50 nM, respectively), whereas 4 alpha-PDD, a non-activator of protein kinase C, did not affect it. HPLC analysis of TPA-treated samples revealed increase of all immunoreactive PTH fragments produced by OK cells. These findings suggested that activation of protein kinase C in OK cells would augment PTHDA in the cells.
