Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a role in heart morphogenesis and can initiate cardiomyogenesis in P19 cells. To determine if Hh signaling is essential for P19 cell cardiomyogenesis, we determined which Hh factors are expressed and the effect of Hh signal transduction inhibitors. Here, we find that the Hh gene family and their downstream mediators are expressed during cardiomyogenesis but an active Hh signaling pathway is not essential. However, loss of Hh signaling resulted in a delay of BMP-4, GATA-4, Gli2, and Meox1 expression during cardiomyogenesis. By using Noggin-overexpressing P19 cells, we determined that Hh signaling was not active during Noggin-mediated inhibition of cardiomyogenesis. Thus, there is cross talk between the Hh and BMP signaling pathways and the Hh pathway appears important for timely cardiomyogenesis.
