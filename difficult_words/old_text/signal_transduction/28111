Mechanisms underlying the divergent effects of ovarian hormones on neuron death induced by TNFalpha were investigated in differentiated PC12 cells (dPC12). dPC12 cells were exposed to 17beta-estradiol (E, 1.0 nm), progesterone (P, 100 nm), or a combination of both hormones for 0-72 h before treatment with TNFalpha (0-150 ng) to induce cell death. Cells undergoing apoptosis were identified by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting after 18 h. Cell death induced by TNFalpha was decreased 89% after E treatment and increased 2-fold after P treatment compared with cells treated with TNFalpha alone. Treatment with E for 24 h before TNFalpha exposure was required for maximum neuroprotection, whereas P-enhanced death was maximal after a 30-min P treatment. TNFalpha induced a 3-fold increased activity of c-JUN-N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1 in d PC12 cells within 20 min that could be increased 5- to 8-fold by P together with TNFalpha. A peptide inhibitor of JNK1 abrogated P enhancement of TNFalpha-mediated dPC12 death but had only a minimal effect on cell death by TNFalpha alone. Inhibition of caspase-8 activation reduced death induced by TNFalpha alone but was much less effective for P+TNF. P alone did not activate caspase-8. E increased estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and Bcl-xL expression and all but abolished TNFalpha receptor 1 (TNFR1) expression. P decreased ERalpha and Bcl-xL expression and doubled TNFR1 expression. These data suggest that P regulates apoptosis or survival through augmentation of JNK signaling and altered TNFR1 expression, whereas E mainly affects the expression of BCL-xL, TNFR1, and ERalpha.
