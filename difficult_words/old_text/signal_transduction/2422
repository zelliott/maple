The CD40 pathway plays a critical role at many levels of the sensitization and effector phases of allograft rejection. In addition to the important signaling role of this pathway for T cell help and effector function, recent evidence suggests that the CD40 pathway can directly co-stimulate T cells, independently of its effect on the B7-CD28 pathway.
