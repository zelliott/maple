The adipose-derived plasma protein, adiponectin (APN), has various protective effects on cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we show that endogenous APN is required for full cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction by ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart in vivo. In rat neonatal cardiac myocytes, APN-induced COX-2 expression was reduced by treatment with a sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK-1) inhibitor or siRNA targeting SphK-1. Treatment with a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor antagonist also diminished COX-2 expression in response to APN stimulation. These findings suggest that APN is a physiological regulator of COX-2 signaling in the heart and that this regulation occurs in part via a SphK-1-S1P receptor dependent mechanism in cardiac myocytes.
