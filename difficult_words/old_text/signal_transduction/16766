The efficiency of neural circuits can be enhanced not only by increasing synaptic strength but also by increasing neuronal intrinsic excitability. Three major types of activity-dependent long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) have been well defined: decreased action potential (AP) threshold, reduced afterhyperpolarization (AHP), and attenuated dendritic propagation. The ionic basis and induction pathways for these three types of LTP-IE have been largely revealed recently. These intrinsic plasticities and their cooperation enrich the functions fulfilled by neurons, and may serve as a supplementary mechanism for learning and memory.
