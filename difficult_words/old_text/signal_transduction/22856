In relation to the activation of the Src-family of tyrosine kinases during early morphogenetic events of gastrulation in Xenopus, we have identified two multiprotein complexes. The first complex, including RasGAP, p190 RhoGAP and p62, was previously characterized in murine fibroblasts overexpressing c-Src or transformed by v-Src and has been correlated with cytoskeleton remodelling. A second complex, not identified in other models includes tyrosine-phosphorylated p66SHC, Grb2, RasGAP and p190 RhoGAP. The association with p66SHC, considered as a negative regulator of ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), p120RasGAP and p190RhoGAP, suggests a possible mechanism for coupling Ras and Rho signalling pathways. The interaction of RasGAP and p190 RhoGAP in two multiprotein complexes could constitute an additional level of Rho regulation during morphogenetic events of gastrulation.
