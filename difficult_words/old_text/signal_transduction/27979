The low-affinity receptor for IgG, FcgammaRIIb, negatively regulates B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-mediated proliferative signalling. FcgammaRIIb has been reported to mediate this inhibition by uncoupling the BCR from the RasMAPkinase pathway. We now show that FcgammaRIIb-mediated negative feedback inhibition also correlates with induction of an Erk-associated phosphatase activity that reflects the rapid association of Erk and the MAPkinase phosphatase, Pac-1, and dephosphorylation and inactivation of ErkMAPkinase. This mechanism of abrogating ongoing ErkMAPkinase signalling therefore provides a rationale for rapid immune-complex-mediated feedback inhibition of active antigen-driven B cell responses. In addition, FcgammaRIIb signalling also induces the recruitment and activation of the 3'-inositol phosphatase, PTEN, which by antagonising PI 3kinase activity and inhibiting BCR-coupling to the anti-apoptotic kinase, Akt, provides an additional mechanism for FcgammaRIIb-mediated negative regulation of BCR-coupling to ErkMAPkinase, cell survival and proliferation.
