Mimetic peptides of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) present a new strategy for promoting the biological activity of high density lipoproteins (HDL). This study aimed to compare the anti-inflammatory effects of ETC-642, a new apoA-I mimetic peptide, with discoidal reconstituted HDL (rHDL).

New Zealand White rabbits (n=42) received daily infusions of saline, rHDL or discoidal complexes of an amphipathic peptide, ETC-642 (1-30 mg/kg), prior to insertion of non-occlusive carotid collars. Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) were pre-incubated with ETC-642 or rHDL before TNF-α stimulation. Monocyte adhesion was investigated by pre-incubating HCAECs with rHDL or ETC-642, stimulating with TNF-α and incubating with THP-1 monocytes.

Infusion of ETC-642 resulted in dose-dependent reductions of collar-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in the artery wall (p<0.05). Pre-incubation of HCAECs with ETC-642 and rHDL reduced TNF-α-induced THP-1 monocyte adhesion (p<0.01). Furthermore, ETC-642 and rHDL treatment reduced TNF-α induced mRNA levels of inflammatory markers VCAM-1, fractalkine, MCP-1 and the p65 subunit of NF-κB (p<0.05).

These studies demonstrate that ETC-642 exhibits anti-inflammatory properties that are comparable to apoA-I both in vivo and in vitro and that these effects are mediated via the NF-κB signaling pathway.
