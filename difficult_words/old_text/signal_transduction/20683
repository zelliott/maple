We prepared primary cultures of mouse astrocytes from the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and cerebellum to examine the possibility of regional disparity in binding of human atrial and porcine brain natriuretic peptides (hANP, pBNP) and their effect on cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production. 125I-hANP and 125I-pBNP bound in a specific and saturable manner to all three regions. For both peptides, Scatchard analysis suggested a single population of binding sites on astrocytes from all three regions. No significant differences were observed in the maximal binding capacities (Bmax) or binding dissociation constants (KD) between the two peptides in the astrocyte preparations from different regions. ANP and BNP also evoked cGMP stimulation in a similar, dose-dependent fashion in astrocytes from all three regions, with maximal responses to both peptides reached at a concentration above 1 microM. While BNP elicited a greater maximal cGMP accumulation than ANP, no difference could be demonstrated in the cGMP responses to either peptide between brain regions. Thus we have been unable to demonstrate regional heterogeneity in the responsiveness of astrocytes to ANP and BNP.
