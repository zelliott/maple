Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), a constituent of the outer membrane of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, exerts a wide variety of biological effects in humans. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying these activities and discusses structure-function relationships of the endotoxin molecule, its interaction with humoral and cellular receptors involved in cell activation, and transmembrane and intracellular signal transduction pathways.
