Morphological hallmarks of inflammatory and degenerative diseases of the brain are hypertrophy of astrocytes and accumulation of macrophages recruited from circulating blood monocytes and/or from resident macrophages, the so-called microglial cells. Recently, production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by astrocytes has been suggested to contribute to the macrophage response. Here we report that in addition to GM-CSF, murine astrocytes also produce macrophage (M)-CSF upon stimulation with tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 and lipopolysaccharides. The bioactivity detected in supernatant of astrocytes was characterized using the M-CSF-dependent cell line M-NFS-60 and neutralizing anti-M-CSF antibodies. RNase protection analysis showed M-CSF mRNA already in unstimulated astrocytes without striking up-regulation by the stimuli. Thus, in astrocytes the expression of the M-CSF gene is predominantly regulated at the posttranscriptional level.
