Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) remains an unresolved and complicated situation in clinical practice, especially in the case of organ transplantation. Several factors contribute to its complexity; the depletion of energy during ischemia and the induction of oxidative stress during reperfusion initiate a cascade of pathways that lead to cell death and finally to severe organ injury. Recently, the sirtuin family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylases has gained increasing attention from researchers, due to their involvement in the modulation of a wide variety of cellular functions. There are seven mammalian sirtuins and, among them, the nuclear/cytoplasmic sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and the mitochondrial sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) are ubiquitously expressed in many tissue types. Sirtuins are known to play major roles in protecting against cellular stress and in controlling metabolic pathways, which are key processes during IRI. In this review, we mainly focus on SIRT1 and SIRT3 and examine their role in modulating pathways against energy depletion during ischemia and their involvement in oxidative stress, apoptosis, microcirculatory stress and inflammation during reperfusion. We present evidence of the beneficial effects of sirtuins against IRI and emphasize the importance of developing new strategies by enhancing their action.
