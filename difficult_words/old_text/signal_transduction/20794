Molecules released or generated during microbial entry (elicitors) are recognized by components of plant cells, ultimately resulting in the induction of a battery of plant defense responses. The molecular mechanisms underlying these signaling systems, as well as the plant defense responses they control, are becoming increasingly well characterized.
