Rhabdomyosarcoma is a group of soft-tissue sarcomas that share features of skeletal myogenesis, but show extensive heterogeneity in histology, age and site of onset, and prognosis. This review matches recent molecular data with biological features of rhabdomyosarcoma. Alterations in molecular pathways, animal models, cell of origin and potential new therapeutic targets are discussed.
