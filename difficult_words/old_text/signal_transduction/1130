Recent success in the cloning of glycosyl-transferase genes involved in the synthesis of GSLs has enabled us to modulate the expression profiles of GSLs in cultured cells and experimental animals, and allowed novel approaches to obtain clear elucidation of individual enzyme products by observing the resulting phenotypic changes in the mutant animals and transfected cells. In this review, recent progress in the study of glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis and modification of GSLs has been summarized with special emphasis on their function.
