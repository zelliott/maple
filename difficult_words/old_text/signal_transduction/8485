To investigate the effect of total flavones from Cuscuta chinens is (TFCC) on proliferation of the first trimester human cytotrophoblast and its possible signal transduction pathway.

The first trimester human trophoblast cells were isolated by trypsin/Dnasel digestion and discontinuous Percoll density gradient centrifugation. After identified by immunocytochemistry to Cytokeratin 7 and Vimentin, the trophoblast cells appared to more than 95% pure. MTT Assay was used to evaluate the effect of TFCC in vitro viability/proliferation of the first trimster human cytotrophoblasts, The PCNA expression of the first rimester human cytotrophoblasts were analyzed by the way of flow cytopmetry. The pERK level of the first trimester human cytotrophoblasts was analyzed by the way of western blotting.

TFCC could promote viabilitylproliferation and PCNA expression of the first trimester human cytotrophobia in vitro, which could activate the ERK 1/2 in time-dependent and dosage-dependent manner.
