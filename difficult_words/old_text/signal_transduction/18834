cAMP-dependent signalling cascades regulate a number of CNS functions including brain inflammation processes. In this study, we characterized IL-1-induced IL-6 production in hippocampal cells using H19-7/IGF-IR cells and investigated the effect of changes in intracellular cAMP levels on IL-1 activity. IL-1 potently induced IL-6 mRNA expression with a corresponding increase in IL-6 release, in a time- and dose-dependent manner with a maximal at 24 h and with an EC50 value of 0.11 ng/ml. Cell pre-treatment with the IL-1sR antagonist produced a rightward shift of IL-1 dose-response effect with a corresponding decrease in IL-1 potency. IL-1-induced IL 6 release was attenuated in the presence of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 but was not significantly affected by the PKA inhibitor KT 5720. Western blotting analysis of phospho-CREB cell content showed a marked increase in CREB activation. Similar results were obtained by pharmacologically increasing cAMP using dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP) or the cAMP-specific type-4 phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram. Both dbcAMP and rolipram increased IL-6 production to about 50% of IL-1 effect. However, in the presence of IL-1, IL-6 production was further potentiated by either dbcAMP and rolipram, reaching 300% and 500% IL-1-induced levels. These data implicate the role of cAMP-dependent pathways on IL-6 production in neuronal cells and suggest novel synergistic mechanisms of regulation of cytokine production in brain.
