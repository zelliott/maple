Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are multipotent signaling molecules that belong to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. Developmentally these proteins promote endochondral bone formation and are involved in the cascade of body patterning and morphogenesis. Moreover, BMPs play an important role in the pathophysiology of several diseases, including osteoporosis, arthritis, pulmonary hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases, cancer and kidney diseases. In this review, BMP signaling and regulation, the pathophysiological role of BMP in kidney diseases and potential therapeutic applications have been discussed.
