The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible role of the AP-1 signaling cascade in the process of wasting associated with cancer cachexia at the level of skeletal muscle. The injection of virus containing the TAM67 protein (a blocker of the AP-1 protein) to the gastrocnemius muscle of tumour-bearing rats resulted in a significant recovery of the muscle mass (which is dramatically reduced as a result of tumour burden), therefore suggesting that AP-1 is certainly involved in the signaling associated with muscle protein accretion. In conclusion, the gene therapy approach presented here clearly suggests an important role for AP-1 in muscle signaling during catabolic states.
