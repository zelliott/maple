We found that SAPK/JNK was phosphorylated during X-ray-induced rapid cell death of MOLT-4 cells and that acid Sphingomyelinase inhibitor D609 suppressed the rapid cell death as well as phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK. Also C2-ceramide caused phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK, followed by rapid cell death. Further we isolated X-ray-resistant radiation-hybrid clones from MOLT-4 and 50 Gy irradiated mouse FM3A cells by repeated selections with 3 Gy irradiation. One of them named Rh-1a was found resistant to X-ray- as well as C2-ceramide-induced rapid cell death. Rh-1a cells had mouse DNA but no increase in either mouse or human Bcl-2 determined by Western blotting. Accumulation of p53 after X-irradiation was similarly observed in both parental MOLT-4 and Rh-1a cells. However, contrasting to prolonged and prominent phosphorylated status of SAPK/JNK in MOLT-4 cells, Rh-1a cells exhibited short transient increase and FM3A cells showed no increase of phosphorylated status SAPK/JNK after X-irradiation. Therefore, SAPK/JNK activation is considered important in X-ray-induced rapid cell death or apoptosis of MOLT-4 cells.
