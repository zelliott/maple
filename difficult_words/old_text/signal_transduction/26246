Skin homoeostasis is interrupted during UV-A irradiation. How the UV-A-altered skin components influences photoageing of skin should be investigated using human in vitro models that are important for understanding skin ageing. In this study, chromene compound, sargachromenol, was isolated from Sargassum horneri, and its potency on inhibition of photoageing was investigated in UV-A-irradiated dermal fibroblasts. Effects of sargachromenol on the prevention of photoageing were evaluated by measuring ROS production, membrane protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and ageing-related gene expression in UV-A-irradiated human skin dermal fibroblasts. The results indicated that treatment with sargachromenol suppressed the collagenase matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression without any cytotoxicity and phototoxicity. It was further found that these inhibitions were because of increase in the expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 genes. Furthermore, we confirmed that the UV-A-induced transcriptions of AP-1 signalling pathway were regulated by sargachromenol treatment in UV-A-irradiated dermal fibroblasts.
