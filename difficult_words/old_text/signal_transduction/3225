Considering that fibrin deposition is observed in glomerulonephritis as well as in diabetic nephropathy, we performed studies to clarify the roles of the coagulation pathway and the active type of coagulation factor X (factor Xa) in the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using animal models. Factor Xa activates various cell types through protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2). Several in vitro studies have demonstrated that PAR2 can mediate factor Xa signaling, but not thrombin signaling. Coagulation processes proceed together with the extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation through factor V expression in rat Thy-1 nephritis. DX-9065a, a factor Xa inhibitor, suppresses this type of glomerulonephritis. The factor Xa inhibitor danaparoid ameliorated proteinuria, cellular proliferation, and fibrin deposition in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered activation of High IgA (HIGA) strain of ddY mice. Another factor Xa inhibitor, fondaparinux, suppressed urinary protein, glomerular hypertrophy, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and ECM protein deposition together with angiogenesis in diabetic db/db mice. Finally, in the model of peritoneal fibrosis, fondaparinux treatment decreased the thickness of submesothelial fibrotic tissue and angiogenesis. In consideration of the results to potential human therapy, factor Xa regulation may be promising for the treatment of the aggravation in glomerulonephritis and of the early phase of diabetic nephropathy. In the near future, novel factor Xa inhibitors with the characteristics of oral administration and biliary elimination may appear in the clinical use for treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
