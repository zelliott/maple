We examine whether complement factor C3 or C5 is synthesized by human skin-derived mast cells and whether their synthesis is regulated by cytokines. C3 and C5 mRNAs were assessed by RT-PCR, and proteins by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, Western blotting, and ELISA. C3 and C5 mRNAs were each expressed, and baseline protein levels/10(6) cultured mast cells were 0.9 and 0.8 ng, respectively, and located in the cytoplasm outside of secretory granules. C3 accumulated in mast cell culture medium over time and by 3 d reached a concentration of 9.4 ± 8.0 ng/ml, whereas C5 levels were not detectable (<0.15 ng/ml). Three-day incubations of mast cells with IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-17, IFN-γ, IL-6, or anti-FcεRI did not affect C3 protein levels in culture medium, whereas incubations with PMA, TNF-α, IL-13, or IL-4 enhanced levels of C3 1.7- to 3.3-fold. In contrast with C3, levels of C5 remained undetectable. Importantly, treatment with TNF-α together with either IL-4 or IL-13 synergistically enhanced C3 (but not C5) production in culture medium by 9.8- or 7.1-fold, respectively. This synergy was blocked by attenuating the TNF-α pathway with neutralizing anti-TNF-α Ab, soluble TNFR, or an inhibitor of NF-κB, or by attenuating the IL-4/13 pathway with Jak family or Erk antagonists. Inhibitors of PI3K, Jnk, and p38 MAPK did not affect this synergy. Thus, human mast cells can produce and secrete C3, whereas β-tryptase can act on C3 to generate C3a and C3b, raising the likelihood that mast cells engage complement to modulate immunity and inflammation in vivo.
