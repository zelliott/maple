Studies in cultured cells have implicated protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTPalpha) as a potential regulator of insulin signaling. The physiological role of PTPalpha in insulin action was investigated using gene-targeted mice deficient in PTPalpha. PTPalpha-null animals had normal body weights and circulating levels of glucose and insulin in random fed and fasted states. In glucose and insulin tolerance tests, their efficiency of blood glucose clearance was comparable to wild-type mice. Kinetics and extents of insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation were similar in wild-type and PTPalpha(-/-) liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. However, the association of IRS-1 and PI 3-K was altered in PTPalpha(-/-) liver, with increased insulin-independent and reduced insulin-stimulated association compared to wild-type samples. This did not affect activation of the downstream signaling effector Akt. Our data indicate that PTPalpha is not a negative regulator of insulin signaling and does not perform an essential role in mediating the physiological action of insulin.
