PZR is an immunoglobulin superfamily cell surface protein containing a pair of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. As a glycoprotein, PZR displays a strong association with concanavalin A (ConA), a member of the plant lectin family. Treatment of several cell lines with ConA caused tyrosine phosphorylation of a major cellular protein. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation studies indicated that this protein corresponded to PZR. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR was accompanied by recruitment of SHP-2 and was inhibited by PP1, a selective inhibitor of the Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, c-Src was constitutively associated with PZR and was activated upon treatment of cells with ConA. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR was markedly enhanced in v-Src-transformed NIH-3T3 cells and was predominant in Escherichia coli cells co-expressing c-Src. Expression of an intracellular domain-truncated form of PZR in HT-1080 cells affected cell morphology and had a dominant negative effect on ConA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR, activation of c-Src, and agglutination of the cells. Together, the data indicate that PZR is a major receptor of ConA and has an important role in cell signaling via c-Src. Considering the various biological activities of ConA, the study of PZR may have major therapeutic implications.
