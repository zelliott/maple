Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that serve as second messengers for intracellular signaling. Currently, precise roles of individual ROS in the actions of TNF-alpha remain to be elucidated. In this report, we investigated the roles of superoxide anion (O-(2)), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) in TNF-alpha-triggered apoptosis of mesangial cells. Mesangial cells stimulated by TNF-alpha produced O-(2) and underwent apoptosis. The apoptosis was inhibited by transfection with manganese superoxide dismutase or treatment with a pharmacological scavenger of O-(2), Tiron. In contrast, although exogenous H(2)O(2) induced apoptosis, TNF-alpha-triggered apoptosis was not affected either by transfection with catalase cDNA or by treatment with catalase protein or glutathione ethyl ester. Similarly, although ONOO(-) precursor SIN-1 induced apoptosis, treatment with a scavenger of ONOO(-), uric acid, or an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, N(G)-nitro-L-argininemethyl ester hydrochloride, did not affect the TNF-alpha-triggered apoptosis. Like TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, treatment with a O-(2)-releasing agent, pyrogallol, induced typical apoptosis even in the concurrent presence of scavengers for H(2)O(2) and ONOO(-). These results suggested that, in mesangial cells, TNF-alpha induces apoptosis through selective ROS. O-(2), but not H(2)O(2) or ONOO(-), was identified as the crucial mediator for the TNF-alpha-initiated, apoptotic pathway.
