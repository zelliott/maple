It is technically demanding to make intracellular measurements of mechanoreception in intact arthropod cuticular receptors. Here we introduce a method for recording mechanically induced electrical events in a class of spider mechanoreceptors using single electrode voltage- or current-clamp. A concave piece of cuticle containing a mechanosensitive lyriform slit organ was dissected free and fixed with wax onto a specially designed holder. This holder-cuticle complex, filled with spider saline, allowed displacement of the slit membrane from below while simultaneously recording intracellularly from neurons of the organ through a thin saline film. Extracellular ion concentrations could be changed and ion channel blockers could be applied to the bath. The method promises to allow the investigation of the ion channels responsible for mechanically transduced receptor signals and spike encoding.
