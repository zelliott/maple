The correlation between the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and membrane potential in monolayers of density-arrested normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblasts was investigated. Using the fluorescent probe Fura-2, spontaneous repetitive spike-like increases in [Ca2+]i (Ca2+ spikes) were observed that were synchronised throughout the entire monolayer. Ca2+ spikes disappeared in Ca(2+)-free solutions and could be blocked by the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist felodipine. Simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+]i and membrane potential showed that these Ca2+ spikes were paralleled by depolarisations of the plasma membrane. Using patch clamp measurements, action potential-like depolarisations consisting of a fast spike depolarisation followed by a plateau phase were seen with similar kinetics as the Ca2+ spikes. The action potentials could be blocked by L-type Ca2+ channel blockers and were dependent on extracellular Ca2+. The plateau phase was predominantly determined by a Cl- conductance and was dependent on intracellular Ca2+. The presence of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels in NRK cells was confirmed by patch clamp measurements in single cells. It is concluded that monolayers of density-arrested NRK fibroblasts exhibit spontaneous Ca2+ action potentials leading to synchronised Ca2+ spiking. This excitability of monolayers of fibroblasts may represent a novel Ca2+ signaling pathway in electrically coupled fibroblasts, cells that were hitherto considered to be inexcitable.
