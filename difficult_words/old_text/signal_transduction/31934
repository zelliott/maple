Poxviruses, a type of ds-DNA viruses which mainly target at the epithelial cell, are the pathogens of human and animals. During the revolution of poxviruses, the viruses encode multiple proteins that regulate the immune system to monitor the viral reproductive cycle in host cells. The nuclear kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway is essential to signal transcription in the innate immune system. Therefore, poxviruses have adopted different strategies to elude immune detection and destruction regulated by NF-kappaB. Further research in this field would help us develop preventive and therapeutic preparation for pox. Given the renewed interest in poxvirus, we review the current understanding of how the various classes of poxviralimmunomodulatory proteins target and manipulate the NF-kappaB pathway.
