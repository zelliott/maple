The renal medulla, the inner compartment of the metanephric kidney, plays vital roles in the regulation of body water, electrolyte homeostasis, and systemic blood pressure. It is composed of the loops-of-Henle, the medullary collecting ducts, the vasa recta, and the medullary interstitium. Its epithelial and endothelial components display ordered spatial organization. This organization serves as the structural basis for its function in urine concentration. The urine concentration ability of a renal medulla is also related to its length among species. In this review, the current understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying renal medulla formation (elongation) is summarized, with a focus on the role of Wnt signaling in this developmental process. Renal medulla blunting and effacement is a common symptom of many renal and urological destructions. The knowledge in renal medulla formation should assist efforts in repair and regeneration of a damaged renal medulla, so to improve renal physiology in diseased situations.
