Study the influence of Erigeron breviscapus on collagen type I, matrix metalloproteinase1 (MMP1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase1(TIMP1) in human embryo lung fibroblast MRC-5 under hypoxia.

MRC-5 cultured in vitro were individed into 4 groups, including normoxia control, hypoxia, hypoxia and staurosporine (SP), hypoxia and erigeron breviscapus. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), pro-collal and phospho-smad2 (p-smad2) were evaluated by Western blot. The level of collagen type I, MMP1 and TIMP1 in supernatant fluid were detected by ELISA.

Expressed pro-collalpha1, p-smad2 in MRC-5 cells under nomoxia were detected, but not HIF-lalpha. A low level of collagen type I, MMP1 and TIMP1 was also detected in the cell supernatant. In nomoxia secreted pro-collalpha1, p-smad2, collagen type I , MMP1 and TIMP1, hardly secreted HIF-lalpha. Under hypoxia, the expression of all of them was increased when compared with those of under nomoxia condition (P < 0.05). MMP1 expression was significantly further upregluted by pre-cubation with SP in hypoxia, however collagen type I, TIMP1 in supernatant fluid and pro-collalpha1, p-smad2 in cells were inhibited (P < 0.05, vs. hypoxia group). Treated with Erigeron breviscapus (12. 5 microg/mL, 50 microg/mL) under hypoxia condition, significantly reduced expression of pro-collalpha1, p-smad2, HIF-1alpha in MRC-5 cells and collagen type I, MMP1, TIMP1 in supernatant fluid were observed (P < 0.05, vs. hypoxia).

Erigeron breviscapus can decrase the expression of HIF-1alpha of MRC-5 cells under hypoxia condition by inhibit the expression of collagen type I and TIMP1 partly through the Smad2 signaling pathways.
