To investigate the transcriptional regulation of pacemaker channel I(f) mediated by vasoactive peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and its mechanism.

Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were enzymatically isolated. I(f) current was recorded using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The expression of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN) isoforms HCN2 and HCN4 were measured by quantitative RT-PCR.

ET-1 increased the expression of HCN2 and HCN4 mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These effects were blocked by specific ETA receptor antagonist BQ-123 but not the ETB receptor antagonist BQ-788. The effects of ET-1 on HCN2 and HCN4 mRNA expression were not affected by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor (SB-203580).

These findings indicate that ET-1 stimulates the expression of pacemaker channel I(f) in cardiomyocytes via ETA receptor through a p38 MAPK-independent signaling pathway, which might be linked to the intrinsic arrhythmogenic potential of ET-1.
