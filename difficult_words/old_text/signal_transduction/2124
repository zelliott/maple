Since the discovery that at least one form of endothelium derived relaxing factor is nitric oxide (NO), numerous studies have uncovered diverse roles for this free radical in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. NO production, a process mediated by a family of enzymes termed NO synthases, has been detected in most cell types. Many of the effects of NO are thought to be mediated through its direct interaction with specific and defined cell signaling pathways. The nature of such interactions are highly dependent on the concentration of NO and cell type. Furthermore, specific NO derived reaction products, such as peroxynitrite, also have the potential to effect cell signal transduction events. As with NO, this can occur through diverse mechanisms and depends on concentration and cell type. It is perhaps not surprising that the reported effects of NO in different disease states are often conflicting. In this brief overview, a framework for placing these apparently disparate properties of NO will be described and will focus on the effects of NO and peroxynitrite on signaling pathways.
