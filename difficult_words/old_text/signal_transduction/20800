This review article briefly summarizes aspects of our current understanding of the Uhp sugar phosphate transport system in enteric bacteria, particularly the mode of genetic regulation of its synthesis. This regulation occurs by a process that involves an example of the very widespread and ever-growing group of so-called two-component bacterial regulatory systems, a mechanism of response to environmental signals that employs phosphate transfer reactions between constituent proteins. Of emphasis here is the unusual involvement in transmembrane signaling of the UhpC protein which is related in sequence and structure to some transport proteins, including the very protein whose synthesis it helps regulate.
