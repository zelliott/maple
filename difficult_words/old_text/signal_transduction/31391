Recent findings indicate that enhanced glucose uptake protects enterocytes from excessive apoptosis and barrier defects induced by LPS exposure. The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanisms responsible for increased sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-1 activity in enterocytes challenged with LPS. SGLT-1-transfected Caco-2 cells were incubated with LPS in high glucose media. LPS increased SGLT-1 activity in dose- and time-dependent fashion, and is due to increased V(max) of the cotransporter. Elevated apical expression of SGLT-1 was also demonstrated. This LPS-induced effect was colchicine-inhibitable, suggesting microtubule-dependent translocation of SGLT-1 onto apical surface. Immunofluorescence staining showed expression of CD14 on the apical surface, but no TLR-4, on these cells. Neutralizing anti-CD14 decreased the LPS-induced upregulation of SGLT-1 activity, whereas anti-TLR-4 had no effect. Pharmacological studies indicated that signaling for LPS-mediated SGLT-1 glucose uptake depends on caspase-8 and -9 activation, but occurs independently of caspase-3. The findings describe a novel feedback mechanism within the apoptotic signaling pathway for SGLT-1-dependent cytoprotection. The observation suggests a new function for CD14 on enterocytes, involving the induction of the caspase-dependent SGLT-1 activity, which ultimately leads to cell rescue. The understanding of these signaling events may shed light on enterocytic cytoprotection and homeostasis mechanism upon pro-apoptotic challenges.
