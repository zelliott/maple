Involvement of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in the growth response of colon cancer cells has been suggested.

To investigate the characteristics of PPARgamma induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells.

The effects of ligands for each of the PPAR subtypes (alpha, delta, and gamma) on DNA synthesis and cell viability were examined in HT-29 colon cancer cells. Modulation of apoptosis related gene expression by PPARgamma ligands was screened with cDNA arrays, and the results were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis.

PPARalpha, PPARdelta, and PPARgamma were all expressed in HT-29 cells. PPARgamma ligands, 15-deoxy-delta(12,)(14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and troglitazone (TGZ), suppressed DNA synthesis of HT-29 cells whereas ligands for PPARalpha and PPARdelta had no significant effects. Both 15d-PGJ2 and TGZ induced HT-29 cell death in a dose dependent manner which was associated with an increase in fragmented DNA and was sensitive to a caspase inhibitor. Among several genes selected by cDNA array screening, quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed downregulation of c-myc expression and upregulation of c-jun and gadd153 expression by 15d-PGJ2 and TGZ. PPARgamma induced apoptosis was antagonised by the presence of serum in the culture medium, and interaction between PPARgamma signalling and cell survival signalling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway was suggested.

As c-myc is an important target gene of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)/beta-catenin and/or APC/gamma-catenin pathway, activation of PPARgamma signalling appears to compensate for deregulated c-myc expression caused by mutated APC. The present results suggest the potential usefulness of PPARgamma ligands for chemoprevention and treatment of colon cancers.
