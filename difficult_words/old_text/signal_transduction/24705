The function of a carboxyl-terminal truncated version of the Xenopus activin receptor, encoded by a previously isolated gene XSTK2, was investigated in early embryos. The transcript corresponding to the truncated receptor gene was detected throughout embryonic development although the temporal expression pattern was different from that of an intact receptor. Injection of XSTK2 mRNA into early embryos resulted in the formation of a duplicated body axis. Mesoderm induction as evaluated by the activation of the alpha-actin gene in presumptive ectoderm (animal cap) treated with exogenous activin was significantly enhanced by the injection of XSTK2 mRNA. These results suggest that the truncated receptor is capable of transmitting the activin signal to the same extent as the native receptor.
