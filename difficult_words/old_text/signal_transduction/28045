Infectious entry of JC virus (JCV) into human glial cells occurs by receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent endocytosis. In this report we demonstrate that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocks virus entry and inhibits infection. Transient expression of dominant-negative eps15 mutants, including a phosphorylation-defective mutant, inhibited both virus entry and infection. We also show that the JCV-induced signal activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2. These data demonstrate that JC virus binding to human glial cells induces an intracellular signal that is critical for entry and infection by a ligand-inducible clathrin-dependent mechanism.
