T cell activation is triggered by the specific recognition of cognate peptides presented by MHC molecules. Altered peptide ligands are analogs of cognate peptides which have a high affinity for MHC molecules. Some of them induce complete T cell responses, i.e. they act as agonists, whereas others behave as partial agonists or even as antagonists. Here, we analyzed both early (intracellular Ca2+ mobilization), and late (interleukin-2 production) signal transduction events induced by a cognate peptide or a corresponding altered peptide ligand using T cell hybridomas expressing or not the CD8 alpha and beta chains. With a video imaging system, we showed that the intracellular Ca2+ response to an altered peptide ligand induces the appearance of a characteristic sustained intracellular Ca2+ concentration gradient which can be detected shortly after T cell interaction with antigen-presenting cells. We also provide evidence that the same altered peptide ligand can be seen either as an agonist or a partial agonist, depending on the presence of CD8beta in the CD8 co-receptor dimers expressed at the T cell surface.
