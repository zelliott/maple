This report reviews and illustrates ways in which some of the problems linked to excessive alcohol intake may develop from alcohol-induced alterations of eukaryotic cell surface molecules. Alcohol is the number one drug of abuse in the US, affecting at least 15 million Americans and causing annual losses of more than $80 billion and 100,000 lives. An estimated 20-40% of all persons admitted to general hospitals have alcohol-related problems and are often undiagnosed alcoholics being treated for the consequences of their drinking. Chronic alcohol-related cirrhosis of the liver is the ninth leading cause of death in the US, with over 28,000 deaths annually. Alcohol has harmful effects on almost every organ system in the body, producing cardiovascular disorders, liver disease, neuropathological illness and fetal injury. The etiologic mechanisms for these effects of alcohol is a research area of considerable importance to the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
