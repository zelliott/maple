c-Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase is an important component of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor signaling pathway. c-Src has been shown to mediate the mitogenic response to PDGF in fibroblasts. However, the exact components of PDGF receptor signaling pathway mediated by c-Src remain unclear. Here, we used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled with mass spectrometry to identify Src-family kinase substrates involved in PDGF signaling. Using SILAC, we were able to detect changes in tyrosine phosphorylation patterns of 43 potential c-Src kinase substrates in PDGF receptor signaling. This included 23 known c-Src kinase substrates, of which 16 proteins have known roles in PDGF signaling while the remaining 7 proteins have not previously been implicated in PDGF receptor signaling. Importantly, our analysis also led to identification of 20 novel Src-family kinase substrates, of which 5 proteins were previously reported as PDGF receptor signaling pathway intermediates while the remaining 15 proteins represent novel signaling intermediates in PDGF receptor signaling. In validation experiments, we demonstrated that PDGF indeed induced the phosphorylation of a subset of candidate Src-family kinase substrates - Calpain 2, Eps15 and Trim28 - in a c-Src-dependent fashion.
