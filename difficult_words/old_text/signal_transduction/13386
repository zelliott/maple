Follitropin and the follitropin receptor are essential for normal gamete development in males and females. This review discusses the molecular genetics and structural and cellular biology of the follitropin/follitropin receptor system. Emphasis is placed on the human molecules when possible. The structure and regulation of the genes for the follitropin beta subunit and the follitropin receptor is discussed. Control of systemic and cellular protein levels is explained. The structural biology of each protein is described, including protein structure, motifs, and activity relationships. Finally, the follitropin/follitropin receptor signal transduction system is discussed.
