Phage display is a powerful strategy for identifying protein-peptide interactions. Glutathione transferases (GSTs) play prominent roles in the cellular protection against oxidative stress by catalyzing detoxication reactions. In addition, GSTs seem to act in signaling pathways by means of interaction with other macromolecules such as protein kinases. This chapter describes how the technique of peptide phage display can be used to identify possible partners in GST-protein complexes.
