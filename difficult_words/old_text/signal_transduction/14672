The past two years have seen an explosion in the structural understanding of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery that facilitates the trafficking of ubiquitylated proteins from endosomes to lysosomes via multivesicular bodies (MVBs). A common organization of all ESCRTs is a rigid core attached to flexibly connected modules that recognize other components of the MVB pathway. Several previously unsuspected key links between multiple ESCRT subunits, phospholipids and ubiquitin have now been elucidated, which, together with the detailed morphological analyses of ESCRT-depletion phenotypes, provide new insights into the mechanism of MVB biogenesis.
