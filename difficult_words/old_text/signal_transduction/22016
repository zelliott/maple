Microglial hyperactivity contributes to neuronal damage resulting from CNS injury and disease. Therefore, a better understanding of endogenous microglial receptor systems that can be exploited to modulate their inflammatory functions is important if better, neuroprotective therapeutics are to be designed. Previous studies from our lab and others have demonstrated that the P2X7 purinergic receptor agonist BzATP attenuates microglial inflammatory mediator production stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), suggesting that purinergic receptors may be one such receptor system that can be used for manipulating microglial activation. However, although P2X7 receptor activation is well recognized to regulate processing and release of cytokines, little is known concerning its role in regulating the transcription of inflammatory genes, nor the molecular mechanisms underlying these transcriptional effects. In the present studies, we identify that the transcription factors early growth response (Egr)-1, -2 and -3 are downstream signaling targets of P2X7 receptors in microglia, and that their activation is sensitive to MEK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors. Moreover, using RNAi, we demonstrate that Egr factors and P2X7 receptors are necessary for BzATP-mediated attenuation of iNOS, and stimulation of TNF-Î± and IL-6 gene expression. BzATP also attenuates neuronal death induced by LPS conditioned medium, and P2X7 receptors are required for this effect. These studies are the first to identify Egr factors as regulators of inflammatory gene expression following P2X7 receptor activation, and suggest that P2X7 receptors may utilize the MAPK-Egr pathway to exert differential effects on microglial inflammatory activities which are beneficial to neuron survival.
