TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α) is an extensively studied pleiotropic cytokine associated with the pathogenesis of a variety of inflammatory diseases. It elicits a wide spectrum of cellular responses which mediates and regulates inflammation, immune response, cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis. TNFα initiates its responses by binding to its receptors. TNFα-induced effector responses are mediated by the actions and interactions among the various intracellular signalling mediators in the cell. TNFα induces both survival and apoptotic signal in a TRADD (TNF receptor-associated DD)-dependent and -independent way. The signals are further transduced via a variety of signalling mediators, including caspases, MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases), phospholipid mediators and miRNA/miR (microRNA), whose roles in specific functional responses is not fully understood. Elucidating the complexity and cross talks among signalling mediators involved in the TNFα-mediated responses will certainly aid in the identification of molecular targets, which can potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutics to treat TNFα-associated disorders and in dampening inflammation.
