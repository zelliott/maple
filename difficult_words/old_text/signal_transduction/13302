Through selective disruption of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity and the use of green fluorescent protein tagged derivatives of domains capable of specifically binding the lipid products of PI3Ks in vivo, it has been shown that this family of signalling enzymes have vital and distinct roles in chemotaxis, phagocytosis and phagosome maturation in leukocytes.
