For recombinant xylose-utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ethanol yield and productivity is substantially lower on xylose than on glucose. In contrast to glucose, xylose is a novel substrate for S. cerevisiae and it is not known how this substrate is recognized on a molecular level. Failure to activate appropriate genes during xylose-utilization has the potential to result in sub-optimal metabolism and decreased substrate uptake. Certain differences in fermentative performance between the two substrates have thus been ascribed to variations in regulatory response. In this study differences in substrate utilization of glucose and xylose was analyzed in the recombinant S. cerevisiae strain TMB3400. Continuous cultures were performed with glucose and xylose under carbon- and nitrogen-limited conditions. Whereas biomass yield and substrate uptake rate were similar during carbon-limited conditions, the metabolic profile was highly substrate dependent under nitrogen-limited conditions. While glycerol production occurred in both cases, ethanol production was only observed for glucose cultures. Addition of acetate and 2-deoxyglucose pulses to a xylose-limited culture was able to stimulate transient overflow metabolism and ethanol production. Application of glucose pulses enhanced xylose uptake rate under restricted co-substrate concentrations. Results are discussed in relation to regulation of sugar metabolism in Crabtree-positive and -negative yeast.
