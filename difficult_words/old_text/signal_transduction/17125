The pancreatic islet β cell senses circulating levels of calorigenic nutrients to secrete insulin according to the needs of the organism. Altered insulin secretion is linked to various disorders such as diabetes, hypoglycemic states, and cardiometabolic diseases. Fuel stimuli, including glucose, free fatty acids, and amino acids, promote insulin granule exocytosis primarily via their metabolism in β cells and the production of key signaling metabolites. This paper reviews our current knowledge of the pathways involved in both positive and negative metabolic signaling for insulin secretion and assesses the role of established and candidate metabolic coupling factors, keeping recent developments in focus.
