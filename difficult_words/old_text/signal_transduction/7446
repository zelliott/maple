Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILR) are cell surface molecules that regulate the activities of myelomonocytic cells through the balance of inhibitory and activation signals. LILR genes are located within the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) on chromosome 19q13.4 adjacent to KIR genes, which are subject to allelic and copy number variation (CNV). LILRB3 (ILT5) and LILRA6 (ILT8) are highly polymorphic receptors with similar extracellular domains. LILRB3 contains inhibitory ITIM motifs and LILRA6 is coupled to an adaptor with activating ITAM motifs. We analysed the sequences of the extracellular immunoglobulin domain-encoding regions of LILRB3 and LILRA6 in 20 individuals, and determined the copy number of these receptors, in addition to those of other members of the LILR family. We found 41 polymorphic sites within the extracellular domains of LILRB3 and LILRA6. Twenty-four of these sites were common to both receptors. LILRA6, but not LILRB3, exhibited CNV. In 20 out of 48 human cell lines from the International Histocompatibility Working Group, LILRA6 was deleted or duplicated. The only other LILR gene exhibiting genomic aberration was LILRA3, in this case due to a partial deletion.
