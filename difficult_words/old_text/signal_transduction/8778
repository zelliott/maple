In earlier studies, we had suggested that the fasting signal induces TR4 orphan nuclear receptor expression in vivo. The detailed mechanism(s), however, remain unclear. In this study, we found that cAMP/PKA, the mediator of fasting and glucagon signals, could induce TR4 gene expression that in turn modulates gluconeogenesis. Mechanistic dissection by in vitro studies in hepatocytes demonstrated that cAMP/PKA might trigger C/EBP alpha and beta binding to the selective cAMP response element, which is located at the TR4 promoter, thus inducing TR4 transcription. We also demonstrated that the binding activity of C/EBPs to the TR4 promoter is increased in response to cAMP treatment. Together, our data identified a new signaling pathway from the fasting signal --> cAMP/PKA --> C/EBP alpha and beta --> TR4 --> gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes; and suggested that TR4 could be an important regulator to control glucose homeostasis. The identification of activator(s)/inhibitor(s) or ligand(s) of TR4 may provide us an alternative way to control gluconeogenesis.
