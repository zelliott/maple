Thrombin is a coagulation protease that activates platelets, leukocytes, endothelial and mesenchymal cells at sites of vascular injury, acting partly through an unusual proteolytically activated G-protein-coupled receptor. Knockout of the gene encoding this receptor provided definitive evidence for a second thrombin receptor in mouse platelets and for tissue-specific roles for different thrombin receptors. We now report the cloning and characterization of a new human thrombin receptor, designated protease-activated receptor 3 (PAR3). PAR3 can mediate thrombin-triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis and is expressed in a variety of tissues, including human bone marrow and mouse megakaryocytes, making it a candidate for the sought-after second platelet thrombin receptor. PAR3 provides a new tool for understanding thrombin signalling and a possible target for therapeutics designed selectively to block thrombotic, inflammatory and proliferative responses to thrombin.
