We reported previously that Ets2 is expressed in normal and transformed macrophages. We show here that the expression of both c-ets-2 mRNA proteins is induced rapidly and transiently in chicken nondividing bone marrow-derived macrophages but not in E26-transformed myeloblasts in response to chicken myelomonocytic growth factor (cMGF), an avian hematopoietic growth factor required for survival, proliferation, and colony formation of avian myeloid cells. c-ets-2 expression is also rapidly induced in chicken bone marrow-derived macrophages, human monocytes, and mouse peritoneal macrophages in response to LPS and/or PKC activators. The rapid induction of Ets2 after treatment of chicken bone marrow-derived macrophages by cMGF is blunted after down-regulation or inactivation of PKC, suggesting a role of PKC in the cMGF-induced signal transduction pathway. Because Ets2 is localized in the nucleus of macrophages and binds to DNA in vitro, the kinetics of its expression suggest a role for Ets2 in the transduction within the nucleus of specific signals received at the cell membrane and involved in securing the survival and/or the development of functional competence of these cells.
