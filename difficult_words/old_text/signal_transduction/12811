Nf1(-/-) fetal liver cells were used to reconstitute B and T cells in Rag-1(-/-) mice. Lymphocyte development was largely unimpaired in the absence of neurofibromin. However antigen-receptor induced proliferation was defective in neurofibromin deficient peripheral B cells and CD4(+) single positive thymocytes. In contrast to its role as a negative regulator of proliferation in many other cell types, neurofibromin may be a positive regulator of lymphocyte proliferation. Peripheral B cells exhibited circumscribed defects in anti-IgM induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which may contribute to the unexpected proliferative defect seen in these cells.
