Sonic hedgehog (Hh) developmental pathway deregulation has been proven to play an essential role in several malignancies as neuroblastoma. We found that Hh signaling is active in neuroblastoma, as most pathway components, including GLI1, were expressed in cell lines and tumor samples. Furthermore, SHH ligand expression was found in cell lines and tumors, and GLI1 up-regulation was achieved in response to SHH treatment, suggesting an autocrine mechanism of aberrant activation. A decrease of proliferation and tumorigenic potential, as well as increased apoptosis and a dramatic decrease in the percentage of CD15+ cell population were produced upon Hh inhibition by cyclopamine.
