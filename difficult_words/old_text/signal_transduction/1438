In cultures of rat neonatal cerebellar granule cells the signal transduction at ionotropic NMDA-sensitive glutamate receptors (GC1) was measured as an increase of influx of 45Ca2+. This transmitter-mediated influx of Ca2+ was enhanced by glycine and D-serine in a dose-dependent manner. D-Alanine was less active than glycine and D-serine, while L-alanine and L-serine were inactive. These amino acids failed to activate basal influx of Ca2+. Activation of calcium influx at GC2 receptors by kainate was unchanged by the amino acids mentioned above. Glycine and D-serine increased the potency but failed to change the efficacy of GC1 agonists. This action was not changed by strychnine. The enhancement of aspartate signal transduction by glycine and D-serine was inhibited by the noncompetitive GC1 receptor antagonist, phencyclidine, but was even more evident in presence of Mg2+ ions. Hence, glycine and D-serine may function as positive allosteric modulators of signal transduction at NMDA-sensitive (GC1) glutamate receptors.
