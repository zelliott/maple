Death receptors in the TNF receptor superfamily signal for apoptosis via the ordered recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 to a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). However, the nature of the protein-protein interactions in the signaling complex is not well defined. Here we show that FADD self-associates through a conserved RXDLL motif in the death effector domain (DED). Despite exhibiting similar binding to both Fas and caspase-8 and preserved overall secondary structure, FADD RDXLL motif mutants cannot reconstitute FasL- or TRAIL-induced apoptosis and fail to recruit caspase-8 into the DISC of reconstituted FADD-deficient cells. Abolishing self-association can transform FADD into a dominant-negative mutant that interferes with Fas-induced apoptosis and formation of microscopically visible receptor oligomers. These findings suggest that lateral interactions among adapter molecules are required for death receptor apoptosis signaling and implicate self-association into oligomeric assemblies as a key function of death receptor adapter proteins in initiating apoptosis.
