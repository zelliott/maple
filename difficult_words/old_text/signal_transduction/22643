An in vitro model was developed for the study of signal transduction between a Cu-wire, miming a neural signal source, and recording electrodes on perforated silicon chips. Phosphorous doped electrodes were used to achieve an all silicon device. The model was used to study signal amplitude as a function of the spatial position, and distance to the signal source. Recordings of the signal crosstalk to neighboring electrodes on the chips were made. It was found that the amplitude decreased by a factor of two at a distance of 50 microns between the electrode surface and the signal source. The chip electrode signal crosstalk was found to be 6 dB using an external reference electrode. Improvements were accomplished with an on chip reference electrode giving a crosstalk suppression of 20 dB. Impedance analysis showed that doped silicon electrodes displayed similar characteristics as Cu-electrodes at frequencies above 3 kHz. Sieve electrodes were implanted in the rat sciatic nerve and following a 10-week nerve regeneration period the dorsal and ventral (L5) roots in the spinal cord were stimulated. Compound action potentials were recorded via the chip. Stimulating the regenerated sciatic nerve via the sieve electrode also induced lower leg muscle contraction activity.
