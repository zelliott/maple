To study the mechanism responsible for alteration of T cell response in IDDM patients.

T cells from peripheral blood of IDDM patients were activated by anti-TCR antibodies. The level of TCR-mediated signaling pathway was analyzed.

T cells from IDDM patients responded weakly to anti-TCR antibody-induced proliferation, as compared with T cells from normal subjects (P < 0.05). The defect could be partially remedied by the addition of rIL-2, while the anti-CD28 antibody stimulation did not restore the proliferative response of anti-TCR-induced cells from IDDM patients (P = 0.03).

Unresponsiveness of the T cells from IDDM patients to anti-TCR antibody may result from a defect in the signaling pathway, the CD28 co-stimulation-signaling pathway is normal. Defect in the TCR signaling pathway increases the sensitivity of T cells from IDDM patients to apoptosis or anergy.
