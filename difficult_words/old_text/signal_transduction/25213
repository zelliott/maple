In platelets, alpha(IIb)beta(3) exists in a form that cannot bind adhesive proteins in the plasma; although it can interact with immobilized fibrinogen it cannot interact with immobilized von Willebrand factor in the vessel wall. Soluble agonists such as thrombin convert alpha(IIb)beta(3) to a form that recognizes soluble and immobilized ligands. Attempts to reconstitute alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation in a non-hematopoietic, nucleated cell system have been unsuccessful. In the present study, we have developed a transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell model in which alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation is induced by signaling across glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX by its ligand, von Willebrand factor. GPIb-IX activates not only the transfected alpha(IIb)beta(3) but also endogenous alpha(v)beta(3). Activation of the pathways leading to integrin activation occurred even in cells transfected with GPIb-IX lacking the domain on GPIbalpha that binds 14-3-3 or that which binds actin-binding protein. These studies demonstrate that signals induced by interaction of GPIb-IX with von Willebrand factor lead to alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation and suggest that the signaling pathways by which GPIb-IX induces alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation are different to those used by thrombin. Elucidation of these differences may provide insights into therapeutic ways in which to inhibit integrin activation in selective clinical settings.
