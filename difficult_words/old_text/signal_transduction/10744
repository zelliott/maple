Pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha (TNF) production from in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human peripheral blood CD14+ cells (PB-CD14) was inhibited by A2A adenosine receptor (AdoR) (A2AR) or beta2 adrenergic receptor (ADR) (beta2R) signaling in a concentration-dependent manner. These inhibitory effects were presumably mediated by the increase in intracellular cAMP. Furthermore A2AR agonist and beta2R agonist synergistically inhibited the TNF production of LPS-stimulated PB-CD14 cells. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of extracellular adenosine is, at least in part, due to the modification of the cytokine milieu via A2A signaling, and that the targeting of both A2AR and beta2R may have strong therapeutic potential for the inflammatory diseases.
