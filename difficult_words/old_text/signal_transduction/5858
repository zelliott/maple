Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops most often in a background of chronic inflammatory liver injury from viral infection or alcohol use. Most HCCs are diagnosed at a stage at which surgical resection is not feasible. Even in patients receiving surgery rates of recurrence and metastasis remain high. There are few effective HCC therapies and hence a need for novel, rational approaches to treatment. Platelet derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR-alpha) is involved in tumor angiogenesis and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment and has been implicated in development and metastasis of HCC.

To examine PDGFR-alpha as a target for therapy of HCC and explore opportunities and strategies for PDGFR-alpha inhibition.

A review of relevant literature.

Targeted inhibition of PDGFR-alpha is a rational strategy for prevention and therapy of HCC.
