Ventromedial hypothalamus lesions in rats induce hyperphagia and hyperinsulinaemia associated with a rapid growth of white adipose tissue resulting in massive obesity. It has been shown previously that at an early stage after the lesion, during the dynamic phase of obesity, the white adipose tissue is hyper-responsive to insulin. In the present work, we show that the effects of insulin on the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor and on its tyrosine-kinase activity towards endogenous substrates are similar in intact adipocytes of control and ventromedial hypothalamus lesioned rats. One week after the lesion, the expression of phosphatidylinisitol 3-kinase and RAF-1 kinase, evaluated by Western-blotting, was similar in control and ventromedial hypothalamus lesioned rats. In contrast, an important increase in the expression of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 protein was observed in white adipose tissue of ventromedial hypothalamus lesioned compared to control animals. No difference in the expression of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 mRNA was observed in adipose tissue of control and ventromedial hypothalamus lesioned rats, suggesting that a posttranscriptional mechanism is involved in the over-expression of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1. The kinase activity of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 is also markedly increased in adipocytes of ventromedial hypothalamus lesioned compared to control rats, both in the basal state and after insulin stimulation. Six weeks after the ventromedial hypothalamus lesion, this increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase expression and activity was still observed in adipocytes of ventromedial hypothalamus lesioned rats. These results suggest that an early and sustained increase in the expression and activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase may participate in the development of white adipose tissue in ventromedial hypothalamus lesioned rats.
