The fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a powerful model to study innate immunity against intracellular pathogens. To combat infection, the fly relies on multiple lines of defense, many of which are shared with mammals and arthropod vectors of human diseases. In addition to conserved immune pathways, the ease of performing sophisticated genetic screens has allowed the identification of novel host immune factors and novel pathogen virulence factors. Recently, some groups have exploited this to simultaneously analyze the host and pathogen genetics of intracellular infection. This review aims to unravel the Drosophila immune response against intracellular pathogens, highlighting recent discoveries.
