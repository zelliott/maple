Entry of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium into host cells requires membrane ruffling and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Here, it is shown that the bacterial protein SipA plays a critical role in this process. SipA binds directly to actin, decreases its critical concentration, and inhibits depolymerization of actin filaments. These activities result in the spatial localization and more pronounced outward extension of the Salmonella-induced membrane ruffles, thereby facilitating bacterial uptake.
