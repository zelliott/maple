Hibernation in mammals is a reversible state of suspended animation associated with tolerance to an otherwise lethal reduction of core body temperature and metabolism. An integral aspect of hibernation is tolerance to a profound decrease of cerebral perfusion. Identification of regulatory mechanisms that control hibernation in ground squirrels can guide efforts to develop improved treatment for stroke and brain trauma. In this study, we show in multiple tissues that S473 phosphorylation of Akt (Protein kinase B), a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-regulated serine/threonine kinase, was significantly reduced (P<0.001) as was its kinase activity (P=0.023) in the 13-lined ground squirrel, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus, during hibernation. T308 phosphorylation of Akt was relatively preserved. Brain immunohistochemical staining confirmed these results. In hibernating animals, reduction of immunoreactive phospho (S473)-Akt was noted throughout the brain. Akt is a key molecule in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signal transduction pathway, which plays a critical role in the balance between survival and apoptosis. The data presented here raise the possibility that down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation plays a regulatory role in hibernation. This would resemble dauer larva formation in Caenorhabditis elegans where Akt inhibition is associated with energy conservation, fat storage, expression of antioxidant enzymes and growth arrest.
