Synovial sarcoma is a rare sarcoma of unknown histologic origin. We previously reported the gene expression profile of synovial sarcoma was closely related to that of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal was one of the main growth signals in synovial sarcoma. Here we further demonstrate the neural origin of synovial sarcoma using primary tumors and cell lines. The expression of neural tissue-related genes was confirmed in synovial sarcoma tumor tissues, but the expression of some genes was absent in synovial sarcoma cell lines. Treatment of synovial sarcoma cell lines with BMP4 or FGF2 enhanced or restored the expression of neural tissue-related genes and induced a neuron-like morphology with positive Tuj-1 expression. Treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid also induced the expression of neural tissue-related genes in association with growth inhibition, which was not observed in other cell lines except a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cell line. A growth-inhibitory effect of all-trans-retinoic acid was also observed for xenografted tumors in athymic mice. The simultaneous treatment with FGF signal inhibitors enhanced the growth-inhibitory effect of all-trans-retinoic acid, suggesting the combination of growth signaling inhibition and differentiation induction could be a potential molecular target for treating synovial sarcoma.
