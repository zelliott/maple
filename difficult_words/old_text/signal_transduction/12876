Nonautonomous inductive signals from the soma and autonomous signals due to a 2X karyotype determine the sex of Drosophila melanogaster germ cells. These two signals have partially overlapping influences on downstream sex determination genes. The upstream OVO-B transcription factor is required for the viability of 2X germ cells, regardless of sexual identity, and for female germline sexual identity. The influence of inductive and autonomous signals on ovo expression has been controversial. We show that ovo-B is strongly expressed in the 2X germ cells in either a male or a female soma. This indicates that a 2X karyotype controls ovo-B expression in the absence of inductive signals from the female soma. However, we also show that female inductive signals positively regulate ovo-B transcription in the 1X germ cells that do not require ovo-B function. Genetic analysis clearly indicates that inductive signals from the soma are not required for ovo-B function in 2X germ cells. Thus, while somatic inductive signals and chromosome karyotype have overlapping regulatory influences, a 2X karyotype is a critical germline autonomous determinant of ovo-B function in the germline.
