Calcium homeostasis is maintained by parathyroid hormone and vitamin D. Mechanisms of action of these calcium-regulating hormones have been extensively examined, and the intracellular signaling pathways as well as transcriptional regulation of their target genes have been elucidated. Epidemiological studies revealed the importance of vitamin D sufficiency, and efforts have been made to implement the diagnostic criteria for vitamin D insufficiency. As a therapeutic agent, a new active vitamin D analog with anti-fracture efficacy has been developed for the treatment of osteoporosis.
