To explore the relationship between interferon (IFN) α and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced signaling pathways in the expression of retinoic acid-induced gene G (RIG-G).

Acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1-deficient U3A cells were used. The protein levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT2 in ATRA-treated NB4 cells were detected by Western blot. The culture supernatants of NB4 cells treated with ATRA for different time or U3A cells transfected with interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 were respectively collected. And the concentration of IFN-α was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The effects of NB4 cell culture supernatants on the phosphorylation of STAT2 and the expression of RIG-G were detected by Western blot.

The level of phosphorylated-STAT2 was obviously up-regulated in NB4 cells treated with ATRA for 72 hours, as well as the concentration of IFN-α in culture supernatants. The concentration of IFN-α increased from (1.5 ± 0.5) pg/ml in the untreated group to (7.6 ± 0.3) pg/ml (P < 0.05). After a 96-hour treatment, the concentration of IFN-α was up to (63.8 ± 5.8) pg/ml. And these culture supernatants could induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2 and up-regulate the protein level of RIG-G. As for U3A cells transfected with IRF-1, the concentration of IFN-α from the culture supernatant also increased 3-fold versus the control group transfected with empty vectors [(8.8 ± 1.4) pg/ml vs (3.4 ± 0.4) pg/ml, P < 0.05].

RIG-G gene expression is closely correlated with the cross-talk between ATRA and IFN-α-induced signaling pathways. ATRA increases the secretion of IFN-α by up-regulating the protein level of IRF-1. Then the secreted IFN-α may induce the phosphorylation of STAT2 and reinforce the expression of RIG-G.
