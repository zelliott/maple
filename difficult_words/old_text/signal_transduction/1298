Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a ubiquitous necrotrophic fungal pathogen capable of infecting a wide range of plants. To identify genes involved in fungal development and pathogenesis we generated 2232 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from two cDNA libraries constructed using either mycelia grown in pectin medium or tissues from infected Brassica napus stems. A total of 774 individual fungal genes were identified of which 39 were represented only among the infected plant EST collection. Annotation of 534 unigenes was possible following the categories applied to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Universal Gene Ontology scheme. cDNAs were identified that encoded potential pathogenicity factors including four endopolygalacturonases, two exopolygalacturonases, and several metabolite transporters. The potential role of these genes, as well as those encoding signal transduction factors, in the infection process is discussed.
