The phage shock protein (Psp) system found in enterobacteria is induced in response to impaired inner membrane integrity (where the Psp response is thought to help maintain the proton motive force of the cell) and is implicated in the virulence of pathogens such as Yersinia and Salmonella. We provided evidence that the two-component ArcAB system was involved in induction of the Psp response in Escherichia coli and now report that role of ArcAB is conditional. ArcAB, predominantly through the action of ArcA regulated genes, but also via a direct ArcB-Psp interaction, is required to propagate the protein IV (pIV)-dependent psp-inducing signal(s) during microaerobiosis, but not during aerobiosis or anaerobiosis. We show that ArcB directly interacts with the PspB, possibly by means of the PspB leucine zipper motif, thereby allowing cross-communication between the two systems. In addition we demonstrate that the pIV-dependent induction of psp expression in anaerobiosis is independent of PspBC, establishing that PspA and PspF can function as a minimal Psp system responsive to inner membrane stress.
