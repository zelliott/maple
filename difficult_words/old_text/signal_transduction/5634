The nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) functions as the "master switch" in adipocyte development and is important in regulating glucose metabolism. PPAR-gamma is rapidly degraded in adipocytes by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway under basal and ligand-activated conditions. Proteasome inhibition increases PPAR-gamma activity, indicating disposal of PPAR-gamma by the ubiquitin proteasome system regulates PPAR-gamma activity. However, the signals and factors required for recognition of PPAR-gamma by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway are unknown. To begin understanding how the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway interacts with PPAR-gamma, we designed a series of constructs containing each PPAR-gamma domain expressed as a fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The ability of each PPAR-gamma domain to alter the stability of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and to undergo ubiquitylation was assessed via western blot analysis. In addition, luciferase reporter assays were used to assay PPAR-gamma transcriptional activity. Using this approach, we determined that the AF-1 and ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of PPAR-gamma are targeted to the proteasome for degradation. However, only the LBD is conjugated to ubiquitin. The AF-2 helix of the LBD is required for maximum ubiquitylation, but is not essential for ligand-dependent ubiquitin conjugation. Finally, luciferase reporter assays show a fully functional ubiquitin system is required for PPAR-gamma activation. These results indicate that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is an integral determinant of PPAR-gamma activity, targeting PPAR-gamma for proteasomal degradation via ubiquitin independent and ubiquitin dependent mechanisms.
