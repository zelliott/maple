NRPs (neuropilins) are receptors for class 3 semaphorins, polypeptides essential for axonal guidance, and for members of the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) family of angiogenic cytokines. While mutant mouse studies show that NRP1 is essential for neuronal and cardiovascular development, little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms through which NRPs mediate the functions of their ligands in different cell types. NRP1 forms complexes with its co-receptors and is required for optimal function, but NRPs lack a clearly defined signalling domain and the role of NRP1 in receptor signalling and the function of the NRP1 cytosolic domain are unclear. Growing evidence indicates, however, that NRP1 plays a selective role in signalling at least in part via its C-terminal domain and interaction with intracellular binding partners.
