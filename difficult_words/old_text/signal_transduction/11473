A review of the meeting "The Ras Superfamily of Small GTP-Binding Proteins," FASEB Summer Research Conference, Snowmass, Colorado, 15 through 20 July 2000 The molecular cloning of the human proto-oncogene encoding Ras was reported nearly 20 years ago. Since then, Ras has become the prototypical member of a superfamily of small guanosine triphosphatase proteins. Despite the maturity of this field of research, the discovery of new functions and interactions between the superfamily members continues unabated. Symons and Takai have written a meeting report on the latest findings on the Ras superfamily.
