A 2-oxoglutaric acid (2-OG) probe bearing a methylene group introduced at the C4 position and a vinyl group to replace the carbonyl group at the C2 position elicited characteristic affinity for NtcA, the 2-OG receptor, while maintaining the signaling function of the parent natural metabolite 2-OG. This discovery opens new perspectives in the design, synthesis, and implementation of specific 2-OG analogues as molecular probes for investigating the complex 2-OG signaling pathways.
