An integral component of gastrulation in all organisms is epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a fundamental morphogenetic event through which epithelial cells transform into mesenchymal cells. The mesenchymal cells that arise from epithelial cells during gastrulation contribute to various tissue rudiments during subsequent development, including the notochord, somites, heart, gut, kidney, body wall and lining of the coelom. The process of gastrulation has been the subject of several hundred scientific papers. Despite all that has been written, it is likely that what we currently know about gastrulation is still considerably less than what remains to be learned. One critical remaining question that we consider here is how does gastrulation cease at the right place along the body axis, and at the right time? In this commentary, we focus on the molecular mechanism for the cessation of gastrulation, using the chick embryo as a model system.
