We investigated the effects of the sphingolipid FTY720 on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced proliferation and signal transduction in human smooth muscle cells (SMC). We showed that clinically relevant concentrations of FTY720 inhibited TNF-alpha-induced SMC proliferation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. We concluded that FTY720 may be a useful drug to inhibit chronic vascular rejection.
