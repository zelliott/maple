Nod factors are among the best-studied molecules implicated in the signal exchange that leads to legume-rhizobia symbiosis. The role of these molecules in symbiosis development has been primarily studied in legumes invaded through infection threads. In these plants, Nod factors generate several responses required for nodulation, including the induction of cortical cell division to form the nodule primordium. Arachis hypogaea L. (peanut) exhibits a specific mode of rhizobial infection and nodule morphogenetic programme in which infection threads are never formed. The role of Nod factors in this particular mechanism is unknown. In this work, a peanut symbiont mutant strain unable to produce Nod factors was obtained and characterised. The strain Bradyrhizobium (Arachis) sp. SEMIA 6144 V2 is altered in the nodC gene, which encodes an N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase involved in the first step of the Nod factor biosynthetic pathway. Further research revealed that, although its ability to colonise peanut roots was unaffected, it is not capable of inducing the division of cortical cells. The results obtained indicate that rhizobial Nod factors are essential for the induction of cortical cell division that leads to nodule primordium formation.
