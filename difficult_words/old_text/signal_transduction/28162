The heptahelical AT(1) G-protein-coupled receptor lacks inherent tyrosine kinase activity. Angiotensin II binding to AT(1) nevertheless activates several tyrosine kinases and stimulates both tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphatase activity of the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase in vascular smooth muscle cells. Since a balance between tyrosine kinase and tyrosine phosphatase activities is essential in angiotensin II signaling, we investigated the role of SHP-2 in modulating tyrosine kinase signaling pathways by stably transfecting vascular smooth muscle cells with expression vectors encoding wild-type SHP-2 protein or a catalytically inactive SHP-2 mutant. Our data indicate that SHP-2 is an efficient negative regulator of angiotensin II signaling. SHP-2 inhibited c-Src catalytic activity by dephosphorylating a positive regulatory tyrosine 418 within the Src kinase domain. Importantly, SHP-2 expression also abrogated angiotensin II-induced activation of ERK, whereas expression of catalytically inactive SHP-2 caused sustained ERK activation. Thus, SHP-2 likely regulates angiotensin II-induced MAP kinase signaling by inactivating c-Src. These SHP-2 effects were specific for a subset of angiotensin II signaling pathways, since SHP-2 overexpression failed to influence Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation or Fyn catalytic activity. These data show SHP-2 represents a critical negative regulator of angiotensin II signaling, and further demonstrate a new function for this phosphatase in vascular smooth muscle cells.
