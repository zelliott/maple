The chemiluminescence system amplified by luminol or isoluminol is a sensitive and widely used method for determination of respiratory burst products generated by the NADPH-oxidase in phagocytes. The present study shows that luminol, but not isoluminol, can inhibit the release of oxygen metabolites generated by human neutrophil NADPH-oxidase. The difference in structure between luminol and isoluminol (rendering luminol more lipophilic than isoluminol, and thereby membrane-permeable), is suggested to determine indirectly whether or not the molecule is inhibitory. Luminol was shown to have an increased inhibitory effect after preincubation of neutrophils on a surface of aggregated IgG, suggesting that the cells can be transferred from a 'luminol-insensitive' to a 'luminol-sensitive' state. Since luminol had no inhibitory effect in a cell-free NADPH-oxidase system, it is likely that it interferes with the signal transduction pathway, leading to assembly and/or activation of the oxidase. As a consequence of the present results, showing that luminol but not isoluminol can inhibit NADPH-oxidase activity, we suggest that isoluminol is used in future studies of superoxide anion release from phagocytes.
