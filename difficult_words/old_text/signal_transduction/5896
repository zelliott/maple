The platelet alpha2beta1 integrin functions as both an adhesion and signaling receptor upon exposure to collagen. Recent studies have indicated that alpha2beta1 function can be activated via inside-out signaling, similar to the prototypical platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3. However, signaling molecules that regulate alpha2beta1 activation in platelets are not well defined. A strong candidate molecule is the small GTPase Rap1b, the dominant platelet isoform of Rap1, which regulates alphaIIbbeta3 activation.

We hypothesized that Rap1b positively regulates alpha2beta1 during agonist-induced platelet activation.

To test whether Rap1b activates alpha2beta1 downstream of glycoprotein (GP)VI or other platelet receptors, we stimulated platelets purified from Rap1b-/- or wild-type mice with diverse agonists and measured alpha2beta1 activation using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monomeric collagen. We also examined the role of Rap1b in outside-in signaling pathways by analyzing adhesion and spreading of Rap1b-/- or wild-type platelets on monomeric, immobilized collagen. Finally, we monitored the activation status of related Rap GTPases to detect changes in signaling pathways potentially associated with Rap1b-mediated events.

Rap1b-/- platelets displayed comparable ADP-induced or thrombin-induced alpha2beta1 activation as wild-type platelets, but reduced convulxin-dependent alpha2beta1 activation. Rap1b-/- platelets exhibited increased spreading on immobilized collagen but similar adhesion to immobilized collagen compared to wild-type platelets. Rap1b-/- platelets also showed Rap1a and Rap2 activation upon agonist stimulation, possibly revealing functional compensation among Rap family members.

Rap1b is required for maximal GPVI-induced but not ADP-induced activation of alpha2beta1 in murine platelets.
