It is well known that the expression level of secretory group IIA phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)-IIA) is elevated in inflammatory diseases and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) up-regulates the expression of sPLA(2)-IIA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Recently, lower concentration thrombin could elicit anti-inflammatory responses in HUVECs. Here, the effects of lower concentration thrombin on the expression of sPLA(2)-IIA in LPS-stimulated HUVECs were investigated. Prior treatment of cells with thrombin (25-75 pM) inhibited LPS-induced sPLA(2)-IIA expression by activating its receptor, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). And pretreatment of cells with either PI3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002) or cholesterol depleting agent (methyl-β-cyclodextrin, MβCD) abolished the inhibitory activity of thrombin against sPLA(2)-IIA expression. Therefore, these results suggest that PAR-1 activation by lower concentration thrombin inhibited LPS mediated expression of sPLA(2)-IIA by PAR-1 and PI3-kinase-dependent manner in lipid raft on the HUVECs.
