Cellular responses to signals require the action of a myriad of protein networks, which are regulated by protein/protein associations. Rapid actions of steroid hormones are also subject to this regulation. They induce direct association of steroid receptors with different proteins (e.g., growth factor receptors, signaling effectors, scaffold proteins, transcription factors). These multi-molecular complexes drive signaling activation and finally trigger basic hormonal effects. Receptor/protein associations are attracting increased interest concerning their role in hormone action as well as their potential use as therapeutic targets in hormonal diseases.
