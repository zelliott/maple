Hypothermia improves resistance to ischemia in the cardioplegia-arrested heart. This adaptive process produces changes in specific signaling pathways for mitochondrial proteins and heat-shock response. To further test for hypothermic modulation of other signaling pathways such as apoptosis, we used various molecular techniques, including cDNA arrays. Isolated rabbit hearts were perfused and exposed to ischemic cardioplegic arrest for 2 h at 34 degrees C [ischemic group (I); n = 13] or at 30 degrees C before and during ischemia [hypothermic group (H); n = 12]. Developed pressure, the maximum first derivative of left ventricular pressure, oxygen consumption, and pressure-rate product (P < 0.05) recovery were superior in H compared with in I during reperfusion. mRNA expression for the mitochondrial proteins, adenine translocase and the beta-subunit of F1-ATPase, was preserved by hypothermia. cDNA arrays revealed that ischemia altered expression of 13 genes. Hypothermia modified this response to ischemia for eight genes, six related to apoptosis. A marked, near fivefold increase in transformation-related protein 53 in I was virtually abrogated in H. Hypothermia also increased expression for the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologue Bcl-x relative to I but decreased expression for the proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologue bak. These data imply that hypothermia modifies signaling pathways for apoptosis and suggest possible mechanisms for hypothermia-induced myocardial protection.
