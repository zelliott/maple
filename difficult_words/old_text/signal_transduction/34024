To explore the role of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in the migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the underlying signal transduction mechanism.

Rat bone marrow-derived MSCs were infected with 100 ml recombinant adenovirus containing human SDF-1alpha gene (Ad-hSDF-1alpha), and the cell migration changes were observed at 1, 2, and 3 days after the infection. Twelve hours after Ad-hSDF-1alpha transfection, the MSCs in separate cultures were treated with wortmannin (50 nmol/L), LY294002 (10 mmol/L), PD98059 (50 mmol/L), U73122 (10 mmol/L), AMD3100 (0.1 g/L), or verapamil (50 nmol/L), respectively, and the signal transduction pathways involved in MSC migration were analyzed.

The MSCs grew in colonies after transfection with Ad-hSDF-1alpha, but this growth pattern was substantially attenuated after treatment with wortmannin, LY294002, PD98059, U73122, AMD3100 and verapamil, among which U73122 and AMD3100 treatments resulted in the most conspicuous inhibitory effects.

The effect of SDF-1 in promoting MSC migration is related to mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C, and protein kinase signal pathways.
