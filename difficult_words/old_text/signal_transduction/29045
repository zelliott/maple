The cellular Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitory protein-long form (c-FLIP(L)) is a key regulator of Fas signaling, although owing a dominant-negative homologue of caspase-8, the role of c-FLIP(L) remains controversial. In the present study, two pairs of small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against c-FLIP(L) were used to assess the effect of c-FLIP(L) on Fas-mediated apoptosis of colon carcinoma in vitro. HT-29 cell line was selected for overexpression of c-FLIP(L) and Fas with RT-PCR and flow cytometry analyses. After electroporation, the mRNA level of c-FLIP(L) was significantly decreased (control siRNA versus c-FLIP(L) siRNA, 77.97+/-5.61% versus 26.22+/-3.79%) and the maximum interfering efficiency was around 66.49% using semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Knockdown of c-FLIP(L) with the specific siRNA sensitized colon carcinoma cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis (control siRNA versus c-FLIP(L) siRNA, 5.68+/-2.11% versus 29.50+/-2.27%) using DNA content analysis and Annexin V-FITC analysis. In conclusion, our study indicated that c-FLIP(L) might be a suppressor of Fas-mediated apoptosis in Fas antigen expressing colon carcinoma and therefore a potential target for novel anticancer therapies.
