The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor (R)-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK signal transduction cascade, which have critical roles in prevention of apoptosis and regulation of cell cycle progression, plays an important role in tumorigenesis. The expression of IGF-1R, AKT and ERK1/2 has been described in some human malignancies, but not in extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD).

To study the expression of IGF-1R, p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 in EMPD and to evaluate the relationships among them.

Thirty-six tissue samples of 34 patients with primary EMPD were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for IGF-1R, p-AKT and p-ERK1/2.

Of thirty-six EMPD tissue samples, 34, 34 and 28 were positive for IGF-IR, p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 expression, respectively; 27, 23 and 17 of the 36 specimens stained positive for IGF-IR, p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 in more than half of Paget's cells, respectively. There were significant correlations between the IGF-1R and p-AKT expression as well as between IGF-1R and p-ERK1/2 expression. Taken together, these results indicate that IGF-1R is overexpressed, and AKT and ERK1/2 are frequently phosphorylated in EMPD.

Our study shows that the expression of IGF-1R and the induction of p-AKT and the p-ERK1/2 pathway may play an important role in the pathogenesis of EMPD. The IGF-IR system might be a potential therapeutic target in EMPD.
