Identified as a major pathway controlling entry in the facultative dauer diapause stage, the DAF-2/Insulin receptor (InsR) signaling acts in multiple developmental and physiological regulation events in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we identified a role of the insulin-like pathway in controlling developmental speed during the C. elegans second larval stage. This role relies on the canonical DAF-16/FOXO-dependent branch of the insulin-like signaling and is largely independent of dauer formation. Our studies provide further evidence for broad conservation of insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) functions in developmental speed control.
