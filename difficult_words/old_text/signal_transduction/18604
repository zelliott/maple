Phosphorilation of subunit beta from insulin receptor induced mainly by insulin, it begins a series of intracellular complex signaling in cascade. Through this way establish multiple effects, which permits to the cell initiate its biological activity. This activity include the glucose metabolism, the regulation of ions and amino acids transport, lipids metabolism, glycogen synthesis, genetic transcription, mRNA expression, synthesis and degradation of proteins, as well as synthesis of DNA. Therefore, a modification in anyone of the proteins involved in the insulin signaling, can take place a dysfunction in the glucose metabolism. The impaired glucose can be due because there are many proteins, ions and enzymes that participate in the downstream pathways of the insulin signaling, it has become difficult to find a single phatophysiologic level as cause of diabetes. In spite of the advances in the study of this disease, it has been reached the conclusion that the glucose control is not enough to impede the complications that characterize to type 2 diabetes, since the organic worsening does not stop, which indicates that insulin signaling dysfunction is directly involved in all cellular process, and a better understanding in the communication ways of this hormone will take to new forms of treatment to impaired insulin response.
