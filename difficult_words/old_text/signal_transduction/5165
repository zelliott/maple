Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase. It is ubiquitously expressed in cells and is a therapeutic target for the cancer treatment arsenal. Despite the great responses obtained in tumors addicted to specific mutations or overactivation of key members of the mTOR pathway (HiF1Î± in RCC, cyclin D1 in MCL, or TSC in SEGA), mTOR inhibitors as single agents have modest activity. Dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitors have been developed with the idea of overcoming resistance to the mTOR inhibition through preventing the activation of PI3K/Akt as a result of release negative feedback loops.
