Extracellular ATP is a widespread autocrine/paracrine signal since many animal cells release ATP in the extracellular medium; often this release is mechanosensitive, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. The involvement of vesicular release, conductive channels, or ABC transporters has been suggested in different cell types. We investigated the mechanism of ATP release in human HOBIT osteoblastic cells, in which mechanical stimulation induced intercellular calcium waves sustained by both cell-to-cell coupling through gap junctions and ATP release. In this study we employed a luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence assay to measure the amount of ATP released under different stimulatory conditions. Given the role of connexin hemichannels in favoring passive NAD(+) transport [Bruzzone, S., et al. (2001) FASEB J. 15, 10-12], the involvement of connexin hemichannels as putative ATP transporters was initially investigated. In HOBIT cells overexpressing connexin43 the amount of nucleotide released under basal and stimulated conditions was similar to non-transfected cells, ruling out a major involvement of connexin hemichannels in ATP transport. In nontransfected HOBIT cells mechanical stimulations induced by medium displacement and hypotonic stress consistently enhanced ATP efflux. Cytochalsin D treatment did not alter basal and stimulated ATP release, while elevated cAMP levels consistently reduced efflux in both cases. ATP released by hypotonic stress and medium displacement evoked intracellular Ca(2+) transients in fura2-loaded HOBIT cells, indicating that different mechanical stimuli activate physiological cell responses.
