This mini-review is addressed to the question how the membranous environment may affect traffic of receptors and signalling from membrane-anchored receptors on the outside of cells to transducers and targets on the inside. Signal transduction by membrane-anchored receptors to the interior of the cell and eventually to the genome is a central issue in cellular regulation. In this context the role of membrane fluidity and of the cytoskeleton in restricting the mobility of proteins are discussed and the evidence for a structural order in membranes which could limit the mobility of proteins is scrutinised.
