The present study addressed the modulatory role of CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) in Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9-mediated innate immunity and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that CCR4-deficient mice were resistant to both septic peritonitis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and CpG DNA/D-galactosamine-induced shock. In bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMPhi) from CLP-treated CCR4-deficient mice, TLR9-mediated pathways of MAPK/AP-1, PI3K/Akt, and IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB were impaired compared to wild-type (WT) cells. While TLR9 expression was not altered, the intensity of internalized CpG DNA was increased in CCR4-deficient macrophages when compared to WT macrophages. Pharmacological inhibitor studies revealed that impaired activation of JNK, PI3K/Akt, and/or IKK/NF-kappaB could be responsible for decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression in CCR4-deficient macrophages. Interestingly, the CCR4-deficient BMMPhi exhibited an alternatively activated (M2) phenotype and the impaired TLR9-mediated signal transduction responses in CCR4-deficient cells were similar to the signaling responses observed in WT BMMPhi skewed to an alternatively activated phenotype. These results indicate that macrophages deficient in CCR4 impart a regulatory influence on TLR9-mediated innate immunity.
