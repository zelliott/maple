Growth factors, typically defined as natural substances capable of stimulating cell growth and differentiation, are vital regulators for the survival of metazoan cells. In this review, we will focus on growth factor signaling pathways that are closely related to autophagy induction and discuss the critical roles of this fascinating cellular process in intracellular energy homeostasis, cell fate determination, and pathophysiological regulation.
