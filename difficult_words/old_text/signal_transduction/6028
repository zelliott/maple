Efforts to identify the signal transduction pathways used by interleukin-10 (IL-10) have resulted in limited success. The anti-inflammatory effects elicited by IL-10, and the mechanisms by which these are mediated, are still relatively unknown. Understanding the signalling mechanisms behind the suppression of cytokine expression by IL-10 could be of potential therapeutic interest. Although the consensus is that the Janus kinase, Jak1, as well as the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT3 are central, much controversy exists about the participation and roles of many other signalling pathways targeted by IL-10. The mechanisms of cytokine suppression proposed by various groups have included transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation of IL-10 target genes; nevertheless no unifying model has emerged thus far. Here we would like to highlight novel findings and discuss their implications in the context of current understanding of IL-10 signalling.
