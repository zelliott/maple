In their environment, plants interact with a multitude of living organisms and have to cope with a large variety of aggressions of biotic or abiotic origin. To survive, plants have acquired, during evolution, complex mechanisms to detect their aggressors and defend themselves. Receptors and signaling pathways that are involved in such interactions with the environment are just beginning to be uncovered. What has been known for several decades is the extraordinary variety of chemical compounds the plants are capable to synthesize, and many of these products are implicated in defense responses. The number of natural products occurring in plants may be estimated in the range of hundreds of thousands, but only a fraction have been fully characterized. Despite the great importance of these metabolites for plant and also for human health, our knowledge about their biosynthetic pathways and functions is still fragmentary. Recent progress has been made particularly for phenylpropanoid and oxylipin metabolism, which are emphasized in this review. Both pathways are involved in plant resistance at several levels: by providing building units of physical barriers against pathogen invasion, by synthesizing an array of antibiotic compounds, and by producing signals implicated in the mounting of plant resistance.
