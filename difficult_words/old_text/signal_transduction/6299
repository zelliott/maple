Filamins were discovered as the first family of non-muscle actin-binding protein. They are lage cytoplasmic proteins that cross-link cortical actin into a dynamic three-dimensional structure. Filamins have also been reported to interact with a large number of cellular proteins of great functional diversity, suggesting that they are unusually versatile signalling scaffolds. More recently, genetic mutations in filamin A and B have been reported to cause a wide range of human diseases, suggesting that different diseases highlight distinct filamin interactions.
