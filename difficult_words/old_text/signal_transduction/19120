The synthesis and in vitro antitumour evaluation of a new series of fluorinated benzothiazole-substituted 4-hydroxycyclohexa-2,5-dienones ('quinols') is described. The new compounds were found to be of comparable activity compared to the non-fluorinated precursor PMX 464, in terms of antiproliferative activity in sensitive human cancer cell lines (nanomolar GI(50) values) and inhibitory activity against the thioredoxin signalling system.
