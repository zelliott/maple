Progress in the last decades indicated that ageing might be a universal fact of life. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain a major challenge in biology. Our relatively long life span and huge variations in lifestyle make detailed studies of ageing in humans difficult to interpret. In contrast, the relatively simple yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) has been a critical model in the field of ageing research for decades. Systems biology has contributed to the ageing field by mapping complex regulatory networks and resolving the dynamics of signal transduction pathways. In this review we first review the current understanding of ageing in yeast, then highlight the recent high-throughput systems and system biology approaches that could be used to further our understanding of ageing in yeast.
