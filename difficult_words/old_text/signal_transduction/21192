The role of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase; EC 2.7.1.123) in the generation of Ca2+ signals by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) was studied. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) induced by mAChR activation were monitored in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells using the dye Fura-2. SK-N-SH cells express M3 mAChR, as well as CaM kinase types II and IV, which are specifically inhibited by the CaM kinase antagonist KN-62 (1-[N,O-bis(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazi ne). Carbamylcholine (100 microM) elicited an initial transient peak in [Ca2+]i due to mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores, followed by a sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i that depended on the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and which was inhibited by EGTA and Ni2+. These mAChR-induced Ca2+ signals were diminished to an equal extent by preincubating the cells with 0.01 to 100 microM KN-62. KN-62 inhibited mAChR-induced Ca2+ influx and mobilization from internal stores by about 25-30%, producing a half-maximal effect at approximately 1 microM. In contrast, KN-62 (25 microM) almost completely abolished carbamylcholine-stimulated entry of divalent cations through Mn2+-permeant channels, as revealed by Mn2+ quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence. KN-62 also almost completely abolished Ca2+ influx induced by depolarization of the cells with 25 mM K+ (IC50 = 3 microM). These results suggest that CaM kinases regulate both the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and the stimulation of Ca2+ influx that are induced by mAChR activation, and indicate that the mAChR-induced influx of Ca2+ occurs through Ca2+ channels other than, or in addition to, the voltage-gated calcium channels or Mn2+-permeant channels which are inhibited by KN-62.
