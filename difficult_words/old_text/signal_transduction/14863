Unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) activate immune cells to produce immune mediators. This study demonstrates that in murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells, CpG ODN-mediated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression is regulated at transcriptional level and requires de novo protein synthesis. Inhibition of ERK and p38 MAPK, but not JNK, results in significant decrease of CpG ODN-induced MMP-9 expression. We found that endosomal maturation inhibitors, chloroquine and bafilomycin A, block CpG ODN-induced ERK and p38 MAPK activation and the subsequent MMP-9 expression. We also observed that CpG ODN induces NF-kappaB activation and NF-kappaB is a downstream target of p38 MAPK. Taken together, our data demonstrate that CpG ODN triggers MMP-9 expression via TLR-9 dependent ERK and p38 MAPK activation followed by NF-kappaB activation.
