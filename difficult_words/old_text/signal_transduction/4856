To summarize the recent progress in related research on transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1)/Smad3 signal transduction pathway and post-traumatic scar formation.

Recent related literature at home and abroad on TGF-beta1/Smad3 signal transduction pathway and post-traumatic scar formation was reviewed and summarized.

TGF-beta1 is an important influence factor of fibrotic diseases, and it plays biological effects by TGF-beta1/ Smad3 signal transduction pathway. The pathway is regulated by many factors and has crosstalk with other signal pathways at cellular and molecular levels. The pathway is involved in the early post-traumatic inflammatory response, wound healing, and late pathological scar formation. Intervening the transduction pathway at the molecular level can influence the process of fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition.

TGF-beta1/Smad3 signal transduction pathway is an important way to affect post-traumatic scar formation and extracellular matrix deposition. The further study on the pathway will provide a theoretical basis for promotion of wound healing, as well as prevention and treatment of pathological scar formation.
