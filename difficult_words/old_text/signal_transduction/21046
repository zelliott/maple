To explore the possible role of purinergic receptors in thymocyte development and in pathogenesis of adenosine deaminase SCID, we studied effects of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP(ext)) and adenosine on TCR- and steroid hormone-triggered processes in mouse thymocytes. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis confirms the mRNA expression of several types of purinergic receptors, while the functioning of ATP receptors in thymocytes is reflected by ATP(ext)-induced intracellular calcium increases and by thymocyte subset-specific sensitivity to the effects of ATP(ext) and adenosine. Only ATP(ext), but not the ATP catabolites, adenosine, dexamethasone, or TCR cross-linking, was efficient in triggering rapid protein synthesis independent lysis of CD4+8- thymocytes and peripheral CD4+ T cells. In contrast, extracellular adenosine specifically induced the apoptosis of CD4+8+ thymocytes. ATP(ext) also induced a slower process of DNA fragmentation and protein synthesis-dependent apoptosis in all thymocyte subsets. ATP(ext) had an additive effect with TCR cross-linking in the induction of thymocyte death, but, unexpectedly, the effects of ATP(ext) at high concentration were antagonistic to steroid-induced apoptosis. Described here, the properties of ATP(ext) and adenosine are consistent with their involvement in the regulation of T cell development due to differential expression and signaling through purinergic receptors in different thymocyte subsets. The possible role of purinergic receptor signaling in T cell differentiation and adenosine deaminase SCID is discussed.
