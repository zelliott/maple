Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are now known to mediate much more than adhesion between cells and between cells and the extracellular matrix. Work by many researchers has illuminated their roles in modulating activation of molecules such as receptor tyrosine kinases, with subsequent effects on cell survival, migration, and process extension. CAMs also are known to serve as substrates for proteases which can create diffusible fragments capable of signaling independently from the CAM. The diversity of interactions is further modulated by membrane rafts, which can co-localize or separate potential signaling partners to affect the likelihood of a given signaling pathway being activated. Given the ever-growing number of known CAMs and the fact that their heterophilic binding in cis or in trans can affect their interactions with other molecules, including membrane-bound receptors, one would predict a wide range of effects attributable to a particular CAM in a particular cell at a particular stage of development. The function(s) of a given CAM must therefore be considered in the context of the history of the cell expressing it and the repertoire of molecules expressed both by that cell and its neighbors.
