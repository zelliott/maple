Structural microdomains of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) consist of spatially related side chains that mediate discrete functions. The conserved helix 2/helix 7 microdomain was identified because the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor appears to have interchanged the Asp(2.50) and Asn(7.49) residues which are conserved in transmembrane helices 2 and 7 of rhodopsin-like GPCRs. We now demonstrate that different side chains of this microdomain contribute specifically to receptor expression, heterotrimeric G protein-, and small G protein-mediated signaling. An Asn residue is required in position 2.50(87) for expression of the GnRH receptor at the cell surface, most likely through an interaction with the conserved Asn(1.50(53)) residue, which we also find is required for receptor expression. Most GPCRs require an Asp side chain at either the helix 2 or helix 7 locus of the microdomain for coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins, but the GnRH receptor has transferred the requirement for an acidic residue from helix 2 to 7. However, the presence of Asp at the helix 7 locus precludes small G protein-dependent coupling to phospholipase D. These results implicate specific components of the helix 2/helix 7 microdomain in receptor expression and in determining the ability of the receptor to adopt distinct activated conformations that are optimal for interaction with heterotrimeric and small G proteins.
