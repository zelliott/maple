The pore-forming toxin Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is carried by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and associated with necrotizing pneumonia together with poor prognosis of infected patients. Although the cell-death-inducing properties of PVL have previously been examined, the pulmonary immune response to PVL is largely unknown. Using an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach, we show that PVL induces only 29 genes in mouse alveolar macrophages, which are associated with TLR signaling. Further studies indicate that PVL directly binds to TLR2 and induces immune responses via NF-ÎºB in a TLR2, CD14, MyD88, IL-1R-associated kinase 1, and TNFR-associated factor 6-dependent manner. PVL-mediated inflammation is independent of pore formation but strongly depends on the LukS subunit and is suppressed in CD14/TLR2(-/-) cells. In vivo PVL or LukS induced a robust inflammatory response in lungs, which was diminished in CD14/TLR2(-/-) mice. These results highlight the proinflammatory properties of PVL and identify CD14/TLR2 as an essential receptor complex for PVL-induced lung inflammation.
