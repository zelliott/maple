FoxO transcription factors contribute to cardiac muscle remodeling and insulin signaling, but how they link insulin resistance and maladaptive heart hypertrophy remains unknown. A new study by Ni et al. (2007) shows that sustained activation of FoxO1 or FoxO3 in cardiomyocytes selectively enhances the activity of Akt/PKB and reduces insulin signaling through inhibition of calcineurin and PP2A.
