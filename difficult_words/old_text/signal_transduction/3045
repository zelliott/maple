To investigate whether FTY720 inhibits rat mesangial proliferation and extracellular matrix expansion through suppression of transforming growth factor β1-connective tissue growth factor (TGFβ1-CTGF) pathway, and to explore experimental evidence for its effect on mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis.

A rat model of anti-Thy-1 mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis was established and FTY720 intervention was performed. Periphery blood lymphocyte count, urine protein excretion, glomerular mesangial proliferation, protein and gene expression of TGFβ1 and CTGF and extracellular matrix protein including fibronectin, laminin and collagen IV in isolated glomeruli were documented at 1, 3 and 7 days after injection of anti-Thy-1 antibody.

The model group developed proteinuria at 1, 3 and 7 days after injection of anti-Thy-1 antibody, which were significantly higher [(27.9 ± 7.3), (63.5 ± 18.8) and (52.4 ± 15.4)mg/d, respectively] than those in the control group [(8.4 ± 2.4), (8.4 ± 2.1) and (10.4 ± 3.2) mg/d; respectively, P < 0.01]. FTY720 intervention group showed significantly decreased proteinuria at 3 and 7 days after injection [(31.4 ± 7.0), (25.5 ± 7.7) mg/d, respectively] than model group (P < 0.01), although higher than the control group (P < 0.01). After intervention for 3 and 7 days, FTY720 significantly down-regulated both TGFβ1 and CTGF gene and protein expression in cultured glomeruli, and suppressed the production of glomerular extracellular matrix protein secretion, leading to attenuated mesangial cell proliferation and extracellular matrix expansion in rat anti-Thy-1 mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis.

FTY720 significantly attenuates mesangial proliferation and extracellular matrix expansion through inhibition of TGFβ1-CTGF pathway in rat, and thus ameliorates the development of anti-Thy-1 mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis.
