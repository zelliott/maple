Activated interleukin (IL)-4Ralpha stimulates production of IgE through signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (Stat6) activation in lymphocytes. Genetic studies have shown an association between polymorphisms in the genes encoding IL-4Ralpha and Stat6 and elevated serum IgE in patients with atopic disease. Some authors, including us, have reported an association of Graves' disease and elevated serum IgE. To analyse the relationship between IL-4Ralpha and Stat6 polymorphisms and elevated serum IgE in patients with Graves' disease, 169 patients with Graves' disease were studied. We investigated whether these polymorphisms affect IL-4Ralpha-Stat6 signalling in cultured human lymphocytes. A high frequency of both the Ile50 polymorphism in IL-4Ralpha and 13GT repeat variants of the Stat6 gene was observed in patients with Graves' disease and elevated serum IgE (Ile50 allele; P < 0.05, 13GT allele; P < 0.01 versus controls) but not in subjects with normal IgE. Cultured human lymphocytes with the Ile50 IL-4Ralpha polymorphism and the 13GT repeat variant of Stat6 showed increased IL-4 (and/or IL-13)-induced Stat6 activation (2.7-fold; P < 0.05 and 2.2-fold; P < 0.05, respectively). These findings suggest that polymorphisms in the IL-4Ralpha and Stat6 genes play an important role in elevation of serum IgE through increased Stat6 action in patients with Graves' disease.
