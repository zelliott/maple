The receptor structures of activating and inhibiting types of innate immunity central cells (macrophages and natural killer cells) participating in supporting genetic homeostasis and providing organism protection from extracellular and intracellular microbes and other alien cells, have been considered. The molecular physiological formation mechanisms of intracellular signal ways providing macrophage activation under interaction influence of Toll-like phagocyte receptors with one of its ligands: lipopolysaccharide that is the main component of gram-negative bacterium membrane have been analysed.
