Organelles within a eukaryotic cell respond to age-related intracellular stresses and environmental factors by altering their functional states to generate, direct and process the flow of interorganellar information that is essential for establishing a pro- or antiaging cellular pattern. The scope of this review is to critically analyze recent progress in understanding how various intercompartmental (i.e., organelle-organelle and organelle-cytosol) communications regulate cellular aging in evolutionarily distant eukaryotes. Our analysis suggests a model for an intricate network of intercompartmental communications that underly cellular aging in eukaryotic organisms across phyla. This proposed model posits that the numerous directed, coordinated and regulated organelle-organelle and organelle-cytosol communications integrated into this network define the long-term viability of a eukaryotic cell and, thus, are critical for regulating cellular aging.
