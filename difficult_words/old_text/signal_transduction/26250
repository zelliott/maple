A quantitative trait locus (QTL) affecting fatness in a way opposite to expectations based on breed means was mapped to swine chromosome 7 (SSC7) using crosses between Large White (LW) and Meishan (MS) founders. Defining the molecular fatness trait more explicitly would allow deducing positional candidate genes, for which expression differences must be analysed in experimental populations. First, mRNA levels of genes representing sequential steps in adipogenesis or involved in lipid metabolism were studied in backfat of pigs having homozygous LW(QTL7)/LW(QTL7) or heterozygous LW(QTL7)/MS(QTL7) alleles and considered at two ages. mRNA level of DLK1 expressed in preadipocytes was greater in MS(QTL7)/LW(QTL7) pigs than in homozygous pigs at 28 days. Transcript abundances of CEBPA involved in differentiation, the prolipogenic FASN gene and the adipocyte-specific marker FABP4 were lower in MS(QTL7)/LW(QTL7) pigs compared with LW(QTL7)/LW(QTL7) pigs at 150 days. Because these results suggest a lag time in terminal differentiation associated with the MS allele, seven genes in the QTL interval were deduced as promising candidates for the QTL effect by bioinformatics analysis. Among them, PPARD and CDKN1A had lower expression levels in MS(QTL7)/LW(QTL7) pigs at both ages. Genotype-related differences were observed in mRNA levels of PPARD target genes involved in cell differentiation (FZD7) or fatty acid oxidation (ACADL and ACOX1) at 150 days. These results re-evaluate the potential of PPARD to explain part of variation in pig adiposity.
