Ovarian progesterone induces essential changes leading to a temporary state of uterine receptivity for conceptus implantation. Estrogens secreted by the porcine conceptus on days 11 and 12 of pregnancy provide the initial signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy and maintenance of a functional corpus luteum (CL) for continued production of progesterone. As prostaglandins F(2)(α) (PGF(2)(α)) and E(2) (PGE(2)) exert opposing actions on the CL, a tight control over their synthesis and secretion is critical either for the initiation of luteolysis or maintenance of pregnancy. One of the supportive mechanisms by which conceptus inhibits luteolysis is changing PG synthesis in favor of luteoprotective PGE(2). Conceptus PGE(2) could be amplified by PGE(2) feedback loop in the endometrium. In pigs, as in other species, implantation and establishment of pregnancy is associated with upregulation of expression of proinflammatory factors, which include cytokines, growth factors, and lipid mediators. The conceptus produces inflammatory mediators: interferon γ and interferon δ, interleukins IL1B and IL6, and PGs, which probably activate inflammatory pathways in the endometrium. The endometrium responds to these embryonic signals by enhancing further progesterone-induced uterine receptivity. Understanding the mechanisms of pregnancy establishment is required for translational research to increase reproductive efficiencies and fertility in humans and animals.
