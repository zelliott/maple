The multifunctional Ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a crucial mediator of cardiac physiology and pathology. Increased expression and activation of CaMKII has been linked to elevated risk for arrhythmic events and is a hallmark of human heart failure. A useful approach to determining CaMKII's role therein is large-scale analysis of phosphorylation events by mass spectrometry. However, current large-scale phosphoproteomics approaches have proved inadequate for high-fidelity identification of kinase-specific roles. The purpose of this study was to develop a phosphoproteomics approach to specifically identify CaMKII's downstream effects in cardiac tissue.

To identify putative downstream CaMKII targets in cardiac tissue, animals with myocardial-delimited expression of the specific peptide inhibitor of CaMKII (AC3-I) or an inactive control (AC3-C) were compared using quantitative phosphoproteomics. The hearts were isolated after isoproterenol injection to induce CaMKII activation downstream of Î²-adrenergic receptor agonist stimulation. Enriched phosphopeptides from AC3-I and AC3-C mice were differentially quantified using stable isotope dimethyl labeling, strong cation exchange chromatography and high-resolution LC-MS/MS. Phosphorylation levels of several hundred sites could be profiled, including 39 phosphoproteins noticeably affected by AC3-I-mediated CaMKII inhibition.

Our data set included known CaMKII substrates, as well as several new candidate proteins involved in functions not previously implicated in CaMKII signaling.
