One characteristic of B cells that accumulate during chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is their highly heterogeneous functional responses to B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation. Leukemic B cells with very poor responses have defective rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous substrates, especially phospholipase C (PLC)gamma, as well as a defective calcium elevation on BCR stimulation. This points to a defect in BCR-associated protein tyrosine kinase (PTK). We investigated whether a defect in Syk, a PTK that is pivotal in coupling BCR to downstream signaling events, could account for these alterations. Syk tyrosine phosphorylation triggered by BCR ligation was severely impaired in B-CLL cells with low calcium responses to anti-mu stimulation. Syk associations were also defective, as concomitant tyrosine phosphorylation of a Syk-associated 145 kDa protein comigrating with PLCgamma-2 was only detected in responding B-CLL cells. By contrast, we found similar expression of the kinase regardless of B-CLL cell responsiveness. These results are consistent with the possibility that very proximal BCR signaling elements in some B-CLL cells are unable to connect with downstream biochemical events dominated by tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential docking function of Syk PTK.
