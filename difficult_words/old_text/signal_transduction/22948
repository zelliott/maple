Death receptor-mediated apoptosis can be modulated by several antiapoptotic proteins, such as the FLICE (FADD [Fas-associated death domain]-like IL-1beta-converting enzyme)-inhibitory proteins (FLIPs). The FLIP family includes both cellular and viral members. The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus protein (KSHV)-FLIP is expressed by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), which is associated with malignancies such as Kaposi's sarcoma and certain lymphomas. In this paper, we demonstrate that KSHV-FLIP protects cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting caspase activation and permits clonal growth in the presence of death stimuli in vitro. Furthermore, we show that KSHV-FLIP can act as a tumor progression factor by promoting tumor establishment and growth in vivo. When injected into immunocompetent recipient mouse strains, murine B lymphoma cells (A20) transduced with KSHV-FLIP rapidly develop into aggressive tumors showing a high rate of survival and growth. The tumor-progressive activity of KSHV-FLIP is mediated by prevention of death receptor-induced apoptosis triggered by conventional T cells. Consequently, inhibitors of death receptor signaling can be regarded as a new class of tumor progression factors, and HHV-8-associated tumors may represent naturally occurring examples of the tumorigenic effect of such inhibitors.
