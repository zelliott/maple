Plant development and reproduction depend on a precise recognition of environmental conditions and the integration of this information with endogenous metabolic and developmental cues. Calcium ions have been firmly established as ubiquitous second messengers functioning in these processes. Calcium signal deciphering and signal-response coupling often involve calcium-binding proteins as responders or relays in this information flow. Here we review the calcineurin B-like protein (CBL) calcium sensor/CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK) network as a newly emerging signaling system mediating a complex array of environmental stimuli. We focus particularly on the mechanisms generating signaling specificity. Moreover, we emphasize the functional implications that are emerging from the analyses of CBL and CIPK loss-of-function mutants.
