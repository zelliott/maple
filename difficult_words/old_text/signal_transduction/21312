Macrophages are believed to play an important role in the host inflammatory response to implanted biomaterials. However, the mechanism of macrophage adhesion to protein-adsorbed substrates and the subsequent activation and inflammation is unresolved. Previously the effect of various surface-adsorbed proteins and increasing concentrations of phosphorylation inhibitor AG18 on intracellular protein expression levels in adherent human monocytic cell line U937 was identified using SDS-PAGE and densitometry. The protein ligands and AG18 concentrations up or down regulated the expression of a set of proteins ranging from approximately 200 to approximately 23 kDa. In the present work, HPLC coupled tandem mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) was used to identify proteins in these bands. We hypothesized that key proteins in macrophage adhesion and activation could be identified by observing protein expression resulting from various surface-adsorbed ligands and AG18 concentrations. Increasing concentrations of AG18 down or up regulate protein expression in adherent U937 on PBS-adsorbed TCPS at approximately 52, approximately 42 and approximately 23 kDa. AG18 concentrations had no effect on cells on albumin (Alb)-adsorbed surfaces but regulated different protein expression in adherent U937 on fibronectin (FN)-adsorbed TCPS at 40 and 80 microm AG18. Both Alb and FN regulate distinct sets of proteins in adherent cells as surface-adsorbed ligands. Based on the data from LC/MS, both surface associated ligand and increasing concentrations of AG18 modulate shifts in intracellular signaling.
