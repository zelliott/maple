The aglycons of the most abundant anthocyanins in food, cyanidin (cy) and delphinidin (del), represent potent inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Structure-activity studies show that the presence of vicinal hydroxy substituents at the phenyl ring at the 2-position (B-ring) is crucial for target interaction. The presence of a single hydroxy group or introduction of methoxy substituents at the B-ring results in a substantial loss of inhibitory properties. However, biological activity is not exclusively limited to compounds bearing vicinal hydroxy groups. A contradictory structure-activity relationship is observed for the inhibition of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Of the anthocyanidins tested, malvidin, bearing methoxy substituents in the 3'- and 5'-positions, most effectively inhibited cAMP hydrolysis. The absence of methoxy groups and/or replacement by hydroxy substituents was found to strongly diminish PDE-inhibitory properties. We found that either effective EGFR inhibition or effective PDE inhibition is required to achieve a shut-down of the central mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, a signaling cascade crucial for the regulation of cell growth. This is consistent with the finding that efficient reduction of cell growth is limited to anthocyanidins that are potent EGFR- or PDE-inhibitors including cy and del or malvidin (mv), respectively. In summary, depending on the substitution pattern at the B-ring, anthocyanidins interfere with different signaling cascades involved in the regulation of cell growth.
