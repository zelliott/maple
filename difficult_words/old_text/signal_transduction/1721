Fusion proteins between the human 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) receptor and either wild type or certain pertussis toxin-resistant forms of G(o1)alpha and G(i1)alpha display constitutive GTPase activity that can be inhibited by the inverse agonist spiperone. Addition of recombinant regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) 1 or RGS16 to membranes expressing these fusion proteins resulted in elevation of this constitutive GTPase activity without significantly altering the binding affinity of antagonist/inverse agonist ligands. For a 5-HT(1A) receptor-(Cys(351)Ile)G(o1)alpha fusion protein the increase in basal GTPase activity was greater than 4-fold. Enzyme kinetic analysis demonstrated that the effect of RGS1 was as a GTPase-activating protein for the fusion construct. In the presence of the RGS proteins, both agonists and inverse agonists produced much more robust regulation of high-affinity GTPase activity than in their absence. This allowed detection of the partial agonist nature of WAY100635, which has been described previously as a neutral antagonist at the 5-HT(1A) receptor. Of a range of ligands studied, only haloperidol functioned as a neutral ligand in the presence of RGS1. These studies show that addition of a recombinant RGS protein provides a simple and novel means to elevate the fraction of basal membrane GTPase activity contributed by the constitutive activity of a receptor. By so doing, it also greatly enhances the ability to detect and analyze the effects of inverse agonists and to discriminate between neutral ligands and those with low levels of positive intrinsic efficacy.
