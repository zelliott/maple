The effect of blockade of NF-kappaB activity on human pancreatic cancer angiogenesis was determined in an orthotopic xenograft model. Highly metastatic L3.3 human pancreatic cancer cells, which expressed an elevated level of constitutive NF-kappaB activity, were transfected with a mutated IkappaBalpha (IkappaBalphaM). After implantation in the pancreas of nude mice, parental (L3.3) and control vector-transfected (L3.3-Neo) cells produced rapidly growing tumors and liver metastases, whereas IkappaBalphaM-transfected (L3.3-IkappaBalphaM) cells had decreased tumorigenicity and metastatic potential. NF-kappaB signaling blockade significantly inhibited the in vitro and in vivo expression of the major proangiogenic molecules vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-8 and decreased tumor vascular formation. These events were correlated with retarded tumor growth and suppression of metastasis. Collectively, these data suggest that suppression of tumorigenicity and metastasis by NF-kappaB blockade is due to impaired angiogenic potential of tumor cells.
