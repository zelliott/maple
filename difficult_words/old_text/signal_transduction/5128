Recent thymic emigrants, the youngest T cells in the lymphoid periphery, undergo a 3 week-long period of functional and phenotypic maturation before being incorporated into the pool of mature, na√Øve T cells. Previous studies indicate that this maturation requires T cell exit from the thymus and access to secondary lymphoid organs, but is MHC-independent. We now show that post-thymic T cell maturation is independent of homeostatic and costimulatory pathways, requiring neither signals delivered by IL-7 nor CD80/86. Furthermore, while CCR7/CCL19,21-regulated homing of recent thymic emigrants to the T cell zones within the secondary lymphoid organs is not required for post-thymic T cell maturation, an intact dendritic cell compartment modulates this process. It is thus clear that, unlike T cell development and homeostasis, post-thymic maturation is focused not on interrogating the T cell receptor or the cell's responsiveness to homeostatic or costimulatory signals, but on some as yet unrecognized property.
