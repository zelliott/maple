Polyamines (PA), polyamine oxidases, copper amine oxidases, and nitric oxide (NO) play important roles in physiology and stress responses in plants. NO biosynthesis as a result of catabolism of PA by polyamine oxidases and copper amine oxidases may explain in part PA-mediated responses. Involvement of a copper amine oxidase gene, COPPER AMINE OXIDASE1 (CuAO1), of Arabidopsis was tested for its role in stress responses using the knockouts cuao1-1 and cuao1-2. PA-induced and ABA-induced NO production investigated by fluorometry and fluorescence microscopy showed that the cuao1-1 and cuao1-2 are impaired in NO production, suggesting a function of CuAO1 in PA and ABA-mediated NO production. Furthermore, we found a PA-dependent increase in protein S-nitrosylation. The addition of PA and ABA also resulted in H(2)O(2) increases. cuao1-1 and cuao1-2 showed less sensitivity to exogenous ABA supplementation during germination, seedling establishment, and root growth inhibition as compared to wild-type. In response to ABA treatment, expression levels of the stress-responsive genes RD29A and ADH1 were significantly lower in the knockouts. These observations characterize cuao1-1 and cuao1-2 as ABA-insensitive mutants. Taken together, our findings extend the ABA signal transduction network to include CuAO1 as one potential contributor to enhanced NO production by ABA.
