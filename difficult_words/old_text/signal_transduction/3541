Cancer/testis antigen (CTA) SSX2, which is silent in most normal adult tissues             and expressed in various malignant tumors, has been identified for decades. Expression             of SSX in tumors has been associated with advanced stages and worse patient prognosis.             However, little is known about its role in breast cancer. The SSX2 expression             plasmid constructed was stably transfected into the breast cancer cell line MCF-7.             The influence of SSX2 on MCF-7 cells was assessed using MTT assay, flow cytometry,             transwell invasion assay and in vivo tumorigenicity assay. A comparative proteomic             approach was performed to identify and clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms.             SSX2 expression was more pronounced in ERα-negative breast cancer cells compared             with the positive ones. Overexpression of SSX2 induced cell growth and prompted             cell invasion. Both ERα and E-cadherin expression were suppressed in the SSX2             overexpressing MCF-7 cells. Eleven known proteins were identified with significant             differential expression. Among these, five were decreased, while other six were             increased in the SSX2 overexpressing MCF-7 cells. These results suggested SSX2             may enhance invasiveness in MCF-7 cells both in vivo and in vitro. The regulation             of ERα signaling by target proteins of SSX2 may explain the metastatic potential             of breast cancer cells.
