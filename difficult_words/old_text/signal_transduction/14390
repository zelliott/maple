Progress has been made in the development and application of mechanism-based pharmacodynamic models for describing the drug-specific and physiological factors influencing the time course of responses to the diverse actions of drugs. However, the biological variability in biosignals and the complexity of pharmacological systems often complicate or preclude the direct application of traditional structural and nonstructural models. Mathematical transforms may be used to provide measures of drug effects, identify structural and temporal patterns, and visualize multidimensional data from analyses of biomedical signals and images. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet analyses are two methodologies that have proven to be useful in this context. FFT converts a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain, whereas wavelet transforms colocalize in both domains and may be utilized effectively for nonstationary signals. Nonstationary drug effects are common but have not been well analyzed and characterized by other methods. In this review, we discuss specific applications of these transforms in pharmacodynamics and their potential role in ascertaining the dynamics of spatiotemporal properties of complex pharmacological systems.
