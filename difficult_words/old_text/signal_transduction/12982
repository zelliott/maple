We tested the hypothesis that p42/44MAPK and p38MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases; MAPK) signaling pathways regulate endothelial cell permeability to macromolecules. Passage 2-4 human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown to confluence on fibronectin-coated Snapwell membranes. The flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran-70 across the HUVEC monolayers served to determine permeability. Application of 1 mM 8-bromo 3' 5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) increased permeability from 7.0 +/- 1.6 x 10(-6) to 12.5 +/- 2.8 x 10(-6) cm/s (P < 0.05). Pretreatment of HUVEC for 60 min with a selective p42/44MAPK inhibitor (AG126 at 2.7 and 27 microM) blocked 8-Br-cGMP-induced hyperpermeability. However, inhibition of p38MAPK (SB203580 at 0.6 microM) did not influence the cGMP-induced hyperpermeability response. AG126, administered at 27 microM, decreased baseline permeability from 7.9 +/- 0.5 x 10(-6) to 5.9 +/- 0.5 x 10(-6) cm/s (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that the p42/44MAPK signaling pathway is important in the regulation of baseline permeability and cGMP-induced hyperpermeability.
