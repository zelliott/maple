The laminin receptors (LRs) play important roles in cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, certain cell-cell adhesions, and the activation of many intracellular signaling pathways. Studies of LRs have primarily focused on mammals, while few studies of LRs in marine invertebrates have been reported. The functions of LRs in marine bivalve species are still unclear.

In this study, we cloned and sequenced an LR gene, MmeLR, from the clam Meretrix meretrix. The MmeLR mRNA and protein detected by realtime PCR and western blots were primarily distributed in muscle tissues. Far-western analysis showed a specific interaction between recombinant MmeLR and the LR ligand laminin. The results of the binding assay suggested a role of LR in cell adhesion and apoptosis in cultured primary cells of mantle tissues from M. meretrix. The Bcl-2 mRNA expression level in primary cells cultured in matrigel (mainly laminin) coated plates was significantly higher than in cells cultured in non-coated plates at 48 h of culture, while the p53 mRNA expression pattern was inversely related to that of bcl-2, suggesting that MmeLR is involved in p53-dependent apoptosis, and the binding between MmeLR and laminin inhibits apoptosis during primary cell culture.

Our results suggest that MmeLR may be involved in cell adhesion and apoptosis. This study may increase the understanding of the role of laminin receptor in cell adhesion and apoptosis and help to improve the culture of primary cells of marine invertebrates.
