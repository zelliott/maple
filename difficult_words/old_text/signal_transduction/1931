Increasing evidence has placed hormones and neuropeptides among potent immunomodulators, in both health and disease. Herein, we focus on the effects of growth hormone (GH) upon the thymus. Exogenous GH enhances thymic microenvironmental cell-derived secretory products such as cytokines and thymic hormones. Moreover, GH increases thymic epithelial cell (TEC) proliferation in vitro, and exhibits a synergistic effect with anti-CD3 in stimulating thymocyte proliferation, which is in keeping with the data showing that transgenic mice overexpressing GH or GH-releasing hormone exhibit overgrowth of the thymus. GH also influences thymocyte traffic: it increases human T-cell progenitor engraftment into the thymus; augments TEC/thymocyte adhesion and the traffic of thymocytes in the lymphoepithelial complexes, the thymic nurse cells; modulates in vivo the homing of recent thymic emigrants, enhancing the numbers of fluroscein isothiocyanate (FITC)+ cells in the lymph nodes and diminishing them in the spleen. In keeping with the effects of GH upon thymic cells is the detection of GH receptors in both TEC and thymocytes. Additionally, data indicate that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 is involved in several effects of GH in the thymus, including the modulation of thymulin secretion, TEC proliferation as well as thymocyte/TEC adhesion. This is in keeping with the demonstration of IGF-1 production and expression of IGF-1 by TEC and thymocytes. Also, it should be envisioned as an intrathymic circuitry, involving not only IGF-1, but also GH itself, as intrathymic GH expression is seen both in TEC and in thymocytes, and that thymocyte-derived GH could enhance thymocyte proliferation. Finally, the possibility that GH improve thymic functions, including thymocyte proliferation and migration, places this molecule as a potential therapeutic adjuvant in immunodeficiency conditions associated with thymocyte decrease and loss of peripheral T cells.
