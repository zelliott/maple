The outflow facility for aqueous humor across the trabecular meshwork (TM) is enhanced by agents that oppose the actomyosin contraction of its resident cells. Phosphorylation of MYPT1 (myosin light chain [MLC] phosphatase complex of Type 1) at Thr853 and Thr696 inhibits dephosphorylation of MLC, leading to an increase in actomyosin contraction. In this study, we examined the effects of Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitors on the relative dephosphorylation of the two sites of MYPT1 using human TM cells (GTM3).

Dephosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr853 and Thr696 was determined by western blot analysis following exposure to selective inhibitors of ROCK, namely Y-27632 and Y-39983. Consequent dephosphorylation of MLC and decreases in actomyosin contraction were assessed by western blot analysis and collagen gel contraction assay, respectively. Changes in the cell-matrix adhesion were measured in real time by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing and also assessed by staining for paxillin, vinculin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK).

Both ROCK inhibitors produced a concentration-dependent dephosphorylation at Thr853 and Thr696 of MYPT1 in adherent GTM3 cells. IC₅₀ values for Y-39983 were 15 nM and 177 nM for dephosphorylation at Thr853 and Thr696, respectively. Corresponding values for Y-27632 were 658 nM and 2270 nM. Analysis of the same samples showed a decrease in MLC phosphorylation with IC₅₀ values of 14 nM and 1065 nM for Y-39983 and Y-27632, respectively. Consistent with these changes, both inhibitors opposed contraction of collagen gels induced by TM cells. Exposure of cells to the inhibitors led to a decrease in the electrical cell-substrate resistance, with the effect of Y-39983 being more pronounced than Y-27632. Treatment with these ROCK inhibitors also showed a loss of stress fibers and a concomitant decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK.

Y-39983 and Y-27632 oppose ROCK-dependent phosphorylation of MYPT1 predominantly at Thr853 with a corresponding decrease in MLC phosphorylation. A relatively low effect of both ROCK inhibitors at Thr696 suggests a role for other Ser/Thr kinases at this site. Y-39983 was several-fold more potent when compared with Y-27632 at inhibiting the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at either Thr853 or Thr696 commensurate with its greater potency at inhibiting the activity of human ROCK-I and ROCK-II enzymes.
