The endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), major component of Gram-negative bacteria cell wall, activate numerous types of cells, neutrophils included. The chemical compositions of polysaccharide (O-specific polysaccharide and core oligosaccharide) and hydrophobic lipid A parts of LPS are presented. The bindings of LPSs to neutrophils resulted in signal transduction and neutrophils activation. Neutrophils, under LPS stimulation, generate oxygen radicals, nitric oxide and other components of inflammatory processes.
