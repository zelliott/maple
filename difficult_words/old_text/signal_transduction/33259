T cells from old mice showed impaired proliferative response to antigenic stimulation. To understand the mechanism underlying the age-related impairment of T cell functions, the signal transduction pathway was examined and compared between T cells from young and old mice, and between T cell clones established from a young and old mouse. The age-related changes in T cells were as follows: (1) reduction in the expression and the activation of protein tyrosine kinases associated with T cell receptor (TCR) after antigenic stimulation; (2) reduced phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1); (3) reduced production of second messengers such as inositoltrisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG); and (4) reduced influx of Ca2+ ion. Thus, a T cell clone established from an old mouse showed impaired proliferation by stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody, but was fully activated to the level of a T cell clone from a young mouse by stimulation with phorbol acetate myristate (PMA) plus ionomycin (INM). However, splenic T cells freshly prepared from old mice did not show full recovery by the same treatment. The results indicate that one major blockade in the signal transduction of T cells from old mice is present in the pathway just after TCR, but besides this, the blockade is also present in multiple sites down-stream, which can not be bypassed by stimulation with PMA plus INM.
