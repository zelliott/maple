The release of transmitters at sympathoeffector junctions is not constant, but subject to modulation by a plethora of different mechanisms. In this respect, presynaptic receptors located on the sympathetic axon terminals are of utmost importance, because they are activated by exogenous agonists and by endogenous neurotransmitters. In the latter case, the transmitters that activate the presynaptic receptors of a nerve terminal may be released either from the very same nerve ending or from a different axon terminal, and the receptors involved are auto- and heteroreceptors, respectively. In terms of their structural and functional features, receptors of sympathetic axon terminals can be categorized as either ionotropic (transmitter-gated ion channels) or metabotropic (most commonly G protein-coupled) receptors. This review summarizes results on more than 30 different metabotropic and four different ionotropic receptors that have been found to control the amount of transmitter being released from sympathetic neurons. Each of these receptors may not only stimulate, facilitate, and reduce sympathetic transmitter release, respectively, but also interact with the functions of other receptors present on the same axonal varicosity. This provides a multitude of mechanisms that regulate the amount of sympathetic transmitter output. Accordingly, a sophisticated cross-talk within and between extra- and intracellular signals is integrated at axon terminals to adapt the strength of sympathoeffector transmission to a given situation. This will not only determine the function of the sympathetic nervous system in health and disease, but also therapeutic and untoward effects of drugs that bind to the presynaptic receptors in sympathetically innervated tissues.
