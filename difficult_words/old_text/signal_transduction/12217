Over the last decade, the endocannabinoid system (ECS) has emerged as a potential target for multiple sclerosis (MS) management. A growing amount of evidence suggests that cannabinoids may be neuroprotective during CNS inflammation. Advances in the understanding of the physiology and pharmacology of the ECS have potentiated the interest of several components of this system as useful biological targets for disease management. Alterations of the ECS have been recently implicated in a number of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions, so that the pharmacological modulation of cannabinoid (CB) receptors and/or of the enzymes controlling synthesis, transport, and degradation of these lipid mediators is considered an option to treat several neurological diseases. This chapter focuses on our current understanding of the function of anandamide (AEA), its biological and therapeutic implications, as well as a description of its effects on neuroimmune modulation.
