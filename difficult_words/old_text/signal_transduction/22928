Cell-cell adhesion complexes play an important role in the organization and behavior of cells in tissues. An important step in the formation of such complexes is the clustering of the adhesion receptors; this is critical for proper adhesion, for anchorage of the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, and for generation of different intracellular signals. Recent advances reveal that several interconnected mechanisms are responsible for clustering of the different adhesion receptors.
