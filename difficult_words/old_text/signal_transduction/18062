We have investigated the role of cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) in neutrophil phagocytosis. Inhibition of cAPK with H-89 reduced complement- and IgG-dependent phagocytosis to 83 and 46%, respectively. Fluorescence intensity measurements of phalloidin-stained actin in neutrophils showed a reduced amount of filamentous actin (F-actin) in pseudopods and around the phagosome in cells treated with H-89 or cAMP-elevating agents (forskolin and rolipram). The amount of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins was also reduced in pseudopods and around the phagosome. Taken together, the data show that cAMP/cAPK regulates F-actin reorganization during receptor-mediated phagocytosis, particularly triggered by IgG-FcR interaction. Our results support the hypothesis that active subcortical reorganization of F-actin is a prerequisite for FcR-mediated phagocytosis, but is less important during CR3-mediated ingestion.
