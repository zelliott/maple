A novel clonal cell line derived from a human glioma (HOG) was found to express some oligodendrocyte-specific proteins including a 15-kDa form of myelin basic protein (MBP) and high 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) activity. Expression of the myelin lipids galactosylceramide and sulfogalactosylceramide (sulfatide) was low. HOG cells did not express the characteristic astrocyte markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or significant glutamine synthetase (GS) activity. After initial plating, HOG cells were flat and epitheloid and thus showed a limited oligodendrocyte-like morphology. However, after cells became more confluent, some cells were phase-bright and elaborated short processes. Receptor types expressed by HOG cells included A2-adenosine, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), and beta 2-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) linked to stimulation of adenylate cyclase, and muscarinic cholinergic and H1-histamine coupled to phosphatidyinositol turnover (Post and Dawson, 1991). HOG cells should therefore provide a useful model for studying the extracellular regulation and phosphorylation of oligodendrocyte-specific proteins.
