Imiquimod is a TLR7/8 agonist that has anticancer therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of precancerous skin lesions and certain nonmelanoma skin cancers. To test our hypothesis that imiquimod enhances DNA repair as a mechanism for its anticancer activity, the nucleotide excision repair genes were studied in bone marrow-derived cells. Imiquimod enhanced the expression of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) A and other DNA repair genes (quantitative real-time PCR analysis) and resulted in an increased nuclear localization of the DNA repair enzyme XPA. This was dependent on MyD88, as bone marrow-derived cells from MyD88(-/-) mice did not increase XPA gene expression and did not enhance the survival of MyD88(-/-)-derived bone marrow-derived cells after UV B exposure as was observed in bone marrow-derived cells from MyD88(+/+) mice. Imiquimod also enhanced DNA repair of UV light (UVL)-irradiated gene expression constructs and accelerated the resolution of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers after UVL exposures in P388 and XS52. Lastly, topical treatment of mouse skin with 5% imiquimod cream prior to UVL irradiation resulted in a decrease in the number of cyclobutane pyridimine dimer-positive APC that were found in local lymph nodes 24 h after UVL irradiation in both wild-type and IL-12 gene-targeted mice. In total, these data support the idea that TLR7 agonists such as imiquimod enhance DNA repair in bone marrow-derived cells. This property is likely to be an important mechanism for its anticancer effects because it protects cutaneous APC from the deleterious effects of UVL.
