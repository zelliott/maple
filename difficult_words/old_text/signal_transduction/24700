The mechanism of action of ipriflavone, an isoflavone derivative, was studied in the osteoblastic-like UMR-106 cell line. Ipriflavone affected both phosphoinositide hydrolysis and 45Ca2+ uptake. A repeated treatment of UMR-106 cells (once a day, for 3 days) with ipriflavone decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation. This effect was also achieved after single addition of high concentrations of ipriflavone or 100 nM [Asu1,7]eel-calcitonin, a semi-synthetic analog of eel calcitonin. When repeatedly added to UMR-106 cells, 17 beta-estradiol produced a marked inhibition of [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation, an effect which appeared significant only at a concentration of 1 microM and which was accompanied by a reduced incorporation of [3H]inositol into membrane phospholipids. A repeated treatment with ipriflavone reduced 45Ca2+ uptake as well. This effect was observed also after a single addition of [Asu1,7]eel-calcitonin but not following single or repeated treatment with 17 beta-estradiol. The present data indicate the osteoblast as a direct and specific target for ipriflavone and suggest that this compound may share intracellular transducing mechanisms with other antiosteoporotic hormones such as estrogen and calcitonin.
