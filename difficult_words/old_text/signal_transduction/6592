The characteristics of the activation of a histone H4 kinase activity in Triton X-100 lysates of rabbit peritoneal neutrophils pretreated with fMet-Leu-Phe were studied: The activation of the kinase was a) inhibited by the antagonist of formylpeptide, t-Boc-(Phe-Leu)2(-)-Phe, b) completely inhibited by pertussis toxin pretreatment, c) not affected by the pretreatment of neutrophils with an activator of protein kinase C, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, or an inhibitor of protein kinase C, 1-(5-isoquinoline-sulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine, and d) not inhibited in the cells preloaded with the intracellular calcium chelators, bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra acetic acid acetoxymethyl-ester (BAPTA/AM). These results suggest that the stimulus-induced activation of H4 kinase requires functional receptor and GTP-binding protein but neither calcium mobilization nor protein kinase C activation.
