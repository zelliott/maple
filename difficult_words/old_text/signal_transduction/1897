Intracellular assays of signal transduction in T cells stimulated by antigen in vivo have been limited by requirements for large numbers of highly purified cells to perform conventional biochemical techniques. Here, we describe a technique using flow cytometry to study signaling events in T cells after antigen recognition in the body.
