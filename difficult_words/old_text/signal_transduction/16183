Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) are a class of hyperglycosylated, hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins that are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. AtAGP17, 18 and 19 are homologous genes encoding three classical lysine-rich AGPs in Arabidopsis. We observed subcellular localization of AtAGP18 at the plasma membrane by expressing a translational fusion gene construction of AtAGP18 attached to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag in Arabidopsis plants. We also overexpressed AtAGP18 without the GFP tag in Arabidopsis plants, and the resulting transgenic plants had a short, bushy phenotype. Here we discuss putative roles of AtAGP18 as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein involved in a signal transduction pathway regulating plant growth and development.
