Signals through the Notch receptors are used throughout development to control cellular fate choices. Loss- and gain-of-function studies revealed both the pleiotropic action of the Notch signalling pathway in development and the potential of Notch signals as tools to influence the developmental path of undifferentiated cells. As we review here, Notch signalling affects the development of the nervous system at many different levels. Understanding the complex genetic circuitry that allows Notch signals to affect specific cell fates in a context-specific manner defines the next challenge, especially as such an understanding might have important implications for regenerative medicine.
