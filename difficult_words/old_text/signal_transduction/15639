To enhance our understanding of the function(s) of gamma-tubulin-complex proteins (GCPs), we identified and analyzed the functions of the Aspergillus nidulans homologs of GCP2-GCP6 (here designated GCPB-GCBF). The gamma-tubulin small complex (gamma-TuSC) components, gamma-tubulin, GCPB and GCPC, are essential for viability and mitotic spindle formation, whereas GCPD-GCPF are not essential for viability, spindle formation or sexual reproduction. GCPD-GCPF function in reducing the frequency of chromosome mis-segregation and in the assembly of large gamma-tubulin complexes. Deletion of any of the gamma-TuSC components eliminates the localization of all GCPs to the spindle pole body (SPB), whereas deletion of GCPD-GCPF does not affect localization of gamma-TuSC components. Thus, GCPD-GCPF do not tether the gamma-TuSC to the SPB, but, rather, the gamma-TuSC tethers them to the SPB. GCPD-GCPF exhibit a hierarchy of localization to the SPB. Deletion of GCPF eliminates GCPD-GCPE localization to the SPB, and deletion of GCPD eliminates GCPE (but not GCPF) localization. All GCPs localize normally in a GCPE deletion. We propose a model for the structure of the gamma-tubulin complex and its attachment to polar microtubule organizing centers.
