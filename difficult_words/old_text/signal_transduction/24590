The signal transduction systems of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1 receptor were studied in SK-N-MC human neuroblastoma cells. NPY induced an increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) and inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation, which were mediated through Y1 receptors. One-min preincubation of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibited both signal transductions dose-dependently, but its effect on [Ca2+]i was about 100-fold more potent than that on cyclic AMP. PMA had no effect on [125I]BH-NPY binding in SK-N-MC cells and hardly inhibited the endothelin-1-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. Pertussis toxin also inhibited the NPY-induced [Ca2+]i increase 30-fold more effectively than the NPY-mediated inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation. These results indicate that Y1 receptors in SK-N-MC cells couple to two signal transduction systems that have different sensitivities to phorbol ester and pertussis toxin treatments.
