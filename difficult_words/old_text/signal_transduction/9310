This study tested the hypothesis that activation of β2-adrenoceptors on DCs influences NOD2 signaling along with its cross-talk with Toll-like receptor-2 resulting in altered Th cell priming ability. Th17 cells are a newly discovered lineage of CD4(+) T cells involved in defense against extracellular bacteria and also implicated in autoimmune disorders. Initiation and polarization of the adaptive immune response is controlled by innate immune recognition mediated by DCs. Previous studies demonstrated that adrenergic receptors modulate cytokine production by DCs and affect their Th cell priming ability. We show that the β2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol enhanced IL-6 production in murine bone marrow-derived DCs stimulated with the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 ligand muramyl dipeptide. However, when the Toll-like receptor-2 ligand Pam3CysSK4 was added, salbutamol inhibited IL-12 but did not alter IL-6 and IL-23 expression. Gene expression analysis showed that salbutamol inhibited the p40 subunit as well as IL-12p35, while IL-23p19 and IL-6 were stimulated. Therefore, β2-adrenoceptors modulated cytokine production resulting in a Th17 cell priming cytokine pattern. Indeed, when antigen-pulsed DCs stimulated by muramyl dipeptide or Pam3CysSK4+muramyl dipeptide in the presence of salbutamol were used for in vivo immunization, the resulting Th17/Th1 cell ratio was increased as evaluated by IL-17 and IFN-γ production. In addition, intradermal injection of norepinephrine along with Pam3CysSK4+muramyl dipeptide increased the Th17 response to an immunogenic protein and this effect was reversed by a β2-adrenoceptor antagonist. Thus, β2-adrenoceptors may be involved in the regulation of defense against extracellular bacteria and the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.
