This investigation examined the role of estrogen receptor (ER) on the stimulatory effect of estradiol (E2) on protein phosphorylation in the oviduct as well as on E2-induced acceleration of oviductal oocyte transport in cyclic rats. Estrous rats were injected with E2 s.c. and with the ER antagonist ICI 182 780 intrabursally (i.b.), and 6 h later, oviducts were excised and protein phosphorylation was determined by Western blot analysis. ICI 182 780 inhibited the E2-induced phosphorylation of some oviductal proteins. Other estrous rats were treated with E2 s.c. and ICI 182 780 i.b. The number of eggs in the oviduct, assessed 24 h later, showed that ICI 182 780 blocked the E2-induced egg transport acceleration. The possible involvement of adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A (PK-A), protein kinase C (PK-C), or tyrosine kinases on egg transport acceleration induced by E2 was then examined. Selective inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase or PK-A inhibited the E2-induced egg transport acceleration, whereas PK-C or tyrosine kinase inhibitors had no effect. Furthermore, forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, mimicked the effect of E2 on ovum transport and E2 increased the level of cAMP in the oviduct of cycling rats. Finally, we measured PK-A activity in vitro in the presence of E2 or E2-ER complex. Activity of PK-A in the presence of E2 or E2-ER was similar to PK-A alone, showing that E2 or E2-ER did not directly activate PK-A. We conclude that the nongenomic pathway by which E2 accelerates oviductal egg transport in the rat requires absolute participation of ER and cAMP and partial participation of PK-A signaling pathways in the oviduct.
