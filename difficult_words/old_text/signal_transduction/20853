Neuromuscular synapses in Aplysia have been used as model systems to study peptidergic cotransmission. Here we describe neuromuscular preparations in which it has been possible to investigate the physiological consequences of peptide transmitter release in detail. In the first preparation, the release of peptide cotransmitters from identified motor neuron B15 has been shown to be sensitive to the pattern of stimulation. High frequencies and long burst durations evoke peptide release that modulates muscle contractions in a manner similar to that produced by exogenous cotransmitter. By contrast, the release of the same peptide transmitters from motor neuron B1 show little dependence on pattern. We conclude that there are no stimulation patterns that are prerequisites for peptide release. Peptide cotransmitter release from motor neuron B47 has also been studied. B47, depending on the stimulation pattern, uses either ACh, which acts as a conventional inhibitory transmitter, or ACh plus neuropeptides, which act as excitatory modulatory cotransmitters. Thus, neuropeptide cotransmitters have the capability to greatly increase synaptic plasticity at neuromuscular synapses.
