Although transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) can affect cell cycle arrest, not much molecular detail is known about how TGF-beta-dependent arrest is mediated. Two recent papers shed some light on how this is accomplished. Orian and Eisenman discuss how Myc interacts with Miz-1 to block the expression of a cell cycle inhibitory protein, p15(INK4b), and how TGF-beta is able to unblock Myc-dependent repression of Miz-1.
