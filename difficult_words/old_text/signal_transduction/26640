Geroprotective peptide T-34 regulates the expression of mRNA for various genes. The development of gastric ulcer is associated with morphological and molecular changes resulting from modulation of the synthesis of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proteins. Peptide T-34 normalizes the synthesis of these proteins by regulating the expression of the corresponding genes.
