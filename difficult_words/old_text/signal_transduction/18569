Although the precise causes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have yet to be discovered, important therapeutic advances have resulted from the manipulation of cytokine function(s) using anticytokine/cytokine therapies, such as targeting of tumor necrosis factor. We discuss the future of this area of investigation in the context of preclinical experimentation using animal models of IBD. In particular, we pinpoint the roles played by interleukin 6 and its intracellular signalling pathways in the SAMP1/Yit murine model of Crohn's-like ileitis.
