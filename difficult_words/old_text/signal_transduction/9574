Atherosclerotic plaques are characterized by hypoxic even anoxic areas and by high concentrations of oxidized lipoproteins. Moreover, unstable plaques attract a high number of macrophages despite the proapoptotic background within these plaques. Recently, it was shown that these macrophages are positive for Hif-1α. This subunit is a part of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (Hif-1), a key transcriptional factor under hypoxia. Till date, it is not understood whether the Hif-system (consisting of Hif-1, Hif-2 and Hif-3) is involved in protection of macrophages under these proatherogenic conditions. The present study delineates that oxLDL causes fundamental changes in the regulation of the Hif-system in primary human macrophages. First, both oxLDL and hypoxia mediate accumulation of Hif-1α protein. Second, treatment with a combination of oxLDL and hypoxia is acting in an additive manner on Hif-1α protein content. Third, oxLDL alone does not increase Hif-2α protein, but abolishes the hypoxic induction of Hif-2α completely. OxLDL treatment alone was not toxic for macrophages under neither normoxia nor hypoxia. But, inhibition of Hif-pathway by adenoviral expression of a dominant-negative mutant combined with oxLDL treatment independently of the oxygen tension leads to apoptosis, as determined by caspase-3 activation and induction of DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, this inhibition also mediates the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. In conclusion, the present data show that Hif-1α regulation is essential for survival of oxLDL-treated macrophages independent of the oxygen tension. Therefore, this newly characterized mechanism might also have an important influence for the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques.
