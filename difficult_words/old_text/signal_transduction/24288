Novel neurotrophin-1/B cell-stimulating factor-3 (NNT-1/BSF-3) is a recently cloned gp130 cytokine, acting through the tripartite ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) alpha/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR)/gp130 receptor complex. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of NNT-1/BSF-3 in corticotroph cell function and further characterize NNT-1/BSF-3 signaling pathways. Using RT-PCR, expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, and gp130 could be demonstrated in mRNA derived from murine corticotroph AtT-20 cells and murine pituitary tissue. Incubation of AtT-20 cells with 10 ng/ml recombinant human NNT-1/BSF-3 rapidly induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and STAT1 at 5 and 10 min. Proopiomelanocortin promoter activity and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 promoter activity were significantly stimulated by NNT-1/BSF-3 4.0 +/- 0.3- and 5.9 +/- 0.2-fold, respectively. In comparison with untreated control, NNT-1/BSF-3 significantly stimulated ACTH secretion at 24 and 48 h 1.7 +/- 0.2-fold and 1.5 +/- 0.1-fold above baseline. In comparison with mock-transfected cells, stable overexpression of SOCS-3 in AtT-20 cells abolished NNT-1/BSF-3-induced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and almost completely inhibited STAT-dependent proopiomelanocortin promoter and SOCS-3 promoter activities. In addition, NNT-1/BSF-3-induced ACTH secretion at 48 h was significantly attenuated by SOCS-3 overexpression. In summary, we have shown that NNT-1/BSF-3 is a modulator of corticotroph cell function, which is negatively regulated by SOCS-3. Our data indicate that the activation of the Jak-STAT cascade is essential for corticotroph NNT-1/BSF-3 signaling. Further studies will have to investigate the possible in vivo role of NNT-1/BSF-3 as a neuroimmunoendocrine modulator of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis stress response.
