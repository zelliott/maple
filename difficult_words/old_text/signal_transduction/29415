Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a cytosolic receptor that recognizes viral RNA and activates the interferon-mediated innate antiviral response. To understand the mechanism of signal activation at the receptor level, we cloned, expressed, and purified human RIG-I containing the two caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) followed by the C-terminal helicase domain. We found that recombinant RIG-I is a functional protein that interacts with double-stranded RNA with substantially higher affinity as compared with single-stranded RNA structures unless they contain a 5'-triphosphate group. Viral RNA binding to RIG-I stimulates the velocity of ATP hydrolysis by 33-fold, which at the cellular level translates into a 43-fold increase of interferon-beta expression. In contrast, the isolated ATPase/helicase domain is constitutively activated while also retaining its RNA ligand binding properties. These results support the recent model by which RIG-I signaling is autoinhibited in the absence of RNA by intra-molecular interactions between the CARDs and the C terminus. Based on pH profile and metal ion dependence experiments, we propose that the active site of RIG-I cannot efficiently accommodate divalent cations under the RNA-free repressed conformation. Overall, these results show a direct correlation between RNA binding and ATPase enzymatic function leading to signal transduction and suggest that a tight control of ATPase activity by the CARDs prevents RIG-I signaling in the absence of viral RNA.
