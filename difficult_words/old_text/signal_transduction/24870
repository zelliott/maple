Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-induced STAT inhibitor-1 [SSI-1; also known as suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1)] was identified as a negative feedback regulator of Janus kinase-STAT signaling. We previously generated mice lacking the SSI-1 gene (SSI-1 -/-) and showed that thymocytes and splenocytes in SSI-1 -/- mice underwent accelerated apoptosis. In this paper, we show that murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking the SSI-1 gene are more sensitive than their littermate controls to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced cell death. In addition, L929 cells forced to express SSI-1 (L929/SSI-1), but not SSI-3 or SOCS-5, are resistant to TNF-alpha-induced cell death. Furthermore L929/SSI-1 cells treated with TNF-alpha sustain the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. In contrast, SSI-1 -/- murine embryonic fibroblasts treated with TNF-alpha show hardly any activation of p38 MAP kinase. These findings suggest that SSI-1 suppresses TNF-alpha-induced cell death, which is mediated by p38 MAP kinase signaling.
