Studies were performed to determine the unknown status of PKC and RhoA/ROCK in the phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu)-stimulated state in the human internal anal sphincter (IAS) smooth muscle cells (SMCs). We determined the effects of PDBu (10(-7) M), the PKC activator, on PKCα and RhoA and ROCK II translocation in the human IAS SMCs. We used immunocytochemistry and fluorescence microcopy in the basal state, following PDBu, and before and after PKC inhibitor calphostin C (10(-6) M), cell-permeable RhoA inhibitor C3 exoenzyme (2.5 μg/ml), and ROCK inhibitor Y 27632 (10(-6) M). We also determined changes in the SMC lengths via computerized digital micrometry. In the basal state PKCα was distributed almost uniformly throughout the cell, whereas RhoA and ROCK II were located in the higher intensities toward the periphery. PDBu caused significant translocation of PKCα, RhoA, and ROCK II. PDBu-induced translocation of PKCα was attenuated by calphostin C and not by C3 exoenzyme and Y 27632. However, PDBu-induced translocation of RhoA was blocked by C3 exoenzyme, and that of ROCK II was attenuated by both C3 exoenzyme and Y 27632. Contraction of the human IAS SMCs caused by PDBu in parallel with RhoA/ROCK II translocation was attenuated by C3 exoenzyme and Y 27632 but not by calphostin C. In human IAS SMCs RhoA/ROCK compared with PKC are constitutively active, and contractility by PDBu is associated with RhoA/ROCK activation rather than PKC. The relative contribution of RhoA/ROCK vs. PKC in the pathophysiology and potential therapy for the IAS dysfunction remains to be determined.
