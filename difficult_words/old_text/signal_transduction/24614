Adhesion receptors allow cells to interact with a dynamic and information-rich environment of extracellular matrix molecules. The integrin family of adhesion receptors transduces signals from the extracellular matrix that regulate growth, gene expression and differentiation, as well as cell shape, motility and cytoskeletal architecture. Recent data support the hypothesis that integrins transduce signals cooperatively with other classes of adhesion receptors or with growth factor receptors. Furthermore, the ability of integrins to interact with the cytoskeleton appears to be fundamental to their mechanism for signal transduction.
