The proteins Grb2-Sem-5, Shc and Sos have been implicated in the signalling pathway from tyrosine kinase receptors to Ras. Grb2-Sem-5 binds directly to murine Sos1, a Ras exchange factor, through two SH3 domains. Sos is also associated with ligand-activated tyrosine kinase receptors which bind Grb2-Sem-5, and with the Grb2-Sem-5 binding protein, Shc. Ectopic expression of Drosophila Sos stimulates morphological transformation of rodent fibroblasts. These data define a pathway by which tyrosine kinases act through Ras to control cell growth and differentiation.
