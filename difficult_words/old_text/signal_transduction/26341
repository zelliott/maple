Xenopus laevis provides a robust model system to study cellular signaling and downstream processes during development both in vitro and in vivo. Intracellular signals must function within highly restricted spatial and temporal domains to activate specific downstream targets and cellular processes. Combining the versatility of developing Xenopus neurons with advances in fluorescent protein biosensors and imaging technologies has allowed many dynamic cellular processes to be visualized. This review will focus on the techniques we use to visualize and measure cell signaling, motility and adhesion by quantitative fluorescence microscopy in vitro and in vivo.
