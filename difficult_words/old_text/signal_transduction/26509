Stroke (hypoxia) is one of the leading causes of mortality in the developed countries, and it can induce excessive glutamate release and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Taurine, as a free amino acid, present in high concentrations in a range of organs in mammals, can provide protection against multiple neurological diseases. Here, we present a study to investigate the potential protective benefits of taurine against ER stress induced by glutamate and hypoxia/reoxygenation in primary cortical neuronal cultures. We found that taurine suppresses the up-regulation of caspase-12 and GADD153/CHOP induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation, suggesting that taurine may exert a protective function against hypoxia/reoxygenation by reducing the ER stress. Moreover, taurine can down-regulate the ratio of cleaved ATF6 and full length ATF6, and p-IRE1 expression, indicating that taurine inhibits the ER stress induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation and glutamate through suppressing ATF6 and IRE1 pathways.
