We report the identification and characterization of a previously unidentified protein domain found in bacterial chemoreceptors and other bacterial signal transduction proteins. This domain contains a motif of three noncontiguous histidines and one cysteine, arranged as Hxx[WFYL]x(21-28)Cx[LFMVI]Gx[WFLVI]x(18-27)HxxxH(boldface type indicates residues that are nearly 100% conserved). This domain was first identified in the soluble Helicobacter pylori chemoreceptor TlpD. Using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry on heterologously and natively expressed TlpD, we determined that this domain binds zinc with a subfemtomolar dissociation constant. We thus named the domain CZB, for chemoreceptor zinc binding. Further analysis showed that many bacterial signaling proteins contain the CZB domain, most commonly proteins that participate in chemotaxis but also those that participate in c-di-GMP signaling and nitrate/nitrite sensing, among others. Proteins bearing the CZB domain are found in several bacterial phyla. The variety of signaling proteins using the CZB domain suggests that it plays a critical role in several signal transduction pathways.
