In the past year there have been significant advances in understanding the role of interleukin-2. Its role in the activation of T cells by antigen-presenting cells, the structure-activity relationships between interleukin-2 and its receptor and the subsequent signaling have all become clearer. The creation of mice with a specific defect in the interleukin-2 gene has given us a clearer idea of its role in vivo. Recent studies also suggest that interleukin-2 may finally find a role in immunotherapy.
