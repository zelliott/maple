Macrophage cell lines exhibit different responses to IFN-gamma depending on their maturation stage. We investigated the mechanisms underlying the differential IFN-gamma responsiveness in the less mature P388.D1 and in mature RAW264.7 cells. A reduction in the binding activity of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT-1) to different STAT binding elements (SBEs) was observed in P388.D1. This reduced binding activity was not due to an impaired STAT-1 activation. Studies on the expression of a negative regulator of cytokine signalling, protein-inhibiting activated STAT-1 (PIAS-1), showed that this protein was expressed constitutively at high levels in P388.D1. Forced expression of a PIAS-1 homologue, the Gu binding protein (GBP), inhibited the STAT-1-mediated gene activation in RAW264.7 cells, whereas a construct expressing the 5' portion of GBP in the antisense orientation reverts the IFN-gamma-resistant phenotype of P388.D1. Thus, our results indicate that PIAS-1 may account for the differential IFN-gamma responsiveness in macrophage cell lines at different stages of maturation.
