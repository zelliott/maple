Pleural fluid accumulation is a frequent clinical observation in diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). The cytological analysis of pleural fluid often reveals the presence of free spheroid aggregates of malignant cells, giving rise to the question of the ability of non-adherent tumor cells to resist the loss of anchorage-induced apoptosis (termed as anoikis), and to develop new tumor foci in the pleural cavity. Here, we show that MPM cells cultured under non-adherent conditions form well-organized aggregates composed of viable cells, which progressively enter in G(0). Although the PI3K/Akt, ERK and SAPK/JNK signaling pathways are activated in adherent MPM cells, loss of anchorage results in the inactivation of these pathways. By comparison, we show that the non-tumoral mesothelial cells MeT-5A enter anoikis in an SAPK/JNK-, Bim- and caspase-9-dependent pathway. The survival of MPM cells can be reversed by activating SAPK/JNK with anisomycin, according to a Bim-dependent mitochondrial pathway. Finally, our findings show that impairment of cell aggregation activates SAPK/JNK and Bim and induces anoikis. Our results underline the importance of intercellular contacts in the anoikis resistance of MPM cells.
