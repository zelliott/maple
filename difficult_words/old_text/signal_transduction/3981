Human immunodeficiency virus binds to CD4+ T lymphocyte by the interaction, in part, between its gp120 envelope glycoprotein and the CD4 molecule. We and others have reported that the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-kinase) is associated with the CD4-p56lck complex and can be activated by various CD4 ligands. In a previous report we showed that the gp160 envelope down-regulates lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)-dependent adhesion between CD4+ T cells and B cells. This down-regulation was shown to be p56lck-dependent. Here we investigate the role of PI3-kinase in the inhibition of adhesion induced by gp160 binding to CD4. We found that gp160 activates the PI3-kinase of HUT78 CD4+ T cell lines in a way dependent on CD4-p56lck association, since no activation was detected when the interaction between CD4 and p56lck was disrupted. It was also shown, using different inhibitors of the PI3-kinase (wortmannin, Ly294002 and antisense oligonucleotides), that this lipid kinase was necessary for the down-regulation of LFA-1-mediated adhesion induced by gp160. These results strongly suggest that PI3-kinase activation induced by gp160 leads to down-regulation of LFA-1-mediated T cell adhesion to B cells. Inhibition by gp160 of cytoskeleton rearrangement-dependent, anti-CD3-mediated T cell adhesion to B cells was blocked by neutralization of PI3-kinase activity, while inhibition of cytoskeleton rearrangement-independent, Mg(2+)-induced T cell adhesion was not. These results emphasize the role of PI3-kinase in the regulation of cytoskeleton structure. It is proposed that gp160 activates both p56lck and PI3-kinase which lead to a cytoskeleton organization unfavorable for LFA-1 function.
