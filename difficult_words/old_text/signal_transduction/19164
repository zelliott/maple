In order for haploid gametes to fuse during fertilization, microtubules (MTs) must generate forces that are sufficient to move the nuclei together. Nuclear movements during fertilization rely on microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), many of which have been characterized extensively during mitosis. A useful model system to study MT-dependent forces before nuclear fusion, or karyogamy, is the mating pathway of budding yeast. Dynamic MTs are guided to the mating projection (shmoo tip) when plus-end-binding proteins interact with polarized actin microfilaments. If two shmoo tips are in proximity they may fuse, dissolving the MT-cortical interactions. Subsequently, oppositely oriented MT plus ends interact and draw the nuclei together. The plus-end-binding proteins in the yeast mating pathway are conserved in metazoan cells and may play a role in higher eukaryotic fertilizaton. Thus, understanding the mechanism of plus end orientation and karyogamy in budding yeast will reveal mechanisms of MT-dependent force generation conserved throughout evolution.
