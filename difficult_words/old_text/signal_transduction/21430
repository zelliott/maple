To elucidate an understanding into H-Ras protein network, we have established various oncogene H-Ras-expressing NIH/3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cell clones, which are expressing G12V H-Ras, G12R H-Ras, and G12V/T35S H-Ras proteins under the tight control of expression by an antibiotic doxycycline. Here we provide a catalog of proteome profiles in total cell lysate derived from the oncogenic and partial loss of function H-Ras-expressing NIH/3T3 cells. In this biological context, we compared total proteome changes by the combined methods of 2-DE, quantitative image analysis and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis both commonly in oncogenic and partial loss of function H-Ras expression system. Thus, we tried to dissect H-Ras signaling pathway, especially a downstream effector molecule, Raf in NIH/3T3 cells using proteomics tools. In this study, we centralized upon the proteome profile changes as common targets for oncogenic H-Ras and a partial loss of function H-Ras in the H-Ras-expressing cells. Thirteen protein spots were selected as what the staining intensities on the gels for 2-DE images from both kinds of cells were consistently changed in their protein expression level. Differentially regulated expression was further confirmed for some subsets of candidates by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Taken together, our results obtained and present here show that the comparative analysis of proteome from oncogenic and partial loss of function H-Ras-expressing cells has yielded interpretable data to elucidate the protein network directly and/or indirectly.
