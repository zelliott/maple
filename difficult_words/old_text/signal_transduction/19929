Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling induces embryonic vascular development and angiogenesis in adult tissues. Direct phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein profilin by VEGF receptors is now shown to increase its affinity for actin, and to be essential for adult but not embryonic arteriogenesis.
