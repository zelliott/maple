In the Notch pathway, the transmembrane ligand Delta is internalized and then re-established on the surface of signal-sending cells to allow the productive binding and activation of the Notch receptor on neighbouring cells. Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization directs Delta trafficking through this circuit.
