Regulation of epithelial cell attachment and migration are essential for normal development and maintenance of numerous tissues. G proteins and integrins are critical signaling proteins regulating these processes, yet in polarized cells little is known about the interaction of these pathways. Herein, we demonstrate that G alpha 12 inhibits interaction of MDCK cells with collagen-I, the major ligand for alpha2 beta1 integrin. Activating G alpha 12 (QL point mutation or stimulating endogenous G alpha 12 with thrombin) inhibited focal adhesions and lamellipodia formation and led to impaired cell migration. Consistent with G alpha 12-regulated attachment to collagen-I, G alpha 12-silenced MDCK cells revealed a more adherent phenotype. Inhibiting Rho kinase completely restored normal attachment in G alpha 12-activated cells, and there was partial recovery with inhibition of Src and protein phosphatase pathways. G alpha 12 activation led to decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin with displacement of alpha2 integrin from the focal adhesion protein complex. Using the MDCK cell 3D-tubulogenesis assay, activated G alpha 12 inhibited tubulogenesis and led to the formation of cyst-like structures. Furthermore, G alpha 12-silenced MDCK cells were resistant to thrombin-stimulated cyst development. Taken together, these studies provide direct evidence for G alpha 12-integrin regulation of epithelial cell spreading and migration necessary for normal tubulogenesis.
