Virus replication and spreading in a host population depends on highly specific interactions of viral proteins with infected cells, resulting in subversion of multiple cellular signal transduction pathways. For instance, viral proteins cause cell cycle progression of the infected host cell in order to establish a cellular environment favourable for virus replication. Of equal importance for successful virus propagation is virus-mediated attenuation of a host's immune response. Many of the pathways controlling these aspects of cell behaviour are regulated by cellular tyrosine kinases. One particular family of these enzymes, Src family kinases, are involved in processing signals emanating from the plasma membrane upon stimulation by growth factors, by cell-substratum or by cell-cell contact. Two families of DNA viruses, polyoma- and herpesviruses, encode proteins targeted at tyrosine kinases. The middle-T antigens expressed by mouse and hamster polyomavirus associate with and activate Src family tyrosine kinases. Two members of the herpes family of DNA viruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), encode proteins, LMP2A and Tip, respectively, that associate with cellular tyrosine kinases of the Src and Syk/Zap family. Upon association with these viral proteins, the activity of these tyrosine kinases is changed resulting in altered signal output. Middle-T, LMP2A and Tip are therefore excellent tools to study the regulation of Src family kinases.
