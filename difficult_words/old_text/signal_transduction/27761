Activation-induced cell death of T cells typically occurs late in the primary response after a prior proliferative response. Here, we describe a novel form of cell death in which purified naive murine CD4+ cells undergo apoptosis within 18 h in vitro after strong TCR ligation. Such rapid-onset TCR-mediated death of T cells does not involve cell division and is Fas-dependent, inhibited by CD28 (and IL-6) costimulation and enhanced by IL-4 and IL-7; by contrast, spontaneous death of CD4+ cells cultured alone is Fas-independent and inhibited by IL-4 and IL-7. TCR-mediated Fas-dependent death of CD4+ cells is prevented by combined TCR/Fas ligation and by drugs that inhibit calcineurin-dependent signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase MEK1 activation.
