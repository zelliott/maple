Notch1 signaling has a critical function in maintaining a balance among cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Our earlier work showed that the Notch1 intracellular domain interferes with the scaffolding function of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein-1 (JIP1), yet the effect of JIP1 for Notch1-recombining binding protein suppressor of hairless (RBP-Jk) signaling remains unknown. Here, we show that JIP1 suppresses Notch1 activity. JIP1 was found to physically associate with either intracellular domain of Notch1 or RBP-Jk and interfere with the interaction between them. Furthermore, we ascertained that JIP1 caused the cytoplasmic retention of RBP-Jk through an interaction between the C-terminal region of JIP1 including Src homology 3 domain and the proline-rich domain of RBP-Jk. We also found that RBP-Jk inhibits JIP1-mediated activation of the JNK1 signaling cascade and cell death. Our results suggest that direct protein-protein interactions coordinate cross-talk between the Notch1-RBP-Jk and JIP1-JNK pathways.
