Acquired or innate resistance to chemotherapy is a major drawback of cancer therapeutics, which is frequently seen in epithelial cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapy resistance remain poorly understood. The mitochondrial pathway is a critical death pathway common to many different types of chemotherapy. Aberrations in this pathway can result in resistance to chemotherapy. The Bcl-2 family of proteins control commitment to programmed cell death by mitochondrial apoptosis. In this review, we will summarize the strategies in determining the components of apoptotic defects responsible for chemotherapy resistance, mainly focused on Bcl-2 protein network.
