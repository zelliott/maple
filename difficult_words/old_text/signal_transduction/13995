Chemerin was initially described as a chemoattractant factor for leukocyte populations. More recently, the protein has also been reported to be an adipokine, regulating adipocyte differentiation in vitro via its receptor ChemR23, and to be correlated with BMI and other parameters of the metabolic syndrome in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the chemerin/ChemR23 axis in the regulation of metabolism in vivo, using a mouse knockout (KO) model for ChemR23 (Cmklr1) in a C57BL/6 genetic background. Body weight and adipose tissue mass did not differ significantly in young animals, but were significantly higher in ChemR23 KO mice aged above 12 months. Glucose tolerance was unaffected. No significant modifications in the levels of blood lipids were observed and no increase in the levels of inflammatory markers was observed in the adipose tissue of KO mice. A high-fat diet did not exacerbate the obese phenotype in ChemR23 KO mice. No obvious defect in adipocyte differentiation was detected, while a marker of lipogenic activity (GPD1 expression) was found to be elevated. In conclusion, the chemerin/ChemR23 system does not appear to play a major role in adipocyte differentiation in vivo, but it may be involved in adipose tissue homeostasis.
