The nervous system displays a high degree of topographic organisation such that neuronal soma position is closely correlated to axonal trajectory. One example of such order is the myotopic organisation of the motor system where spinal motor neuron position parallels that of target muscles. This chapter will discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying motor neuron soma positioning, which include transcriptional control of Reelin signaling and cadherin expression. As the same transcription factors have been shown to control motor axon innervation of target muscles, a simple mechanism of topographic organisation specification is becoming evident raising the question of how coordinating soma position with axon trajectory might be important for nervous system wiring and its function.
