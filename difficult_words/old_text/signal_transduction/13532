The following studies were undertaken to develop a cultured uterine myocyte model which would allow further clarification of the adrenergic signal transduction mechanisms utilized by these myocytes. After mechanical removal of the endometrium, rabbit uterine myocytes were isolated by an overnight enzymatic disaggregation using collagenase and DNase I. The isolated myocytes were maintained in culture in 75-cm2 flasks containing Waymouth's MB 751/1 medium-10% fetal bovine serum along with 10(-8) M estradiol, penicillin, streptomycin, and Fungizone. The phase contrast and electron micrographic appearance of these cells was consistent with that previously reported for smooth muscle myocytes in culture. Immunocytochemical studies utilizing monoclonal anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin antibodies confirmed the presence of smooth muscle actin in these cultured myocytes. Western blot studies similarly confirmed the presence of alpha-smooth muscle actin in rabbit myometrial tissue and the cultured myocytes, both the primary and F1 generation. After prelabeling the myocytes with [3H]inositol, adrenergic stimulation experiments demonstrated alpha-1 receptor mediated stimulation of inositol phosphates. Beta receptor stimulation experiments confirmed cAMP production in these cultured myocytes, and the ability of clonidine, an alpha-2 agonist, to inhibit forskolin stimulated cAMP production confirmed the presence of functional alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in these myocytes. In conclusion, these cultured rabbit uterine myocytes have provided an in vitro model which can be utilized to further clarify the adrenergic receptor signal transduction mechanisms in genital tract smooth muscle.
