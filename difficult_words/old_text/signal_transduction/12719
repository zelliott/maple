Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a key regulator of tumor development. Recently, the tumor microenvironment, with the presence of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), has gained considerable interest. The mechanisms of macrophage/TAM migration as well as the role of HIF-1 in macrophages for tumor progression are still under debate. We present evidence that under normoxic conditions, nitric oxide (NO) promotes macrophage migration. The response was impaired in macrophages from leukocyte conditional HIF-1 alpha(-/-) mice. NO production and cell migration in response to cytokines were attenuated in macrophages from iNOS(-/-) mice, suggesting that iNOS-derived NO transmits cytokine signaling toward cell migration. We further identified the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 as effectors of the NO-HIF axis to drive macrophage migration by modulating the actin cytoskeleton. Our observations strengthen the role of HIF-1 in macrophages as a target of NO in facilitating functional responses such as migration.
