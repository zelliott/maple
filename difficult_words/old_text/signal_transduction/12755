We have used the synthetic microtubule inhibitor Tubulozole C in order to study the role of the microtubule system in human lymphocyte activation. Microtubule disruption prior to activation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) resulted in a drastic reduction of IL-2 production. Similarly, using OKT3 or PHA as stimulators, a substantial decrease in proliferation was observed. Although IL-2 receptor analysis performed on the stimulated and antitubular-treated lymphocytes showed a 2-fold decrease in high-affinity and a 100-fold decrease in low-affinity IL-2 receptor expression, a proliferative response to externally added rIL-2 was noticed. This occurred provided the triggering agent was excluded or added in suboptimal concentrations. These results indicate that intact microtubules are necessary for PHA/OKT3-induced proliferation and IL-2 production, but not for IL-2-induced proliferation.
