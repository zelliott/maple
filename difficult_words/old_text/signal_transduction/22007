Microbial pathogens use a wide repertoire of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that affect host cell responses through activation of intracellular signaling events in a PAMP-specific manner. Here we describe a set of western blot-based methodologies for the evaluation of biochemical effects specifically induced by N-(3-oxo-acyl) homoserine lactones (3-oxo-AHLs) small molecules secreted by a number of Gram-negative bacteria, including the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. First, we will highlight the AHL-mediated effects on proapoptotic and stress pathways. Secondly, we will demonstrate that AHLs possess the ability to alter stimulus-induced NF-ÎºB signaling, a key biochemical marker of inflammation and innate immune responses.
