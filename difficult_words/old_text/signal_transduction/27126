1. Activation of muscarinic K+ (KACh) channels by P2-purinergic agonists, such as ATP, decreases monotonically in the continued presence of agonist. We investigated the mechanisms underlying this process of decline in guinea-pig atrial myocytes using the patch-clamp technique. 2. External ATP reversibly depressed the acetylcholine (ACh, 5.5-11 microM)-induced KACh current in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.4 microM. 3. External ATP irreversibly reduced guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S)-induced KACh current both in control and pertussis toxin (PTX)-pretreated cells, suggesting (i) that the ATP-induced inhibition of KACh current occurred at some step(s) downstream from the activation of the PTX-sensitive G protein, GK, and (ii) that a PTX-insensitive G protein was involved in the signal transduction pathway. 4. The potency order of ATP analogues in reducing KACh current was ATP > or = 2-methylthio-ATP > or = alpha, beta-methylene-ATP, indicating involvement of a P2Y-type purinoceptor. 5. In the cell-attached patch recording, ATP (100 microM) applied to the bath solution reduced the activity of the KACh channels activated by ACh in the pipette, in two out of eight experiments, suggesting the possible involvement of cytosolic second messengers in the inhibition of KACh channels. 6. The ATP-induced reduction of KACh current was not affected by a protein kinase C inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulphonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H-7), suggesting that this response was not mediated by the activation of protein kinase C. 7. These results demonstrate that, in addition to the membrane-delimited activation through GK, external ATP causes an inhibition of the KACh channel probably by activating a PTX-insensitive G protein and cytosolic second messenger(s), which may underlie the monotonic decrease of the ATP-activated KACh current.
