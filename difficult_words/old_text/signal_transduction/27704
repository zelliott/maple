To study the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (PTP) in platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced platelet signal transduction cascade.

Washed rabbit platelets were used to test the inhibitory effect of genistein (Gen) on platelet aggregation and serotonin secretion. Intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and pH (pHi) were measured by a dual wavelength fluorophotometer with Fura 2-AM and BCECF-AM. PTP was determined with a specific anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody by Western blotting.

Pretreatment with Gen (100 and 200 mumol.L-1) inhibited PAF (20 nmol.L-1)-stimulated platelet serotonin release by 23.7% +/- 2.0% and 41% +/- 8%, respectively. Similar inhibitory effects of Gen were observed on PAF-evoked increase of [Ca2+]i and intracellular alkalization. PAF also elicited a pronounced increase in PTP of several bands with M(r) 70,000, 60,000, 50,000, 42,000/40,000, and 34,000, which were suppressed markedly by Gen 200 and 400 mumol.L-1. Pretreatment with staurosporine (Sta) 20 nmol.L-1, BAPTA 200 mumol.L-1, and egtazic acid 2 mmol.L-1 to inhibit PKC activation, [Ca2+]i elevation, and Ca2+ influx respectively, also showed an inhibitory effects on the formation of PTP.

PTP is involved in multiple signal transduction pathways induced by PAF, on which PKC activation and calcium mobilization play a regulatory role.
