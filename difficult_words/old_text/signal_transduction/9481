The interplay of signals between dura mater, suture mesenchyme, and brain is essential in determining the fate of cranial sutures and the pathogenesis of premature suture fusion leading to craniosynostosis. At the forefront of research into suture fusion is the role of fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-β, which have been found to be critical in the cell-signaling cascade involved in aberrant suture fusion. In this review, the authors discuss recent and ongoing research into the role of fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-β in the etiopathogenesis of craniosynostosis.
