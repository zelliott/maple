Protein kinase CK2 (formerly casein kinase II) is a tetrameric enzyme constitutively expressed in all eurakyotic tissues that plays a significant role in the regulation of cell proliferation, malignant transformation, and apoptosis. The catalytic alpha-subunit of the enzyme is known to exist in three isoforms CK2alpha, CK2alpha' and CK2alpha". CK2alpha" is highly expressed in liver compared with other tissues and is required for the normal trafficking of several hepatocellular membrane proteins. Initial studies of dengue virus infection indicated that the CK2alpha"-deficient membrane trafficking mutant cell line (Trf1) was resistant to virus-induced cell death compared with the parental human hepatoma (HuH)-7 hepatoma line. Expression of recombinant CK2alpha" in Trf1 was capable of reverting this resistant phenotype. This study was extended to TNF-alpha in addition to other stimuli of cell death in an attempt to uncover common death pathways that might be modulated by CK2alpha". Evaluation of different pathways involved in death signaling suggest that the regulation of a critical proapoptotic step in HuH-7 cells by CK2alpha" is mediated by a JNK signaling cascade.
