To identify the effect of PNA CXCR3 on acute rejection of islet allograft.

The mice islet transplant models were used. The mice were divided into three groups including saline group, PNA CXCR3 group and mismatch PNA group. In vitro the proliferation capability of T cell was assessed by proliferative responses. RT-PCR and western blot were used to detect the expression of mRNA and protein. Flow cytometry was applied to determine the expression level of CXCR3 in spleen CD3(+) T cells.

Compared with saline [(6.72 +/- 1.48) d] and PNA mismatch-treated recipients [(6.54 +/- 0.86) d], PNA CXCR3-treated recipients demonstrated statistically significant prolongation [(9.70 +/- 1.57) d] in functional allograft survival. The CXCR3 mRNA expression level of PNA CXCR3 group (1.06 +/- 0.07) was significantly down-regulated compared with saline (1.98 +/- 0.22) and PNA mismatch (1.87 +/- 0.10) group at the 7th day after transplant. The date showed that CXCR3 protein and lymphocytes proliferation capability was significantly down-regulated in PNA CXCR3 group compared with saline and PNA mismatch group (P<0.01).

The present study indicates that PNA CXCR3 can inhibit T cell activating and prolonging the survival time of islet allograft and has a substantial therapeutic effect on inhibiting acute allograft rejection.
