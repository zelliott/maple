The phosphorylation states of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and nucleotides control the mechanisms behind nearly all cellular functions. Therefore, not surprisingly, recent findings have shown that alterations in these phosphorylation pathways play a central role in the development and progression of many disease states. This review provides a brief summary of the function and activity of various phosphorylation mechanisms, outlines some of the major phosphorylation signaling cascades, and describes the role of these phosphorylation mechanisms in intensive care medicine.

This article will comprise a comprehensive review of the literature in the context of intensive care medicine. Specifically, we will discuss the involvement of phosphorylation in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, respiratory failure, ventilation-induced lung injury, traumatic brain injury, acute organ failure, systemic sepsis, and shock.

Phosphorylation mechanisms clearly play an important role in many pathologies and treatment strategies of intensive care and therefore further understanding of these mechanisms may lead to the development of novel therapies and improved patient care.
