Ca(2+) regulates a multitude of cellular processes and does so by partitioning its actions in space and time. In this review, we discuss how Ca(2+) responses are constructed from small quantal (elementary) events that have the potential to propagate to produce large pan-cellular responses. We review how Ca(2+) is compartmentalized both physically and functionally, and describe how each organelle has its own distinct Ca(2+)-handling properties. We explain how coordination of the movement of Ca(2+) between organelles is used to shape and hone Ca(2+) signals. Finally, we provide a number of specific examples of where compartmentation and localization of Ca(2+) are crucial to cell function.
