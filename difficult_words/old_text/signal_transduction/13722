The idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is a complex disease that mainly affects pulmonary arterial circulation. This undergoes a remodeling with subsequent reduction of flow in the small pulmonary arteries. Because of this damage an increased vascular resistance gradually develops, and over time it carries out in heart failure. The inflammatory process is a key element in this condition, mediated by various cytokines. The inflammatory signal induces activation of NF-κB, and prompts TGF-β-related signaling pathway. Clinical evolution leads to progressive debilitation, greatly affecting the patient quality of life. The actual therapeutic approaches, are few and expensive, and include systemic drugs such as prostanoids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and antagonists of endothelin-1 (ERBs). Some researchers have long investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin. It shows a role for inactivation of NF-κB-mediated inflammation. On the basis of these findings we propose a potential role of curcumin and its pharmacologically fit derivatives for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.
