Beginning with the first mitotic division in a Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, asymmetric cleavages establish much of the body plan. Although they share a common axis of polarity, at least three kinds of asymmetric cell division occur: two are under intrinsic control, while a third requires an inductive signal and may operate repeatedly throughout development.
