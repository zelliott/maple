Coordination of mitosis and cytokinesis is crucial for ensuring proper chromosome segregation and genomic stability. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the sid genes (cdc7, cdc11, cdc14, spg1, sid1, sid2 and sid4) define a signaling pathway that regulates septation and cytokinesis. Here we describe the characterization of a novel protein kinase, Sid1p. Sid1p localizes asymmetrically to one spindle pole body (SPB) in anaphase. Sid1p localization is maintained during medial ring constriction and septum synthesis and disappears prior to cell separation. Additionally, we found that Cdc14p is in a complex with Sid1p. Epistasis analysis places Sid1p-Cdc14p downstream of Spg1p-Cdc7p but upstream of Sid2p. Finally, we show that cyclin proteolysis during mitosis is unaffected by inactivating the sid pathway; in fact, loss of Cdc2-cyclin activity promotes Sid1p-Cdc14p association with the SPB, possibly providing a mechanism that couples cytokinesis with mitotic exit.
