G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) plays a key role in cardiac signaling regulation, and its expression is increased in heart failure. Recently, increased expression of GRK5 in the myocardium of mice has been shown to be detrimental in the setting of pressure-overload hypertrophy. The ubiquitous nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) is involved in the regulation of numerous genes in various tissues, and activation of NF-κB has been shown to be associated with heart disease. Here, we investigated the role of NF-κB signaling in the regulation of the GRK5 gene and expression of this kinase in cardiomyocytes. First, in analyzing the 5'-flanking DNA of GRK5, the presence of a potential NF-κB binding site was observed in the promoter region. Phorbol myristate acetate, a known stimulator of NF-κB, increased the levels of GRK5 in myocytes whereas treatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine, a known inhibitor of NF-κB, or with SC 514, an inhibitor of IκB kinase 2 decreased GRK5. Utilizing EMSA or ChIP assays, we found that both p50 and p65 NF-κB could interact with the promoter of GRK5 following myocytes NF-κB activation. Importantly, short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated loss of p65 in myocytes decreased the stimulated increased levels of GRK5 mRNA and protein. Finally, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant-negative IκBα in myocytes inhibited the levels of GRK5. Taken together, our study demonstrates that NF-κB plays a critical role in the regulation of GRK5 transcription in myocytes and that this may translate to the significant expression changes seen in heart disease.
