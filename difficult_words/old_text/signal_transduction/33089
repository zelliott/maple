The molecular bases of the versatile functions of Rho-like GTPases are still unknown. Using luciferase assays with rat 3Y1 cells, we found that Rac1 is integrated downstream of Ras in the TRE (TPA response element) activation pathway. Coexpression of a mutant of p65PAK, PAK/RD, lacking the kinase domain but containing the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) region, suppressed the TRE activation and cell transformation caused by constitutively activated forms of Ras (RasV12) and Rac1 (Rac1V12). PAK/RD is a good tool to investigate the signaling pathways in which Rac and Cdc42 are involved.
