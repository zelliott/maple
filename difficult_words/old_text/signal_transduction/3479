Progression of invasive carcinoma involves the deregulation of molecular signaling pathways that results in the acquisition of oncogenic phenotypes. Functional enrichment analysis allows for the identification of deregulated pathways from omics scale expression data. Given the importance of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms on protein expression and function, identification of deregulated pathways on the basis of protein expression data is likely to provide new insights. In this study, we have developed methods for label-based mass spectrometry in a large number of samples and applied these methods toward identification and quantification of protein expression in samples of infiltrating ductal carcinoma, benign breast growths, and normal adjacent tissue. We identified 265 proteins with differential expression patterns in infiltrating ductal carcinoma relative to benign growths or normal breast tissue. Analysis of the differentially expressed proteins indicated the deregulation of signaling pathways related to proliferation, invasion and metastasis, and immune response. Our approach provides complementary information to gene expression microarray data and identifies a number of deregulated molecular signaling pathways indicative of breast cancer progression that may enable more accurate, biologically relevant diagnoses and provide a stepping stone to personalized treatment.
