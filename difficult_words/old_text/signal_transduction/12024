To review the progress of the mechanisms of Wnt/beta-catenin and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathways in the process of the intervertebral disc degeneration.

The related literature about the mechanisms of Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB pathways in the process of the intervertebral disc degeneration was reviewed, analyzed, and summarized.

Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB pathways are both activated in the process of the intervertebral disc degeneration, and exist interaction. However, the specific mechanisms and interactive mediums of Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB pathways in the process of the intervertebral disc degeneration are still unclear.

The mechanisms of Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB pathways in the process of the intervertebral disc degeneration have to be studied deeply.
