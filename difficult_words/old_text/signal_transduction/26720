FGF (fibroblast growth factor)/FGFR (FGF receptor) signalling plays an essential role in both endochondral and intramembranous bone development. FGF signalling pathways are important for the earliest stages of limb development and throughout skeletal development. The activity and the outcome of this signalling pathway during bone development are also influenced by many other intracellular and extracellular signals. In this review, we focus on the interplay between FGF signalling and other pathways, which is tightly regulated both spatially and temporally during endochondral skeletal development.
