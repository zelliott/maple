Ceramide has been proposed to be an important signaling intermediate in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis in human MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells. We compared cell death and signal transduction pathways induced by TNF and ceramide in TNF-sensitive, parental MCF-7 cells to those in TNF-resistant, MCF-7 cells (3E9). TNF caused proteolysis of the caspase substrate, polyADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) in parental cells, but not in 3E9 cells. Both apoptosis and PARP cleavage were strongly prevented by co-incubation with caspase inhibitors. In contrast, ceramide-induced cell death was neither affected by TNF resistance nor was it associated with PARP cleavage, and death could not be prevented by co-incubation with caspase inhibitors in either cell line. TNF was able to activate JNK/SAPK approximately 30-fold and approximately 5-fold in parental MCF-7 and 3E9 cells, respectively; in contrast, cell-permeable ceramide only weakly stimulated JNK/SAPK activity in either cell type. Although JNK was activated by TNF, pharmacological blockade of the JNK pathway did not inhibit TNF- or ceramide-mediated cell death. Using mass spectroscopic analysis for ceramide, no increase, rather, a decrease in total ceramide content in TNF-treated parental cells was observed. These results suggest that the cell death signaling and execution pathways utilized by ceramide are distinct from those activated by TNF in MCF-7 cells.
