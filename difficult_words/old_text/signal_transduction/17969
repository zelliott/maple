The glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein CD14 is expressed in myeloid cells and serum. It binds Gram-negative and -positive bacterial cell wall components and endogenous phospholipids. Toll-like receptors, NF-kappaB and MAP kinases participate in CD14 signaling of inflammation. Alterations of CD14 in inflammatory diseases support a pathogenic role for this microbial receptor.
