We report on the characterization of the interaction between reactive oxygen species signalling and abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated gene network in ozone (O(3)) stress response. To identify the stress-related signalling pathways and possible cross-talk controlled by an ABA-negative regulator, the protein phosphatase 2C abscisic acid insensitive1 (ABI1), we performed a genome-wide transcription profiling of O(3)-treated wild-type and ABI1 knockout (abi1td) plants. In addition, to better understand ABA signalling and the interactions between stress response pathways, we performed a microarray analysis of drought-treated plants. Functional categorization of the identified genes showed that ABI1 is involved in the modulation of several cellular processes including metabolism, transport, development, information pathways and variant splicing. Comparisons with available transcriptome data sets revealed the extent of ABI1 involvement in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent gene expression. Furthermore, in O(3) stress the ABA hypersensitivity of abi1td resulted in a significant reduction of the ABA level, ethylene (ET) over-production and O(3) tolerance. Moreover, the physical interaction of ABI1 with ACC synthase2 and ACC synthase6 was shown. We provide a model explaining how ABI1 can regulate both ABA and ET biosynthesis. Altogether, our findings indicate that ABI1 plays the role of a general signal transducer linking ABA and ET biosynthesis as well as signalling pathways to O(3) stress tolerance.
