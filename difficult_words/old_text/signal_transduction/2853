The pathways regulating ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in the chick embryo were studied to determine which kinase-signaling pathways regulate ODC activity levels during development. Insulin-dependent tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase were activated by the addition of insulin, tetradecanoylphorbol-12,13-acetate, and forskolin, respectively. All three drugs increased ODC activity and forskolin combined with insulin increased ODC activity above the increase caused by either drug alone. These results suggest that all three signaling pathways regulate ODC activity during development and that common intermediates exist among the pathways downstream of the kinases.
