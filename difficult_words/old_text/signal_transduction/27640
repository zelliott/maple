Diabetic neuropathy is the most common secondary complication of diabetes mellitus. Several pathogenetic factors have been proposed for diabetic neuropathy. The present investigation was undertaken to study different components of signal transduction from discrete brain regions from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Rats were sacrificed after 1 and 3 months of induction of diabetes, and a control group was also studied in parallel to ascertain the specificity of diabetes-associated changes. Blood glucose level and protein content of discrete brain regions were also estimated. Signal transduction cascade components like protein kinase A, protein kinase C, cAMP, phospholipase C, phospholipase A2, diacylglycerol and inositol phosphate levels were assayed in control and diabetic groups of rats. Significant attenuation in phosphoinositide metabolism along with activation of protein kinase activities were observed. These findings provide evidence to suggest a mechanism linking changes in signal transduction cascade, which is observed in 1- and 3-month diabetic rats, which ultimately leads to development of diabetic neuropathy.
