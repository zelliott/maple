Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor activation regulates endothelial cell (EC) survival, migration and proliferation. Recently, it was suggested the cross-talk between the VEGF receptors-1 (FLT-1) and -2 (KDR) modulated several of these functions, but the detailed molecular basis for such interactions remained unexplained. Here we demonstrate for the first time that VEGF stimulation of EC monolayers induced a rapid FLT-1-mediated internalization of KDR to the nucleus, via microtubules and the endocytic pathway, internalization which required the activation of PI 3-kinase/AKT. KDR deletion mutants were generated in several tyrosine residues; in these, VEGF-induced KDR internalization was impaired, demonstrating this process required activation (phosphorylation) of the receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in vitro wounding of EC monolayers leads to a rapid and transient internalization of VEGF+KDR to the nucleus, which is essential for monolayer recovery. Notably, FLT-1 blockade impedes VEGF and KDR activation and internalization, blocking endothelial monolayer recovery. Our data reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism induced by VEGF on EC, which regulates EC recovery following wounding, and as such indicate novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
