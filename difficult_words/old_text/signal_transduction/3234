Ro52/SSA is an autoantigen that presents in patients with SS (Sjögren's syndrome) and SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus). It increases cell death and redistributes itself to apoptotic blebs, but its pro-apoptotic function has not been completely identified. Overexpression of Ro52/SSA promoted cell apoptosis induced by DR (death receptor) in caspase-8-dependent manner. Ro52/SSA expression down-regulated c-FLIP(L) [cellular (Fas-associated death domain)-like interleukin 1β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein long form] expression, and Ro52/SSA siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) increased c-FLIP(L) production, indicating that Ro52/SSA plays a role in c-FLIP(L) regulation. Ro52/SSA negatively regulated c-FLIP(L) transcriptional level probably by suppressing NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) signalling. The data suggest that Ro52/SSA is involved in DR-mediated apoptosis by regulating c-FLIP(L).
