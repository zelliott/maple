IgM cross-linking induces NF-kappaB inactivation, c-Myc down-regulation, and cyclin kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) accumulation in WEHI-231 murine B lymphoma cells. p27(Kip1) up-regulation leads to a decreased cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity, retinoblastoma protein hypophosphorylation, G1 arrest and apoptosis. Similar to membrane (m) IgM cross-linking in B lymphoma cells, steroids and retinoids down-regulate c-Myc (via NF-kappaB inactivation) and induce apoptosis in T cell hybridomas and thymocytes. In this study, we determined if steroids and retinoids have similar effects in WEHI-231 cells. Our results show that steroids and retinoids induce NF-kappaB inactivation, c-Myc down-regulation, p27(Kip1) up-regulation, G1 arrest, and apoptosis. Importantly, these hormones enhance anti-IgM-induced apoptosis in WEHI-231 cells. Similar to mIgM signaling, all these effects are prevented by treatment with CD40 ligand. Caspase inhibition, on the other hand, rescues cells from steroid/retinoid-induced apoptosis, but has no effect on growth arrest, p27(Kip1), and c-Myc. Together, these findings suggest that steroids/retinoids and mIgM cross-linking share a common signal transduction pathway leading to G1 arrest and cell death.
