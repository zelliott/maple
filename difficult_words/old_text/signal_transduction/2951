Renal hypertrophy and accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins are among cardinal manifestations of diabetic nephropathy. TGF beta system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these manifestations. Among signaling pathways activated in the kidney in diabetes, mTOR- (mammalian target of rapamycin-)regulated pathways are pivotal in orchestrating high glucose-induced production of ECM proteins leading to functional and structural changes in the kidney culminating in adverse outcomes. Understanding signaling pathways that influence individual matrix protein expression could lead to the development of new interventional strategies. This paper will highlight some of the diverse components of the signaling network stimulated by hyperglycemia with an emphasis on extracellular matrix protein metabolism in the kidney in diabetes.
