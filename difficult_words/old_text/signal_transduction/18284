Neurotrauma activates the release of membrane phospholipid-derived second messengers, such as free arachidonic acid (20:4n-6, AA) and diacylglycerols (DAGs). In the present study, we analyze the effect of cortical impact injury of low-grade severity applied to the rat frontal right sensory-motor cortex (FRC) on the accumulation of free fatty acids (FFAs) and DAGs in eight brain areas 30 min and 24 hours after the insult. At these times, accumulation of FFAs and DAGs occurred mainly in the damaged FRC. The cerebellum was the only other brain area that displayed a significant accumulation of DAGs by day one post-injury. By 30 min, accumulation of free AA in the FRC displayed the greatest relative increase (300% over sham value), followed by free docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA, 150%), while both 20:4-DAGs and 22:6-DAGs were increased 100% over sham values. At day one, free 22:6 and 22:6-DAGs showed the greatest increase (590% and 230%, respectively). These results suggest that TBI elicits the hydrolysis of phospholipids enriched in excitable membranes, targeting early on 20:4-phospholipids (by 30 min post- trauma) and followed 24 hours later by preferential hydrolysis of DHA-phospholipids. These lipid metabolic changes may contribute to the initiation and maturation of neuronal and fiber track degeneration observed following cortical impact injury.
