Recent discoveries have advanced our understanding of oncogene action: transcription factors are encoded by cellular (nuclear) oncogenes and the activity of transcription factors is modulated in response to extracellular stimuli. Moreover, the nuclear oncoproteins appear to represent the gene-proximal ends of a network of cellular oncoproteins that link extracellular stimuli to the transcriptional machinery and thus to the program of genes a cell will express.
