In this paper we explore the possibility of improving, by genetic engineering, the resistance of insulin-secreting cells to the metabolic and inflammatory stresses that are anticipated to limit their function and survival when encapsulated and transplanted in a type 1 diabetic environment. We show that transfer of the Bcl-2 antiapoptotic gene, and of genes specifically interfering with cytokine intracellular signaling pathways, greatly improves resistance of the cells to metabolic limitations and inflammatory stresses.
