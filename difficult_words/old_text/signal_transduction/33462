The apoptosis in SF-21 cell line can be induced by the conditioned medium (CM) of the entomopathogenic fungus, Nomuraea rileyi, based on changes in morphology and formation of apoptotic bodies in cultured cells, and with the onset of DNA fragmentation as shown by TUNEL staining and agarose electrophoresis. Moreover, the induction of apoptosis in SF-21 cells was inhibited by adding the inhibitor of effector caspase, viz. z-DEVD-fmk, to the CM, indicating that Sf-caspase-1 is involved in this apoptosis. Similarly, the inhibitor of initiator caspase, viz., z-VAD-fmk, inhibited apoptosis. Therefore, both initiator and effector caspases are possibly involved in the apoptosis of SF-21 cells. In addition, we detected Sf-caspase-1 activity in the process of apoptosis in SF-21 cells, suggesting that the effector caspase in SF-21 is similar to that found in mammalian cells. Our results also indicated that the apoptosis found in this line is accomplished through a Sf-caspase-1 signaling pathway.
