c-Met is a tyrosine receptor kinase which is activated by its ligand, the hepatocyte growth factor. Activation of c-Met leads to a wide spectrum of biological activities such as motility, angiogenesis, morphogenesis, cell survival and cell regeneration. c-Met is abnormally activated in many tumour types. Aberrant c-Met activation was found to induce tumour development, tumour cell migration and invasion, and the worst and final step in cancer progression, metastasis. In addition, c-Met activation in cells was also shown to confer resistance to apoptosis induced by UV damage or chemotherapeutic drugs. This study describes the development of monoclonal antibodies against c-Met as therapeutic molecules in cancer treatment/diagnostics. A panel of c-Met monoclonal antibodies was developed and characterised by epitope mapping, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, agonist/antagonist effect in cell scatter assays and for their ability to recognise native c-Met by flow cytometry. We refer to these antibodies as Specifically Engaging Extracellular c-Met (seeMet). seeMet 2 and 13 bound strongly to native c-Met in flow cytometry and reduced SNU-5 cell growth. Interestingly, seeMet 2 binding was strongly reduced at 4oC when compared to 37oC. Detail mapping of the seeMet 2 epitope indicated a cryptic binding site hidden within the c-Met Î±-chain.
