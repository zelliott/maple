The detailed genomic organization of a gene-dense region at human chromosome 12p13, spanning 223 kb of contiguous sequence, was determined. This region is composed of 20 genes and several other expressed sequences. Experimental tools including RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing, combined with gene prediction programs, were utilized in the analysis of the sequence. Various computer software programs were employed for sequence similarity searches and functional predictions. The high number of genes with diverse functions and complex transcriptional patterns make this region ideal for addressing challenges of gene discovery and genomic characterization amenable to large-scale sequence analysis.
