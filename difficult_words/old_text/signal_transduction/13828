Chloroplasts are responsible for biosynthesis of salicylic acid (SA) an important signal molecule in plant immunity. EDS5 is a homolog of the MATE (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion) family of transporters, and is essential for SA biosynthesis. It has been speculated that EDS5 would be involved in the export of SA from chloroplasts. However, the subcellular localization of EDS5 remains largely uncharacterized. We demonstrate here that EDS5 is specifically localized to the chloroplast envelope membrane in Arabidopsis. In addition, we found that EDS5 is preferentially expressed in epidermal cells. These findings suggest that EDS5 is responsible for transport of SA from chloroplasts to the cytoplasm in epidermal cells.
