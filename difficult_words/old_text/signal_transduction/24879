TSH is an important physiological regulator of growth and function in thyroid gland. The mechanism of action of TSH depends on interaction with its receptor coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins. We show here that TSH induces the phosphorylation of tyrosine in the intracellular kinases Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and -2 (JAK2) in rat thyroid cells and in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with human TSH receptor (TSHR). The JAK family substrates STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription) are rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to TSH. We also find that JAK1, JAK2, and STAT3 coprecipitate with the TSHR, indicating that the TSHR may be able to signal through the intracellular phosphorylation pathway used by the JAK-STAT cascade. TSH increases STAT3-mediated promoter activity and also induces endogenous SOCS-1 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-1) gene expression, a known target gene of STAT3. The expression of a dominant negative form of STAT3 completely inhibited TSH-mediated SOCS-1 expression. These findings suggest that the TSHR is able to signal through JAK/STAT3 pathways.
