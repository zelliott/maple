The hypothesis and indirect evidence of imidazoline receptors has been promoted since some 15 years ago and it gave a substantial impetus for research in this field, resulting in a better understanding of neuronal and cardiovascular regulatory processes. The nomenclature of the imidazoline receptors has been accepted by international forums but no direct proof for the existence of these receptors has been published. Authors summarise the most important available data, including facts and doubts as far as the discovery, characterisation, and function of imidazoline receptors and their subtypes, the differences between imidazoline receptors and alpha-2 adrenoceptors, and also on their participation in regulatory processes.
