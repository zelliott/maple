We investigated effects of fosfomycin (FOM) on neutrophil function, specifically the oxidative burst and adhesion molecule expression (CD11b/CD18, or MAC-1) using flow cytometry assay. Preincubation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) with FOM from 1 to 100 microg/ml prior to stimulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 2 ng/ml) significantly suppressed the oxidative burst in a concentration-dependent manner. However, FOM did not affect the oxidative burst of PMNL stimulated by a chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). Stimulation with PMA (2 ng/ml) caused a rapid up-regulation of CD11b surface expression on PMNL, followed by time-dependent loss of this receptor. FOM also suppressed loss of CD11b in PMNL stimulated by PMA. FOM then inhibits the PMA-induced oxidative burst and CD11b epitope loss in PMNL. The suppressive effect appears to be mediated by the protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathway.
