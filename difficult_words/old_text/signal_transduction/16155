Genes do not act in isolation but perform their biological functions within genetic pathways that are connected in larger networks. Investigation of nucleotide variation within genetic pathways and networks has shown that topology can affect the rate of protein evolution; however, it remains unclear whether a same pattern of nucleotide variation is expected within functionally similar networks and whether it may be due to similar or different biological mechanisms. We address these questions by investigating nucleotide variation in the context of the structure of the insulin/Tor-signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis, which is well characterized and is functionally conserved across phylogeny. In Drosophila and vertebrates, the rate of protein evolution is negatively correlated with the position of a gene within the insulin/Tor pathway. Similarly, we find that in Caenorhabditis, the rate of amino acid replacement is lower for downstream genes. However, in Caenorhabditis, the rate of synonymous substitution is also strongly affected by the position of a gene in the pathway, and we show that the distribution of selective pressure along the pathway is driven by differential expression level. A full understanding of the effect of pathway structure on selective constraints is therefore likely to require inclusion of specific biological function into more general network models.
