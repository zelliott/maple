TIS108 is a triazole-type strigolactone (SL)-biosynthesis inhibitor that reduces the level of 2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol (epi-5DS) in rice. Here we report the effects of TIS108 on Arabidopsis. Treatment of TIS108 increased the number of branches and repressed root hair elongation as was observed in SL-deficient mutants, and co-application of GR24, a synthetic SL analog, recovered the TIS108-induced phenotype to that of wild-type. In addition, MAX3 and MAX4 genes in the SL-biosynthesis pathway were upregulated in TIS108-treated Arabidopsis, probably due to feedback regulation caused by SL deficiency. These results indicate that TIS108 is an effective tool for regulating SL production in Arabidopsis.
