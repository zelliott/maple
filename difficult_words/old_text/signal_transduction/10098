Long-term treatment with all trans-retinoic acid (RA) induces neuronal differentiation and apoptosis. However, the effect of short-term RA treatment on cell proliferation, migration and invasion of neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32) remains unclear. RA induces expression of tissue-transglutaminase (TGase) and promotes migration and invasion after 24 h of treatment in SH-SY5Y cells, but not in IMR-32 cells. RA receptor (RAR) agonist (4-(E-2-[5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl]-1-propenyl) benzoic acid) and RAR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist (9-cis-RA) promote expression of TGase, migration and invasion of SH-SY5Y cells, while RXR agonist has no significant effect. RAR antagonist blocks RA effect on migration and invasion, indicating that RAR receptors are required. Retinoid receptors are expressed and activated by RA in both cell lines. However, only transient activation of RAR is observed in IMR-32 cells. These findings suggest that different responses observed in SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells could be due to differential activation of retinoid receptors. Overexpression of TGase has no effect on migration or invasion, while overexpression of antisense TGase blocks RA-induced migration and invasion, indicating that other molecules along with TGase mediate RA effects. In addition to the long-term effects of RA that are coupled with cell differentiation, short-term effects involve migration and invasion of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.
