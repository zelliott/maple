Apoptosis and inflammatory/oxidative stress have been associated with hyperglycemia in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) and other cell types. We and others have highlighted the role of early products of non-enzymatic protein glycation in inducing proinflammatory conditions and increasing apoptotic rates in HPMCs. Loss of HPMCs seems to be a hallmark of complications associated with peritoneal membrane dysfunction. The aim of this work is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Amadori adducts may act upon HPMC apoptosis.

HPMCs isolated from different patients were exposed to different Amadori adducts, i.e. highly glycated hemoglobin (10 nM) and glycated bovine serum albumin (250 μg/ml), to study cell death and several proapoptotic markers by different experimental approaches.

Amadori adducts, but not their respective controls, impaired cell proliferation and cell viability by means of apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. They regulated the intrinsic mitochondrial cell death signaling pathway and modulated activation of caspases, Bax, iNOS, p53, NF-κB, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 and JNK) through different reactive oxygen and nitrosative species.

Our data strongly support the idea that long-term hyperglycemia could act as an inducer of apoptosis in HPMCs through Amadori adducts, involving different oxidative and nitrosative reactive species.
