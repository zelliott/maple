In this study we investigated the effect of different dialysis membranes on the clonal murine haematopoietic cell line 32D cells transmembrane signalling machinary, monitored by 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) formation, and on their ability to respond to the physiological growth factor interleukin-3 (IL-3).

Cells were exposed to dialysers (cuprophane, CU; polysulphone, PS; cellulose diacetate, CA; polyacrylonitrile, AN69; polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA; cellulose triacetate, CT; polyamide, PA; and polycarbonate, PC); they were collected, counted, and treated with physiological amount of IL-3. Cell proliferation was monitored as incorporation of radioactivity in duplicating DNA. DAG was measured by thin-layer chromatography in cell labelled with tritiated glycerol overnight.

CU and PA stimulated cell proliferation in comparison with resting cells. PS and TC did not significantly affect thymidine incorporation either in IL-3-stimulated, or in resting cells. Cells exposed to AN69, PC, and CA showed depressed basal incorporation of thymidine (70, 54 and 56% of controls respectively) but retained the ability to respond to IL-3 in a manner not statistically different from controls. PMMA reduced thymidine incorporation both in basal condition and after IL-3 stimulation CU and PC activated early cell signalling (1.95 x and 1.31 x respectively, DAG increase over control), while PA and TC depressed DAG generation (0.38 x and 0.47 x respectively, DAG increase over control). PS, CA, AN69, and PMMA did not stimulate DAG generation.

Alternations of intracellular mitogenic signalling appear to correlate with the ability to make a cell competent for function. These results might help to elucidate the effect of different dialysers, at the molecular level, on the blood cell behaviour in vivo.
