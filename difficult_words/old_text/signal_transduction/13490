Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) plays a central role in the metabolism of diacylglycerol released as a second messenger in agonist-stimulated cells. The major purified form of the enzyme (80 kDa DGK) is highly abundant in lymphocyte cytosol and may become membrane-associated via phosphorylation by protein kinase C. In addition, there are several kinase subspecies immunologically distinct from the 80 kDa enzyme, which differ markedly in their responses to several compounds such as sphingosine and R59022. Thus, further work on each enzyme species is needed to define the function of DGK in stimulated cells.
