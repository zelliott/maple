Calcium-dependent signaling pathways are thought to be involved in the regulation of mammalian oocyte meiotic maturation. However, the molecular linkages between the calcium signal and the processes driving meiotic maturation are not clearly defined. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the multi-functional calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM KII) functions as one of these key linkers. Mouse oocytes were treated with a pharmacological CaM KII inhibitor, KN-93, or a peptide CaM KII inhibitor, myristoylated AIP, and assessed for the progression of meiosis. Two systems for in vitro oocyte maturation were used: (1) spontaneous gonadotropin-independent maturation and (2) follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-induced reversal of hypoxanthine-mediated meiotic arrest. FSH-induced, but not spontaneous germinal vesicle breakdown (GVB) was dose-dependently inhibited by both myristoylated AIP and KN-93, but not its inactive analog, KN-92. However, emission of the first polar body (PB1) was inhibited by myristoylated AIP and KN-93 in both oocyte maturation systems. Oocytes that failed to produce PB1 exhibited normal-appearing metaphase I chromosome congression and spindles indicating that CaM KII inhibitors blocked the metaphase I to anaphase I transition. Similar results were obtained when the oocytes were treated with a calmodulin antagonist, W-7, and matured spontaneously. These results suggest that CaM KII, and hence the calcium signaling pathway, is potentially involved in regulating the meiotic maturation of mouse oocytes. This kinase both participates in gonadotropin-induced resumption of meiosis, as well as promoting the metaphase I to anaphase I transition. Further evidence is therefore, provided of the critical role of calcium-dependent pathways in mammalian oocyte maturation.
