Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in innate immunity. Overexpression of TLRs has been implicated in various types of cancer including colorectal cancer (CRC). The phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is involved in CRC growth and progression. In this study, we determined whether TLR4 signaling and PI3K/Akt pathway activation occur in CRCs.

Human CRCs and adjacent mucosa were evaluated for TLR4 expression. CRC cell lines were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), endogenous TLR4 ligand, to assess Akt phosphorylation.

Human CRCs overexpressed TLR4 compared to matched normal mucosa. Additionally, TLR4 was expressed in CRC cells and LPS treatment increased Akt phosphorylation of TLR4-positive CRCs in a time-dependent manner.

Our results identify TLR4 expression in human CRCs and activation of PI3K with LPS treatment. These findings suggest possible treatment strategies targeting TLR4 in CRC.
