Dendritic morphology has an important influence on neuronal information processing. Multiple environmental cues, including neuronal activity, the neurotrophin family of growth factors, and extracellular guidance molecules have been shown to influence dendritic size, shape, and development. The Rho GTPases have emerged as key integrators of these environmental cues to regulate the underlying dendritic cytoskeleton.
