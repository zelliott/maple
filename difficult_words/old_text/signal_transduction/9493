To explore the effect and mechanism of ferulic acid on differentiation in bFGF-treated PC12 cells.

The length of neurite outgrowth and the percentage of PC12 cells induced in the presence of 0 ng/mL or 1 ng/mL bFGF were assayed.

Compared with that of control group,ferulic acid could enhance the differentiation effect of bFGF (1 ng/mL) in PC12 cells (P < 0.01) and the enhancing effect could be blocked by the specific MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD98059.

Ferulic acid potentiates neurite outgrowth in bFGF-treated PC12 cells by MAPK-dependent signaling pathway.
