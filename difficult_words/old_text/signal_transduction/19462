Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) offer new avenues for studying human development and disease progression in addition to their tremendous potential toward development of cell-replacement therapies for various cellular disorders. We have earlier reported the derivation and characterization of Relicell(®) hES1, the first fully characterized hESC line generated from the Indian subcontinent. Recent studies have demonstrated discrete differences among hESC lines, in terms of both their growth properties and their differentiation propensity. To address some of these issues in the context of hESC research in India, we have recently generated two new hESC lines: Relicell(®) hES2 and Relicell(®)hES3. Both these cell lines were derived using a combinatorial approach of immunosurgery followed by mechanical surgery for inner cell mass isolation. The cell lines exhibit the usual hESC characteristics including their ability to differentiate both in vitro and in vivo to yield the three germinal layers. Whole genome microarray analysis of these cell lines was compared with Relicell(®)hES1 and it showed that approximately 9000 genes were expressed by these lines. As expected the expression pattern of these new cell lines bore close resemblance to that of Relicell(®)hES1. A majority of the pluripotency genes and the genes known to inhibit various differentiation pathways were also expressed by these cell lines. We also observed that each of these cell lines expressed a unique set of genes that are mutually exclusive from each other. These results represent the first detailed characterization of a set of hESC lines originating from India.
