The caudal-related homeobox transcription factor (Cdx2) plays an important role in intestinal development, differentiation, and homeostasis. However, only a limited number of Cdx2-regulated target genes have been elucidated. To delineate the molecular mechanism regulated downstream of Cdx2, we aimed to define Cdx2-regulated genes. We engineered a rat intestinal epithelial cell line, IEC-6, with minimal endogenous Cdx2 expression to express exogenous Cdx2. The gene expression patterns for Cdx2-inducing cells and control cells were examined using oligonucleotide arrays. In the present study, differential expression of 23 genes was confirmed by a semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis using gene-specific primers. Increased expression of genes was involved in the Notch signaling pathway, xenobiotic metabolism, enzymes associated with tumor suppression, RNA binding protein, receptors, signal transduction, and transcription factors. The wide-ranging collection of such inducing genes suggests to the functions of Cdx2 in cell fate decision and maintenance of intestinal epithelia.
