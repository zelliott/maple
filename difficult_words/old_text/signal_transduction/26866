Glucocorticoids, steroid hormones of the adrenal gland, are an integral part of the stress response and regulate glucose metabolism. Natural and synthetic glucocorticoids are widely used in anti-inflammatory therapy but can have severe side effects. In vivo tests are needed to identify novel glucocorticoids and to screen compounds for unwanted effects on glucocorticoid signaling. We created the Glucocorticoid Responsive In vivo Zebrafish Luciferase activitY assay to monitor glucocorticoid signaling in vivo. The GRIZLY assay detects stress-induced glucocorticoid production in single zebrafish larvae, measures disruption of glucocorticoid signaling by an organotin pollutant metabolite, and specifically identifies a compound stimulating endogenous glucocorticoid production in a chemical screen. Our assay has broad applications in stress research, environmental monitoring, and drug discovery.
