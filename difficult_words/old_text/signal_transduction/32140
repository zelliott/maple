Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a pathogenic, dimorphic fungus that causes paracoccidioidomycosis, a systemic human mycosis that is highly prevalent in Latin America. In this study, we demonstrated that P. brasiliensis yeasts induced interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6 secretion by human lung epithelial A549 cells. However, tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ were undetectable in these cultures. Moreover, P. brasiliensis yeasts induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in A549 cells, and IL-8 and IL-6 secretion promoted by this fungus was dependent on activation of p38 MAPK and ERK 1/2. In addition, IL-8 and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in culture supernatants of A549 cells that were incubated with formaldehyde-fixed P. brasiliensis compared to cultures of cells that were infected with live yeasts. Our results indicate that the observed cytokine level differences were due to protease expression, in live yeasts, that degraded these cytokines. Degradation of human recombinant IL-8 and IL-6 by live P. brasiliensis was inhibited by AEBSF and aprotinin, suggesting that these proteases belong to a family of serine proteases. This is the first report showing that P. brasiliensis may modulate host inflammation by expressing proteases that degrade proinflammatory cytokines.
