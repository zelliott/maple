GM-CSF promotes homeostasis of myeloid cells. We report that GM-CSF upregulates mRNA and protein production of the soluble form of membrane bound VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1) in human monocytes. This sVEGFR-1 was biologically active, as cell-free supernatants from GM-CSF-stimulated monocytes blocked detection of endogenously expressed VEGF and inhibited endothelial cell migration and tube formation, even in the presence of exogenous rhVEGF. VEGF activity was recovered by neutralizing sVEGFR-1. To determine whether these events were important in vivo, Matrigel plugs were incubated with rhVEGF, rhGM-CSF, or rhGM-CSF/rhVEGF and injected into mice. Plugs containing GM-CSF or GM-CSF/VEGF had less endothelial cell invasion than plugs containing rhVEGF and were similar to plugs incubated with PBS alone. Neutralizing antibodies specific for sVEGFR-1 injected in these plugs reversed the effects of GM-CSF or GM-CSF/VEGF, while an isogenic antibody did not. Thus, GM-CSF and monocytes play a vital role in angiogenesis through the regulation of VEGF and sVEGFR-1.
