Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an effective molecular target of anti-cancer therapies. Curcumin inhibits cancer cell growth in vitro by suppressing gene expression of EGFR and reduces tumor growth in various animal models. To overcome instable and insoluble properties of curcumin as therapeutics, we designed and synthesized six novel pyrimidine-substituted curcumin analogues with or without a hydroxyl group originally present in curcumin. The cell viability tests indicated that IC50 of the analogues containing hydroxyl group were 3 to 8-fold lower than those of the analogues without hydroxyl group in two colon cancer cell lines tested. Western blot analysis indicates the analogues containing hydroxyl group inhibited expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. Further protein analyses showed that the analogues had anti-cellular proliferation, pro-apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest properties associated with suppressed EGFR expression. These results indicate that the hydroxyl groups in curcumin and the analogues were critical for observed biological activities.
