Soluble secretory proteins are first translocated across endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and folded in a specialized ER luminal environment. Fully folded and assembled secretory cargo are then segregated from ER-resident proteins into COPII-derived vesicles or tubular elements for anterograde transport. Mechanisms of bulk-flow, ER-retention and receptor-mediated export have been suggested to operate during this transport step, although these mechanisms are poorly understood. In yeast, there is evidence to suggest that Erv29p functions as a transmembrane receptor for the export of certain soluble cargo proteins including glycopro-alpha-factor (gpalphaf), the precursor of alpha-factor mating pheromone. Here we identify a hydrophobic signal within the pro-region of gpalphaf that is necessary for efficient packaging into COPII vesicles and for binding to Erv29p. When fused to Kar2p, an ER-resident protein, the pro-region sorting signal was sufficient to direct Erv29p-dependent export of the fusion protein into COPII vesicles. These findings indicate that specific motifs within soluble secretory proteins function in receptor-mediated export from the ER. Moreover, positive sorting signals seem to predominate over potential ER-retention mechanisms that may operate in localizing ER-resident proteins such as Kar2p.
