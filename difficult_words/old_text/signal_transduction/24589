Crosslinking of sIgM on the B cell line WEHI 231 with anti-sIgM antibody induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation, implicating protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in sIg-mediated signal transduction. We have analyzed this cell line for members of the src family of PTKs and have evaluated whether these PTKs might be involved in the process of sIgM-mediated signaling. Our results show that Blk, Lyn, Lck, and Hck are detectable in WEHI 231 cells. Addition of antibodies to sIgM were found to variably stimulate the activities of Blk, Lyn, Lck, and Hck as measured by immune-complex protein kinase assays. Autophosphorylation of these src PTKs, as assessed by reaction with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, increased over the time course of sIgM-mediated activation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies to investigate the potential physical interaction of src PTKs with the sIgM receptor complex revealed that, under digitonin and Brij 96 lysis conditions Lyn, Lck, Hck, but not Blk associated with sIgM.
