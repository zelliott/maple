Engagement of the FcepsilonRI expressed on mast cells induces the production of phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate by PI3K, which is essential for the functions of the cells. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) directly opposes PI3K by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate at the 3' position. In this work we used a lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA gene knockdown method to study the role of PTEN in CD34(+) peripheral blood-derived human mast cells. Loss of PTEN caused constitutive phosphorylation of Akt, p38 MAPK, and JNK, as well as cytokine production and enhancement in cell survival, but not degranulation. FcepsilonRI engagement of PTEN-deficient cells augmented signaling downstream of Src kinases and increased calcium flux, degranulation, and further enhanced cytokine production. PTEN-deficient cells, but not control cells, were resistant to inhibition of cytokine production by wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor. The findings demonstrate that PTEN functions as a key regulator of mast cell homeostasis and FcepsilonRI-responsiveness.
