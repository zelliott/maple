Cardiotrophin-1 protects cardiac myocytes from ischaemic re-oxygenation (IR) injury. CT-1 activates MEK1/2,p42/44MAPK as well as the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-OH kinase (PI3) protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pathway. In this study we investigate the signalling pathways that mediate the anti-apoptotic cell survival effect of CT-1 in IR. Dominant negative gene based inhibitors of MEK1/2, PI3-kinase and Akt inhibited CT-1 mediated cardioprotection in re-oxygenation as did chemical inhibitors of the PI3-kinase pathway. Hence the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway is required in addition to MEK1/2 to mediate CT-1 cardioprotection in IR.
