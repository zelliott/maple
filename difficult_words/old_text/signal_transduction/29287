The molecular signals that regulate the regenerative function of satellite cells in the skeletal muscle remain largely obscure. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Brack et al. (2008) report that direct molecular crosstalk between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation pathways determines the timing and efficiency of muscle repair.
