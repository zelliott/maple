The transcription of ribosomal DNA, ribosomal protein (RP) genes, and 5S and tRNA genes by RNA polymerases (Pols) I, II, and III, respectively, is rapidly and coordinately repressed upon interruption of the secretory pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that repression of ribosome and tRNA synthesis in secretion-defective cells involves activation of the cell integrity pathway. Transcriptional repression requires the upstream components of this pathway, including the Wsc family of putative plasma membrane sensors and protein kinase C (PKC), but not the downstream Bck1-Mkk1/2-Slt2 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. These findings reveal a novel PKC effector pathway that controls more than 85% of nuclear transcription. It is proposed that the coordination of ribosome and tRNA synthesis with cell growth may be achieved, in part, by monitoring the turgor pressure of the cell.
