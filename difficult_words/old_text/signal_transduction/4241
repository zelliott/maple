Anisomycin or osmotic stress induced by sorbitol activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases (JNKs) in ventricular myocytes cultured from neonatal rat hearts. After 15-30 min, JNK was activated by 10-20-fold. Activation by anisomycin was transient, but that by sorbitol was sustained for at least 4 h. In-gel JNK assays confirmed activation of two renaturable JNKs of 46 and 55 kDa (JNK-46 and JNK-55, respectively). An antibody against human JNK1 immunoprecipitated JNK-46 activity. Endothelin-1, an activator of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), also transiently activated JNKs by 2-5-fold after 30 min. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not activate the JNKs although it activated ERK1 and ERK2, which phosphorylated the c-Jun transactivation domain in vitro. ATP depletion and repletion achieved by incubation in cyanide+deoxyglucose and its subsequent removal from the medium activated the ERKs but failed to activate the JNKs. Sorbitol (but not anisomycin) also stimulated the ERKs. Sorbitol-stimulated JNK activity could be resolved into three peaks by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono Q column. The two major peaks contained JNK-46 or JNK-55. These results demonstrate that cellular stresses differentially activate the JNKs and ERKs and that there may be "cross-talk" between these MAPK pathways.
