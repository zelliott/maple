Protein tyrosine kinases help to regulate the expression of many genes, which play an important role in the pathophysiology of a number of diseases. Here we investigate the effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, AG126 and AG556 on the degree of experimental spinal cord trauma induced by the application of vascular clips to the dura via a four-level T4-T8 laminectomy. Spinal cord injury in mice resulted in severe trauma characterized by oedema, neutrophil infiltration, production of a range of inflammatory mediators, tissue damage, and apoptosis. Treatment of the mice with AG126 and AG556 significantly reduced the degree of (1) spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score), (2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity), (3) iNOS, nitrotyrosine, and PARP expression and (4) apoptosis (TUNEL staining and Bax and Bcl-2 expression). In a separate set of experiments, AG126 and AG556 significantly ameliorated the recovery of limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). This study provides an experimental evidence that (1) prevention of the activation of protein tyrosine kinases reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal cord trauma, and (2) inhibition of the activity of certain tyrosine kinases may represent a novel approach for the therapy of spinal cord trauma.
