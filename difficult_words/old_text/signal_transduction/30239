In this report we show that exogenous NO added to human neuroblastoma NB69 cells inhibits cell proliferation and downregulates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream signaling pathways. These comprise the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-regulated kinases 1 and 2 pathway, and the phospholipase Cgamma pathway. In contrast, NO enhances the EGFR-controlled p38MAPK pathway. We also show that NO enhances the activation of the cAMP-responsive element binding protein, a transcription factor controlled by p38MAPK, as demonstrated using 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole (SB202190), a p38MAPK inhibitor. These processes are accompanied by the NO-mediated hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), preferentially at Ser795 compared to Ser780 and Ser807/811, and the downregulation of p27(KIP1), p21(CIP1/WAF1), and p16(INK4a), although NO downregulated p16(INK4a) only when the p38MAPK activity was suppressed. The p38MAPK pathway controls the phosphorylation status of pRb as SB202190 enhances the hypophosphorylation of pRb. We reverted the inhibitory action of NO on EGFR and pRb phosphorylation in living cells using cell-permeable reducing agents, which suggested that reversible S-nitrosation controls these proteins. Our results support the notion that NO negatively modulates the p38MAPK-controlled phosphorylation of pRb, inducing the subsequent arrest of the cell cycle at the G1/S transition.
