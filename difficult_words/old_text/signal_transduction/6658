Guanine nucleotide regulatory (G) proteins control signalling via a variety of widely distributed cell surface receptors. Relatively little is known about the involvement of G-proteins in signal transduction via biologically important receptors on lymphocytes. This review focuses primarily on the role of G-proteins in controlling antigen receptor-stimulated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in B and T cells. Surface Ig receptors are clearly typical G-protein linked receptors. In contrast, there is only suggestive, but not definitive evidence for G-protein participation in signal transduction via the T cell antigen receptors.
