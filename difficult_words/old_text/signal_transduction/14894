Suitable mammalian models for aging with a wide range of age-associated pathology are desirable to study molecular mechanisms of human aging. Recent studies have identified that fibroblast growth factor 23 (Fgf-23) null mice and klotho hypomorphs could generate multiple premature aging-like features, including shortened lifespan, infertility, kyphosis, atherosclerosis, extensive soft tissue calcifications, skin atrophy, muscle wasting, T cell dysregulation, pulmonary emphysema, osteoporosis/osteopenia, abnormal mineral ion metabolism, and impaired vitamin-D homeostasis. The strikingly similar in vivo phenotypes of two separate genetically altered mouse lines implicate that the premature aging-like features may be partly regulated through a common signaling pathway involving both Fgf-23 and klotho; such speculation is experimentally supported by the observation that Fgf-23 requires klotho as a cofactor to exert its functions. Despite about 2000-fold higher serum levels of Fgf-23 in klotho mutants (compared to wild-type animals), these mice show physical, biochemical and morphological features similar to Fgf-23 null mice, but not as Fgf-23 transgenic mice; these observations suggest that widely encountered premature aging-like features in klotho mutant mice are due to the inability of Fgf-23 to exert its bioactivities in absence of klotho. The results of recent studies showing klotho as a cofactor in Fgf-23 signaling consequently explains that the premature aging-like features in klotho-deficient mice is not a primary cause, rather a consequence of lacking Fgf-23 activity. These understandings will help us to redefine the role of klotho as an aging factor.
