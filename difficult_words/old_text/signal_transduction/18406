Ultraviolet radiation induces signal transduction at both early (<6 h) and late (>6 h) times after exposure. The inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha is induced at late times, and is induced by ultraviolet-induced DNA damage, as defects in DNA repair increase, and enhanced photoproduct repair reduces, tumor necrosis factor alpha expression. Here we show that late tumor necrosis factor alpha gene expression is sensitive to rapamycin, implicating FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein, a member of the DNA protein kinase family, as a signal transducer of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein was localized in the nucleus of keratinocytes and its level was increased following ultraviolet irradiation. Immuno- precipitated FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein was stimulated by ultraviolet-irradiated DNA to phosphorylate p53 in vitro, and in vivo rapamycin reduced ultraviolet induction of p53 by 20%. Rapamycin further inhibited the ultraviolet-induced phosphorylation of the FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein downstream target kinase p70S6K. In mice, topical application of rapamycin before ultraviolet exposure protected against suppression of the contact hypersensitivity that is a hallmark of ultraviolet-induced cytokine gene expression. These results demonstrate that the FKBP12-rapamycin-associated DNA protein kinase transduces the signal of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage into production of immunosuppressive cytokines at late times after ultraviolet irradiation.
