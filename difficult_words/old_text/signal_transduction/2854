Prespore differentiation requires both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the transcription factor GBF, and for one class of prespore genes the two form part of a single pathway. It seems that differentiation-inducing factor, the inducer of prestalk cell differentiation, may operate via a calcium signalling pathway, and terminal stalk cell differentiation is in part regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3.
