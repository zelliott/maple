Recently we could demonstrate that FIT is post-translationally regulated in way of protein turnover and that such turnover can be counteracted by the signaling compound NO. Here we summarize findings about FIT regulation and point out which signals and post-translational modifications could act on FIT activity to regulate iron uptake from the soil.
