DAP-kinase (DAPK) is a Ca(2+)/calmodulin regulated Ser/Thr kinase that activates a diverse range of cellular activities. It is subject to multiple layers of regulation involving both intramolecular signaling, and interactions with additional proteins, including other kinases and phosphatases. Its protein stability is modulated by at least three distinct ubiquitin-dependent systems. Like many kinases, DAPK participates in several signaling cascades, by phosphorylating additional kinases such as ZIP-kinase and protein kinase D (PKD), or Pin1, a phospho-directed peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that regulates the function of many phosphorylated proteins. Other substrate targets have more direct cellular effects; for example, phosphorylation of the myosin II regulatory chain and tropomyosin mediate some of DAPK's cytoskeletal functions, including membrane blebbing during cell death and cell motility. DAPK induces distinct death pathways of apoptosis, autophagy and programmed necrosis. Among the substrates implicated in these processes, phosphorylation of PKD, Beclin 1, and the NMDA receptor has been reported. Interestingly, not all cellular effects are mediated by DAPK's catalytic activity. For example, by virtue of protein-protein interactions alone, DAPK activates pyruvate kinase isoform M2, the microtubule affinity regulating kinases and inflammasome protein NLRP3, to promote glycolysis, influence microtubule dynamics, and enhance interleukin-1Î² production, respectively. In addition, a number of other substrates and interacting proteins have been identified, the physiological significance of which has not yet been established. All of these substrates, effectors and regulators together comprise the DAPK interactome. By presenting the components of the interactome network, this review will clarify both the mechanisms by which DAPK function is regulated, and by which it mediates its various cellular effects.
