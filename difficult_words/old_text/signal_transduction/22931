Tight junctions (TJs) have been suggested to act both as barriers and fences, but lack of information on the constituents of TJ strands has hampered the direct assessment of these functions. Over the past year, our understanding of the molecular architecture of TJ strands has increased markedly and we are ready to experimentally examine how TJs are involved in their dual functions.
