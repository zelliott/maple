To understand the induction of the adaptive response under various stress conditions, it is important to determine the partnership between histidine kinase and response regulators in the bacterial two-component system (TCS). The genes encoding TCS partners are usually comprised of an operon in the genome, but many of them are orphans in the cyanobacterial genome. There is little information on their partnerships in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Our comprehensive analysis of protein-protein interactions among all 37 full-length proteins and the truncated domains of 24 orphans revealed a number of specific interactions. They involved evolutionarily well-conserved orphan proteins among cyanobacterial species such as Synpcc7942_0453/Ycf29, NblS/RpaB, NblS/SrrA, SasA/RpaA, and SasA/Synpcc7942_2466. Our investigation of the transphosphorylation of interaction partners indicates that orphan TCSs comprise a complex signaling network.
