The human neuroblastoma cell line NB-39-nu expressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA following treatment with a combination of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin). The level of iNOS mRNA peaked at 48 hr after treatment, and dexamethasone inhibited the induction of iNOS mRNA expression. Cisplatin induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA expression, and an anti-TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody inhibited the induction of iNOS expression by a combination of cisplatin and IFN-gamma in NB-39-nu cells. Thus, iNOS expression in NB-39-nu cells by a combination of cisplatin and IFN-gamma involves in the TNF-alpha-mediated signal transduction mechanism.
