Many cytokines and cytokine receptors involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, immune responses, and inflammation have been identified and characterized at the molecular level. Several characteristic features of cytokines, such as pleiotropy and redundancy, are now more clearly understood on the basis of their molecular structures. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated an intimate link between cytokines and various diseases such as allergy, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. The pathogenesis of these diseases and therapies to treat them will be discussed based on insights derived from cytokine research.
