Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal lung disease characterized by the proliferation of fibroblasts and deposition of extracellular matrix. Since the prognosis of IPF is still poor, novel therapeutic modalities are strongly required. For this reason, to find molecular target for therapy of IPF is of much importance. The recent understanding of pathogenesis in IPF indicates the critical role of alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII) and fibroblasts. Although the detailed mechanisms involved in IPF is still unclear, various profibrotic mediators which are produced by the injured AECII are thought to play a role in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis via stimulating fibroblasts. Among them, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is one of critical growth factors by stimulating the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts. In this review, we discuss the role of PDGF in pulmonary fibrosis and the possibility as a therapeutic target for IPF.
