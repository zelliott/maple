Wounding in multicellular eukaryotes results in marked changes in gene expression that contribute to tissue defense and repair. Using a cDNA microarray technique, we analyzed the timing, dynamics, and regulation of the expression of 150 genes in mechanically wounded leaves of Arabidopsis. Temporal accumulation of a group of transcripts was correlated with the appearance of oxylipin signals of the jasmonate family. Analysis of the coronatine-insensitive coi1-1 Arabidopsis mutant that is also insensitive to jasmonate allowed us to identify a large number of COI1-dependent and COI1-independent wound-inducible genes. Water stress was found to contribute to the regulation of an unexpectedly large fraction of these genes. Comparing the results of mechanical wounding with damage by feeding larvae of the cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae) resulted in very different transcript profiles. One gene was specifically induced by insect feeding but not by wounding; moreover, there was a relative lack of water stress-induced gene expression during insect feeding. These results help reveal a feeding strategy of P. rapae that may minimize the activation of a subset of water stress-inducible, defense-related genes.
