When stimulated by chemoattractants, eukaryotic cells respond through a combination of temporal and spatial dynamics. These responses come about because of the interaction of a large number of signaling components. The complexity of these systems makes it hard to understand without a means of systematically generating and testing hypotheses. Computer simulations have proved to be useful in testing conceptual models. Here we outline the steps required to develop these models.
