Invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is thought to originate from duct-like lesions called pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). PanINs progress from low grade (PanIN-1) to high grade (PanIN-3) as the cells attain molecular alterations to key regulatory genes, including activating mutations in the KRAS protooncogene. Despite a well-documented progression model, our knowledge of the initiator cells of PanINs and the transcriptional networks and signaling pathways that impact PanIN formation remains incomplete.

In this study, we examined the importance of the acinar-restricted transcription factor Mist1 to KrasG12D-induced mouse PanIN (mPanIN) formation in 3 different mouse models of pancreatic cancer.

In the absence of Mist1 (Mist1KO), KrasG12D-expressing mice exhibited severe exocrine pancreatic defects that were rescued by ectopic expression of Mist1 in acinar cells. mPanIN development was greatly accelerated in Mist1KO/KrasG12D/+ pancreata, and in vitro assays revealed that Mist1KO acinar cells were predisposed to convert to a ductal phenotype and activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Notch-signaling pathways.

We propose that convergence of EGFR, Notch, and Kras pathways in acinar cells lacking Mist1 leads to enhanced mPanIN formation.
