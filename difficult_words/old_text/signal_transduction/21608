Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is the major cytokine involved in the control of neutrophil development. G-CSF activates the special receptor, the G-CSF receptor (GCSF-R), which subsequently triggers multiple signaling events. To obtain more interactive molecules with GCSF-R and to further understand the cellular signaling mechanism of GCSF-R, yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen a mouse liver library. Here, the interaction of GCSF-R and Snapin was found by yeast two-hybrid experiment, and the interaction of the two proteins was further confirmed by GST pull-down experiment, mammalian two-hybrid experiment and co-immunoprecipitation study. Moreover, the immuno-fluorescence assay was shown that the two proteins of GCSF-R with Snapin were co-localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. The region of C-terminal GCSF-R between box2 and box3, including the residue Tyr703, was responsible for the interaction with Snapin. These data suggested that Snapin is a new interactive protein of GCSF-R.
