The TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family is a group of adapter proteins that link a wide variety of cell surface receptors. Including the TNF and IL-1 receptor superfamily to diverse signaling cascades, which lead to the activation of NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases. In addition, TRAFs interact with a variety of proteins that regulate receptor-induced cell death or survival. Thus, TRAF-mediated signals may directly induce cell survival or interfere with the death receptor-induced apoptosis.
