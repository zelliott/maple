The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) and its downstream signaling components have become increasingly recognized as having a driving role in the development of malignancy, and consequently IGF-1R has become a potential target for cancer therapy. Several inhibitors of IGF-1R are in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These IGF-1R-targeted agents include monoclonal antibodies such as cixutumumab (IMC-A12), AMG-479, AVE1642, BIIB022, dalotuzumab (MK-0646), and robatumumab (Sch717454), the ligand neutralizing antibody Medi-573, and the small molecule inhibitors BMS-754807, linsitinib (OSI-906), XL228, and AXL1717. Two phase III trials of the anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody, figitumumab (CP-751,871), were discontinued in 2010 as it was considered unlikely either trial would meet their primary endpoints. In light of disappointing clinical data with figitumumab and other targeted agents, it is likely that the use of molecular markers will become important in predicting response to treatment. This review outlines the role of IGF-1R signaling in solid tumors with a particular focus on NSCLC, and provides an overview of clinical data.
