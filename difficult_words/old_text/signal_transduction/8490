To observe the effect of mechanical force on the expression of p-ERK and p-STAT3 when pulmonary epithelium A549 cells were subjected to tensile stress.

By the self-made four-point bending system, the A549 cells were subjected to cyclic tensile stress of 3000 microstrain for 30 min, 1 h, 2 h or 4 h respectively, then the total protein of each time point was collected and the expression of p-ERK and p-STAT3 were detected by Western blot analysis.

(1) The expression of p-ERK was activated at 1 h and remained at a high level until 4 h. (2) The expression of p-STAT3 (Ser) was activated at 30 min and remained at a high level until 4 h.

Tensile stress can activate the expression of p-ERK and p-STAT3 (Ser) in alveolar epithelium A549 cells. ERK and STAT3 may participate in the cell mechanotransduction in A549 cells.
