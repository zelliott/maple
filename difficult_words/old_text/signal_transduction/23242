Growth rate is determined not only by extracellular cues such as nutrient availability but also by intracellular processes. Changes in cell morphology in budding yeast, mediated by polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, have been shown to reduce cell growth.

Here we demonstrate that polarization of the actin cytoskeleton inhibits the highly conserved Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) pathway. This downregulation is suppressed by inactivation of the TORC1 pathway regulatory Iml1 complex, which also regulates TORC1 during nitrogen starvation. We further demonstrate that attenuation of growth is important for cell recovery after conditions of prolonged polarized growth.

Our results indicate that extended periods of polarized growth inhibit protein synthesis, mass accumulation, and the increase in cell size at least in part through inhibiting the TORC1 pathway. We speculate that this mechanism serves to coordinate the ability of cells to increase in size with their biosynthetic capacity.
