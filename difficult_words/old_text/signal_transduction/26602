The activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) through its receptor, EGFR,             is one of the major mechanisms that mediate renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastasis.             Silibinin, a natural flavonoid antioxidant with pleiotropic anticancer capability,             has shown anti-metastatic effects in a variety of cancers. However, the mechanism             by which silibinin inhibits EGFR signal-induced migration and invasion of RCC             cells is not clear. Here, we evaluated the potential roles of EGFR signaling cascade             that affects RCC progression, and also investigated the inhibitory effect of silibinin             on the EGFR signal-induced migration and invasion abilities of RCC cells. Our             data indicated that silibinin inhibited migration and invasion of RCC cells in             a dose-dependent manner via blocking the EGFR signal, especially in the EGFR highly             expressing RCC cells. Silibinin inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream             molecules ERK1/2 but did not affect phosphorylation of other downstream molecules,             STAT3 and Akt, in human RCC cell lines. Moreover, our data suggested that silibinin             significantly reduced the MMP-9 expression and its activity that was promoted             by the EGFR signal, and also suppressed MMP9-dependent migration and invasion             abilities of RCC cells. Taken together, this study clearly demonstrated that silibinin             inhibited EGFR induced migration and invasion of RCC cells via blockade of EGFR/MMP-9             signaling. Thus, we suggest that silibinin could be used as a potential effective             drug for the inhibition of RCC metastasis.
