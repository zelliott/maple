Adenylyl cyclases of the type II family differ from other subforms in that they are conditionally stimulated via alpha(s)/betagamma subunits and regulated by PKC mediated phosphorylation. AC II, stably expressed in HEK 239 cells, was incubated with the PKC activator tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA). Using cells metabolically labeled with [32P]phosphate, TPA caused concerted stimulation of basal and forskolin activated adenylyl cyclase together with incorporation of [32P]phosphate into AC II protein. Enhanced phosphorylation was also indicated by a monoclonal anti-phosphothreonine antibody. Assignment of TPA-induced [32P]phosphate-incorporation to specific sites was achieved by a combination of chemical and immunochemical methods. Three out of five [32P]labeled peptides that were generated by fragmentation with N-chlorosuccinimide were also recognized by the monoclonal antibody BBC-4 [S. Mollner, T. Pfeuffer, Eur. J. Biochem. 171 (1988) 265-271] directed against an epitope 8 kDa from the extreme C-terminus. These findings suggested Ser-871 (consensus sequence ARSLK) and Thr-1057 (CTCR) as acceptor candidates of phorbolester induced phosphoryl transfer.
