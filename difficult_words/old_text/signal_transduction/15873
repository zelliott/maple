The adaptor protein Disabled1 (Dab1) interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and decreases its pathological processing, an effect mediated by Fyn tyrosine kinase. Fyn is highly enriched in lipid rafts, a major site of pathological APP processing. To investigate the role of Fyn in the localization and phosphorylation of APP and Dab1 in lipid rafts, we isolated detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions from wild-type and Fyn knock-out mice. In wild-type mice, all of the Fyn kinase, 17% of total APP, and 33% of total Dab1 were found in DRMs. Nearly all of the tyrosine phosphorylated forms of APP and Dab1 were in DRMs. APP and Dab1 co-precipitated both in and out of DRM fractions, indicating an association that is independent of subcellular localization. Fyn knock-out mice had decreased APP, Dab1, and tyrosine-phosphorylated Dab1 in DRMs but increased co-immunoprecipitation of DRM APP and Dab1. Expression of phosphorylation deficient APP or Dab1 constructs revealed that phosphorylation of APP increases, whereas phosphorylation of Dab1 decreases, the interaction between APP and Dab1. Consistent with these observations, Reelin treatment led to increased Dab1 phosphorylation and decreased association between APP and Dab1. Reelin also caused increased localization of APP and Dab1 to DRMs, an effect that was not seen in Fyn knock-out neurons. These findings suggest that Reelin treatment promotes the localization of APP and Dab1 to DRMs, and affects their phosphorylation by Fyn, thus regulating their interaction.
