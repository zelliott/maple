We examined whether cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels are involved in S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. SNAP significantly increased ROS generation in cardiomyocytes. This increase was suppressed by both 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) and glibenclamide. Direct opening of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels with diazoxide led to ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was reversed by N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine (MPG), a scavenger of ROS. Myxothiazol partially suppressed the ROS generation. KT-5823, an inhibitor of PKG, prevented ROS generation, indicating that PKG is required for ROS generation. In addition, 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-BrcGMP), an activator of PKG, induced ROS generation. The effect of 8-BrcGMP was reversed by either 5-HD or MPG. YC-1, an activator of guanylyl cyclase, also increased ROS production, which was reversed by 5-HD. Neither LY-294002 nor wortmannin, the inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), affected SNAP's action. In a whole heart study, SNAP significantly reduced infarct size. The anti-infarct effect of SNAP was abrogated by either MPG or 5-HD. This effect was also blocked by PD-98059, an ERK inhibitor, but not by LY-294002. A Western blotting study showed that SNAP significantly enhanced phosphorylation of ERK, which was reversed by MPG. These results suggest that SNAP-induced ROS generation is mediated by activation of PKG and mitochondrial K(ATP) channels and that opening of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels is the downstream event of PKG activation. ROS and mitochondrial K(ATP) channels participate in the anti-infarct effect of SNAP. Moreover, phosphorylation of ERK is the downstream signaling event of ROS and plays a role in the cardioprotection of SNAP.
