The v-src oncogene is one of only two oncogenes capable of transforming mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the IGF-IR gene (R-cells). R-/v-src cells grow robustly in the absence of serum, suggesting the hypothesis that they may produce one or more growth factors that would sustain their ability to proliferate in serum-free condition. Using proteomic approaches on serum-free conditioned media derived from v-src-transformed cells, we have identified two growth promoting factors: ostepontin and proliferin. Subsequent experiments have indicated that osteopontin plays a prevalent role in promoting growth of v-src-transformed cells in serum-deprived condition.
