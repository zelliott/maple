13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), hydroxylinoleic acid, is a major lipoxygenase metabolite which is produced by myeloid inflammatory cells and modifies inflammatory cell activity. The biological effects of 13-HODE in non-haemopoietic cells (HUVEC) have been attributed to the incorporation of 13-HODE into 13-HODE containing diacylglycerol and the selective inhibition of protein kinase C. Our studies, using whole promyeloid cells (HL60) and recombinant PKC isoenzymes in an in vitro assay, showed that 13-HODE inhibited PKC-alpha, beta1, and PKC-betall, but did not affect the activity of PKC-delta. These data suggest that the actions of hydroxylinoleic acid on myeloid cells include the selective inhibition of classical PKC isoenzymes.
