The cell state splitter (CSS) model for differentiation, supported by recent evidence, requires that an intracellular mechanical events result in a commitment signal to the nucleus that determines which of two readied gene cascades is to be activated, via their master genes. We show how a link between the mechanochemistry of cell state splitting and the molecular genetics of "nuclear state splitting" might be forged out of well known molecular components of cells.
