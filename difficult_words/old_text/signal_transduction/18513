Integrins modulate signaling by growth factor receptors, but their role during tumorigenesis is not clear. Guo et al. (2006) now demonstrate that alpha 6 beta 4 integrin cooperates with ErbB2 in the formation of mammary tumors and discover distinct pathways that regulate cellular proliferation and adhesion downstream of the ErbB2-integrin complex.
