Feeding in codling moth caterpillars was induced by the general glutamate receptor activator monosodium glutamate (MSG) and by three different mGluR agonists known to specifically stimulate different classes of vertebrate metabotropic glutamate receptors, including: (1S,3R)-ACPD, which stimulates group I mGluRs (2R,4R)-APDC, which stimulates group II mGluRs and L-AP4, which stimulates some group III mGluRs. Experiments exposing larvae to combinations of specific mGluR agonists and specific signal transduction modulators suggest that each tested mGluR uses a different signaling pathway. First, feeding stimulatory effects of (1S,3R)-ACPD were abolished by phospholipase C inhibitor, U 73122, but remained unaffected by adenylate cyclase activator, NKH 477, or phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Rolipram. Second, (2R,4R)-APDC induced feeding in presence of U 73122 or Rolipram, but lost its feeding stimulatory effects in presence of NKH 477. Finally, L-AP4 did not induce feeding in presence of Rolipram, but maintained its feeding stimulatory effects in presence of U 73122 or NKH 477. The activity of the general glutamate receptor activator MSG was abolished by NKH 477, and Rolipram. U 73122 did not affect MSG-stimulated feeding. These results suggest that transduction of MSG taste in the codling moth caterpillar relies mostly on cAMP-dependent signaling pathways.
