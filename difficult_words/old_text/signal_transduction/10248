Activation of several signaling pathways contributes to long-term synaptic plasticity, but how brief stimuli produce coordinated activation of these pathways is not understood. In Aplysia, the long-term facilitation (LTF) of sensory neuron synapses by 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT) requires the activation of several kinases, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The 5-HT-enhanced secretion of the sensory neuron-specific neuropeptide sensorin mediates the activation of MAPK. We find that stimulus-induced activation of two signaling pathways, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and type II protein kinase A (PKA), regulate sensorin secretion and responses. Treatment with 5-HT produces a rapid increase in sensorin synthesis, especially at varicosities, which precedes the secretion of sensorin. PI3K inhibitor and rapamycin block LTF and the rapid synthesis of sensorin at varicosities even in the absence of sensory neuron cell bodies. Secretion of the newly synthesized sensorin from the varicosities and activation of the autocrine responses of sensorin to produce LTF require type II PKA interaction with AKAPs (A-kinase anchoring proteins). Thus, long-term synaptic plasticity is produced when multiple signaling pathways that are important for regulating distinct cellular functions are activated in a specific sequence and recruit the secretion of a neuropeptide to activate additional critical pathways.
