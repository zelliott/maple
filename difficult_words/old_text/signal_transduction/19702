The histidine kinase-based signal transduction pathway was first uncovered in bacteria and is a prominent form of regulation in prokaryotes. However, this type of signal transduction is not unique to prokaryotes; over the last decade two-component signal transduction pathways have been identified and characterized in diverse eukaryotes, from unicellular yeasts to multicellular land plants. A number of small but important differences have been noted in the architecture and function of eukaryotic pathways. Because of the powerful genetic approaches and facile molecular analysis associated with the yeast system, the SLN1 osmotic response pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is particularly useful as a eukaryotic pathway model. This chapter provides an overview of genetic and biochemical methods that have been important in elucidating the stimulus-response events that underlie this pathway and in understanding the details of a eukaryotic His-Asp phosphorelay.
