Drosophila genetics is one of the most powerful tools in modern biology. For many years, the "forward genetic" approach using Drosophila has been extraordinarily successful in elucidating the molecular pathways of many physiological processes and behaviors. Recently, the "reverse genetic" approach in Drosophila is increasingly being developed as a major tool for research in biology, especially in the study of human diseases. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Kinase signaling has been directly implicated in PD pathogenesis. Mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) cause PARK6 type PD, in which mitochondrial deficits are at the center of pathogenesis. Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most prevalent genetic cause of both familial (PARK8 type with autosomal dominant inheritance) and sporadic PD. To understand the mechanism of PINK1- and LRRK2- mediated pathogenesis, reverse-engineered Drosophila models have been critical tools. Here the authors will discuss the usage of Drosophila models in their and other laboratories, and share scientific insights that originate from these studies, and discuss their experimental results of the effect of PINK1 on proteasome function. The authors will also comment on the different approaches taken in these lines of investigation.
