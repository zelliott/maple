Engagement of the mast cell high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE), FcepsilonRI, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, that has been demonstrated as critical for degranulation. Herein we describe a synthetic compound, ER-27319, as a potent and selective inhibitor of antigen or anti-IgE-mediated degranulation of rodent and human mast cells. ER-27319 affected neither Lyn kinase activity nor the antigen-induced phosphorylation of the FcepsilonRI but did effectively inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and thus its activity. As a consequence, tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma1, generation of inositol phosphates, release of arachidonic acid, and secretion of histamine and tumor necrosis factor alpha were also inhibited. ER-27319 did not inhibit the anti-CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma1 in Jurkat T cells, demonstrating a specificity for Syk-induced signals. In contrast the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Syk, induced by in vitro incubation with the phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of FcepsilonRI gamma subunit or by antigen activation of RBL-2H3 cells, was specifically inhibited by ER-27319. However, when ER-27319 was added to immunoprecipitated Syk, derived from activated cells, no effect was seen on Syk activity. ER-27319 did not inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk induced by activation in the presence of Igbeta ITAM or the anti-IgM-induced phosphorylation of Syk in human peripheral B cells. Therefore, ER-27319 selectively interferes with the FcepsilonRI gamma phospho-ITAM activation of Syk in vitro and in intact cells. These results confirm the importance of Syk in FcepsilonRI-mediated responses in mast cells and demonstrate the mast cell selectivity and therapeutic potential of ER-27319 in the treatment of allergic disease.
