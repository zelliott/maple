SMAD3 is a key player in the TGFÎ² signaling pathway as a primary inducer of fibrosis. The inhibition of SMAD3 production is one strategy to alleviate fibrosis in keloid fibroblasts. In the present study, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against SMAD3 were designed to specifically block the expression of SMAD3. The cationic lipid nanoparticles (cLNs) were formulated to enhance an intracellular activity of SMAD3 ASOs in keloid fibroblasts. This formulation was prepared using melt-homogenization method, composed of 3-[N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamol] cholesterol (DC-Chol), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), Tween20, and trimyristin as a lipid core (1:1:1:1.3, w/w). The size and zeta potential of cLNs and cLN/ASO complexes were measured using light scattering. AFM was used to confirm the morphology and the size distribution of cLNs and cLN/ASO complexes. The prepared cLNs had a nano-scale sized spherical shape with highly positive charge, which were physically stable without aggregation during the storage. The cLN/SMAD3 ASO complexes were successfully generated and internalized onto keloid fibroblasts without toxicity. After the treatment with cLN/ASO complexes, SMAD3 was inhibited and collagen type I was also significantly suppressed in keloid fibroblasts. These results suggest that SMAD3 ASOs complexed with cLNs have a therapeutic potential to suppress collagen deposition in fibrotic diseases. Therefore, this strategy might be developed to lead to anti-fibrotic therapies.
