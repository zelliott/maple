In mammals, cytosolic sensors retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) activate multiple signaling cascades initiating IFN-α/β expression. IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is required for the activation of IFN-β, which, in turn, primes the expression of most IFN-α genes by IFN-induced IRF7 through the STAT1 pathway. In fish, RIG-I overexpression inhibits virus infection by induction of IFN response; however, the subtle signaling cascade mechanism remains to be identified. In this study, we clone an ortholog of MITA, a recently identified adaptor responsible for RLR pathway, from crucian carp (Carassius auratus L.), and demonstrate its ability to suppress viral replication through IRF3/7-dependent IFN response. The pivotal signaling molecules of RLR pathway, including RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, laboratory of genetics and physiology 2, and TANK-binding kinase 1, are also cloned and characterized, confirming that the RLR-mediated IFN activation is conserved from fish to mammals. Further characterization of distinct IFN gene activation reveals that zebrafish IFN1 and IFN3 are induced by the MITA pathway but are dependent on distinct transcription factors. Whereas fish IFN genes cannot be classified into IFN-α or IFN-β, zebrafish IFN1 is primarily regulated by IRF3, thereby resembling that of IFN-β, and zebrafish IFN3 is regulated by IRF7, thereby resembling of those of IFN-αs. In contrast with mammalian IFN-α/β, zebrafish IFN1 and IFN3 are induced by the basally expressed IRF3 or IRF7, both of which are upregulated by IFN and virus infection. Collectively, these data suggest that IFN genes in fish and mammals have evolved independently to acquire a similar mechanism triggering their expression.
