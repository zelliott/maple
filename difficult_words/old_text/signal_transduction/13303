Recent advances in the study of axon guidance have begun to clarify the intricate signalling mechanisms utilised by receptors that mediate path-finding. Many of these axon guidance receptors, including Plexin B, EphA, ephrin B and Robo, regulate the Rho family of GTPases, to effect changes in motility. Recent studies demonstrate a critical role for the cytoplasmic tails of guidance receptors in signalling and also reveal the potential for a great deal of crosstalk between the various receptor-signalling pathways.
