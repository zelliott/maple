The Alagille Syndrome (AGS) is a heritable disorder affecting the liver and other organs. Causative dominant mutations in human Jagged 1 have been identified in most AGS patients. Related organ defects occur in mice that carry jagged 1 and notch 2 mutations. Multiple jagged and notch genes are expressed in the developing zebrafish liver. Compound jagged and notch gene knockdowns alter zebrafish biliary, kidney, pancreatic, cardiac and craniofacial development in a manner compatible with an AGS phenocopy. These data confirm an evolutionarily conserved role for Notch signaling in vertebrate liver development, and support the zebrafish as a model system for diseases of the human biliary system.
