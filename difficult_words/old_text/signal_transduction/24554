Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is believed to be involved in articular destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. HLA-class II antigens are expressed on synovial cells of patients with RA. The relation between the production of IL-1 and expression of HLA-class II antigens was studied. Synovial cells of rheumatoid patients appeared to express HLA-DR and DQ antigens to a significantly greater extent than those of osteoarthritic patients. These cells produced IL-1 following interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) stimulation and there was synergistic enhancement of production induced by IFN-gamma and monoclonal antibodies to HLA-DR or DQ antigens in combination. In the intracellular signal transduction mechanism for the production of IL-1 beta by these cells following IFN-gamma stimulation, protein kinase C and calmodulin may be involved as second messengers.
