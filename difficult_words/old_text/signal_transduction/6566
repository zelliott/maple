Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their ligands are important components of the signalling pathways by which cells interact. This review summarizes a growing body of genetic evidence showing that many developmentally important mutations in Drosophila and the mouse are in the genes that encode RTKs or their ligands, indicating that these molecules play central roles during both invertebrate and vertebrate development.
