MHC class II molecules have a crucial role in thymic selection and in generating Ag-specific T cell responses. There is extensive evidence for second messenger generation via MHC class II molecules, which can lead to apoptosis of B lymphocytes. We have examined HLA class II-mediated apoptosis in both normal and tumoral human B lymphocytes. Phosphatidylserine exposure and DNA fragmentation were observed in B cells within 24 h of stimulation via HLA class II. In marked comparison with Fas, the cell-permeable and irreversible caspase inhibitors zVAD-fmk and DEVD-fmk failed to inhibit HLA-DR-mediated apoptosis. No direct activation of caspase 3 was detected, and cleavage of pro-caspase 3 was not observed. Cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was detected via Fas but not via HLA class II. Although phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase has been implicated in HLA class I-mediated apoptosis, neither wortmannin nor LY294002 affected HLA class II-mediated apoptosis. CD95-sensitive cells were used to reveal that death occurred independently of CD95-CD95 ligand interactions. Overall, these data reveal a pathway of HLA-DR-mediated apoptosis that neither requires nor involves caspases. Moreover, it is phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase independent and Fas/CD95 independent. This pathway of HLA class II-mediated apoptosis could have an important role in the regulation of APC populations or in the control of malignant B lymphocyte proliferations.
