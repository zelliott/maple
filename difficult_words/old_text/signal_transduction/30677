JunD, a transcription factor of the AP-1 family, protects cells against oxidative stress. Here, we show that junD(-/-) mice exhibit features of premature aging and shortened life span. They also display persistent hypoglycemia due to enhanced insulin secretion. Consequently, the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathways are constitutively stimulated, leading to inactivation of FoxO1, a positive regulator of longevity. Hyperinsulinemia most likely results from enhanced pancreatic islet vascularization owing to chronic oxidative stress. Indeed, accumulation of free radicals in beta cells enhances VEGF-A transcription, which in turn increases pancreatic angiogenesis and insulin secretion. Accordingly, long-term treatment with an antioxidant rescues the phenotype of junD(-/-) mice. Indeed, dietary antioxidant supplementation was protective against pancreatic angiogenesis, hyperinsulinemia, and subsequent activation of insulin signaling cascades in peripheral tissues. Taken together, these data establish a pivotal role for oxidative stress in systemic regulation of insulin and define a key role for the JunD protein in longevity.
