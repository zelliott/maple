The epithelium-associated tissue distribution of the intracellular IL-1R antagonist (icIL-1Ra) suggests that it functions as a novel regulatory molecule for IL-1 in somatic tissues. We examined the role of the icIL-1Ra in IL-1 beta-induced responses in human ovarian cancer cells because ovarian surface epithelium expresses transcripts for the icIL-1Ra, and the majority of ovarian cancers arise from these cells. Several human ovarian and cervical cancer cell lines spontaneously express the icIL-1Ra. icIL-1Ra-expressing cells did not have altered growth characteristics or altered short term responses to IL-1 compared with icIL-1Ra-nonexpressing cells. While a 90-min exposure to IL-1 beta resulted in increased steady state cytokine mRNA levels in all cells, icIL-1Ra-positive cells were incapable of maintaining IL-1-beta-induced expression of GRO mRNA. This did not result from decreased transcriptional activity of the GRO gene, but reflected differences in mRNA stability and/or degradation. To determine whether the icIL-1Ra altered mRNA stability, we used a retroviral expression vector to express the icIL-1Ra in an icIL-1Ra-negative cell line. The resulting cells displayed a profile of IL-1 beta-induced genes analogous to that found in cells spontaneously expressing icIL-1Ra. These data show for the first time an intrinsic biologic activity for the icIL-1Ra. The capacity to selectively alter IL-1-induced gene expression suggests that this version of the IL-1Ra is a unique intracellular inhibitor that attenuates IL-1 responses at a point downstream of the initial IL-1/IL-1 receptor interaction.
