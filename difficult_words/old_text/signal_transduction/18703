Cell for cell, probably no human cancer is as aggressive as melanoma. It is among a handful of cancers whose dimensions are reported in millimeters. Tumor thickness approaching 4 mm presents a high risk of metastasis, and a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma carries with it an abysmal median survival of 6-9 mo. What features of this malignancy account for such aggressive behavior? Is it the migratory history of its cell of origin or the programmed adaptation of its differentiated progeny to environmental stress, particularly ultraviolet radiation? While the answers to these questions are far from complete, major strides have been made in our understanding of the cellular, molecular, and genetic underpinnings of melanoma. More importantly, these discoveries carry profound implications for the development of therapies focused directly at the molecular engines driving melanoma, suggesting that we may have reached the brink of an unprecedented opportunity to translate basic science into clinical advances. In this review, we attempt to summarize our current understanding of the genetics and biology of this disease, drawing from expanding genomic information and lessons from development and genetically engineered mouse models. In addition, we look forward toward how these new insights will impact on therapeutic options for metastatic melanoma in the near future.
