The toxicity of thapsigargin, a selective inhibitor of endoplasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase, was investigated in osteoblasts. We induced apoptosis in murine osteoblastic MC3T3E1 cells by exposure to the thapsigargin. Thapsigargin transiently increased the phosphotransferase activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinases1 (JNK1), which might in turn activate transcriptional activity of activation protein-1 (AP-1). We then prepared extracts from thapsigargin-treated MC3T3E1 cells and monitored cleavage of acetyl-YVAD-AMC and acetyl-DEVD-AMC, fluorogenic substrates for caspase 1-like and caspase 3-like proteases, respectively. Thapsigargin significantly increased the proteolytic activity of caspase 3-like proteases, but not the activity of caspase 1-like proteases. Furthermore, thapsigargin increased the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). These data suggest that thapsigargin-induced apoptosis in osteoblasts may be via activation of JNK1, caspase 3-like family proteases, and transcriptional factors including AP-1 and NF-kappaB.
