3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce the risk of coronary event by cholesterollowering dependent and independent mechanisms. We have already described that the inhibitory effect of cerivastatin on angiogenesis contribute to the cholesterol-independent beneficial effect and was due to the inhibition of the cell signaling cascade RhoA/FAK/Akt. In this study, new insights in the molecular mechanism of action were provided. It indicates an inhibition of exposure of alpha V beta 3 integrin on cell membrane and a modification of gene expression. The inhibition of angiogenesis could be related to 1) an increase in genes involved in the inhibition of cell proliferation (p19(INK4), p21(Waf/Cip1),Wnt-5a), the inhibition of cell migration (Rho-GDI 1, alpha E-catenin) and 2) a downregulation of genes involved in angiogenesis (PAI-1, Vitronectin, HoxD3, Notch4) or in cell invasion (Semaphorin E). In addition, DNA repair protein genes (MLH1, XRCC1) were increased. This study may indicate new biological interest of genes involved in angiogenesis control.
