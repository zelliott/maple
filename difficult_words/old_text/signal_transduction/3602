We report for the first time that expression of the novel IL-1 cytokine receptor IL-1Rrp2 (IL-1R6) is unique to DCs within the human myelomonocytic lineage. IL-1Rrp2 was expressed by monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) which was dose-dependently increased by IL-4 and correlated with increased numbers of differentiated MDDCs. Human plasmacytoid DCs also express IL-1Rrp2 but the receptor is not expressed by either myeloid DC type 1 (mDC1) or mDC2 cells. We also show that IL-1F8 or IL-1F9 cytokines, which signal through IL-1Rrp2, induce maturation of MDDCs, as measured by increased expression of HLA-DR and CD83 and decreased expression of CD1a. Furthermore, IL-1F8 stimulated increased CD40 and CD80 expression and IL-18 and IL-12 p70 production by MDDCs, which induced proliferation of IFN-Î³-producing CD3(+)  lymphocytes (indicative of inflammatory Th1 subsets). IL-1F8 and IL-1F2 were equipotent in their ability to stimulate IL-18 secretion from MDDCs but IL-1F8 was not as potent as IL-1F2 in stimulating secretion of IL-12p70 from MDDCs or inducing lymphocyte proliferation Therefore, IL-1Rrp2 expression by some DC subsets may have an important function in the human immune response in vivo via its role in differentiation of inflammatory Th1 lymphocytes.
