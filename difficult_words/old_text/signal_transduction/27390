Rat anterior pituitary tissue expresses mRNA for PVR1 and PVR3, as well as a low level of PVR2. The PVR1 appears to be highly expressed in gonadotroph-like cells, while somatotroph-like cells apparently express the PVR3. We have recently demonstrated the expression of mRNA for both PVR2 and PVR3 in corticotroph-like AtT20 cells (FIG.3). If normal corticotrophs express the same mRNA as AtT20 cells, this may partly explain the low levels of PVR2 seen in normal pituitary tissue. Significant levels of at least two PVR1 splice variants mRNAs (PVR1s and PVR1hop) were expressed in clonal gonadotroph-like alpha T3-1 cells and normal rat anterior pituitary tissue. However, these splice variants are reported to have almost identical pharmacological characteristics in terms of binding, and the activation of AC and PLC. Further experiments are necessary to determine the functional consequences of differential splice variant expression in such cells. Interestingly, all three pituitary-cell lines studied expressed mRNA for the PVR3 (FIG.3), whereas earlier binding studies demonstrate a predominance of PACAP-preferring binding sites on normal anterior pituitary-cell membranes. In addition, it is clear that the different PVR subtypes can couple to different intracellular messenger systems. Thus it will be important to determine the expression of the different PVR subtypes in normal anterior pituitary-cell types if we are to begin to understand the regulation of pituitary-cell regulation by PACAP. Such questions form the basis of some of the ongoing studies in our laboratory.
