In the past year, several new components involved in cell migration and axon guidance have been identified by genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans, taking us a step closer to being able to trace the pathways which mediate these processes. The completion of the C. elegans genome sequencing project has provided us with the knowledge of the full spectrum of genes that might be involved in cell migration and axon guidance, and can facilitate the analysis of components that have been shown to be important for these processes in other systems.
