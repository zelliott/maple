Systematic histopathologic examination of hepatoblastoma specimens from patients enrolled in therapeutic protocols has allowed the identification of clinically relevant histologic subtypes that are being incorporated into risk stratification systems. Genetic and molecular studies have documented recurrent chromosomal abnormalities and aberrant activation of developmental, and oncogenic signaling pathways in hepatoblastoma. Molecular profiling has also identified molecular subclasses and gene signatures that could be used to stratify hepatoblastoma patients. Future international collaboration is needed to develop consensus pathology classifications, and to progressively incorporate genetic and molecular biomarkers into therapeutic pediatric liver tumors protocols.
