Molecular signaling in eukaryotic cells is accomplished by complex and redundant pathways converging on key molecules that are allosterically controlled by a limited number of signaling proteins. The p53-signaling pathway is an example of a complicated sequence of signals produced in response to DNA damage. This pattern of signaling may arise from chance occurrences at the origin of life and the necessities imposed on a nanomolar system. From this viewpoint, chaos theory may explain the origin, complexity, and convergence of these pathways.
