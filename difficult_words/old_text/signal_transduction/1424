Using site-directed mutagenesis of the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor and continuous expression in B-82 cells, the role of 3 conserved cysteines in transmembrane domains and 2 conserved cysteines in the third extracellular domain in receptor function was examined. Cysteine was replaced with serine in each mutant receptor as this amino acid is similar to cysteine in size but it cannot form disulfide linkages. Replacement of cysteine residues 77 and 327, in the second and seventh transmembrane-spanning domains, respectively, had no effect on ligand binding or the ability of the receptor to mediate isoproterenol stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Substitution of cysteine 285, in the sixth transmembrane domain of the receptor, produced a mutant receptor with normal ligand-binding properties but a significantly attenuated ability to mediate stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Mutation of cysteine residues 190 and 191, in the third extracellular loop of the beta 2 receptor, had qualitatively similar effects on ligand binding and isoproterenol-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Replacement of either of these residues with serine produced mutant receptors that displayed a marked loss in affinity for both beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Replacement of both cysteine 190 and 191 with serine had an even greater effect on the ability of the receptor to bind ligands. Consistent with the loss of Ser190 and/or Ser191 mutant receptor affinity for agonists was a corresponding shift to the right in the dose-response curve for isoproterenol-induced increases in intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations in cells expressing the mutant receptors. These data implicate one of the conserved transmembrane cysteine residues in the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor in receptor activation by agonists and also suggest that conserved cysteine residues in an extracellular domain of the receptor may be involved in ligand binding.
