The activation of phospholipase D in the kidney could be detected in vivo in rats treated with ethanol by the accumulation of phosphatidylethanol. Unilateral nephrectomy stimulated the activity of phospholipase D in the remaining kidney as indicated by an increase in the level of phosphatidylethanol. A significant increase in phosphatidylethanol level was observed as early as 5 min after contralateral nephrectomy and peak accumulation (200% of control) was observed after 15 min. The phosphatidylethanol level decreased again to the basal level after 2 h. The accumulation of phosphatidylethanol was specific for kidney and the product was localized primarily in the cortex. Phospholipase D activity in kidney cortical slices from untreated rats was stimulated in vitro by plasma obtained from unilaterally nephrectomized rats, indicating that circulating factors in the plasma are responsible for the activation of phospholipase D. The phospholipase D activation by plasma from uninephrectomized animals was selectively inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, but not by the protein kinase C inhibitor H7. It is concluded that phospholipase D activity is stimulated as an early signal transduction event in compensatory kidney growth.
