Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is characterized by the abnormal and sustained proliferation of megakaryocytes. The mechanism for this lineage-specific expansion in ET, remains unclear. We have previously reported that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is involved in negative feedback regulation of megakaryopoiesis in both healthy volunteers (HV) and patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The present study found that megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-MK) of ET patients were less sensitive to TGF-beta1 than those of HV. The expression of Smad4 (Sma- and Mad-related protein-4) in CFU-MK of ET patients was reduced in comparison with that of HV. Finally, to confirm that the impaired TGF-beta1 sensitivity was caused by reduced expression of Smad4, we examined Smad4-transfected CFU-MK from ET patients in the presence of TGF-beta1, and verified that the transfectants were indeed as susceptible as CFU-MK from HV to TGF-beta1. Thus it was surmised that one of the mechanisms for impaired sensitivity of CFU-MK to TGF-beta1 is the reduced expression of Smad4.
