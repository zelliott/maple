During embryogenesis, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling needs to be finely tuned in a locally restricted manner. Here, we report a cell-intrinsic mode of BMP response control executed by the membrane protein Jiraiya. In the Xenopus embryo, zygotic Jiraiya, expressed exclusively in the neuroectoderm, is essential and sufficient for limiting dorsal neural development, which is dependent on BMP signals. In animal cap assays, Jiraiya selectively and cell-autonomously inhibits BMP signaling, while Jiraiya's knockdown enhances the signaling. In the cell, Jiraiya selectively forms a complex with type II BMP receptor (BMPRII) and downregulates the cell surface localization of functional BMPRII. This functional interaction with Jiraiya depends on the unique tail domain of BMPRII, and, in particular, the conserved EVNNNG motif, the function of which has been unknown. Thus, Jiraiya represents a cell-intrinsic cutoff mechanism for dynamic responsiveness to BMP signals via subtype-selective receptor control.
