During endochondral bone formation, chondrocytes undergo terminal differentiation, during which the rate of proliferation decreases, cells become hypertrophic, and the extracellular matrix is altered by production of collagen X, as well as proteins required for matrix mineralization. This maturation process is responsible for most longitudinal bone growth, both during embryonic development and in postnatal long bone growth plates. Among the major signaling molecules implicated in regulation of this process are the positive regulators thyroid hormone (T3) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Both T3 and BMPs are essential for endochondral bone formation and cannot compensate for each other, suggesting interaction of the two signaling pathways. We have analyzed the temporal and spatial expression patterns of numerous genes believed to play a role in chondrocyte maturation. Our results show that T3 stimulates collagen X gene expression in cultured chondrocytres with kinetics and magnitude similar to those observed in vivo. Stimulation of collagen X gene expression by T3 occurs only after a significant delay, implying that this hormone may act indirectly. We show further that T3 rapidly stimulates production of BMP 4, concomitant with a decrease in the BMP inhibitor Noggin, potentially resulting in a net increase in BMP signaling. Finally, inhibition of BMP signaling with exogenous Noggin prevents T3 stimulation of collagen X expression, indicating that BMP signaling is essential for this process. These data position thyroid hormone at the top of a T3/BMP cascade, potentially explaining why both pathways are essential for chondrocyte maturation. J. Cell. Physiol. 219: 595-605, 2009.
