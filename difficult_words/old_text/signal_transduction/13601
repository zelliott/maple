Proanthocyanidins (PA) play a major role in plant protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. Moreover these molecules are known to be beneficial for human health and are responsible for astringency of foods and beverages such as wine and thus have a great impact on the final quality of the product. Genes playing a role in the PA pathway are only partially known. The amount of available transcriptomic and genetic data to select candidate genes without a priori knowledge from orthologous function increases every day. However, the methods used so far generate so many candidate genes that it is impossible to validate all of them. In this study, we used an integrative strategy based on different screening methods to select a reduced list of candidate genes. We have crossed results from different screening methods including QTL mapping and three transcriptomic studies to select 20 candidate genes, located in QTL intervals and fulfilling at least two transcriptomic screenings. This list includes three glucosyltransferases, already suspected to have a role in the PA biosynthetic pathway. Among the 17 remaining genes, we selected three genes to perform further analysis by association genetic studies. For each of these genes, we found a polymorphism linked to PA variation. The three genes (VvMybC2-L1, VvGAT-like and VvCob-like), not previously known to play a role in PA synthesis, are promising candidates for further molecular physiology studies.
