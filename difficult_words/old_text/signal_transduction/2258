C-C chemokines play an important role in recruitment of T lymphocytes to inflammatory sites. T lymphocytes secrete chemokines, but the activation requirements for chemokine production by T cells are uncertain. We studied the regulation of C-C chemokine production by CD28 costimulatory signals by murine T lymphocytes. Splenocytes from BALB/c mice cultured with anti-CD3 mAb expressed macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha mRNA and secreted MIP-1alpha, which was inhibited by anti-B7-1 plus anti-B7-2 mAbs. MIP-1alpha production by Ag-stimulated T cells from DO.11.10 TCR transgenic mice was augmented by anti-CD28 mAb and increased compared with DO.11.10/CD28(-/-) cells. When T cell costimulation was provided by IL-2, MIP-1alpha was not enhanced. Studies with IL-2, IL-4, STAT4, and STAT6 knock-out mice suggested that chemokine production is controlled by pathways different from those regulating T cell differentiation. Thus, CD28 costimulation may amplify an immune response by stimulating T cell survival, proliferation, and production of chemokines that recruit T cells to inflammatory sites.
