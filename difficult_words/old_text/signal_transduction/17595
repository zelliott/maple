The use of platelet concentrates in prophylactic and therapeutic transfusions has increased considerably. The design of suitable storage bags and improvements in procurement, processing, and storage practices have contributed significantly to the quality of stored platelets and their increased shelf life. There continues to be activation of platelets during procurement of blood, shipment, processing, and storage. By using appropriate preventive measures, inhibitors of platelet activation and protectants, platelet activation can be minimized. Although platelets seem to recover from initial activation and function normally, their in vitro response varies depending on the degree of activation occurring during preparative procedures. By and large, response to weak agonists diminishes rapidly during aging in storage. Further studies are essential to determine the reason for the development of this acquired defect. The normal response of stored platelets to a potent agonist such as thrombin suggests that signal generation and transduction mechanisms are not significantly compromised during storage. Epinephrine-mediated membrane modulation may contribute significantly to their improved in vivo performance during transfusions.
