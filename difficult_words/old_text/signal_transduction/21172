Differentiation of thymocytes into mature single-positive T cells is an ordered process involving sequential interactions between T cell receptor (TCR), co-receptors (CD4 or CD8) and their appropriate major histocompatibility complex-encoded ligands. Precisely how these receptor/co-receptor engagements determine lineage commitment is still controversial, but recently it has been suggested that quantitative differences in the signal transmitted by co-ligation of CD4 versus CD8 with TCR might provide the discriminating signal. We examine this hypothesis, using bispecific F(ab')2 antibodies to mimic TCR/ co-receptor engagement during thymocyte differentiation. These bispecific antibodies lack Fc and can engage surface molecules without extensive cross-linking or targeting to Fc receptor-bearing cells. We show that TCR/CD3 co-ligation with CD4 induces efficient differentiation of mature CD4 lineage cells, irrespective of their TCR specificity. Interestingly, TCR/CD3 co-ligation with CD8 also induces maturation of CD4 T cells, although less efficiently, but not of CD8 T cells. Thus, although the signals delivered by co-ligation of TCR and CD8 appear weaker than from co-ligation of TCR and CD4, the outcome from either engagement is the same. These data suggest that differences in signal intensity alone do not determine lineage commitment in the thymus, but that distinct signals are required for CD4 and CD8 single-positive cell differentiation.
