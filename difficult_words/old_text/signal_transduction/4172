The early molecular mechanisms activated by the treatment of human lymphocytes with human interferon beta have been studied. These identify an early increase with respect to control, in diacylglycerol (DG) levels as response to interferon treatment. Such a DG production was derived from the rapid and sequential activation of phosphoinositide specific phospholipase C and phospholipase D pathway. This suggests that a synergistic involvement of phosphatidylinositol-bis-phosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis and phosphatidylcholine (PC) breakdown provide early molecular events upon the interaction between interferon beta and its cell surface receptors. This finally leads to the slowing down of cell growth.
