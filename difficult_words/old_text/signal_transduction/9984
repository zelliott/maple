Here we show that low-dose cyclophosphamide (CY), that depends for its therapeutic effectiveness on the immunopotentiating activity of the drug for T cell-mediated tumor-eradicating immunity, is curative for approximately 80% of wild-type (WT) mice bearing a large s.c. MOPC-315 tumor, but only for approximately 10% of IFN-alpha/betaR-/- mice bearing a large s.c. MOPC-315 tumor. Histopathological examination of the s.c. tumors of such mice on day 4 after the chemotherapy revealed that the low dose of CY led to accumulation of T lymphocytes in both the WT and the IFN-alpha/betaR-/- mice. However, in the CY treated tumor bearing WT mice the T lymphocytes were present throughout the tumor mass and in direct contact with tumor cells, but in the CY treated tumor bearing IFN-alpha/betaR-/- mice most of the T lymphocytes remained in blood vessels. In addition to being important for CY-induced transendothelial migration of T lymphocytes into the tumor mass, we show here that signaling via the IFN-alpha/betaR is also important for CY-induced control of metastatic tumor progression in the spleen and liver of the tumor bearing mice. Finally, CY cured tumor bearing WT mice were resistant to a subsequent challenge with MOPC-315 tumor cells, but the few CY cured tumor bearing IFN-alpha/betaR-/- mice were not. Thus, signaling via the IFN-alpha/betaR on host cells in MOPC-315 tumor bearers is important for CY-induced: (a) transendothelial migration of T lymphocytes into the tumor mass and the eradication of the primary tumor, (b) control of metastatic tumor progression, and (c) resistance to a subsequent tumor challenge.
