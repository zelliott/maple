In an effort to examine signaling pathway of inflammation of the mouse liver caused by intragastric administration of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (NPs), we assessed Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2), TLR-4, IκB kinase (IKK-α, IKK-β), IκB nucleic factor-κB (NF-κB), NF-κBP52, NF-κBP65, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), NF-κB-inducible kinase (NIK), interleukin-2 (IL-2), biochemical parameters of liver functions, and histopathological changes and liver ultrastructure in the TiO(2) NPs-treated mice. The results showed the titanium accumulation in liver, histopathological changes and hepatocytes apoptosis of mice liver, and the liver function damaged by TiO(2) NPs. The real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses showed that TiO(2) NPs can significantly increase the mRNA and protein expression of TLR2 and TLR4 and several inflammatory cytokines, including IKK1, IKK2, NF-κB, NF-κBP52, NF-κBP65, TNF-α, and NIK, and TiO(2) NPs can significantly decrease the mRNA and protein expression of IκB and IL-2. The results of this study added to our understanding of TiO(2) NPs-induced liver toxicity. It implied that the signaling pathway of liver injury in the TiO(2) NPs-stimulated mouse liver sequentially might occur via activation of TLRs→NIK→IκB kinase→NF-κB→TNF-α→inflammation→apoptosis→liver injury.
