Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation has strong biological effects and modulates the expression of many genes. The major biological pathways affected by UVB radiation remain controversial. In this work, we used a loop-design microarray approach and applied rigorous statistical analyses to identify differentially regulated genes at 4, 8, 16 or 24 h after UVB irradiation. The most prominent biological categories in lists of differentially regulated gene sets were extracted by functional enrichment analysis. With this approach, we determined that genes participating in two prime cellular processes, the ribosome pathway and the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, were persistently activated after UVB irradiation. Mitochondrial activity assays confirmed increased activity for up to 24 h after UVB irradiation. These results suggest that the persistent activation of ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways may have a key role in UVB-radiation-induced cellular responses. For the first time, the specific cellular pathways that respond to UVB radiation consistently and persistently can be delineated with confidence using a loop-design microarray approach and functional bioinformatics analysis. The results of this study offer further insight into UVB-radiation-induced stress responses.
