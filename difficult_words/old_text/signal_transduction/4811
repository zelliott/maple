Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is a fundamental pathway for the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, migration, and metabolism in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. In recent years information provided by genetically modified mouse models has revealed that PI3K signaling plays vital roles in oogenesis, folliculogenesis, ovulation, and carcinogenesis in mouse ovary. In this review, we summarize (1) the physiological function of intra-oocyte PI3K signaling in regulation of primordial follicle survival and activation; (2) intra-granulosa cell PI3K signaling in regulation of cyclic follicular recruitment and ovulation; (3) intra-oocyte PI3K signaling in regulation of meiosis resumption and early embryogenesis; and also (4) the pathological function of PI3K signaling in ovarian diseases such as premature ovarian failure, granulosa cell tumors, and ovarian surface epithelium carcinomas. This updated info hopefully will lead to a better understanding of the human ovary and provide potential therapies for treating human infertility.
