Several proteins that catalyze phosphoryl transfer reactions involving phosphohistidine residues have recently been structurally characterized. The architecture of two histidine kinases defines a new protein kinase fold. The diverse folds of several phosphotransfer proteins appear to be designed to foster protein-protein interactions between transfer partners.
