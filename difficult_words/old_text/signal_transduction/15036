Over the past two decades, basic research has revealed a complex network of regulatory mechanisms that control the ERK1/2-signaling cascade. ERK1/2 mediate cardiac hypertrophy, a major risk factor for the development of arrhythmias, heart failure and sudden death, but also beneficial effects, e.g. protection of the heart from cell death and ischemic injury. Selective targeting of these ambiguous ERK functions could provide a powerful tool in the treatment of cardiac disease. This short review will discuss new mechanistic insights into ERK1/2-dependent development of cardiac hypertrophy and the prospect to translate this knowledge into future therapeutic strategies.
