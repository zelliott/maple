The expression of the BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein in primitive hematopoietic cells results in chronic myeloid leukemia. Over the past decade studies of several in vitro and in vivo cell systems revealed multiple signal transduction pathways activated by BCR-ABL. However, the precise function of BCR-ABL in the pathogenesis of CML is still unclear. The goal of this review is to synthesize data on intracellular signaling in the context of the diverse murine assay systems employed. We emphasize the importance of in vivo assays and assays using primary cells in understanding the biology of CML and the molecular mechanisms by which BCR-ABL exerts its effects.
