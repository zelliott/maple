We aimed to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) on free fatty acids (FFAs)-induced peripheral insulin resistance in vivo. Overnight-fasted Wistar rats were subjected to 48-h intravenous infusion of either saline or Intralipid plus heparin (IH) with or without different doses of EGCG co-injection. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was performed in awake rats to assess peripheral insulin sensitivity. Co-injection with EGCG significantly prevented FFAs-induced peripheral insulin resistance, decreased plasma markers of oxidative stress: malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-isoprostaglandin, and increased antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutases (SOD) and Glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Furthermore, EGCG treatment reversed IH-induced: (1) decrease in Thr172 phosphorylation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK); (2) increase in protein kinase Cθ(PKCθ) membrane translocation and Ser307 phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1); (3) decrease in Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt and Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Our data suggest that EGCG treatment ameliorated FFAs-induced peripheral insulin resistance in vivo, and this might be through decreasing oxidative stress and PKCθ membrane translocation, activating the AMPK pathway and improving insulin signaling pathway in vivo. This study suggests the therapeutic value of EGCG in protecting from insulin resistance caused by elevated FFAs.
