Mouse naked cuticle 2 (mNkd2), the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene naked cuticle (nkd), encodes an EF hand protein that regulates early Wg activity by acting as an inducible antagonist. The transcription factor, Hoxc8, a member of the homeobox gene family, is vital for growth and differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and a reporter assay demonstrated that endogenous Hoxc8 protein binds directly to the enhancer region of the mNkd2 gene, implying a Hoxc8-dependent transcriptional activity. Introduction of exogenous Hoxc8 into NIH3T3 cell lines lacking wild-type Hoxc8 dramatically reduced expression of mNkd2 mRNA. If, as the results suggest, mNkd2 is a direct target of Hoxc8, it represents a novel mechanism by which Hoxc8 might cross-talk with the Wnt signaling pathway by regulating mNkd2.
