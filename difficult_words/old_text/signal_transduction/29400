TRB3 is a pseudokinase whose expression is regulated during stress response and changing of nutrient status. TRB3 negatively regulates Akt activation and noticeably, TRB3 expression is induced by insulin. Here, we sought to determine the dynamic relationship between TRB3 expression and Akt activation. We find that insulin induces TRB3 expression in cell type dependent manner such that in hepatic cells and adipocytes but not Beta cells and muscle cells. In Fao hepatoma cells, induction of TRB3 expression by insulin restrains Akt activation and renders Akt refractory to further activation. In addition, we have also analyzed the roles of PI3K and its downstream kinases Akt and atypical PKC in TRB3 expression. Induction of TRB3 expression by insulin requires PI3K. However, inactivation of Akt enhances TRB3 expression whereas inhibition of PKCzeta expression impairs TRB3 expression induced by insulin. Our data demonstrated that PI3K conveys both negative and positive signals to TRB3 expression. We suggest that insulin-induced TRB3 expression functions as an indicator how multiple insulin-induced signal transduction pathways are balanced.
