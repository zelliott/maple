Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) mediates induction of cytotoxicity in various cell types. GSK-3beta has been found to participate in a number of signaling pathways, including cell proliferation and cell death. In the present study, we show that GSK-3beta is rapidly dephosphorylated and activated in response to H(2)O(2) treatment. H(2)O(2) also dephosphorylates Akt/PKB in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Overexpression of Akt/PKB attenuates H(2)O(2)-induced dephosphorylation of GSK-3beta. Ectopic expression of Dvl-1, a component of Wnt signaling, stimulates Akt/PKB and inhibits dephosphorylation of GSK-3beta by H(2)O(2). Furthermore, H(2)O(2) causes the reduction of beta-catenin level and LiCl-mediated activation of Tcf/Lef-dependent transcription activity. These findings suggest that GSK-3beta is involved in H(2)O(2)-mediated inhibition of Tcf/Lef-dependent transcriptional activity.
