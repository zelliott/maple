Prolonged cold preservation frequently causes delayed renal graft function resulting from tubular epithelial injury. Inhibition of signal transduction downstream from protein kinase C (PKC) may reduce renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and confer renal graft protection. We therefore evaluated the effect of sotrastaurin, a small-molecule inhibitor of Ca²⁺-dependent and Ca²⁺-independent PKC isoforms, in comparison with mycophenolic acid (MPA) on rat renal transplants with prolonged cold preservation.

Donor kidneys from male Lewis rats were cold stored in University of Wisconsin solution for 24 hr before syngeneic grafting. Recipients received sotrastaurin (30 mg/kg twice daily), MPA (20 mg/kg/day), or vehicle through gavage starting 1 hr after surgery. Renal function was evaluated by serum creatinine and histology on day 2 (acute injury) and day 7 (repair phase) after transplantation. Postreperfusion inflammation was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction of proinflammatory genes and histology. Signaling mechanisms were studied by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.

Sotrastaurin enhanced immediate transplant function, attenuated epithelial injury, and accelerated renal function recovery compared with MPA. Despite the stronger anti-inflammatory capacity of MPA, only sotrastaurin treatment achieved significant cellular protection with persisting reduced apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells. Decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and p66Shc adaptor protein, both involved in cellular stress and apoptosis, were likely the responsible mechanism of action.

The PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin effectively ameliorated ischemia-reperfusion organ damage and promoted cytoprotection in a clinically relevant model of extended renal cold preservation followed by transplantation. Pharmacologic targeting of PKC may be beneficial for recipients receiving renal transplants at risk for delayed graft function.
