We have previously shown that ethanol (EtOH) induces protective NF-kappaB activation in gastric surface epithelial cells. This study investigates the defense systems in rat gastric mucosal cells (RGM-1) exposed simultaneously to EtOH and taurocholate (TC) or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Simultaneous exposure to ASA and EtOH increased EtOH-induced caspase-3 activity and decreased cell viability, indicating synergetic damaging action. Simultaneous exposure to TC (5 mM) with EtOH (5%) increased EtOH-induced NF-kappaB activation, opposing EtOH-induced decrease in cell membrane integrity and in cell viability as shown by decreasing RelA expression with siRNA technique. Low doses of TC decreased the EtOH (5%) induced caspase-3 activity independently from NF-kappaB pathway and inhibited EtOH-induced decrease in caspase-3 precursor protein levels, also indicating the inhibition of caspase-3 pathway. The TC (5 mM)-induced protection in EtOH exposed tissues seems to have two distinct pathways, inhibition of apoptosis and enhancement of NF-kappaB signaling.
