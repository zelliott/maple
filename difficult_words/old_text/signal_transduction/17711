Pain is a multi-dimensional process involving the physical, emotional and perceptual integration of noxious information. The physical component is relayed via the spinal cord to several brain areas to initiate the detection of pain. The emotional aspect is encoded by the limbic system and encapsulates the relationship between pain and mood. Within the limbic system, the hypothalamus undertakes a diversity of separate and interrelated functions. Dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis has been implicated in a variety of chronic pain conditions and might also be associated with increased risk of developing mood disorders. Experimental and clinical evidence also exists to implicate the effects of other hormonal modulators in the manifestation of chronic pain. Specific targeting of hormonal cascade and effector mechanisms could provide an alternative strategy for the treatment of various chronic pain conditions.
