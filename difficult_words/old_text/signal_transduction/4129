Activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, also called protein kinase B (PKB), was investigated in human neutrophils. Stimulation of the cells with the chemoattractant fMet-Leu-Phe or the chemokines IL-8 and GROalpha leads to the rapid and transient activation of PKB. Maximum PKB activation correlates with the well documented kinetics of respiratory burst and exocytosis. Wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) in neutrophils, abrogates PKB activation. Similarly homo and heterotypic cross-linking of FcgammaIIA and FcgammaIIIB causes a transient activation of PKB that is sensitive to wortmannin treatment. Kinase activity measurements in immunoprecipitates from lysates of the myelocytic GM-1 cells or GM-1/CXCR1 cells, which are transfected with the IL-8 receptor 1, confirmed the transient activation of PKB observed in neutrophils. Stimulation of human monocytes with the CC chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) also results in the activation of PKB. Preincubation of monocytes and neutrophils with Bordetella pertussis toxin inhibits fMet-Leu-Phe and RANTES-stimulated PKB activation, demonstrating that coupling of the receptors to heterotrimeric Gi-protein is required. The data show, that activation of PKB by Gi-protein-coupled receptors is mediated by PI 3-kinase and suggest that PKB is a constituent of neutrophil activating pathways.
