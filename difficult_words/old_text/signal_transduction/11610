Chitin oligosaccharides and their derivatives are involved in developmental and defence-related signalling pathways. Major advances include the structural identification of lectins involved in development that bind chitin oligosaccharides and the links between chitin oligosaccharide and hyaluronan synthesis. Also, recent advances in the understanding of the biological role of oligosaccharides are summarised in a model for multistep glycan recognition.
