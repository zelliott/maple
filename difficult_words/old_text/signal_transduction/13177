This review focuses on the coupling specificity of the Galpha and Gbetagamma subunits of pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G(i/o) proteins that mediate diverse signaling pathways, including regulation of ion channels and other effectors. Several lines of evidence indicate that specific combinations of G protein alpha, beta and gamma subunits are required for different receptors or receptor-effector networks, and that a higher degree of specificity for Galpha and Gbetagamma is observed in intact systems than reported in vitro. The structural determinants of receptor-G protein specificity remain incompletely understood, and involve receptor-G protein interaction domains, and perhaps other scaffolding processes. By identifying G protein specificity for individual receptor signaling pathways, ligands targeted to disrupt individual pathways of a given receptor could be developed.
