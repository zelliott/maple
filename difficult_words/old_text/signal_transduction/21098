We prepared single cell clones from two ovarian carcinoma cell lines, CA-OV3 and SK-OV3, and analyzed the effect of all-trans-RA treatment on cell division, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle stage distribution of these single cell clones. Our results show that despite the well-known heterogeneous nature of these cell lines, all single cell clones of SK-OV3 cells are resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of all-trans-RA. In contrast, all single cell clones of CA-OV3 cells were growth inhibited by all-trans-RA. However, the extent of growth inhibition did vary somewhat from clone to clone. Additional studies employing flow cytometry showed that all-trans-RA blocked CA-OV3 cell cycle progression in the G1 stage. Finally, all-trans-RA was able to inhibit G1 progression in growth-arrested CA-OV3 cells following stimulation with fetal bovine serum, insulin, IGF-1, or estrogen. Since each of these growth factors is known to act via distinct signal transduction pathways, our results suggest that all-trans-RA blocks G1 progression by targeting a downstream process or event which occurs at a point after the insulin/IGF-1, estrogen, and serum signal transduction pathways converge.
