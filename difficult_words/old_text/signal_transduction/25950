RC-RNase exerts anti-cancer effects on many tumors. However, the mechanisms by which RC-RNase induces cytotoxicity in different tumor cells are unclear. Currently, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and negative breast tumors are treated with RC-RNase. Our data demonstrate that RC-RNase induces cell death on ER-positive but not on ER-negative breast tumors. This study also shows that down-regulation of ER and Bcl-2 is found on RC-RNase-treated ER-positive breast tumors. Additionally, Bcl-2 overxpression can prevent ER-positive breast tumors from cell death treated with RC-RNase. In summary, this study demonstrates that RC-RNase-induced cell death of ER-positive breast tumors is through regulation of ER and Bcl-2.
