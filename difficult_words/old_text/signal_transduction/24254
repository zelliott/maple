Neurotrophic growth factors are proteins that control neuronal differentiation and survival, and consequently play important roles in the developing and adult stages of the nervous system. Study of the genes that are regulated by these growth factors has provided insight into the proteins that are critical to the maturation of the nervous system, suggesting that select neurotrophins may play a role in the control of body homeostasis by the brain and peripheral nervous system. Our understanding of the mechanisms of action of neurotrophic growth factors has increased through experimental manipulation of cultured neurons and neuronal cell lines. In particular, the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line, which displays many properties of adrenal chromaffin cells and undergoes differentiation into sympathetic neuron-like cells when treated with nerve growth factor, has been extensively investigated to identify components of neurotrophin signaling pathways as well as the genes that they regulate. VGF was one of the first neurotrophin-regulated clones identified in NGF-treated PC12 cells. Subsequent studies indicate that the vgf gene is regulated in vivo in the nervous system by neurotrophins, by electrical activity, in response to injury or seizure, and by feeding and the circadian clock. The vgf gene encodes a polypeptide rich in paired basic amino acids; this polypeptide is differentially processed in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells and is released via the regulated secretory pathway. Generation and analysis of knockout mice that fail to synthesize VGF indicate that this protein plays a critical, non-redundant role in the regulation of energy homeostasis, providing a possible link between neurotrophin function in the nervous system and the peripheral control of feeding and metabolic activity. Future experiments should clarify the sites and mechanisms of action of this neurotrophin-regulated neuronal and neuroendocrine protein.
