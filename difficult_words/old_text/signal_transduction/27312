The signal activation of the target structure, mediated via receptors, could be also the source of some regulatory events. An intensive signaling brings about desensitization, sequestration and down-regulation of receptors, while in the case of absenting signal the sensitization and the up-regulation occur. Such change in the function of one receptor system could influence the function of the other one (we talk about cross-regulation). This review is focused on mechanisms of the homologous regulation (changes in the pathway activated by the appropriate type of receptor) and possible mechanisms of cross-regulation (changes in pathway activated by other type of receptor).
