As negative regulators of receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signalling, Sprouty proteins fulfil important roles during carcinogenesis. In this report, we demonstrate that Sprouty2 protein expression inhibits cell proliferation and migration in osteosarcoma-derived cells. Although earlier reports describe a tumour-promoting function, these results indicate that Sprouty proteins also have the potential to function as tumour suppressors in sarcoma. In contrast to Sprouty2, Sprouty4 expression failed to interfere with proliferation and migration of the osteosarcoma-derived cells, possibly due to a less pronounced interference with mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Sequences within the NH2-terminus are responsible for the specific inhibitory function of Sprouty2 protein.
