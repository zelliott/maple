Modulation of insulin/IGF signaling in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is the central determinant of the endocrine control of stress response, diapause, and aging. Mutations in many genes that interfere with, or are controlled by, insulin signaling have been identified in the last decade by genetic analyses in the worm. Most of these genes have orthologs in vertebrate genomes, and their functional characterization has provided multiple hints about conserved mechanisms for the genetic influence on aging. The emerging picture is that insulin-like molecules, through the activity of the DAF-2/insulin/ IGF-I-like receptor, and the DAF-16/FKHRL1/FOXO transcription factor, control the ability of the organism to deal with oxidative stress, and interfere with metabolic programs that help to determine lifespan.
