Podocalyxin/Gp135 was recently demonstrated to participate in the formation of a preapical complex to set up initial polarity in MDCK cells, a function presumably depending on the apical targeting of Gp135. We show that correct apical sorting of Gp135 depends on a bipartite signal composed of an extracellular O-glycosylation-rich region and the intracellular PDZ domain-binding motif. The function of this PDZ-binding motif could be substituted with a fusion construct of Gp135 with Ezrin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50). In accordance with this observation, EBP50 binds to newly synthesized Gp135 at the Golgi apparatus and facilitates oligomerization and sorting of Gp135 into a clustering complex. A defective connection between Gp135 and EBP50 or EBP50 knockdown results in a delayed exit from the detergent-resistant microdomain, failure of oligomerization, and basolateral missorting of Gp135. Furthermore, the basolaterally missorted EBP50-binding defective mutant of Gp135 was rapidly retrieved via a PKC-dependent mechanism. According to these findings, we propose a model by which a highly negative charged transmembrane protein could be packed into an apical sorting platform with the aid of its cytoplasmic partner EBP50.
