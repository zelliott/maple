Pore-forming compounds are attracting much attention due to the signal transduction ability for the development of highly sensitive biosensing. In this review, we describe an overview of the recent advances made by our group in the design of molecular sensing interfaces of spherical and planar lipid bilayers and natural bilayers. The potential uses of pore-forming compounds, such as gramicidin and MCM-41, in lipid bilayers and natural glutamate receptor channels in biomembrane are presented.
