The protective effects of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) conditions have been well documented. Here, we investigated whether an effect of HDL on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression and signalling may contribute to its endothelial-protective effects and to improved survival in a mouse model of LPS-induced inflammation and lethality. HDL cholesterol increased 1.7-fold (p<0.005) and lung endothelial TLR4 expression decreased 8.4-fold (p<0.005) 2 weeks after apolipoprotein (apo) A-I gene transfer. Following LPS administration in apo A-I gene transfer mice, lung TLR4 and lung MyD88 mRNA expression, reflecting TLR4 signalling, were 3.0-fold (p<0.05) and 2.1-fold (p<0.05) lower, respectively, than in LPS control mice. Concomitantly, LPS-induced lung neutrophil infiltration, lung oedema and mortality were significantly attenuated following apo A-I transfer. In vitro, supplementation of HDL or apo A-I to human microvascular endothelial cells-1 24 h before LPS administration reduced TLR4 expression, as assessed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting, and decreased the LPS-induced MyD88 mRNA expression and NF-ÎºB activity, independently of LPS binding. In conclusion, HDL reduces TLR4 expression and signalling in endothelial cells, which may contribute significantly to the protective effects of HDL in LPS-induced inflammation and lethality.
