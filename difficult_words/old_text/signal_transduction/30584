Generations of nitric oxide through inducible nitric oxide synthase and prostaglandins through cyclooxygenase-2 are necessary for stimulation of bone formation upon skeletal reloading. Disruption of the p53 gene results in preserved bone mass and bone formation after skeletal unloading. Chronic skeletal loading promotes osteoblastic differentiation and suppresses adipogenic differentiation in association with facilitation of the signal through parathyroid hormone receptor.
