Increased expression of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (MET) is associated with high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma and metastasis. However, the mechanism through which MET signaling contributes to prostate cancer (CaP) metastasis remains unclear.

Human PC-3 CaP cells and in vivo selected, isogeneic variant cells of increasing metastatic potential (PC-3M, PC-3M-Pro4, and PC-3M-LN4) were used to investigate the effect of HGF on CaP cell growth, protease production, and invasion. Cell-free urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) expression and function following HGF treatment were analyzed by Western blot, ELISA, and casein/plasminogen zymography. In vitro invasion stimulated by HGF was measured using Matrigel-coated invasion chambers.

Both mRNA and functional protein for MET were detected in each of the CaP cell lines. HGF treatment (0-40 ng/ml) weakly increase proliferation, however, HGF induced soluble u-PA protein and activity 3-fold in the metastatic variant cells. HGF significantly stimulated the invasion of highly metastatic PC-3M-LN4 cells through Matrigel and treatment with specific urokinase receptor inhibitors diminished the HGF-stimulated invasion in a dose-dependent manner.

These results demonstrate the biological significance of u-PA up-regulation in response to HGF in highly metastatic hormone refractory CaP cells.
