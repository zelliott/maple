Infectious agents and their hosts interact in a complex manner, involving not only superficially apparent mechanisms, but also the signaling machinery that governs host cells responses. Thus, signaling events, surface molecule expression, and transcriptional control may be affected in various cell types, with profound consequences for the function of individual cells and organ systems. Studies of the biochemistry of cell signaling and cell invasion by infectious agents have begun to detail the interplay between elements of infectious organisms and the host at the molecular level. Consequently, the resulting interferences with lymphocyte signaling may disturb the function of the immune system. In B cells, alterations of immune receptor signaling has implications for human diseases. By affecting the mechanisms of the host's immune defense, this may not only lead to inadequate elimination of an infectious agent, but also to autoimmunity or neoplasia.
