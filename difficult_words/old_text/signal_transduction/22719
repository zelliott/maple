The floor plate cells, located at the ventral midline of the neural tube, secrete diffusible factors such as sonic hedgehog (shh) and netrin-1. It is known that shh induces motor neurons at the basal plate, and that netrin-1 contributes to axon pathfinding of spinal commissural neurons located at the dorsal spinal cord. This review focuses on and discusses the roles of signaling molecules expressed at the floor plate, the rostral diencephalic ventral midline cells, and their underlying tissues; the notochord and the prechordal mesoderm in the induction and differentiation of ventral neurons, and in the guidance of commissural axons.
