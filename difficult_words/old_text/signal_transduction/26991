In normal rat kidney cells protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) play a role in attaining density-dependent growth arrest after stimulation with mitogens. The PTPase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate prevents density-dependent growth inhibition of EGF-treated cells and mimicks in that respect the action of TGF beta and retinoic acid. However, enhanced PTPase activity is not obligatory for maintaining cells in a density-arrested state. In contrast to TGF beta and retinoic acid, vanadate is unable to restimulate density-inhibited cells, indicating that different mechanisms are operating. Yet, vanadate is strongly potentiating the effect of low concentrations of TGF beta but not of retinoic acid, implicating that tyrosine phosphorylation is linked to TGF beta action and that PTPase may represent a negative control element in the TGF beta signaling pathway.
