Hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT), the enzyme which catalyzes the final step of melatonin biosynthesis, constitutes a marker of the functional differentiation of pineal cells. In addition, a day/night rhythm of HIOMT mRNA concentration, previously described in the chicken pineal gland [6], would suggest that HIOMT gene transcription is one output of the circadian system that controls pineal function. The study sought to monitor the developmental expression of HIOMT mRNA in the chick pineal gland and to investigate a possible role of instructive signals in this differentiation process. RT-PCR analysis indicated that HIOMT mRNA is expressed at embryonic day 8 (E8). At E12, HIOMT mRNA became detectable on northern blots and traces of HIOMT activity could be measured. HIOMT mRNA concentration increased 100-fold between E14 and day 10 post-hatch, then levelled off. A day/night rhythm of HIOMT mRNA concentration was readily observed in the pineal gland of 2-day-old chicks. Pineal glands isolated on minimum culture medium at E11 stopped developing HIOMT gene expression. However, the addition of serum to the culture medium restored HIOMT mRNA concentration to the levels observed in vivo. The data suggest that the functional differentiation of melatoninergic cells observed during the second week of embryonic life may be controlled [correction of controled] by serum factors.
