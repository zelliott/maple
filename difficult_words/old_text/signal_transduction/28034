Intestinal response to injury requires coordinated regulation of the tension exerted by subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEM). However, the signals governing relaxation of intestinal SEM have not been investigated. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that signal transduction pathways initiated by C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) induce intestinal SEM relaxation. We directly quantified the effects of CNP on isometric tension exerted by cultured human colonic SEM. We also measured the effects of CNP on cGMP content, myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. CNP induced relaxation of SEM within 10 s. By 10 min, relaxation reached a plateau that was sustained for 2 h. CNP-induced relaxation was saturable, with a maximal decrease in tension (51.7 +/- 3.8 dyn) observed at 250 nM. SEM relaxation in response to CNP constituted approximately 23% of total basal tension. CNP increased intracellular cGMP content and reduced MLC phosphorylation. Effects of CNP on cGMP and MLC exhibited the same dose dependence as CNP-induced relaxation. MLC phosphorylation decreased within 2 min of CNP exposure and was sustained for at least 45 min. CNP also stimulated a large transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that occurred within 30 s and was nearly complete by 1 min. We also observed that calyculin-A, a potent inhibitor of MLC phosphatase, completely abolished the reduction in MLC phosphorylation induced by CNP. These results suggest that CNP induces intestinal SEM relaxation through cGMP-associated reductions in MLC phosphorylation. Moreover, these findings raise the possibility that CNP plays a role in intestinal wound healing.
