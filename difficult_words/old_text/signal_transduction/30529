Intracellular signaling initiated by ligation of the TCR influences cell fate at multiple points during the lifespan of a T cell. This is especially evident during thymic selection, where the nature of TCR-dependent signaling helps to establish a MHC-restricted, self-tolerant T cell repertoire. The Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte-specific phosphoprotein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) adaptor protein is a required intermediate in multiple signaling pathways triggered by TCR engagement, several of which have been implicated in dictating the outcome of thymic selection (e.g., intracellular calcium flux and activation of ERK family MAPKs). To determine if thymocyte maturation and selection at later stages of development are sensitive to perturbations in SLP-76 levels, we analyzed these crucial events using several transgenic (Tg) lines of mice expressing altered levels of SLP-76 in the thymus. In Tg mice expressing low levels of SLP-76 in preselection thymocytes, the CD4:CD8 ratio in the thymus and spleen was skewed in a manner consistent with impaired selection and/or maturation of CD4+ thymocytes. Low SLP-76 expression also correlated with reduced CD5 expression on immature thymocytes, consistent with reduced TCR signaling potential. In contrast, reconstitution of SLP-76 at higher levels resulted in normal thymic CD5 expression and CD4:CD8 ratios in the thymus and periphery. It is curious that thymic deletion of TCR-Tg (HY) thymocytes was markedly impaired in both lines of Tg-reconstituted SLP-76-/- mice. Studies using chimeric mice indicate that the defect in deletion of HY+ thymocytes is intrinsic to the developing thymocyte, suggesting that maintenance of sufficient SLP-76 expression from the endogenous locus is a key element in the selection process.
