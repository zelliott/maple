Recent research has demonstrated that aberrant sphingolipid signaling is             an important mechanism of chemoresistance in solid tumors. Sphingosine kinase             (Sphk), the primary enzyme metabolizing the sphingolipid ceramide into sphingosine-1-phosphate             (S1P), is a primary mediator of breast cancer promotion, survival and chemoresistance.             However, to date the mechanism of Sphk-mediated drug resistance is poorly understood.             Using the dual sphingosine kinase isozyme inhibitor, SKI-II (4-[4-(4-chloro-phenyl)-thiazol-2-ylamino]-phenol),             we explored the effects of sphingosine kinase inhibition on multi-drug-resistant             breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that SKI-II alters endogenous sphingolipid             signaling and decreases cancer proliferation, survival and viability. Furthermore,             pharmacological inhibition of Sphk1/2 induced intrinsic apoptosis in these cells             through modulation of the NF-κB pathway. SKI-II decreases NF-κB transcriptional             activity through altered phosphorylation of the p65 subunit. Taken together, these             results suggest that Sphk may be a promising therapeutic target in chemoresistant             cancers.
