Paget's disease is a chronic disorder of bone remodeling, characterized by an abnormal increase of osteoclast and, hence, osteoblast activity. The imbalance of bone turnover results in the formation of unhealthy and fragile bone. It also leads to impairment of adjacent joints and to a risk of various complications. Current research focuses on the elucidation of the etiologic role viral infection and predisposing genetic factors. Paget's disease is commonly discovered by chance; its suspicion is raised either by high level of alkaline phosphatase or by the X-ray of the pathological bone. Bisphosphonates have proven to be effective in controlling disease activity because they inhibit osteoclast function. Their use is recommended when bone-derived serum alkaline phosphatase is high and/or when disease localizations are highly suspected for the development of complications.
