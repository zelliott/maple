The involvement of ceramide in lipopolysaccharide-mediated activation of mouse macrophages was studied. Lipopolysaccharide, cell-permeable ceramide analogs, and bacterial sphingomyelinase led to phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, and p38 kinase and induced AP-1 DNA binding in C3H/OuJ (Lpsn) but not in C3H/HeJ (Lpsd) macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide and ceramide mimetics showed distinct kinetics of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and AP-1 induction and activated AP-1 complexes with different subunit compositions. Lipopolysaccharide-activated AP-1 consisted of c-Fos, Jun-B, Jun-D, and c-Jun, while C2-ceramide induced Jun-D and c-Jun only. Lipopolysaccharide and, less potently, C2-ceramide or sphingomyelinase, stimulated AP-1-dependent reporter gene transcription in RAW 264.7 cells. Unlike lipopolysaccharide, C2-ceramide failed to activate NF-kappaB and did not induce production of tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-6. The lipopolysaccharide antagonist, Rhodobacter sphae-roides diphosphoryl lipid A, inhibited lipopolysaccharide activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 but did not block C2-ceramide-induced AP-1. Pretreatment of C3H/OuJ macrophages with C2-ceramide greatly diminished AP-1 induction following subsequent C2-ceramide stimulation. However, lipopolysaccharide-induced transcription factor activation and cytokine release were not influenced. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide pretreatment inhibited both lipopolysaccharide- and C2-ceramide-mediated responses. Thus, ceramide partially mimics lipopolysaccharide in activating the mitogen-activated protein kinases and AP-1 but not in mediating NF-kappaB induction or cytokine production, suggesting a limited role in lipopolysaccharide signaling.
