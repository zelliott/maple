Environmental stress (e.g. aniso-osmolarity and UV light), hypoxia/reoxygenation, and reactive oxygen species activate intracellular signaling cascades such as the "stress-responsive" mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor kappaB. We have recently shown that the Janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway is ligand-independently activated by hyperosmotic shock. In the present study, we show that besides STAT1 also the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 became tyrosine-phosphorylated upon hyperosmolarity. SB 202190 and SB 203580 (specific inhibitors of p38) inhibited both STAT activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 induced by hyperosmotic stress. Overexpression of wild-type p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and its upstream activator mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 (MKK6) resulted in an enhanced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation upon osmotic shock. Accordingly, overexpression of dominant negative mutants of p38 and MKK6 largely decreased hyperosmotic STAT1 activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinase different from Jak1 is involved in stress-activation of STAT1 and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2. These results strongly suggest that hyperosmotic shock activates STAT1 and SHP2 via p38 and its upstream activator MKK6.
