Dectin-1 is an innate immune pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that, through its ability to bind Î²-glucans, is involved in the recognition of several pathogenic fungi. Dectin-1 can stimulate a variety of cellular responses via the Syk/CARD9 signalling pathway, including phagocytosis, cytokine production and the respiratory burst. Several advances in our understanding of Dectin-1 immunobiology have been made in recent years, including characterisation of additional signalling pathways and demonstration of its ability to directly induce the development of adaptive immunity. However, the physiological role of many of the functions of this receptor is still unclear. This review aims to provide an update on Dectin-1 and its role within antifungal immune responses, focussing on progress made in the last two years.
