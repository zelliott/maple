The Nef protein of the human immunodeficiency virus is as important for disease progression as it is perplexing in its number of target molecules and functions. In this chapter I will try to give an overview on the numerous functions of HIV from a molecular as well as functional point of view. Due to space restriction and for the sake of clarity I will not describe or list all the effects reported in the literature but rather concentrate on the most important aspects of Nef function.
