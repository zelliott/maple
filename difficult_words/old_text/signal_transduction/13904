To identify expression of Notch signaling proteins and its ligands in human cumulus cells which were obtained by follicle aspiration and to compare the differences of this protein expression between the normal and poor responder patients.

47 patients who applied to the assisted reproductive treatments with various infertility problems were included to the study. Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation was performed by using GnRH agonist and gonadotropins. Serum hormon levels were measured by using Chemilluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay method for each patient. After ultrasonographic ovarian follicle screening, oocytes were retrievaled. Cumulus cells obtained from the follicles were cultured for 72 h and immunuhistochemistry were performed for Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Notch4, Jagged1 and Jagged2 proteins. Histological score (HSCORE) were applied to all of the samples. The association between Notch and its ligands protein expressions and the oocyte-embryo quality and fertilization rates were investigated.

Significant differences were observed between the mean values of age, AMH and FSH in the 2 groups, respectively (p < 0.05). However, the mean female infertility duration and total gonadotropin dose did not differ significantly between normal and poor responder groups. All the patients cumulus cells expressed Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Notch4, Jagged1 and Jagged2. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) only for Notch2 between the 2 groups and a positive correlation between Notch2 and Notch3 (r = 547, p = 0.00) expressions were noted. Furthermore, no correlations were observed between the following: Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Notch4, Jagged1, and Jagged2 expression; mature oocyte number; fertilization rates, and embryo quality percentage in both of the groups.

Notch signalling proteins can be an indicator for understanding the ovarian response in ovulation induction.
