Cytokine-mediated signaling pathways were studied in mouse dendritic cells (DC) by analysis of the activation pattern of STAT factors. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to detect STAT isoform-specific complexes. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) simultaneously induced complexes containing STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B and STAT6. In non-DC, a similar broad activation pattern of STAT factors by GM-CSF or other cytokines has not been observed so far. By comparison, in peritoneal macrophages, GM-CSF induced a complex with the properties of a truncated form of STAT5. Other cytokines tested on DC either failed to induce STAT factors [interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-15], or activated the same STAT factors as observed in peritoneal macrophages (IL-4, IFN-gamma). Our results implicate a specific effect of GM-CSF on STAT signaling in DC which might account for the cell type-specific effect of this cytokine on development and function.
