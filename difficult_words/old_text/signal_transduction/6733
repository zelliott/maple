Myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) can induce altered expression of microRNAs (miRNAs). The miRNAs-miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-16 have been shown to play a role in apoptosis, although not in cardiac-related models. We investigated the roles of miR-15b in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction results showed that the expression of miR-15a and miR-15b were up-regulated in Sprague-Dawley rat hearts subjected to I/R. Expression levels of miR-15b increased more than four fold above basal levels. Similar results were obtained for cardiomyocytes exposed to H/R. Recombinant adenoviral vectors were generated to explore the functional role of miR-15b in cultured cardiomyocytes exposed to H/R. Overexpression of miR-15b enhanced cell apoptosis and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, as determined by flow cytometric analysis. Conversely, down-regulated expression was cytoprotective. The effects of miR-15b can by mimicked by Bcl-2 short-interfering RNAs. The inhibition of miR-15b increased expression levels of the Bcl-2 protein without affecting Bcl-2 mRNA levels, suppressed the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytosol and decreased the activities of caspase-3 and 9. It is possible that miR-15b is the upstream regulator of a mitochondrial signaling pathway for H/R induced apoptosis.
