The thesis is presented that molecular receptor physical chemistry offers an interesting model for the design of biosensors with respect to chemical recognition and transduction. In order to appreciate the desirable features of this system and the inherent difficulties, the structures and binding state energetics of molecular receptors are considered via a direct comparison with enzyme chemistry. Detailed analyses of the candidate species nicotinic and beta-adrenergic receptors are provided to illustrate the complexity of molecular receptor binding properties. A revised ternary-complex model, which combines enzymatic and receptor energetics, is proposed to explain the free-energy changes which drive ligand-binding reactions of coupled systems. Throughout this discussion the relevance of the various arguments to applications in biosensor development is highlighted. Finally, a brief appraisal of attempts to produce devices ready for marriage to molecular receptor material is presented.
