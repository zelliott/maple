Cells experiencing lowered O(2) levels (hypoxia) undergo a variety of biological responses in order to adapt to these unfavorable conditions. The master switch, orchestrating the cellular response to low O(2) levels, is the transcription factor, termed hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). The alpha subunits of HIF are regulated by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases that, in the presence of O(2), hydroxylate specific prolyl and asparaginyl residues of HIF-alpha, inducing its proteasome-dependent degradation and repression of transcriptional activity, respectively. Hypoxia inhibits oxygenases, stabilized HIF-alpha translocates to the nucleus, dimerizes with HIF-beta, recruits the coactivators p300/CBP, and induces expression of its transcriptional targets via binding to hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs). HREs are composite regulatory elements, comprising a conserved HIF-binding sequence and a highly variable flanking sequence that modulates the transcriptional response. In summary, the transcriptional response of a cell is the end product of two major functions. The first (trans-acting) is the level of activation of the HIF pathway that depends on regulation of stability and transcriptional activity of the HIF-alpha. The second (cis-acting) comprises the characteristics of endogenous HREs that are determined by the availability of transcription factors cooperating with HIF and/or individual HIF-alpha isoforms.
