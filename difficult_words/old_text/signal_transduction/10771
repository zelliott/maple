We used the patch-clamp technique to study the effect of arachidonic acid (AA) on epithelial Na channels (ENaC) in the rat cortical collecting duct (CCD). Application of 10 microM AA decreased the ENaC activity defined by NPo from 1.0 to 0.1. The dose-response curve of the AA effect on ENaC shows that 2 microM AA inhibited the ENaC activity by 50%. The effect of AA on ENaC is specific because neither 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), a nonmetabolized analogue of AA, nor 11,14,17-eicosatrienoic acid mimicked the inhibitory effect of AA on ENaC. Moreover, inhibition of either cyclooxygenase (COX) with indomethacin or cytochrome P450 (CYP) omega-hydroxylation with N-methylsulfonyl-12,12-dibromododec-11-enamide (DDMS) failed to abolish the effect of AA on ENaC. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of AA on ENaC was absent in the presence of N-methylsulfonyl-6-(propargyloxyphenyl)hexanamide (MS-PPOH), an agent that inhibits CYP-epoxygenase activity. The notion that the inhibitory effect of AA is mediated by CYP-epoxygenase-dependent metabolites is also supported by the observation that application of 200 nM 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) inhibited ENaC in the CCD. In contrast, addition of 5,6-, 8,9-, or 14,15-EET failed to decrease ENaC activity. Also, application of 11,12-EET can still reduce ENaC activity in the presence of MS-PPOH, suggesting that 11,12-EET is a mediator for the AA-induced inhibition of ENaC. Furthermore, gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis detected the presence of 11,12-EET in the CCD and CYP2C23 is expressed in the principal cells of the CCD. We conclude that AA inhibits ENaC activity in the CCD and that the effect of AA is mediated by a CYP-epoxygenase-dependent metabolite, 11,12-EET.
