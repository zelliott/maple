The past few years have brought new advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Although knowledge of the genetic basis for these conditions has not yet translated into clinically useful biomarkers, the current pace of biomedical discovery holds endless possibilities for molecular medicine to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with these conditions. This article provides a useful conceptual basis for understanding the molecular events involved in the making of Barrett metaplasia and in its neoplastic progression, and provides a rationale for evaluating studies on the application of molecular medicine to the diagnosis and management of patients with Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma.
