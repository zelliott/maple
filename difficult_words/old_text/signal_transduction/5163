The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily includes death receptor (DR) ligands, such as TNF-α, FasL, and TRAIL. Death receptors (DRs) induce intracellular signaling upon engagement of their cognate DR ligands, either leading to apoptosis, survival, or proinflammatory responses. The DR signaling is mediated by the recruitment of several death domain (DD)-containing molecules such as Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and receptor-interacting protein (RIP) 1. In this review, we describe DR signaling in mammals, and describe recent findings of DR signaling during metamorphosis in the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. Specifically, we focus on the cell fate (apoptosis or survival) mediated through a DR ligand, TNF-α or TRAIL in endothelial cells or red blood cells (RBCs). In addition, we discuss relationships between thyroid hormone-induced metamorphosis and DR signaling.
