In this issue of Neuron, Kwan et al. demonstrate that TRPA1 is critical for the transduction of noxious cold and mechanical stimuli, as well as in mediating the activation of nociceptors by endogenous and natural irritants. Differences between the present report and a previous study indicate that further study is needed to reach a consensus on the role of TRPA1 in the transduction of mechanical and noxious cold stimuli.
