The intracellular mechanisms underlying enhanced myogenic contraction (MC) in coronary resistance arteries (CRAs) from exercise-trained (EX) pigs have not been established. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that exercise-induced alterations in protein kinase C (PKC) signaling underlie enhanced MC. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether modulation of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling by PKC underlies enhanced MC in EX animals. Male Yucatan miniature swine were treadmill trained (n = 7) at approximately 75% of maximal O(2) uptake for 16 wk (6 miles/h, 60 min) or remained sedentary (SED, n = 6). Diameter measurements in response to intraluminal pressure (60, 75, and 90 cmH(2)O) or 60 mM KCl were determined in single, cannulated CRAs ( approximately 100 microm ID) with and without the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (CE, 1 microM). Confocal imaging of Ca(2+) signaling [myogenic Ca(2+) (Ca(m))] was also performed in CRAs of similar internal diameter after abluminal loading of the Ca(2+) indicator dye fluo 4 (1 microM, 37 degrees C, 30 min). We observed significantly greater MC in CRAs isolated from EX than from SED animals at 90 cmH(2)O, as well as greater reductions in MC after CE at all pressures studied. At intraluminal pressures of 75 and 90 cmH(2)O, CE produced greater decreases in Ca(m) in CRAs from EX than from SED animals (64% vs. 25%, P < 0.05). Inhibition of KCl constriction and Ca(m) by CE was also greater in EX animals (P < 0.05). Western blotting revealed significant increases in Ca(2+)-dependent PKC-alpha ( approximately 50%) but not Ca(2+)-independent PKC-epsilon levels in CRAs isolated from EX animals (P < 0.05). We also observed significant group differences in phosphorylated PKC-alpha levels. Finally, voltage-gated Ca(2+) current (VGCC) was effectively blocked by CE, bisindolylmaleimide, and staurosporine in isolated smooth muscle cells from CRAs, providing evidence for a mechanistic link between VGCCs and PKC in our experimental paradigm. These results suggest that enhanced MC in CRAs from EX animals involves PKC-dependent modulation of intracellular Ca(2+), including regulation of VGCCs.
