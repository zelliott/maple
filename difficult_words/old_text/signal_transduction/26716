We studied the effect of norepinephrine and selective Î²(1)-adrenoceptor blockers on the growth of retinal tissue explants from 10-12-day-old chicken embryos in organotypic culture. The test drugs produced a dose-dependent effect on cell proliferation. Norepinephrine (10(-12) M) and atenolol (10(-4) M) are shown to significantly stimulate explant growth. Combined treatment with norepinephrine (10(-12) M) and atenolol (10(-4) M) results in cumulation of their stimulatory effects. The results suggest that the retina-stimulating effect of norepinephrine is based on its interactions with other types of adrenoceptors.
