Perillyl alcohol (POH) inhibits isoprenylation and has shown anticancer and chemopreventive properties in rodent models. The mechanism that underlies the anticancer activity of POH and other isoprenylation inhibitors is unknown but has been postulated to involve decreased levels of isoprenylated Ras and Ras-related proteins. Previously we demonstrated that POH effectively inhibits human T cell proliferation in vitro and can prevent acute and chronic rejection in a rat cardiac transplant model. In this report, we investigate the effects of POH on T lymphocytes at the single-cell level. POH disrupts the polarized shape and motility of antigen-specific murine 1E5 T cells. Using an optical trap to position anti-CD3-coated beads in contact with 1E5 T cells, we demonstrate that POH inhibits their TCR-mediated calcium response. Furthermore, we show that POH preferentially induces apoptosis in PHA-activated human T cells as well as in 1E5 T cells.
