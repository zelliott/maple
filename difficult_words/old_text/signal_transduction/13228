CD40 ligand (CD40L)-deficient mice have been shown to have a defect in negative selection of self-reactive T cells during thymic development. However, the mechanism by which CD40L promotes deletion of autoreactive thymocytes has not yet been elucidated. We have studied negative selection in response to endogenous superantigens in CD40L-deficient mice and, consistent with previous reports, have found a defect in negative selection in these mice. To test the requirement for expression of CD40L on T cells undergoing negative selection, we have generated chimeric mice in which CD40L wild-type and CD40L-deficient thymocytes coexist. We find that both CD40L wild-type and CD40L-deficient thymocytes undergo equivalent and efficient negative selection when these populations coexist in chimeric mice. These results indicate that CD40L can function in a non-cell-autonomous manner during negative selection. Deletion of superantigen-reactive thymocytes was normal in B7-1/B7-2 double-knockout mice, indicating that CD40-CD40L-dependent negative selection is not solely mediated by B7 up-regulation and facilitation of B7-dependent T cell signaling. Finally, although the absence of CD40-CD40L interactions impairs negative selection of autoreactive CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells during thymic development, we find that self-reactive T cells are deleted in the mature CD4(+) population through a CD40L-independent pathway.
