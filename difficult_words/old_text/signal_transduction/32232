Activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and related pathways by microbial products drives inflammatory responses, host-defense pathways and adaptive immunity. The cost of excessive inflammation is cell and tissue damage, an underlying cause of many acute and chronic diseases. Coincident with activation of TLR signaling, a plethora of anti-inflammatory pathways and mechanisms begin to modulate inflammation until tissue repair is complete. Whereas most studies have focused on the signaling components immediately downstream of the TLRs, this Review summarizes the different levels of anti-inflammatory pathways that have evolved to abate TLR signaling and how they are integrated to prevent cell and tissue destruction.
