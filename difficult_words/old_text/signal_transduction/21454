Studies in transgenic and knockout mice have made a major contribution to our current understanding of the physiological functions of the NF-kappaB signalling cascade. The generation and analysis of mice with targeted modifications of individual components of the NF-kappaB pathway tremendously advanced our knowledge of the roles of the NF-kappaB proteins themselves, and also of the many activators and negative regulators of NF-kappaB. These studies have highlighted the complexity of the NF-kappaB system, by revealing the multiple interactions, redundancies, but also diverse functions, performed by the different molecules participating in the regulation of NF-kappaB signalling. Furthermore, inhibition or enforced activation of NF-kappaB in transgenic mice has uncovered the critical roles that NF-kappaB plays in the pathogenesis of various diseases such as liver failure, diabetes and cancer.
