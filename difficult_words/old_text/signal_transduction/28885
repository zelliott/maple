Present treatment of medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in children, includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In spite of radical treatment, only about 70% of patients survive. Also side effects of the treatment are severe, mostly due to applied radiotherapy.

The following review highlights potential molecular targets for pharmacotherapy of medulloblastoma, as well as the directions in which, in the authors' opinion, the field will evolve in near future.

Present literature on pathways engaged in formation of medulloblastoma is summarized in the context of their available pharmacological modulators.

The quest for a better treatment modalities includes better risk stratification methods, including molecular profiling of individual tumors and a search for new small molecules capable of inhibiting hyperactive signaling pathways. Several candidates for such agents are being tested presently.
