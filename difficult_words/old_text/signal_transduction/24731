The past decade has seen an explosive growth in our understanding of neurotransmitter receptors and the roles they play in neurotransmission. This is particularly true of the serotonin receptors where a synergy of basic science and clinical research has not only produced a deeper understanding of serotonin receptors and their actions but also resulted in the availability of new therapeutic agents useful for treating a number of psychiatric illnesses. This chapter details our current knowledge of the major subtypes of the serotonin receptor, including recent advances in the molecular biology, pharmacology, biochemistry, and clinical correlates of these receptors.
