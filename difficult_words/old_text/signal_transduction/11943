Cellular processes are regulated by signals generated by adhesion receptors and growth factor receptors. IGFbinding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) is a molecule which may affect the both signaling pathways through inactivation of IGF-I (ligand for IGF-IR) and binding to RGD region of integrin receptors. Whether this phenomenon is important in communication between insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) and β1-integrin receptor in regulation of prolidase activity and collagen biosynthesis is the aim of this study.

We studied the effects of IGFBP-1, IGF-I, thrombin (integrin activator), echistatin (disintegrin), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (LY-294002) and ERK 1/2 inhibitors (PD98059 and UO126) on prolidase activity, collagen biosynthesis and expression of proteins participating in pathways generated by these receptors.

Stimulation of β1-integrin and IGF-I receptors by standard ligands was proved to up-regulate collagen synthesis in cultured fibroblasts. IGFBP-1, similarly as echistatin and studied inhibitors, contributed to down-regulation of ERK1/2, Akt, mTOR expression and up-regulation of NFκB. It was accompanied by parallel decrease in prolidase activity and collagen biosynthesis.

The data suggest that "cross talk" between IGF-I receptor and integrin receptor may play important role in regulation of prolidase activity and collagen biosynthesis.
