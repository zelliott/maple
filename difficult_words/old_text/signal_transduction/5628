The terminal differentiation of many developing neurons occurs after they innervate their target cells and is triggered by secreted target-derived signals that are transduced by presynaptic cognate receptors. Such retrograde signaling induces the expression of genes that are often distinctive markers of neuronal phenotype and function. However, whether long-term maintenance of neuronal phenotype requires persistent retrograde signaling remains poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that retrograde bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling induces expression of a phenotypic marker of Drosophila Tv neurons, the neuropeptide FMRFamide (FMRFa). Here, we used a genetic technique that spatiotemporally targets transgene expression in Drosophila to test the role of persistent BMP signaling in the maintenance of Tv phenotype. We show that expression of dominant blockers of BMP signaling selectively in adult Tv neurons dramatically downregulated FMRFa expression. Moreover, adult-onset expression of mutant Glued, which blocks dynein/dynactin-mediated retrograde axonal transport, eliminated retrograde BMP signaling and dramatically downregulated FMRFa expression. Finally, we found that BMP deprivation did not affect Tv neuron survival and that FMRFa expression fully recovered to control levels after the termination of BMP blockade or Glued expression. Our results show that persistent retrograde BMP signaling is required to induce and to subsequently maintain the expression of a stably expressed phenotypic marker in a subset of mature Drosophila neurons. We postulate that retrograde maintenance of neuronal phenotype is conserved in vertebrates, and as a consequence, neuronal phenotype is likely vulnerable to neurodegenerative disease pathologies that disrupt neuronal connectivity or axonal transport.
