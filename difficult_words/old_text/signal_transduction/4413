A very-low-calorie conventional Japanese diet of 370 kcal/day has been shown to be useful for weight reduction and its long-term maintenance. Sources of the diet were mainly from chicken fillet, egg white, fish white-meat, mushroom, seaweed and low- or non-calorie fiber-rich vegetable, and contained 4.4g fat, 38.1g protein, 45.2g carbohydrate and essential minerals and vitamins. However, metabolic and neural implications of a commercial very-low-calorie liquid formula diet have rarely been investigated from the view point of food intake and appetite regulation. Animal studies have demonstrated the rationale for efficacy of the very-low calorie conventional Japanese diet as follows: (1) Increased hypothalamic histamine suppressed food intake through H1-receptors in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and paraventricular nucleus, the satiety centers. (2) Low energy intake enhanced satiety and decreased food intake through histaminergic activation of VMH neurons. (3) Mastication activated afferent signal transmission from proprioceptors in the oral cavity to the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus(Me5). Histaminergic systems in the hypothalamus were activated by mastication and low energy supply, which was accompanied by satiation through the action of histamine in the VMH. Usefulness of the very-low-calorie conventional Japanese diet derives from utilization of conventional Japanese food stuffs as a fiber rich, low energy food source, and from enhancement of satiation by increased mastication required of the diet. The properties of the diet seemed to effect a closed positive feedback loop between histaminergic activation in hypothalamic satiety centers and behavioral changes to enhance satiation and cause feeding suppression.
