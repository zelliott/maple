The apelin receptor was initially classed as an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, and little was known about its physiological functions until apelin, the endogenous ligand, was identified. Similarities between the structure and anatomical distribution of apelin and its receptor and that of angiotensin II and the angiotensin AT1 receptor provide clues about the physiological functions of this novel signal-transduction system. Now, roles have been established for the apelin system in lowering blood pressure, as a potent cardiac inotrope, in modulating pituitary hormone release and food and water intake, in stress activation, and as a novel adipokine that is excreted from fat cells and regulates insulin. Given its broad array of physiological roles, apelin has attracted much interest as a target for novel therapeutic research and drug design.
