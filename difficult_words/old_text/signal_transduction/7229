Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) is a tumor suppressor and negatively regulates several activation signals. Consistent with its potential anti-inflammatory activity, DAPK promotes the formation of IFN-γ-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex that suppresses the translation of selected inflammatory genes. DAPK has been found to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)- or lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Inflammation is always associated with T cell activation, while DAPK attenuates T cell activation by a selective suppression in T cell receptor-triggered NF-κB activation. Recent studies, however, also reveal a contribution of DAPK to pro-inflammatory processes. DAPK is shown to mediate pro-inflammatory signaling downstream of TNF-α, LPS, IL-17, or IL-32. In addition, DAPK is required for the full formation of NLRP3 inflammasome, essential for the generation of IL-1β and IL-18. These results suggest the complicated role of DAPK in the regulation of inflammation that is likely dependent on cell types and environmental cues.
