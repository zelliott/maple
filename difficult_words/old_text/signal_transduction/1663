Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that regulates adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis. PPARgamma agonists are potent therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. PPARgamma agonists also prevent inflammation in animal models, suggesting their use for the treatment of human inflammatory diseases. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a Th1 cell-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease model of multiple sclerosis (MS) and IL-12 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of EAE and MS. In this study we have examined the effect of PPARgamma agonists on the pathogenesis of EAE. In vivo treatment of SJL/J mice with PPARgamma agonists, 15-deoxydelta(12,14) prostaglandin J2 or Ciglitazone, decreased the duration and clinical severity of active immunization and adoptive transfer models of EAE. PPARgamma agonists inhibited EAE in association with a decrease in IL-12 production and differentiation of neural antigen-specific Th1 cells. In vitro treatment of activated T cells with PPARgamma agonists inhibited IL-12-induced activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway and Th1 differentiation. These findings highlight the fact that PPARgamma agonists regulate central nervous system inflammation and demyelination by inhibiting IL-12 production, IL-12 signaling and Th1 differentiation in EAE.
