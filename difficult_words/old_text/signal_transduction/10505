Most rapid excitatory synaptic signaling in the brain is mediated by postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) that are gated open by the neurotransmitter glutamate. In Caenorhabditis elegans, sol-1 encodes a CUB-domain transmembrane protein that is required for currents that are mediated by the GLR-1 iGluR. Mutations in sol-1 do not affect GLR-1 expression, localization, membrane insertion, or stabilization at synapses, suggesting that SOL-1 is required for iGluR function. Here, we provide evidence that SOL-1 is an auxiliary subunit that modulates the gating of GLR-1 receptors. We show that mutant variants of GLR-1 with altered gating partially restore glutamate-gated current and GLR-1-dependent behaviors in sol-1 mutants. Domain analysis of SOL-1 indicates that extracellular CUB domain 3 is required for function and that a secreted variant partially restores glutamate-gated currents and behavior. Also, we show that endogenous glutamatergic synaptic currents are absent in sol-1 mutants. Our data suggest that GLR-1 iGluRs are not simply stand-alone molecules and require the SOL-1 auxiliary protein to promote the open state of the receptor. Our analysis presents the possibility that glutamatergic signaling in other organisms may be similarly modified by SOL-1-like transmembrane proteins.
