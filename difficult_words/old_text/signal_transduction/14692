We investigated the effects of advanced glycation end products (AGE) which accumulate in articular cartilage with age in human osteoarthritic chondrocytes. We found AGE-BSA significantly increased MMP-1, -3, and -13, and TNF-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. AGE-BSA-stimulated JNK, p38, and ERK and NF-kappaB activity. The stimulatory effect of AGE-BSA on MMP-1, -3, and -13 were reversed by treatment with specific JNK, p38 inhibitors, suggesting JNK and p38 are involved in AGE-BSA-induced MMPs and TNF-alpha. We also observed that NF-kappaB is involved in AGE-BSA-induced TNF-alpha. Pretreatment with soluble receptor for AGE (sRAGE) also reduced AGE-stimulated MMPs and TNF-alpha, implicating the involvement of receptor for AGE (RAGE). In conclusion, accumulation of AGE may have a role in the development of osteoarthritis by increasing MMP-1, -3, and -13, and TNF-alpha.
