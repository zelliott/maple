G protein-coupled receptors are membrane receptors that are involved in most of the physiological processes. The large variety of their functions arises from both the number of receptors and the formation of dimers or oligomers having specific properties. The precise consequences of the oligomerization are not well understood yet but it has been proposed to affect the protein trafficking, the ligand binding and the signaling. In this review, we explore the functional consequences of receptor dimers and oligomers using as a model the GABA(B) receptor, which is activated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.
