The signal for chemotaxis in D. discoideum is cyclic AMP. This molecule binds to cell surface receptors and triggers the production of inositol (1,4,5)trisphosphate which releases Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial stores. The subsequent chain of signal transduction events brings about the polymerization of cytoskeletal actin (associated with pseudopodium formation) within five seconds and the formation of a peak of cyclic GMP within 10 s. Evidence from streamer F mutants indicates that the cyclic GMP regulates the association of myosin with the cytoskeleton that occurs at 25-50 s and that this phenomenon is concerned with elongation of the amoebae during chemotactic movement.
