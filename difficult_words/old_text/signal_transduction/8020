The mechanism and role of apoptotic cell death in the pathogenesis of atheromatous diseases is an area of intense research. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease and as such, immune-mediated cell killing plays an important role. Recent studies have suggested that Granzyme B and perforin play an important role in atherogenesis. The current manuscript reviews our current understanding pertaining to the role of Granzyme B in cardiac allograft vasculopathy and atherosclerosis.
