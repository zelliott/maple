Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a hallmark clinical symptom of asthma. At least two components of AHR have been identified: 1) baseline AHR, which is persistent and presumably caused by airway remodelling due to chronic recurrent airway inflammation; and 2) acute and variable AHR, which is associated with an episodic increase in airway inflammation due to environmental factors such as allergen exposure. Despite intensive research, the mechanisms underlying acute and chronic AHR are poorly understood. Owing to the complex variety of interactive processes that may be involved, in vitro model systems and animal models are indispensable to the unravelling of these mechanisms at the cellular and molecular level. The present paper focuses on a number of translational studies addressing the emerging central role of the airway smooth muscle cell, as a multicompetent cell involved in acute airway constriction as well as structural changes in the airways, in the pathophysiology of airway hyperresponsiveness.
