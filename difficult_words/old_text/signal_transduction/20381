We investigate the role of β-catenin signaling in the response of macrophage to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using RAW264.7 cells. LPS rapidly stimulated cytosolic β-catenin accumulation. β-catenin-mediated transcription was showed to be required for LPS induced gene expression and cell migration. Mechanically, ERK activation-primed GSK3β inactivation by Akt was demonstrated to mediate the LPS induced β-catenin accumulation. Overall, our findings suggest that suppression of GSK3β by ERK stimulates β-catenin signaling therefore contributes to LPS induced cell migration in macrophage activation.
