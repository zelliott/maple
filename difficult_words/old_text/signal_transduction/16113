In this study, the signaling mechanism of the polysaccharides isolated from fruiting body of Cordyceps militaris (CM) was investigated in macrophages to evaluate its immuno-stimulating properties. We found that CM was capable of upregulation of NO, ROS, TNF-α and phagocytic uptake in mouse peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 macrophages. Macrophages activation by CM seemed to occur via activation of NF-κB and all three MAPKs pathways through dectin-1 and TLR2 macrophage receptors. Additionally, we showed that CM suppressed in vivo growth of melanoma in an experimental mouse model. Based on these data, we suggested that CM may potentially regulate the immune response.
