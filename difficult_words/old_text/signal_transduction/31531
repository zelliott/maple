The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase receptor that is frequently expressed in epithelial tumors. The EGFR was the first receptor to be proposed as a target for cancer therapy, and after 2 decades of intensive research, there are several anti-EGFR agents available in the clinic. Recent advances in our understanding in the mechanisms of receptor activation and function, discovery of primary and secondary EGFR somatic mutations, as well as a new generation of anti-EGFR agents provide new leads on the clinical targeting of this receptor and may serve as a model for strategies aimed at targeting other receptors.
