M475271, 4-quinazolinamine, N-(2-chloro-5-methoxyphenyl)-6-methoxy-7-[(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl) methoxy]-(9Cl), is a new anilinoquinazoline derivative that displays selective inhibition of Src kinase activity and tumor growth in vivo. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis. Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin is an endothelial cell-specific adhesion molecule that can interact with the cytoskeleton via several anchoring molecules such as beta-catenin. Here, we examined the effect of M475271 on VE-cadherin and beta-catenin phosphorylation and association. We also examined its effect on VEGF-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, migration, and tube formation. The findings reveal pretreatment with M475271 significantly inhibits VEGF-induced VE-cadherin and beta-catenin phosphorylation. However, M475271 significantly increases VE-cadherin and beta-catenin association compared to the VEGF-treated group. Confocal laser microscopic examination confirmed the augmentation effect of M475271 on VE-cadherin and beta-catenin association. Finally, M475271 was shown to have inhibitory effects comparable to those of PP2 and Herbimycin A on VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation. These findings suggest that M475271 attenuates VEGF-induced angiogenesis by maintaining cell-cell junction stability. Although the involvement of other signaling molecules cannot be ruled out, M475271 has potential as a drug for the inhibition of the angiogenesis needed for tumor growth and metastasis.
