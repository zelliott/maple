Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is a multifunctional cytokine acting during development, tissue homeostasis, regeneration processes, and disease progression. Due to its pleiotropic effects, tight regulation of the induced signaling cascades is mandatory. Caveolin proteins regulate a specific endocytic pathway and modulate diverse signaling pathways and thus have been related to severe disorders, for example, cancer and fibrosis. Caveolin affects TGF-β/-Smad and non-Smad signaling in many ways and thus can determine the cellular outcome upon TGF-β challenge. Reciprocal regulation of caveolin and TGF-β is also evident, ranging from gene expression to miRNA regulation. Finally, there is in vivo evidence that this crosstalk influences disease development and progression. This review gives an overview about the multifaceted relations of caveolin and TGF-β.
