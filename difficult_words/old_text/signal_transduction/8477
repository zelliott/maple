Upon ligand binding, cell surface signaling receptors are internalized through a process tightly regulated by endocytic proteins and adaptor protein 2 (AP2) to orchestrate them. Although the molecular identities and roles of endocytic proteins are becoming clearer, it is still unclear what determines the receptor endocytosis kinetics which is mainly regulated by the accumulation of endocytic apparatus to the activated receptors.

Here we employed the kinetic analysis of endocytosis and adaptor recruitment to show that mu2, a subunit of AP2 interacts directly with phospholipase D (PLD)1, a receptor-associated signaling protein and this facilitates the membrane recruitment of AP2 and the endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We also demonstrate that the PLD1-mu2 interaction requires the binding of PLD1 with phosphatidic acid, its own product.

These results suggest that the temporal regulation of EGFR endocytosis is achieved by auto-regulatory PLD1 which senses the receptor activation and triggers the translocation of AP2 near to the activated receptor.
