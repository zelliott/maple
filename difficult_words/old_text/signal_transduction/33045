The majority of skeletal muscles in higher vertebrates are hypaxial and stem from the lateral lip of the dermomyotomes. Various external signals converge on the dorsolateral quadrant of the somite to specify the hypaxial muscle precursors, to discriminate between migratory and non-migratory cells and to allow delamination of precursors destined for long-range migration. Within the somite, Pax3 acts as upstream regulator of hypaxial muscle development. Downstream targets are cMet and Lbx1, which may independently control identity, differentiation and motility of migratory muscle precursors.
