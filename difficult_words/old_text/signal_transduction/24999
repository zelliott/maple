The ability of a cell to migrate is dependent on the cooperative effects of many intracellular signaling events triggered through cell surface receptors (integrins), internal cellular mechanics, and the extracellular matrix. Many proteins have been identified as being involved in cell migration but the regulatory mechanisms involved in cell migration still remain unclear. This review summarizes studies involving various signal transduction pathways and their involvement in the regulation of cell migration. The focus is on cell adhesion sites (focal adhesions) and the actin cytoskeleton.
