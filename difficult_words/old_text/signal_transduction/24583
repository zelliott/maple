Arachidonic acid has been implicated as a second messenger in insulin secretion by islets of Langerhans. D-Glucose, the major physiological stimulus, increases unesterified arachidonate accumulation in islets. We now show, for the first time, that the muscarinic agonist carbachol, at concentrations which stimulate insulin secretion, causes a rapid and nearly 3-fold increase in arachidonic acid accumulation in islets. The combination of glucose and carbachol has an additive effect on unesterified arachidonate release. There is a large component of secretagogue-induced arachidonate accumulation that is independent of extracellular Ca2+. Carbachol stimulation of arachidonic acid release is mediated by activation of phospholipase A2, as demonstrated by early increases in endogenous lysophosphatidylcholine. In addition to phospholipase A2 activation, carbachol-induced arachidonic acid accumulation also appears to involve diacylglycerol hydrolysis, since the diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor RG80267 partly inhibited arachidonic acid accumulation. In contrast, glucose-induced arachidonic acid accumulation appears to reflect diacylglycerol hydrolysis entirely. Our observations indicate that phospholipase A2 has an important role in muscarinic-induced insulin secretion.
