Responses to light were recorded from rods, horizontal cells, and ganglion cells in dark-adapted toad eyecups. Sensitivity was defined as response amplitude per isomerization per rod for dim flashes covering the excitatory receptive field centers. Both sensitivity and spatial summation were found to increase by one order of magnitude between rods and horizontal cells, and by two orders of magnitude between rods and ganglion cells. Recordings from two hyperpolarizing bipolar cells showed a 20 times response increase between rods and bipolars. At absolute threshold for ganglion cells (Copenhagen, D.R., K. Donner, and T. Reuter. 1987. J. Physiol. 393:667-680) the dim flashes produce 10-50-microV responses in the rods. The cumulative gain exhibited at each subsequent synaptic transfer from the rods to the ganglion cells serves to boost these small amplitude signals to the level required for initiation of action potentials in the ganglion cells. The convergence of rod signals through increasing spatial summation serves to decrease the variation of responses to dim flashes, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, at absolute threshold for ganglion cells, the convergence typically increases the maximal signal-to-noise ratio from 0.6 in rods to 4.6 in ganglion cells.
