Growth hormone (GH) release is under the direct control of hypothalamic releasing hormones, some being also produced peripherally. The role of these hypothalamic factors has been understood by in vitro studies together with such in vivo approaches as stalk sectioning. Secretion of GH is stimulated by GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and ghrelin (acting via the GH secretagogue [GHS] receptor [GHSR]), and inhibited by somatostatin (SRIF). Other peptides/proteins influence GH secretion, at least in some species. The cellular mechanism by which the releasing hormones affect GH secretion from the somatotrope requires specific signal transduction systems (cAMP and/or calcium influx and/or mobilization of intracellular calcium) and/ or tyrosine kinase(s) and/or nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP. At the subcellular level, GH release (at least in response to GHS) is accomplished by the following. The GH-containing secretory granules are moved close to the cell surface. There is then transient fusion of the secretory granules with the fusion pores in the multiple secretory pits in the somatotrope cell surface.
