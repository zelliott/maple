Viruses utilize a variety of strategies to evade the host immune response and replicate in the cells they infect. The comparatively large genomes of the Orthopoxviruses and gammaherpesviruses encode several immunomodulatory proteins that are homologous to component of the innate immune system of host cells, which are reviewed here. However, the viral mechanisms used to survive host responses are quite distinct between these two virus families. Poxviruses undergo continuous lytic replication in the host cytoplasm while expressing many genes that inhibit innate immune responses. In contrast, herpesviruses persist in a latent state during much of their lifecycle while expressing only a limited number of relatively non-immunogenic viral proteins, thereby avoiding the adaptive immune response. Poxviruses suppress, whereas latent gammaherpesviruses activate, signaling by NF-kappaB, yet both viruses target similar host signaling pathways to suppress the apoptotic response. Here, modulation of apoptotic and NF-kappaB signal transduction pathways are examined as examples of common pathways appropriated in contrasting ways by herpesviruses and poxviruses.
