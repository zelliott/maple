The glomerular epithelial cells and the glomerular basement membrane are important constituents of the permselective barrier in the kidney. These are affected in diabetic nephropathy, one of the long-term complications in diabetic patients. Nonenzymatic glycosylation resulting in the accumulation of advanced glycosylation end products correlates with the development of long-term complications in diabetes. The interaction of cells with extracellular matrix proteins plays a critical role in a variety of biological processes. Recent studies show that cell-matrix interactions mediated by integrins can transduce biochemical signals to the cell interior and regulate cell behavior. In this paper we demonstrate that interactions of human glomerular epithelial cells with a nonenzymatically glycated matrix are altered with defective cell spreading, reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and reduced activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase. These data suggest that matrix glycation interferes with normal cell-matrix interactions and intracellular signaling that can potentially result in differential gene expression contributing to the changes seen in diabetic nephropathy.
