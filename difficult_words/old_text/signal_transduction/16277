Host-microbial interactions play a key role during the development of colitis. We have previously shown that chinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) is an inducible molecule overexpressed in colonic epithelial cells (CECs) under inflammatory conditions. In this study, we found that chitin-binding motif (CBM) of CHI3L1 is specifically associated with the CHI3L1-mediated activation of the Akt-signaling in CEC by transfecting the CBM-mutant CHI3L1 vectors in SW480 CECs. Downstream, CHI3L1 enhanced the secretion of IL-8 and TNFÎ± in a dose-dependent manner. We previously show that 325 through 339 amino-acids in CBM are crucial for the biological function of CHI3L1. Here we demonstrated that 325th-339th residues of CBM in CHI3L1 is a critical region for the activation of Akt, IL-8 production, and for a specific cellular localization of CHI3L1. In conclusion, CBM region of CHI3L1 is critical in activating Akt signaling in CECs, and the activation may be associated with the development of chronic colitis.
