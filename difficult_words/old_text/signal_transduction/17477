In the last decade a great deal of attention was awarded to a signal transduction pathway which is utilized primarily by 'Ca2+ mobilizing' signal molecules and which involves the hydrolysis of a quantitatively minor phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) by a PtdIns-specific phospholipase C (PLC). The evidence for the existence of receptor-mediated GTP binding protein-coupled PLC in myocardium and its possible functions are briefly summarized. The minireview is concentrated on the following aspects: 1) cellular localization and synthesis of polyphospho-PtdIns from PtdIns, 2) desensitization of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist and endothelin-1 mediated PtdIns responses, 3) oscillatory Ca2+ transients initiated by PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis, 4) polyunsaturated fatty acids as constituents of polyphospho-PtdIns and of the protein kinase C activator 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), 5) source other than PtdIns(4,5)P2 contributing to the stimulated DAG, 6) role of the PtdIns pathway in cardiomyocyte growth and gene expression during the hypertrophic response.
