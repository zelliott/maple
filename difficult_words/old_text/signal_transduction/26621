Hypothesizing that rapid estrogen signaling could be modulated from different estrogen receptors with unique localization patterns, a number of groups have attempted to design drug conjugates that target or restrict compounds to specific subcellular compartments. This article will briefly discuss the history of using conjugates to dissect rapid estrogen signaling and different strategies to attempt to target estrogens and antiestrogens to different locations. It will also detail some of the potential issues that can arise with different types of conjugates, using examples drawn from the authors' own work.
