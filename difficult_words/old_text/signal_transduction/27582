Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that plays a pivotal role during development and in the homeostasis of the adult nervous systems. However, mechanisms that regulate neuronal apoptosis are not well defined. Here, we report that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protects cortical neurons against apoptosis induced by camptothecin or serum deprivation and activates the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathways. Using pharmacological agents and transient transfection with dominant interfering or constitutive active components of the ERK or the PI 3-kinase pathway, we demonstrate that the ERK pathway plays a major role in BDNF neuroprotection against camptothecin. Furthermore, ERK is activated in cortical neurons during camptothecin-induced apoptosis, and inhibition of ERK increases apoptosis. In contrast, the PI 3-kinase pathway is the dominant survival mechanism for serum-dependent survival under normal culture conditions and for BDNF protection against serum withdrawal. These results suggest that the ERK pathway is one of several neuroprotective mechanisms that are activated by stress to counteract death signals in central nervous system neurons. Furthermore, the relative contribution of the ERK and PI 3-kinase pathways to neuronal survival may depend on the type of cellular injury.
