Plant behaviors across levels of cellular organization, from biochemical components to tissues and organs, relate and reflect growth habitats. Quantification of the relationship between behaviors captured in various phenotypic characteristics and growth habitats can help reveal molecular mechanisms of plant adaptation. The aim of this article is to introduce the power of using statistics originally developed in the field of geographic variability analysis together with prominent network models in elucidating principles of biological organization. We provide a critical systematic review of the existing statistical and network-based approaches that can be employed to determine patterns of covariation from both uni- and multivariate phenotypic characteristics in plants. We demonstrate that parameter-independent network-based approaches result in robust insights about phenotypic covariation. These insights can be quantified and tested by applying well-established statistics combining the network structure with the phenotypic characteristics. We show that the reviewed network-based approaches are applicable from the level of genes to the study of individuals in a population of Arabidopsis thaliana. Finally, we demonstrate that the patterns of covariation can be generalized to quantifiable biological principles of organization. Therefore, these network-based approaches facilitate not only interpretation of large-scale data sets, but also prediction of biochemical and biological behaviors based on measurable characteristics.
