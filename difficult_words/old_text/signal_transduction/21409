Nuclear steroid/thyroid vitamin A/D receptor genes form a gene superfamily and encode DNA-binding transcription factors that control the transcription of target genes in a ligand-dependent manner. It has become clear that chromatin remodeling and the modification of histones, the main components of chromatin, play crucial roles in gene transcription, and many distinct classes of NR-interacting co-regulators have been identified that perform significant roles in gene transcription. Since NR dysfunction can lead to the onset or progression of endocrine disease, elucidation of the mechanisms of gene regulation mediated by NRs, as well as the identification and characterization of co-regulator complexes (especially chromatin remodeling and histone-modifying complexes), is essential not only for better understanding of NR ligand function, but also for pathophysiological studies and the development of therapeutic interventions in humans.
