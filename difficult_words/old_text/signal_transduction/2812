The secreted cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) and its glycoprotein inhibitor (PDI) are among the first genes expressed when Dictyostelium amoebae begin their development. We used a series of mutants with defects in signal transduction to ask whether cAMP receptors 1 and 3, G alpha2, G beta, adenylyl cyclase (ACA), or the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKAcat) are required for the initial appearance or later regulation of the PDE and the PDI transcripts. The PDE gene produces a 1.9-kb transcript during vegetative growth and then a 2.4-kb transcript during the early hours of development. Regulation of the 2.4-kb transcript in CAR1, G alpha2, G beta, and ACA mutants is similar to that of isogenic parental strains, although its level is reduced in strains that carry the CAR1 mutation. CAR1/CAR3 double mutants also produce less PDE transcript, but the PDE gene remains inducible by cAMP. The PKAcat mutant produces the 2.4-kb PDE transcript, but in this mutant the vegetative transcript is retained in development. CAR1 and CAR3 are not required for transcription of the PDI gene, but deleting CAR1 leads to overproduction of the PDI transcript. Induction or repression of the PDI gene does not require G alpha2, G beta, or ACA. PKAcat is required for synthesis of the PDI transcript. The results suggest a two-stage regulation of these early genes through a G alpha2/G beta-independent mechanism and an absolute dependence of PDI on the PKAcat.
