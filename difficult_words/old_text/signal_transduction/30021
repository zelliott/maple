A random phosphopeptide probe (bio-pYZZZ) has been used for the isolation and identification of multiple SH2 domains from human cDNA-displaying phage libraries. In addition, on-phage analysis and quantification of binding affinities for these phage-displayed proteins has shown them to be functional domains, retaining the same characteristics as in their native state.
