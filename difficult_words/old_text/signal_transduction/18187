The Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing protein SH2-Bbeta is a substrate of the growth hormone (GH) receptor-associated tyrosine kinase JAK2. Here we tested whether SH2-Bbeta is involved in GH regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Based on cell fractionation and confocal microscopy, we find SH2-Bbeta present at the plasma membrane and in the cytosol. SH2-Bbeta colocalized with filamentous actin in GH and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced membrane ruffles. To test if SH2-Bbeta is required for actin reorganization, we transiently overexpressed wild-type or mutant SH2-Bbeta in 3T3-F442A cells and assayed for GH- and PDGF-induced membrane ruffling and fluid phase pinocytosis. Overexpression of wild-type SH2-Bbeta enhanced ruffling and pinocytosis produced by submaximal GH but not submaximal PDGF. Point mutant SH2-Bbeta (R555E) and truncation mutant DeltaC555, both lacking a functional SH2 domain, inhibited membrane ruffling and pinocytosis induced by GH and PDGF. Mutant DeltaN504, which possesses a functional SH2 domain and enhances JAK2 kinase activity in overexpression systems, also inhibited GH-stimulated membrane ruffling. DeltaN504 failed to inhibit GH-induced nuclear localization of Stat5B, indicating JAK2 is active in these cells. Taken together, these results show that SH2-Bbeta is required for GH-induced actin reorganization by a mechanism discrete from the action of SH2-Bbeta as a stimulator of JAK2 kinase activity.
