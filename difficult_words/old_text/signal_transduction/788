Fatty acids (FA) with at least 12 carbon atoms increase intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) to stimulate cholecystokinin release from enteroendocrine cells. Using the murine enteroendocrine cell line STC-1, we investigated whether candidate intracellular pathways transduce the FA signal, or whether FA themselves act within the cell to release Ca(2+) directly from the intracellular store. STC-1 cells loaded with fura-2 were briefly (3 min) exposed to saturated FA above and below the threshold length (C(8), C(10), and C(12)). C(12), but not C(8) or C(10), induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca(2+)](i), in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca(2+). Various signaling inhibitors, including d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor antagonists, all failed to block FA-induced Ca(2+) responses. To identify direct effects of cytosolic FA on the intracellular Ca(2+) store, [Ca(2+)](i) was measured in STC-1 cells loaded with the lower affinity Ca(2+) dye magfura-2, permeabilized by streptolysin O. In permeabilized cells, again C(12) but not C(8) or C(10), induced release of stored Ca(2+). Although C(12) released Ca(2+) in other permeabilized cell lines, only intact STC-1 cells responded to C(12) in the presence of extracellular Ca(2+). In addition, 30 min exposure to C(12) induced a sustained elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) in the presence of extracellular Ca(2+), but only a transient response in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+). These results suggest that at least two FA sensing mechanisms operate in enteroendocrine cells: intracellularly, FA (>/=C(12)) transiently induce Ca(2+) release from intracellular Ca(2+) stores. However, they also induce sustained Ca(2+) entry from the extracellular medium to maintain an elevated [Ca(2+)](i).
