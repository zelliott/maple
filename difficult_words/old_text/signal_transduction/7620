The aim was to investigate the mucosal activation of a broad range of genes associated with the T-helper 17 cell (Th17) signaling pathway in children at different stages of celiac disease (CD), including children with increased risk for CD and children with untreated and gluten-free diet (GFD)-treated CD.

Small intestinal biopsies were taken from children with untreated and GFD-treated CD, transglutaminase antibody (TGA)-positive children with potential CD, and reference children. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays were used to study the gene expression pattern of Th17-related genes, and quantitative PCR was used to study the interleukin (IL)-17A expression.

The mucosal expression of CD8A was elevated at all stages of CD. Children with untreated CD had diminished levels of IL-17RE, IL-23R, RORc, STAT6, CCL22, NFATC2, IL-18, CD4, CD247, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)9 but had elevated levels of MMP3, IL-17, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and CD8A, compared to references. The majority of the aforementioned genes, being differentially expressed in untreated CD, displayed similar expression in GFD-treated children and references. Children with untreated and GFD-treated CD had elevated expression of IFN-γ but had reduced expression of CD247. Interestingly, children with potential CD displayed reduced FOXP3, IL-21, and IL-17A levels.

Mucosal upregulation of Th17 immunity occurs at the late stage of disease and is downregulated with dietary treatment, thus indicating that IL-17 immunity is not a fundamental feature of CD as Th1 immunity, which is not fully downregulated by GFD.
