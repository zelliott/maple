Drosophila gastrulation serves as a model system to elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in morphogenetic movements. The ligand of the FGF receptor Heartless, which is involved in mesoderm movement, has now been isolated and shown to be a link between a morphogen gradient and cell behavior.
