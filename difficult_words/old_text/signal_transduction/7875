We and others have reported that C-28 methyl ester of 2-cyano-3, 12-dioxoolen-1, 9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me) effectively inhibits the growth of multiple cancer cell types. Our previous studies indicated that prolonged CDDO-Me treatment inactivated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in acute myelogenous leukemia cells. Whether treatment with CDDO-Me has an earlier effect on other proteins that are important for either signal transduction or oncogenesis is unknown. Constitutively activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is frequently found in human breast cancer samples. Constitutively activated STAT3 was shown to up-regulate c-Myc in several types of cancer and has a feedback effect on Src and Akt. To examine the effects of CDDO-Me on STAT3 signaling in breast cancer, we used the murine 4T1 breast tumor model, which is largely resistant to chemotherapy. In vitro, after treatment of 4T1 cells with 500 nmol/L CDDO-Me for 2 h, we found (a) inactivation of STAT3, (b) inactivation of Src and Akt, (c) 4-fold reduction of c-Myc mRNA levels, (d) accumulation of cells in G(2)-M cell cycle phase, (e) abrogation of invasive growth of 4T1 cells, and (f) lack of apoptosis induction. In in vivo studies, CDDO-Me completely eliminated 4T1 breast cancer growth and lung metastases induced by 4T1 cells in mice when treatment started 1 day after tumor implantation and significantly inhibited tumor growth when started after 5 days. In vivo studies also indicated that splenic mature dendritic cells were restored after CDDO-Me treatment. In summary, these data suggest that CDDO-Me may have therapeutic potential in breast cancer therapy, in part, through inactivation of STAT3.
