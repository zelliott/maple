Animals are routinely faced with harsh environmental conditions in which insufficient energy is available to grow and reproduce. Many animals adapt to this challenge by entering a dormant, or quiescent state. In some animals, such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, quiescence is coincident with increased stress resistance and longevity. Here we review evidence that the rules of life span extension established in C. elegans may be generally true of most animals. That is, that the rate of animal aging correlates inversely with cellular resistance to physiological stress, particularly oxidative stress, and that stress resistance is co-regulated with the quiescence adaptation (where the latter occurs). We discuss evidence for highly conserved intracellular signalling pathways involved in energy sensing that are sensitive to aspects of mitochondrial energy transduction and can be modulated in response to energetic flux. We provide a broad overview of the current knowledge of the relationships between energy, metabolism and life span.
