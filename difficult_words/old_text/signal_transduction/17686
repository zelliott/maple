Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is thought to involve translocation to the particulate fraction. The present study demonstrates a membrane-associated, inactive pool of PKC in adult rat ventricular myocytes. Membranes were isolated from stimulated (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), endothelin-1 (ET-1)) or control myocytes and PKC activity determined in the absence (active PKC) or presence (total PKC) of PMA. An inactive, PMA-responsive, pool of PKC was detected. In intact myocytes, PMA or ET-1 induced a translocation of PKC epsilon from the cytosol into the particulate fraction. In contrast, ET-1 decreased both total and active PKC in the membranes: this decrease was associated with a loss of PKC epsilon immunoreactivity. PMA increased the amount of membrane-associated, inactive PKC. Our results demonstrate the presence of a membrane-associated pool of PKC in cardiac myocytes that is differentially modulated by ET-1 or PMA.
