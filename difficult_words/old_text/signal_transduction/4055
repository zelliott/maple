The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits behavioral responses to many volatile odorants. Chemotaxis toward one such odorant, diacetyl (butanedione), requires the function of a seven-transmembrane receptor protein encoded by the odr-10 gene. To determine directly whether ODR-10 protein is an odorant receptor, it is necessary to express the protein in a heterologous system and show that it responds to diacetyl by activation of a G protein signaling pathway. Here we demonstrate that human cells expressing ODR-10 on their surfaces exhibit a transient elevation in intracellular Ca2+ levels after diacetyl application. Volatile compounds that differ from diacetyl only by the addition of a methyl group (2,3-pentanedione) or the absence of a keto group (butanone) are not ODR-10 agonists. Behavioral responses to these compounds are not dependent on odr-10 function, so ODR-10 specificity in human cells resembles in vivo specificity. The apparent affinity of ODR-10 for diacetyl observed in human cells is consistent with the diacetyl concentration ranges that allow efficient nematode chemotaxis. ODR-10 expressed in human cells also responds to two anionic compounds, pyruvate and citrate, which are metabolic precursors used for diacetyl production by certain bacterial species. Ca2+ elevation in response to ODR-10 activation is due to release from intracellular stores.
