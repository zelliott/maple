There have been major advances in the understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of gastrointestinal malignancies. The introduction of new genetic techniques has generated considerable insight into the understanding of familial cancer as is the case with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome and in the understanding of premalignant conditions such as the various dysplasias and adenomas. This new information will be of tremendous help in the early detection, the prognostication, and hopefully the therapy of premalignant and malignant gastrointestinal diseases. This article will attempt to review all these advances with added emphasis on the clinically relevant issues.
