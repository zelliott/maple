Growth factors were historically defined as molecules produced by the body to regulate cell growth and proliferation. After the identification of their receptors and the intracellular signaling machinery they activate, it is now clear that they are involved in the regulation of multiple processes essential for development and normal tissue function. The present review gives a brief overview of growth factor action. Receptor activation and signaling are discussed, highlighting the role of extracellular matrix interactions.
