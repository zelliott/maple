The purpose was to investigate the role of EphB4 in imatinib (IM) resistance and the mechanism responsible for homoharringtonine (HHT) contributing to imatinib sensitivity for a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines. We established cell lines from a patient with CML at the time of first diagnosis and relapsed phase and designated them as NPhA1 and NPhA2, respectively. Stable underexpressing EphB4 cells (NPhA2-sh) were obtained. The activated signal proteins in cells were tested by Western blot. The EphB4 was overexpressed in IM-resistant NPhA2 in comparison with the NPhA1 cell line, but the expression of EphB4 mRNA and protein significantly decreased in knockdown NPhA2-EphB4-sh cells compared with NPhA2 and NPhA1 (P < 0.001) cell lines. NPhA2-EphB4-sh cells were sensitive to IM (IC50 0.93 mg/L), and NPhA2 showed IM resistance (IC50 5.45 mg/L) (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, phospho-Rac1/cdc42 was significantly increased in NPhA2 cells compared to NPhA2-EphB4-sh (P < 0.001). The apoptosis rate reached 58.71 ± 2.39 % with NPhA2 cells incubated with HHT + IM, which was higher than NPhA2 cells incubated with IM alone (P = 0.002). IC50 of NPhA2 cells incubated with IM was 5.45 mg/L. However, co-stimulation with HHT + IM decreased the IC50 of NPhA2 cells from 5.45 to 1.17 mg/L (P < 0.001). Furthermore, HHT blocked the expressions of EphB4/RhoA, but did not down-regulate the phospho-MEK/ERK in NPhA2 cells. The overexpression of EphB4 contributed to IM resistance in CML line cells. EphB4/RhoA may be a new marker of IM resistance. HHT + IM gained more treatment advantages than IM alone by blocking EphB4/RhoA pathways in CML cell lines.
