Various mutant strains were used to examine the regulation and metabolic control of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) reductive pentose phosphate pathway in Rhodobacter capsulatus. Previously, a ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO)-deficient strain (strain SBI/II) was found to show enhanced levels of cbb(I) and cbb(II) promoter activities during photoheterotrophic growth in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide. With this strain as the starting point, additional mutations were made in genes encoding phosphoribulokinase and transketolase and in the gene encoding the LysR-type transcriptional activator, CbbR(II). These strains revealed that a product generated by phosphoribulokinase was involved in control of CbbR-mediated cbb gene expression in SBI/II. Additionally, heterologous expression experiments indicated that Rhodobacter sphaeroides CbbR responded to the same metabolic signal in R. capsulatus SBI/II and mutant strain backgrounds.
