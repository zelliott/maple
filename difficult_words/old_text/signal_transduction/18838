Recent studies have shown that 7-transmembrane receptors (7TM-Rs), their associated signalling molecules and scaffolding proteins are often constitutively associated under basal conditions. These studies highlight that receptor ontogeny and trafficking are likely to play key roles in the determination of both signalling specificity and efficacy. This review highlights information about how 7TM-Rs and their associated signalling molecules are trafficked to the cell surface as well as other intracellular destinations.
