The C-terminal region of the third intracellular loop of the AT(1) angiotensin receptor (AT(1)-R) is an important determinant of G protein coupling. The roles of individual residues in agonist-induced activation of G(q/11)-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis were determined by mutational analysis of the amino acids in this region. Functional studies on mutant receptors transiently expressed in COS-7 cells showed that alanine substitutions of the amino acids in positions 232-240 of the third loop had no major effect on signal generation. However, deletion mutations that removed Ile(238) or affected its position relative to transmembrane helix VI significantly impaired angiotensin II-induced inositol phosphate responses. Substitution of Ile(238) with an acidic residue abolished the ability of the receptor to mediate inositol phosphate production, whereas its replacement with basic or polar residues reduced the amplitude of inositol phosphate responses. Substitutions of Phe(239) with polar residues had relatively minor effects on inositol phosphate signal generation, but its replacement by aspartic acid reduced, and by positively charged residues (Lys, Arg) significantly increased, angiotensin II-induced inositol phosphate responses. The internalization kinetics of the Ile(238) and Phe(239) mutant receptors were impaired in parallel with the reduction in their signaling responses. These findings have identified Ile(238) and Phe(239) as the critical residues in the C-terminal region of the third intracellular loop of the AT(1)-R for receptor activation. They also suggest that an apolar amino acid corresponding to Ile(238) of the AT(1)-R is a general requirement for activation of other G protein-coupled receptors by their agonist ligands.
