Long-term depression (LTD) induction relies upon receptor cross-talk between group I and group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in perirhinal cortex. The molecular mechanism of this mGluR interplay is not clear. Here, we show that the mGluR subtypes postulated to be involved in this mechanism are developmentally regulated and mGluR2 has a preferential role over mGluR3 in the synergistic interaction with mGluR5. We have identified a >70% reduction in basal cAMP levels following mGluR2 stimulation, which could lead to increased mGluR5 function via reduced PKA mediated phosphorylation and decreased desensitisation of mGluR5. To further investigate the roles of mGluRs in downstream intracellular signalling, we have examined the effects of mGluRs on the phosphorylation state of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Both group I and group II agonists increased the phosphorylation of CREB, which indicates a cAMP- and PKA-independent signalling mechanism. These results suggest a convergence of signalling mechanisms from surface mGluRs to CREB-mediated transcription.
