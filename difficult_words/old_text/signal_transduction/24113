Malignant melanoma is the cancer with the most rapid increase in incidence in the United States. Ultraviolet light and deficiency of the p16ink4a gene are known factors that predispose one to the development of malignant melanoma. The signal transduction pathways that underlie the progression of melanoma from their precursors, atypical nevi, are not well understood. We examined activation of the MAP kinase pathway in atypical nevi and melanoma cells and found that this pathway is activated in melanomas. To determine the functional significance of this activation, we introduced constitutively active MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) into immortalized melanocytes. The introduction of this gene into melanocytes leads to tumorigenesis in nude mice, activation of the angiogenic switch, and increased production of the proangiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Activation of MAP kinase signaling may be an important pathway involved in melanoma transformation. Inhibition of MAP kinase signaling may be useful in the prevention and treatment of melanoma.
