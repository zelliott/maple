In this paper, we consider a three-dimensional model of cell signal transduction. In this model, the deactivation of signalling proteins occur throughout the cytosol and activation is localized to specific sites in the cell. We use matched asymptotic expansions to construct the dynamic solutions of signalling protein concentrations. The result of the asymptotic analysis is a system of ordinary differential equations. This reduced system is compared to numerical simulations of the full three-dimensional system. As well, we consider the stability of equilibrium solutions. We find that the systems under consideration may undergo sustained oscillations, hysteresis and other complex behaviors. The simulations of the full three-dimensional system agree with simulations of the reduced ordinary differential equations.
