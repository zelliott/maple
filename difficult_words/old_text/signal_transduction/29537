We report here the identification and functional characterization of Cg-Rel, a gene encoding the Crassostrea gigas homolog of Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors found in insects and mammals. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that Cg-Rel shares the structural organization of Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors of class II. It includes a Rel homology domain as well as a C-terminal transactivation domain (TD). Overexpression of Cg-Rel in the Drosophila S2 cell line activated the expression of a NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene, whereas transfection with a Cg-Rel construct containing a C-terminal deletion of the TD or using a reporter gene with mutated kappaB binding sites failed to activate expression. These results suggest that Cg-Rel is a functional member of the Rel family of transcription factors, making this the sixth structurally homologous component of the Rel/NF-kappaB pathway characterized in C. gigas. Based on homology to other invertebrates' Rel/NF-kappaB cascade, the function of the oyster pathway may serve to regulate genes involved in innate defense and/or development. These findings serve to highlight a potentially important regulatory pathway to the study of oyster immunology, hence allowing comparison of the immune system in vertebrates and invertebrates, an important key issue to understand its evolution.
