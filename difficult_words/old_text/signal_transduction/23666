Recently, a cohort of miRNAs, including miR-31, was reported to be downregulated during osteogenic induction by miR microarray analysis. It remains unclear how changes in miR-31 expression collaborate with bone transcription factors to activate the biological pathways that regulate the differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Here the effects of miR-31, Runx2, and Satb2 on the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs were investigated using mimics and inhibitors of miR-31, small interfering RNA for knockdown of Runx2 and plasmids for overexpression of Runx2. Our results showed that miR-31 expression decreased progressively in BMSC cultures during differentiation. Inhibition of miR-31 dramatically increased the alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization in BMSC cultures. Additionally, miR-31 diminished the levels of the Satb2 protein without significantly affecting Satb2 mRNA levels, and Runx2 directly repressed miR-31 expression. Overexpression of miR-31 significantly reduced expression of the osteogenic transcription factors OPN, BSP, OSX, and OCN, but not Runx2. Furthermore, the high expression of miR-31 in BMSCs cultured in the proliferation medium repressed Satb2 protein levels, which may contribute to the maintenance of BMSCs in an undifferentiated state. In conclusion, our results suggest that a Runx2, Satb2, and miR-31 regulatory mechanism may play an important role in inducing BMSC osteogenic differentiation. The results of this study provide us with a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the BMSC fate.
