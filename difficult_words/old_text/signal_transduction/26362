Retinoic acid (RA) regulates several gene programs by nuclear RA receptors (RARs) that are ligand-dependent transcriptional transregulators. The basic mechanism for switching on transcription of cognate-target genes involves RAR binding at specific response elements and a network of interactions with coregulatory protein complexes. In addition to these classical genomic effects, we recently demonstrated that RA also induces the rapid activation of the p38MAPK/MSK1 pathway, with characteristic downstream consequences on the phosphorylation of RARs and the expression of their target genes. Here, we aimed at deciphering the underlying mechanism of the rapid non-genomic effects of RA. We highlighted a novel paradigm in which a fraction of the cellular RARα pool is present in membrane lipid rafts, where it forms complexes with G protein alpha Q (Gαq) in response to RA. This rapid RA-induced formation of RARα/Gαq complexes in lipid rafts is required for the activation of p38MAPK that occurs in response to RA. Accordingly, in RA-resistant cancer cells, characterized by the absence of p38MAPK activation, RARα present in membrane lipid rafts does not associate with Gαq, pointing out the essential contribution of RARα/Gαq complexes in RA signaling.
