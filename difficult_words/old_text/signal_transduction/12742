The effect of tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate on the phorbolester TPA induced changes in phosphatidylcholine metabolism was investigated. In the simultaneous presence of the xanthate TPA failed to stimulate the metabolic [32P] turnover of the major phospholipids. The precursor molecule [3H] choline was incorporated into phosphatidylcholine after pulse labeling in TPA/D609-treated cells. Thus, the reduction of the [32P] phosphatidylcholine turnover did not appear to result from an inhibition of the TPA-stimulated phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. However, the xanthate exerted an inhibitory effect on the TPA-stimulated liberation of [3H] phosphorylcholine from [3H] phosphatidylcholine in cells prelabeled with [3H] choline. Furthermore, the TPA-induced rise in the diacylglycerol level was reduced in the presence of the compound. Thus, these results provide evidence that the xanthate inhibits a TPA-induced phospholipase C activity in the intact cell.
