If we understand pathological processess within the alimentary tract, it is apparent that the fundamental aspects of microbe-host interactions need to be examined in greater detail. Pathogenic bacteria have evolved strategies to alter and subvert the function of T cels and phagocytes in the gut wall, and exploiting these molecules may lead to new treatments for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. The adaptation of microbes to their host must involve microbe-mediated interference of the host innate immune response. The recent demonstration that nonpathogenic E. coli have a beneficial effect in ulcerative colitis further supports the notion that normal flora may alter the expression of the innate immune receptors or recognize alternative receptors compared with pathogenic variants. Such differences may conceivably lead to beneficial and protective alterations to the host through cytokine and antimicrobial peptide expression. Perhaps the contact point between microbes and host cells lies with the pattern-recognition receptors such as TLRs. However, although much light has been shed on the downstream consequences of TLR activation, many more questions remain unsolved. For example, little is known about the expression profiles of the different TLRs throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, ambiguities remain over the natural ligands for TLRs. The discovery that the Drosophila Toll receptor acts downstream of the pathogen recognition event suggests that there are many more twists and turns to be revealed in the story of host-microbe interactions in the gastrointestinal tract.
