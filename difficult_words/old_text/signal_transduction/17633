CD40 is an important regulator of diverse aspects of the immune response including the T-cell-dependent humoral immune response, the development of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and inflammation. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), a protein encoded by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), appears to mimic CD40 in multiple ways. CD40 and LMP1 bind similar sets of cellular signalling proteins and activate overlapping signalling pathways. Despite many similarities shared between CD40 and LMP1, they also differ substantively. In this review, we will compare and contrast the signalling mediated by CD40 and LMP1.
