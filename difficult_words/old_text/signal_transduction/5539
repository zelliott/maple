To research the alternation effect of insulin-like growth factors-2 (IGF-II) on the expression of KC1 co-transport-1 (KCC1) in the SiHa cells of cervical cancer, and to explore the activation of ERK1/2MAPK and PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathways during the expression process.

To apply semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis to measure changes in mRNA and protein expression of KCC1 after exposure to different concentrations of IGF-II for different time durations in the SiHa cells of cervical cancer. The change in protein expression of the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways is also measured. Furthermore, the protein expression variation in ERK1/2, AKT, and KCC1 is observed after the addition of a specific pathway blocker for the ERK1/2MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways.

The mRNA and protein expression of KCC1 increases dramatically after the application of IGF-II on the SiHa cells, and shows a definite dosage-time dependence relationship. The protein phosphorylation is enhanced in the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways, where the protein activity increases. By adding a specific pathway blocker, the protein activity and phosphorylation of the two pathways are no longer promoted even under the effect of IGF-II.

IGF-II can enhance KCC1 gene expression in cervical cancer cells through the ERK1/2MAPK and PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathways.
