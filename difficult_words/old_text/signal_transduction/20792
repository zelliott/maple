A growing body of literature exists documenting the nonnuclear effects of steroid hormones, and in particular, binding of the lipophillic ligands to specific plasmalemmal recognition sites. This review compiles evidence supporting the presence of membrane receptors for extradiol 17 beta, progesterone, corticosteroids, thyroid hormone, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In addition, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-mediated nonnuclear signal transduction mechanisms and physiological responses are discussed.
