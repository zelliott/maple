Ras interacts with a number of effector molecules to achieve its prolific signalling. Based on iterative sequence profile and motif searches of databases a novel family of Ras-binding domains was recently identified (Ponting and Benjamin, Trends Biochem. Sci. 21: 422-425, 1996). Among them the rat unconventional myosin and Rho-GTPase-activating protein myr 5 was predicted to contain a Ras-binding domain at its N-terminus. Here we report that direct binding experiments between the proposed Ras-binding domain of myr 5 and Ras failed to demonstrate any interaction. Molecular modelling suggests that this domain in myr 5 adopts a similar folding topology as the Ras-binding domain of Raf kinase. However, unlike the Ras-binding domain of Raf kinase, the myr 5 domain lacks the positive surface charges necessary for binding the negatively charged Ras contact site. This result exemplifies the functional diversity of similar structures and suggests that the identified Ras-binding motif does not reliably predict Ras-binding domains.
