Regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) regulates intracellular signaling via G proteins and is markedly reduced in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of patients with schizophrenia. Characterizing the expression of RGS4 within individual neuronal compartments is thus key to understanding its actions on individual G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here we present an ultrastructural reference map of RGS4 protein in macaque PFC based on immunogold electron microscopic analysis. At the soma, all labeling was asynaptic and affiliated with subsurface cistern microdomains of pyramidal neurons. The nucleus displayed most of immunoreactivity. RGS4 levels were particularly high along proximal apical dendrites and markedly decreased with distance from the soma; clustered label was present at the bifurcation into second-order branches. In distal dendrites and in spines, the protein was found flanking or directly facing the postsynaptic density of symmetric and asymmetric synapses. Axons also expressed RGS4. In fact, the density and distribution of pre- and postsynaptic labeling was correlated with the axon ultrastructure and the type of established synapses. The data indicate that RGS4 is strategically positioned to regulate not only postsynaptic but also presynaptic signaling in response to synaptic and nonsynaptic GPCR activation, having broad yet highly selective influences on multiple aspects of PFC cellular physiology.
