The kinase activity of lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase p56lck (Lck) upon physiological major histocompatibility complex (MHC) recognition by normal mature T cells was examined. Recognition of the target MHC molecules by T cells induced phosphorylation of the zeta-chain without obvious enhancement of the background Lck activity. There was no sign of enhancement of Lck through putative T-cell receptor (TCR)-independent class II MHC/CD4 interactions either. As has been reported, cross-linking of CD4 molecules by antibodies induced a marked enhancement of Lck activity. However, it did not have an immediate relevance to TCR-mediated signal transduction, as judged from the lack of detectable de novo phosphorylation of zeta-chain and the absence of functional responses of T cells. These results strongly favour the model in which TCR-mediated signal transduction does not involve aggregation-dependent enhancement of Lck, suggesting that the signal can be triggered simply by the recruitment of already active Lck with basal kinase activity through the formation of a TCR/MHC/CD4 ternary complex.
