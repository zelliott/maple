Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has demonstrated great oncostatic and antiinflammatory properties. Nowadays, it is clear that unsaponifiable fraction (UF) as well as other minor EVOO components have a key role in these beneficial effects. The present study was designed to evaluate UF effect in HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells. Cell growth and viability assays were determined by sulphorhodamine B test at different time points (24, 48, and 72 h). The proapoptotic effect was evaluated by flow cytometric studies and different protein expression were determined by immunoblotting. UF μg/mL concentrations' range significantly reduced the growth of HT-29 cell line. Moreover UF induced intrinsic apoptotic pathway in HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells through PPARγ and NFκB signaling pathways coming up to COX-2 downregulation and modulating p53 suppressor protein levels. The results suggest that UF of EVOO may exert an important role in the anticancer effect of EVOO and provide a natural resource for the prevention or treatment of human colon cancer.
