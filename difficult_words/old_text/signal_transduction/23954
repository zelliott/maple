This chapter will focus on introduction of various wild type (WT) and mutant genes into cells by DNA transfection. Techniques for analysis of the inheritance, expression, and biological effects of the introduced genes will be described. Various strong and weak points about three different techniques of stable gene transfer, including calcium-phosphate DNA precipitation, transfection via liposomes, and transfection via electroporation, will be discussed.
