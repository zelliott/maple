Adiponectin is an adipokine with anti-atherogenic, anti-diabetic and insulin sensitizing properties. Its effects on energy homeostasis, glucose and lipid metabolism are mediated by two ubiquitously expressed seven-transmembrane receptors, AdipoR1 and -R2. With the exception of APPL1 and RACK1, no intracellular binding partners of adiponectin receptors are reported and thus signaling pathways downstream of these receptors remain largely unknown. To incorporate adiponectins protective potential in drug development it is essential to understand adiponectin signaling cascades in detail. A yeast two-hybrid approach employing AdipoR1s cytoplasmatic N-terminus led to the identification of the regulatory subunit of protein kinase CK2. We confirmed the interaction in co-immunoprecipitation, ELISA experiments and co-localization analysis in mammalian cells. Furthermore we could localize the interaction site in an N-terminal basic region close to the transmembrane domain. In adiponectin stimulation experiments of C2C12 mouse myotubes and MCF7 cells incorporating CK2 inhibitor 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benz-imidazole (DMAT) we found a modulator role of CK2 in adiponectin signaling. Accordingly we identified the regulatory subunit of protein kinase CK2 as a novel intracellular partner of AdipoR1 and have strong evidence of CK2 as an effector molecule in adiponectin signaling. Since CK2 is involved in signaling cascades of other adipokines and hormones, e.g. leptin and insulin, our findings suggest a possible key function in crosstalk between adiponectin and insulin signaling pathways and could provide further insight into the anti-diabetic effects of adiponectin.
