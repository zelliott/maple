The androgen-androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway plays a key role in proper development and function of male reproductive organs. Like other transcriptional regulators, AR may communicate with the general transcription machinery on the core promoter to exert its function as a transcriptional modulator. The molecular communication between AR and the general transcription machinery may be achieved either by the direct protein-protein interaction between AR and the general transcription machinery or by the indirect interaction mediated by coregulators. Analyses of AR-mediated transcription suggest that the orchestrated interaction of AR with the transcription factors IIF (TFIIF) and IIH (TFIIH), and positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), may increase efficiency of transcriptional elongation from the androgen target genes, such as prostate specific antigen (PSA). Based on studies so far, AR may regulate transcription not by enhanced assembly of preinitiation transcription complex but by regulating promoter clearance and elongation stage of transcription.
