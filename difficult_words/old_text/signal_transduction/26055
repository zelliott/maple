Specialized epithelial cells in the amphibian skin play important roles in ion transport, but how they arise developmentally is largely unknown. Here we show that proton-secreting cells (PSCs) differentiate in the X. laevis larval skin soon after gastrulation, based on the expression of a `kidney-specific' form of the H(+)v-ATPase that localizes to the plasma membrane, orthologs of the Cl(-)/HCO(-)(3) antiporters ae1 and pendrin, and two isoforms of carbonic anhydrase. Like PSCs in other species, we show that the expression of these genes is likely to be driven by an ortholog of foxi1, which is also sufficient to promote the formation of PSC precursors. Strikingly, the PSCs form in the skin as two distinct subtypes that resemble the alpha- and beta-intercalated cells of the kidney. The alpha-subtype expresses ae1 and localizes H(+)v-ATPases to the apical plasma membrane, whereas the beta-subtype expresses pendrin and localizes the H(+)v-ATPase cytosolically or basolaterally. These two subtypes are specified during early PSC differentiation by a binary switch that can be regulated by Notch signaling and by the expression of ubp1, a transcription factor of the grainyhead family. These results have implications for how PSCs are specified in vertebrates and become functionally heterogeneous.
