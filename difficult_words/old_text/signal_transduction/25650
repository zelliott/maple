This review summarizes the role of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-cyclic guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate pathways in heart failure and several new drugs that modify guanylate cyclase. The sGC activators and stimulators as modulators of sGC are promising drugs in the therapy for decompensated heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Cinaciguat is a nitric oxide (NO)-independent direct activator of sGC, which also may be effective under oxidative stress conditions resulting in oxidized or heme-free sGC refractory to organic nitrates. Riociguat is an NO-independent direct stimulator of sGC with beneficial effects in patients with decompensated heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The sGC modulators play an important role in patients with heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
