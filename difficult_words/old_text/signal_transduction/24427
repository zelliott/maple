Previously, we observed that estrogen treatment enhances regeneration of the sciatic nerve after crush injury [Brain Res. 943 (2002) 283]. In this research, we studied expression of estrogen receptors and effects of estrogen on gene expression in the lumbar spinal cord, following sciatic nerve crush injury. Using the Atlas Mouse 1.2 Array, changes in the expression of 267 of 1176 genes were registered 4 days after nerve injury. Those genes that exhibited a change in signal intensity ratios of 2-fold or greater were selected as up-regulated (42) or down-regulated (21). In estrogen treated mice, we have observed up-regulation of the genes known to control apoptosis, cell proliferation, and growth, which might account for the positive effects of estrogen on the regeneration of motor neurons. Immunohistochemical staining revealed estrogen receptor-alpha and estrogen receptor-beta localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of lumbar motor neurons, and in the regenerating neurites of the sciatic nerve. Expression of estrogen receptor-alpha and estrogen receptor-beta mRNA in lumbar spinal cord was shown by traditional RT-PCR. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we demonstrated increased expression of estrogen receptors-alpha and -beta mRNA on the injured side of the lumbar spinal cord. Western blot analysis showed the accumulation of ERs in regenerating sciatic nerve, and revealed a 40% increase of activated ERK1/2 in estrogen treated mice, compared to placebo. Our findings indicate that: (i). axotomized motor neurons increase expression of estrogen receptors-alpha and -beta mRNA, (ii). estrogen mediates the expression of genes which accelerate the growth and maturation of axons, and (iii). estrogen receptors are transported from the perikaryon into regenerating neurites, and estrogen promotes regeneration locally through the non-genomic ERK-activated signaling pathway.
