Src-like adapter proteins (SLAP and SLAP-2) constitute a family of proteins that are expressed in a variety of cell types but are studied most extensively in lymphocytes. They have been shown to associate with proximal components of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling complexes. An interaction of SLAP with c-Cbl leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of phosphorylated components of the TCR- and BCR-signaling complexes. The absence of this process in immature SLAP-deficient T and B cells leads to increased immunoreceptor levels due to decreased intracellular retention and degradation. We propose a model in which SLAP-dependent regulation of immunoreceptor levels allows for finer control of immunoreceptor signaling. Thus, SLAP functions to dampen immunoreceptor signaling, thereby influencing lymphocyte development and repertoire selection.
