The current standard of care for hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients is cotreatment with human alpha interferon (IFN-α) and ribavirin. The host factor USP18 functions to regulate the interferon signaling pathway by acting as an off-switch. In order to understand whether the inhibition of USP18 represents a valid target for the enhancement of interferon treatment for chronic viral diseases, we have used a wide range of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents to suppress USP18 gene expression in Huh7 cell lines. We demonstrate that a USP18 knockdown results in IFN-α2a signaling (measured by increased IFN-stimulated response element [ISRE] reporter gene activity, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase [2-5 OAS] expression, and ISG15 induction) that is increased by ∼100-fold, whereas the antiviral (AV) potency in both the Huh7 HCV subgenomic replicon assay and the Huh7.5 HCV infectious virus assay increased by ∼3-fold. While the degree of the USP18 knockdown of USP18 elicited by the different RNAi reagents correlated with the enhancement of IFN-α2a signaling, it did not correlate with the enhancement of AV activity. The failure of increased IFN-α2a signaling to fully translate into increased AV potency was also observed for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) assays using Huh7.5 cells. These data suggest that the IFN-mediated AV response in Huh7.5 cells has only a limited dependence on USP18 activity.
