The recent recognition of the presence of rafts in the plasma membrane and of their involvement in cell signaling has strongly stimulated the search for their function in receptor-mediated signal transduction in lymphocytes. Recent progress suggests that a general feature of membrane rafts is to serve as platforms wherein the signaling cascades triggered through different multichain immune recognition receptors (e.g. the TCR, BCR and FcepsilonRI) are initiated and organized.
