Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the commonest chronic, systemic, inflammatory disorder affecting ∼1% of the world population. It has a strong genetic component and a growing number of associated genes have been discovered in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which nevertheless only account for 23% of the total genetic risk. We aimed to identify additional susceptibility loci through the analysis of GWAS in the context of biological function. We bridge the gap between pathway and gene-oriented analyses of GWAS, by introducing a pathway-driven gene stability-selection methodology that identifies potential causal genes in the top-associated disease pathways that may be driving the pathway association signals. We analysed the WTCCC and the NARAC studies of ∼5000 and ∼2000 subjects, respectively. We examined 700 pathways comprising ∼8000 genes. Ranking pathways by significance revealed that the NARAC top-ranked ∼6% laid within the top 10% of WTCCC. Gene selection on those pathways identified 58 genes in WTCCC and 61 in NARAC; 21 of those were common (P(overlap)< 10(-21)), of which 16 were novel discoveries. Among the identified genes, we validated 10 known RA associations in WTCCC and 13 in NARAC, not discovered using single-SNP approaches on the same data. Gene ontology functional enrichment analysis on the identified genes showed significant over-representation of signalling activity (P< 10(-29)) in both studies. Our findings suggest a novel model of RA genetic predisposition, which involves cell-membrane receptors and genes in second messenger signalling systems, in addition to genes that regulate immune responses, which have been the focus of interest previously.
