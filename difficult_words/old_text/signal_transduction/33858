To observe the effeet of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), on mTOR and eukaryotic initiation factor-4E(eIF-4E)expression in coxsac-kievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced rat myocardial cells and to investigate the role of mTOR/eIF-4E signal pathway in viral myocarditis.

To construct a cell model of viral myocarditis with primary cultured myocardial cells. Myocardial cells infected by CVB3 were treated with 10 nmol/L rapamycin according to the cell toxicity test. The mTOR and eIF-4E expressions of cells were determined by RT-PCR and Western Blot.

Rapamycin inhibited the degeneration of CVB3-induced myocardial cells. Expressions of mTOR and eIF-4E mRNA or protein in CVB3-induced myocardial cells were significantly upregulated compared with the control group (P < 0.05), and rapamycin (10 nmol/L) inhibited the upregulation (P < 0.05).

Rapamycin can downregulate the expressions of mTOR and eIF-4E in CVB3-induced myocardial cells, suggesting that mTOR/eIF-4E signal transduction may play an important role in viral myocarditis.
