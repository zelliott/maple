Intracellular free Ca(2+) ions regulate many cellular functions, and in turn, the cell devotes many genes/proteins to keep tight control of the level of intracellular free Ca(2+). Here, we review recent work on Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms and effectors that regulate the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in the maintenance of the homeostasis of Ca(2+) in the cell.
