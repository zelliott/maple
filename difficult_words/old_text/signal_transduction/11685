Convincing evidence is available showing that dietary calcium and vitamin D impede the development of colonic carcinogenesis. The major cellular modes of action of calcium and vitamin D which can contribute to the inhibition of colonic neoplasia are reviewed in this article. These consist of complex series of signaling events induced by the chemopreventive agents acting at various tiers of colonic cell organization.
