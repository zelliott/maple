Biological effects observed with an antagonist are usually interpreted as the result of its ability to block receptor activation produced by an endogenous agonist. In this Principles article, Wolfgang Sch√ºtz and Michael Freissmuth show how considerable evidence has now been accumulated for G protein-coupled receptors that antagonists not only bind to the receptor, but also induce a conformational change that favours uncoupling of the receptor from its G protein. The spontaneous activity of the unliganded receptor (i.e. the receptor not occupied by any ligand) is a well-established phenomenon in reconstituted systems with purified components. However, its physiological relevance needs to be verified in a more physiological environment before biological effect of antagonists can be primarily ascribed to negative intrinsic activity.
