Both immunosuppressive and cytoreductive effects of γ-irradiation contribute to engraftment of allogeneic haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We hypothesized that a release of host stem and progenitor cells from the niche prior to conditioning would permit engraftment after less intensive conditioning. Administration of AMD3100 and SEW2871 on days -4 to -2 followed by irradiation on day -1 in a non-myeloablative zebrafish transplant model resulted in a reduced radiation minimum dose of 10 Gy from 15 Gy being sufficient for engraftment. Targeting the SDF-1 (CXCL12)/CXCR4- and S1P/S1P1 -axis increased the efficacy of allografting in an experimental transplant model.
