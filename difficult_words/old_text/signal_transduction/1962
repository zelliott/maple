This review article considers the purposes and mechanisms of regulation of placental transfer in general terms and then illustrates some key points with reference to the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE), a transport protein found in the syncytiotrophoblast. NHE probably has a role in the homeostasis of syncytiotrophoblast intracellular pH and may also be involved in syncytiotrophoblast cell volume regulation as well as H(+) loss from and Na(+) transfer to the fetus. The activity and expression of NHE in the microvillous plasma membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast is reduced in placentas from preterm, growth restricted babies as compared to their gestationally matched normally grown counterparts. There are differential effects of gestation in normal pregnancy on NHE mRNA, NHE protein and NHE activity. There is also evidence of acute modulation of NHE activity. Regulation of NHE in syncytiotrophoblast is therefore complex with control at transcription, post transcription and post translational loci.
