Allergy is caused by immune effector cells, including mast cells and basophils. Cellular signaling that activates these effector cells is regulated by different inhibitory receptors on their surface. We show that human leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor (LILR) B2 and its mouse orthologue, paired Ig-like receptor (PIR)-B, constitutively associate to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I on the same cell surface (in cis). The IgE-mediated effector responses were augmented in beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) and PIR-B-deficient mast cells. In addition, the increased cytokine production of beta(2)m-deficient mast cells was not affected by the co-culture with MHC class I-positive mast cells, showing that less cis interaction between PIR-B and MHC class I on mast cells led to the increased cytokine release. Thus, the constitutive cis binding between LILRB2 or PIR-B and MHC class I has an essential role in regulating allergic responses.
