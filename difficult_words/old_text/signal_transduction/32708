The assembly of signaling molecules surrounding the integrin family of adhesion receptors remains poorly understood. Recently, the membrane protein caveolin was found in complexes with beta1 integrins. Caveolin binds cholesterol and several signaling molecules potentially linked to integrin function, e.g., Src family kinases, although caveolin has not been directly implicated in integrin-dependent adhesion. Here we report that depletion of caveolin by antisense methodology in kidney 293 cells disrupts the association of Src kinases with beta1 integrins resulting in loss of focal adhesion sites, ligand-induced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation, and adhesion. The nonintegrin urokinase receptor (uPAR) associates with and stabilizes beta1 integrin/caveolin complexes. Depletion of caveolin in uPAR-expressing 293 cells also disrupts uPAR/integrin complexes and uPAR-dependent adhesion. Further, beta1 integrin/caveolin complexes could be disassociated by uPAR-binding peptides in both uPAR-transfected 293 cells and human vascular smooth muscle cells. Disruption of complexes by peptides in intact smooth muscle cells blocks the association of Src family kinases with beta1 integrins and markedly impairs their migration on fibronectin. We conclude that ligand-induced signaling necessary for normal beta1 integrin function requires caveolin and is regulated by uPAR. Caveolin and uPAR may operate within adhesion sites to organize kinase-rich lipid domains in proximity to integrins, promoting efficient signal transduction.
