Crk, which belongs to the adaptor family of proteins composed of Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains, has a putative role in signaling. However, the downstream events of Crk signaling remain unclear. In this study, we found that Jun kinase (JNK) is moderately activated by v-Crk in both NIH 3T3 cells and chicken embryo fibroblasts. Transient expression of v-Crk, c-Crk-I, or c-Crk-II activated JNK1 in human embryo kidney cells, 293T. Coexpression of a guanine nucleotide exchange protein C3G, which specifically binds to Crk's SH3 domain, further enhanced the JNK activity as well as growth rate and anchorage-independent growth of v-Crk NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative form of C3G lacking the guanine nucleotide exchange domain abolished both the JNK activity and the colony forming potential of v-Crk NIH 3T3 cells. The requirement for JNK activation in v-Crk induced transformation was demonstrated by the suppression of colony forming activity of v-Crk NIH 3T3 cells when a dominant-negative form of JNK kinase, Sek1/MKK4 is expressed in these cells. These data strongly suggest the existence of a novel signaling cascade involving an adaptor protein v-Crk, which transmits signals through C3G toward JNK activation.
