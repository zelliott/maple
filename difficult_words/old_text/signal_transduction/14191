Cigarette smoke represents the major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) alter TLR4 expression and activation in bronchial epithelial cells. Carbocysteine, an anti-oxidant and mucolytic agent, is effective in reducing the severity and the rate of exacerbations in COPD patients. The effects of carbocysteine on TLR4 expression and on the TLR4 activation downstream events are largely unknown. This study was aimed to explore whether carbocysteine, in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (16-HBE), counteracted some pro-inflammatory CSE-mediated effects. In particular, TLR4 expression, LPS binding, p21 (a senescence marker), IL-8 mRNA and release in CSE-stimulated 16-HBE as well as actin reorganization in neutrophils cultured with supernatants from bronchial epithelial cells which were stimulated with CSE and/or carbocysteine were assessed. TLR4 expression, LPS binding, and p21 expression were assessed by flow cytometry, IL-8 mRNA by Real Time PCR and IL-8 release by ELISA. Actin reorganization, a prerequisite for cell migration, was determined using Atto 488 phalloidin in neutrophils by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. CSE increased: (1) TLR4, LPS binding and p21 expression; (2) IL-8 mRNA and IL-8 release due to IL-1 stimulation; (3) neutrophil migration. Carbocysteine in CSE stimulated bronchial epithelial cells, reduced: (1) TLR4, LPS binding and p21; (2) IL-8 mRNA and IL-8 release due to IL-1 stimulation; (3) neutrophil chemotactic migration. In conclusion, the present study provides compelling evidences that carbocysteine may contribute to control the inflammatory and senescence processes present in smokers.
