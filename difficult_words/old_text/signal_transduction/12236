Development of early embryos is regulated by autocrine/paracrine factors. Analyzing the expression of polypeptide ligand-receptor pairs using DNA microarray datasets, we identified transcripts for artemin, a member of the GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor) family, its receptor GFRA3 (GDNF family receptor-alpha 3) and coreceptor RET. Here we report an autocrine/paracrine role of the artemin-GFRA3 signaling system in regulating early embryonic development and apoptosis. Possible involvement of the MAP kinase signaling pathway was also demonstrated. The genome-wide survey of ligand-receptor pairs and early embryo cultures provided a better understanding of autocrine/paracrine embryonic factors important for optimal blastocyst development.
