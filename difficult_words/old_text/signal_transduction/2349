The tumor suppressor gene p53 is expressed in the contrasting cell fates apoptosis and proliferation. We examined whether the transactivation of the p53 target genes, waf1 and mdm2, is dependent on the cause of p53 induction in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Both apoptosis triggered by the purine analog 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA) and growth stimulation by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) induced a comparable level and time course of p53 mRNA expression. Both stimuli led also to an increase of p53 protein levels. The cytotoxic agent, but not the mitogen, led to transactivation of waf1 and mdm2 within 18 h. Transactivation was followed by apoptosis of 89% of the PBMC within 48 h. The c-myc oncogene and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), which also have a dual function in proliferation and apoptosis, showed an early induction by both CdA and PHA. These results add further evidence that growth stimulation and DNA damage-induced apoptosis share early gene activation pathways in normal cells. However, since p53 does selectively translate into transactivation of target genes depending on the cause of induction, this function of p53 seems to be regulated by additional factors, which are closely related to the ultimate fate of the cell.
