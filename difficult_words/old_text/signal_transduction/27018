Inhibition of protein phosphatases has been suggested as an alternative mechanism of tumor promotion (H. Fujiki, Mol. Carcinog. 5:91, 1992). We have now used early melanocyte passages dependent on phorbol esters and serum for growth and later passages with partial phorbol ester independence, to investigate the role of protein phosphatases on melanocyte DNA synthesis. Neither okadaic acid, an inhibitor of ser/thr protein phosphatases, nor vanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, can stimulate basal or serum-stimulated mitogenesis in contrast to phorbol esters. Moreover, both phosphatase inhibitors are able to suppress serum and phorbol ester-stimulated mitogenesis, if added within 4 hours of growth activation. Inhibition of mitogenesis by either inhibitor correlated with an early increase in a common set of tyrosine phosphoproteins, which included a major 33 Kd species. Our data suggest that protein phosphatase inhibitors are growth suppressors and antagonize phorbol ester effects in cells of melanocytic origin, implying an early requirement for protein phosphatase activity during mitogenic signalling in these cells.
