To investigate the regulation of MMP-9, TIMP-1, and progesterone via three signal transduction pathways in luteinized granulosa cells from normal ovulatory and PCOD women.

In vitro study.

Laboratory for Research in Reproductive Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ha'Emek Hospital, Afula, Israel.

Ten normal ovulatory and 10 women with polycystic ovary disease (PCOD) treated in an assisted reproduction program.

Cultured cells were exposed to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA), acting via protein kinase C (PKC), to epidermal growth factor (EGF), acting via protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), and to forskolin, acting via protein kinase A (PKA).

Secretion of MMP-9, TIMP-1, and progesterone.

Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate elicited an increase in MMP-9 and TIMP-1 secretion in both groups and apparently did not affect progesterone secretion. Epidermal growth factor did not change significantly neither MMP-9 nor TIMP-1 secretion but dose dependently decreased MMP-9-TIMP-1 ratio and increased progesterone secretion in the PCOD group. Forskolin inhibited MMP-9 activity and increased TIMP-1 and progesterone secretion in both groups. Progesterone production was inversely related to the ratio of MMP-9-TIMP-1 regardless of cell origin.

In this preliminary study, similar and divergent patterns have emerged in the regulation of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in human luteinized granulosa cells. Repressing MMP-9-TIMP-1 ratio may have an important modulatory effect on progesterone secretion.
