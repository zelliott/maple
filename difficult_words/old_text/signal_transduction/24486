Although oxidants clearly possess the capacity to behave in a random and destructive fashion, growing evidence suggests that in many instances the production of reactive oxygen species is tightly regulated and their downstream targets exquisitely specific. This past year, several notable advances have been made in defining the specific redox-dependent targets of intracellular oxidants, as well as the myriad pathways that appear to employ oxidants as effector molecules. These new studies have significantly altered our understanding of how reactive oxygen species participate in diverse processes from tumourigenesis to ageing.
