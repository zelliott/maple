Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily play key roles in innate and adaptive immunity. Here, we review recent structural studies in the intracellular signal transduction of these receptors. A central theme revealed from these structural studies is that upon ligand binding, multiple intracellular proteins form higher-order signaling machines to transduce and amplify receptor activation information to different cellular fates, including NF-ÎºB activation, apoptosis, and programmed necrosis. These studies open a new vista for understanding the biophysical principles in these signaling cascades.
