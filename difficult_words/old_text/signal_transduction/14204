As an important trace element, zinc is required for the normal cellular structure and function, and impairment of zinc homeostasis is associated with a variety of health problems including cardiovascular disease. Zinc homeostasis is regulated through zinc transporters, zinc binding molecules, and zinc sensors. Zinc also plays a critical role in cellular signaling. Studies have documented that zinc homeostasis is impaired by ischemia/reperfusion in the heart and zinc dyshomeostasis may play a role in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Both exogenous and endogenously released zinc may play an important role in cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury. The goal of this review is to summarize the current understanding of the roles of zinc homeostasis and zinc signaling in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.
