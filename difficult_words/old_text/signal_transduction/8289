Ca2+ signaling regulation plays an important role in triggering and/or maintaining atrial fibrillation (AF). Little is known about the relationship of the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in left atrium to chronic AF. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of InsP3R1, InsP3R2 and RyR2 in a chronic dog model of AF. AF was induced in 6 dogs by rapid right atrial pacing for 24 weeks, and a sham procedure was performed in 5 dogs (control group). The intact left atrial myocytes were used to examine the expression and function of InsP3Rs, RyRs by BODIPY(O,R) TR-X ryanodine, heparin-fluorescein conjugate, and were stimulated by caffeine, ATP to release Ca2+ through RyRs, InsP3Rs separately. We also assessed the molecular components of left atrial tissue underlying the amount of RyR2, InsP3R1 and InsP3R2 determined by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. In the chronic AF group, the Ca2+ released through RyRs is not altered, but the Ca2+ released through InsP3Rs increased significantly. RyR2 distributed in cytosol of myocytes, cellular membrane; its expression significantly decreased in AF group compared to controls. InsP3R1 distributed in cytosol, InsP3R2 distributed not only in cytosol, cellular membrane, but also in nuclear envelope and intercalated discs. The InsP3R1 and InsP3R2 expression significantly increased in chronic AF group compared to controls. These results indicated that in a chronic dog model of AF, the expression and function of RyR2 down-regulated; on the contrary, the expression and function of InsP3R1, InsP3R2 up-regulated, and InsP3R2 may be the major InsP3Rs, which regulate intracellular or even intercellular Ca2+ signal transmission.
