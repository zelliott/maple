While the "true" role of T cell anergy in promoting peripheral tolerance continues to be debated, it is clear that studying the various models of anergy have led to important insight in terms of understanding the pathways and molecules responsible for T cell activation and inhibition. This review will examine our current understanding of CD4+ T cell anergy. In particular, it will focus on the signaling pathways responsible for both the induction and maintenance of anergy. Furthermore, it will examine how specifically targeting these pathways can be exploited clinically in terms of promoting tolerance in transplantation and autoimmunity and inhibiting tumor-induced tolerance in the case of tumor-immunotherapy.
