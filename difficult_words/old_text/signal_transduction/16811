The heterotrimeric G-proteins form classical signal transduction complexes conserved in all eukaryotes. The repertoire of G-protein signaling complex is much simpler in plants than in metazoans. One of the best understood functions for the plant G-protein complex is its modulation of cell proliferation. A method is described here to quantify cell division and cell elongation in the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G-protein mutants using the hypocotyl as a model system.
