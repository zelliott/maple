We have previously shown that the B cell Ag receptor (BCR) activates phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. We now show that a serine/threonine kinase called Akt or protein kinase B is a downstream target of PI 3-kinase in B cells. Akt has been shown to promote cell survival as well as the transcription and translation of proteins involved in cell cycle progression. Using an Ab that specifically recognizes the activated form of Akt that is phosphorylated on serine 473, we show that BCR engagement activates Akt in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. These results were confirmed using in vitro kinase assays. Moreover, BCR ligation also induced phosphorylation of Akt of threonine 308, another modification that is required for activation of Akt. In the DT40 chicken B cell line, phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473 was completely dependent on the Lyn tyrosine kinase, while the Syk tyrosine kinase was required for sustained phosphorylation of Akt. Complementary experiments in BCR-expressing AtT20 endocrine cells confirmed that Src kinases are sufficient for BCR-induced Akt phosphorylation, but that Syk is required for sustained phosphorylation of Akt on both serine 473 and threonine 308. In insulin-responsive cells, Akt phosphorylates and inactivates the serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Inactivation of GSK-3 may promote nuclear accumulation of several transcription factors, including NF-ATc. We found that BCR engagement induced GSK-3 phosphorylation and decreased GSK-3 enzyme activity. Thus, BCR ligation initiates a PI 3-kinase/Akt/GSK-3 signaling pathway.
