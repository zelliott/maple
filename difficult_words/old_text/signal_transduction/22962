Cytokinins have been implicated in many aspects of plant development, including a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation. Recent studies indicate that cytokinins may elevate cell division rates by induction of expression of CycD3, which encodes a D-type cyclin thought to play a role in the G1-->M transition of the cell cycle. Progress has also been made in our understanding of cytokinin perception as homologs of two-component phosphorelay systems have emerged as likely signaling elements.
