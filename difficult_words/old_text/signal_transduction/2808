The enzyme adenylyl cyclase from sheep olfactory epithelium is dually regulated by GTP and is highly sensitive to the nucleotide analogues GTP gamma S and GppNHp, as well as to fluoride ions and forskolin. Many, but not all, odorants tested are able to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in a dose-dependent manner and with different potencies. Such an effect is detectable only in the presence of GTP. The odorants belonging to the putrid class are the least effective in stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity, and only furfuryl mercaptan significantly increases cAMP biosynthesis. Mixtures of two odorants, chosen among those able to activate adenylyl cyclase, induce additive or supra-additive effects, suggesting the presence of many different receptor types. The presence of an alternative olfactory signal transduction process, i.e. the inositol phospholipid second messenger system, has been evaluated. Triethylamine, a putrid odorant completely ineffective on cAMP levels, is able to significantly increase inositol phosphate accumulation, indicating the coexistence of both cAMP- and InsP3-mediated signalling pathways in sheep olfactory epithelium.
