Isoforms of the smooth muscle myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) are generated by cassette-type alternative splicing of exons. Tissue-specific expression of these isoforms is thought to determine smooth muscle-relaxant properties and unique responses to signaling pathways. We used mini-gene deletion/mutation constructs to identify cis regulators of splicing of the chicken MYPT1 central alternative exon. Comparisons of alternative exon splicing were made between smooth muscle cells of the fast-phasic contractile phenotype (gizzard), in which the central alternative exon is skipped, and slow tonic contractile phenotype (aorta), in which the alternative exon is included. We demonstrate that splicing of the alternative exon requires a cis-enhancer complex in the vicinity of the alternative exon 5'-splice site. This complex consists of two UCUU motifs in an intronic U-rich sequence (putative PTB (polypyrimidine tract binding) or T cell inhibitor of apoptosis-1 binding sites), an intronic 67-nucleotide enhancer that has similarities with the cardiac Troponin T MSE3 enhancer, and a potentially novel exonic splicing enhancer. The exonic enhancer contains the palindromic sequence UCCUACAUCCU present in many other transcripts where alternative splicing of exons occurs, suggesting that it may be more broadly active. The exonic enhancer is adjacent to a potentially novel exonic silencer element that contains a 13-nucleotide imperfect palindromic sequence. This silencer, in conjunction with a distal intronic silencer, is proposed to mediate the silencing of splicing of the MYPT1 central alternative exon in the fast phasic smooth muscle phenotype.
