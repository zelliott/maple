Coleoptile tip is a blue-light sensitive tissue possessing a "blue light receptor" which, upon activation, elicits a signal cascade resulting in phototropic curvature of the coleoptile. In this context, the nature of the photoreceptors and the exact mechanism through which the photoreceptors transduces the signal across the membrane are not clear. In this study, we attempted to examine whether the blue light receptor perturbs redox status of the coleoptile tip and sensitizes molecular oxygen as part of the signal reactions. Coleoptile tips of Sorghum bicolor and wheat (Triticum vulgare) grown in the dark showed pronounced ascorbate free radical signal, which diminished upon illumination with weak blue light for one minute. Concomitantly, the generation of superoxide radical by the coleoptile tip was augmented upon illumination with blue light. Various thiol blockers tested in this study caused powerful inhibition of blue light induced superoxide anion radical generation. Treatment with these thiol blockers, with the exception of NEM, resulted in marked increase in the levels of ascorbic acid free radical in the blue light irradiated coleoptiles. The blue light stimulated O*-2-generation by the coleoptile tip homogenate is also inhibited by the inhibitors of blue light responses viz phenylacetic acid, potassium iodide, and sodium azide. Based on our observations, we postulate that the activated blue light receptor present in the coleoptile tip sensitizes molecular oxygen to superoxide anion radical in the tip initializing the blue light signal cascade reactions.
