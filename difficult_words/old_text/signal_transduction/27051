Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 comprise the bulk of the inositol phosphate content of mammalian cells, but their intracellular functions are unknown. Until recently it seemed that these compounds were metabolically lethargic; this has diverted attention away from their possible role in short-term regulation of physiological processes. Interest in the idea that these polyphosphates play more dynamic roles is now increasing, following recent demonstrations that they are precursors of several inositol phosphates that turnover rapidly.
