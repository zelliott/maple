Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United States and is the second most common cause of death. While treatment options in early stage disease are curative in intent, treatment of metastatic prostate cancer remains challenging. Although, several new and promising treatment options exploiting novel targets have permeated the therapeutic landscape in recent years, another viable target for therapy is tumor angiogenesis. Many antiangiogenic agents are under development and some are currently under investigation in clinical trials.
