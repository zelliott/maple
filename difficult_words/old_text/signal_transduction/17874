Hantaviruses infect human endothelial and immune cells, causing two human diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). We have identified key signaling elements termed immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) within the G1 cytoplasmic tail of all HPS-causing hantaviruses. ITAMs direct receptor signaling within immune and endothelial cells and the presence of ITAMs in all HPS-causing hantaviruses provides a means for altering normal cellular responses which maintain vascular integrity. The NY-1 G1 ITAM was shown to coprecipitate a complex of phosphoproteins from cells, and the G1 ITAM is a substrate for the Src family kinase Fyn. The hantavirus ITAM coprecipitated Lyn, Syk, and ZAP-70 kinases from T or B cells, while mutagenesis of the ITAM abolished these interactions. In addition, G1 ITAM tyrosines directed intracellular interactions with Syk by mammalian two-hybrid analysis. These findings demonstrate that G1 ITAMs bind key cellular kinases that regulate immune and endothelial cell functions. There is currently no means for establishing the role of the G1 ITAM in hantavirus pathogenesis. However, the conservation of G1 ITAMs in all HPS-causing hantaviruses and the role of these signaling elements in immune and endothelial cells suggest that functional G1 ITAMs are likely to dysregulate normal immune and endothelial cell responses and contribute to hantavirus pathogenesis.
