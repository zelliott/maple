The transcription factor recombination signal binding protein-JÎº (RBP-J) is the critical transcription factor downstream to all four mammalian Notch receptors. Although it has been reported that Notch signaling pathway is involved in bone remodeling, the importance of RBP-J in osteoclastogenesis has not been fully explored. To investigate the role of RBP-J in osteoclastogenesis, we conditionally deleted RBP-J systemically in bone marrow (BM) or specifically in macrophages. We found that disruption of RBP-J in BM resulted in an obvious decrease in trabecular bone mass associated with an increase in osteoclasts, leading to osteopenia. Disruption of RBP-J in macrophages phenocopied the phenotypes of RBP-J deletion in BM with respect to osteoclastogenesis, suggesting that the osteopenia in RBP-J deficient mice is essentially resulted from increased osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, we found that RBP-J deletion in osteoclasts resulted in a dramatic increase in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase expression. These findings demonstrate a negatively role of RBP-J in the differentiation of osteoclasts and suggest that Notch pathway may be a new therapeutic target for bone diseases related to increased osteoclastogenesis.
