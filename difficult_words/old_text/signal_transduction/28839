Endothelin-3 (ET-3) is an essential paracrine factor for the proliferation, migration, and survival of embryonic melanocytes during fetal development. Its expression is tightly regulated, being completely turned off in adult skin.

In this study, results are presented that demonstrate abnormal expression of ET-3 by metastatic melanoma cells in both tissue biopsies and cell culture. Further, in vitro experiments showed that metastatic melanoma cells have the capacity to respond to ET-3 stimulation by increasing survival.

Therefore, an abnormal autocrine stimulation pathway involving ET-3 is present in metastatic melanoma cells. Blocking this signal transduction pathway may prove useful for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
