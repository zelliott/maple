Among its known functions, tumor suppressor gene p53 serves as a transcriptional regulator and mediates various signals through activation of downstream genes. We recently identified a novel gene, GML (glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecule-like protein), whose expression is specifically induced by wildtype p53. To characterize the GML gene further, we determined 35.8 kb of DNA sequence that included a consensus binding sequence for p53 and the entire GML gene. The GML gene consists of four exons; and the p53-binding sequence is present in the 5'-flanking region. In genomic organization this gene resembles genes encoding murine Ly-6 glycoproteins, a human homologue of the Ly-6 family called RIG-E, and CD59; products of these genes, known as GPI-anchored proteins, are variously involved in signal transduction, cell-cell adhesion, and cell-matrix attachment. FISH analysis revealed that the GML gene is located on human chromosome 8q24.3. Genes encoding at least two other GPI-anchored molecules, E48 and RIG-E, are also located in this region.
