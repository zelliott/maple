Oxidative stresses are largely mediated by intracellular protein oxidations by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Host cells are equipped with antioxidants that scavenge ROS. The cellular reduction/oxidation (redox) balance is maintained by ROS and antioxidants. Accumulating evidence suggests that the redox balance plays an important role in cellular signaling through the redox modification of cysteine residues in various important components of the signal transduction pathway. Thioredoxin (TRX) is a small protein playing important roles in cellular responses, including cell growth, cell cycle, gene expression, and apoptosis, to maintain the redox circumstance. Moreover, many recent papers have shown that the redox regulation by TRX is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of various oxidative stress-associated disorders. This review focuses on TRX and its related molecules, and discusses the role of TRX-dependent redox regulation in oxidative stress-induced signal transduction.
