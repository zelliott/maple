Adaptors are modular proteins implicated in the orchestration of intracellular signalling pathways. Studies of adaptors specifically expressed in immune cells have provided clear examples of the importance of adaptor molecules in normal mammalian biology. Moreover, they have led to the identification of naturally occurring mutations in adaptors that can be linked to human diseases. Lastly, they have highlighted the plasticity of protein-protein interaction modules, and have shed light onto the mechanisms dictating the specificity of adaptor-mediated signals.
