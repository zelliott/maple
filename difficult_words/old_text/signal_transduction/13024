Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a glycerophospholipid released from platelets that has multiple biologic effects. The present study evaluated the potential of LPA to modulate tissue repair and remodeling by modifying human lung fibro-blast-mediated contraction of three-dimensional collagen gels. The contraction of native collagen gels caused by human fetal lung fibroblasts was augmented by LPA in a concentration-dependent manner. The estimated median effective concentration was 3 x 10(-7) mol/L, which was well below the concentrations likely released by platelets in tissues. LPA-augmented contraction was not blocked by pertussis toxin or cholera toxin but was inhibited by inhibition of phospholipase C. Neither calcium mobilization nor protein kinase C appeared to play a role. In contrast, the effect of LPA appeared to depend on a kinase inhibited by staurosporine but not by genistein or GF109203X, suggesting a process that depends on phospholipase C and may involve a novel protein kinase. By modulating fibroblast-mediated remodeling, LPA could play a role in the tissue remodeling that characterizes wound repair.
