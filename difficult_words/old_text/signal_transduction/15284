The Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors are key families in the innate immune response. The specific detection of activating ligand facilitates receptor interactions, the formation of multiprotein signalling complexes and initiation of signal transduction cascades. This process can trigger the upregulation of proinflammatory mediators, apoptosis, and modulation of other immune defences. Recently, significant advances have been made in the identification of new activating ligands and the determination of the molecular basis of ligand recognition within these receptor families. Understanding these processes provides information essential to the development of new vaccine adjuvants and the treatment of infectious diseases, inflammatory disorders and, potentially, cancer.
