Signal transduction by the B cell receptor (BCR) is an absolute requirement for the selection and development of B lymphocytes at multiple checkpoints. Binding to antigen via the BCR is complemented by a co-stimulus delivered through accessory and co-stimulatory cell surface molecules that regulate the signalling threshold. In addition, identification of genes associated with immunodeficiency syndromes has highlighted the importance of genetic regulation, particularly in immunoglobulin class-switching and somatic hypermutation. A 1-day symposium organised by the Biochemical Society considered some of the recent advances in our understanding of the molecules and regulatory pathways involved in B lymphocyte activation, differentiation and survival and the health consequences when threshold settings malfunction.
