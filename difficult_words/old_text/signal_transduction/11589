Proteomics tools offer new ways to analyse networks of proteins that control important neurobiological phenomena such as learning and memory. In this review, we discuss how a combined proteomic, pharmacological and genetic approach reveals that multiprotein complexes process neural information and encode memories. Simultaneous analysis of multiple proteins enables the development of new concepts and approaches for neuroscience research.
