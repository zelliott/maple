The protein kinases ATM and ATR are central components of the checkpoint mechanisms that signal the presence of damaged DNA and stalled replication forks. Recent studies have provided important new insights into how these kinases work together with their regulatory subunits, DNA repair proteins and adaptor proteins to sense abnormal DNA structures and implement the appropriate DNA damage response. These advances have provided a more detailed understanding of the interface between damaged DNA and the checkpoint sensor proteins.
