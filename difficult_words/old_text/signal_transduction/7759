Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), have a key role in T cell receptor (TCR)-induced gene transcription but their precise mechanism of activation is not well understood. The findings of two recent papers provide new insight into the activation of p38 and JNK by the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family members Dlgh1 and Carma1, respectively, and show how distinct MAGUK proteins control specific aspects of TCR-mediated MAPK activation.
