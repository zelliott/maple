Channel proteins play essential roles in physiology including ion and volume homeostasis and signal transduction and in pathophysiology of many human diseases. Recently, the importance of the actin cytoskeleton in the channel protein regulation has been highlighted. The actin cytoskeleton and its reorganization have been reported to be required for the regulation of both channel activity and its intracellular trafficking. Furthermore, there are increasing evidences showing the direct interactions of channel to actin. This review focuses on actin-binding channel proteins and the role of the actin interaction in the channel protein regulation.
