5-Oxo-ETE (5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid) is formed from the 5-lipoxygenase product 5-HETE (5S-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid) by 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase (5-HEDH). The cofactor NADP(+) is a limiting factor in the synthesis of 5-oxo-ETE because of its low concentrations in unperturbed cells. Activation of the respiratory burst in phagocytic cells, oxidative stress, and cell death all dramatically elevate both intracellular NADP(+) levels and 5-oxo-ETE synthesis. 5-HEDH is widely expressed in inflammatory, structural, and tumor cells. Cells devoid of 5-lipoxygenase can synthesize 5-oxo-ETE by transcellular biosynthesis using inflammatory cell-derived 5-HETE. 5-Oxo-ETE is a chemoattractant for neutrophils, monocytes, and basophils and promotes the proliferation of tumor cells. However, its primary target appears to be the eosinophil, for which it is a highly potent chemoattractant. The actions of 5-oxo-ETE are mediated by the highly selective OXE receptor, which signals by activating various second messenger pathways through the release of the βγ-dimer from Gi/o proteins to which it is coupled. Because of its potent effects on eosinophils, 5-oxo-ETE may be an important mediator in asthma, and, because of its proliferative effects, may also contribute to tumor progression. Selective OXE receptor antagonists, which are currently under development, could be useful therapeutic agents in asthma and other allergic diseases.
