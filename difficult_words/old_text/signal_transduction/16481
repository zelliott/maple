Axon guidance represents an important step in the formation of neuronal networks. Axons are guided by various guidance factors, such as semaphorins, slits, ephrins, and netrins. Plexins are cell surface receptors for the repulsive molecules of the semaphorin family. Cytoplasmic regions of plexins are responsible for initiating cellular signal transduction, resulting in axon repulsion. Recent advances have shed light on the signal transduction mechanism of plexins and the mechanisms by which it leads to a repulsive response. Plexin-B1 possesses an intrinsic guanine triphosphate (GTP)ase activating protein activity for R-Ras, a member of Ras family of small GTPases that has been implicated in promoting cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth through integrin activation. Stimulation of Plexin-B1 by Sema4D induces collapse of the growth cone through downregulation of R-Ras activity. This article summarizes current understanding of the signaling mechanisms of plexins.
