Immune protection from microbial invaders or malignant progression is dependent on the ability of lymphocytes to efficiently traffic across morphologically and biochemically distinct vascular sites throughout the body. Lymphocyte trafficking to target tissues is orchestrated by adhesion molecules and chemokines that stabilize dynamic interactions between circulating lymphocytes and endothelial cells lining blood vessels. While the molecular mechanisms that regulate the efficient migration of lymphocytes across specialized high endothelial venules (HEVs) in secondary lymphoid organs have been extensively characterized, there is a paucity of information available regarding the mechanisms that dictate the rate of lymphocyte entry into tumor tissues. This article summarizes recent evidence that inflammatory cues associated with fever-range thermal stress promote lymphocyte extravasation across HEVs of lymphoid organs through a highly regulated lymphocyte-endothelial-interleukin-6 (IL-6) biological axis. The potential for using thermally-based strategies to improve lymphocyte delivery to the tumor microenvironment during T cell-based immunotherapy will also be discussed.
