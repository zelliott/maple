Platelet activation by potent, Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists results in shedding of microparticles that are active in coagulation. Here we show that platelets under storage produce procoagulant microparticles in the absence of agonist. Microparticle formation by resting platelets results from alphaIIbbeta3 signaling to destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton in the absence of calpain activation. Integrin-mediated spreading of platelets over fibrinogen similarly results in microparticle formation. After transfusion of stored platelet preparations to thrombocytopenic patients, the microparticles contribute to coagulant activity in vivo.
