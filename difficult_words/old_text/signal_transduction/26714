Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of nucleosomal core histones play roles in basic biological processes via altering chromatin structure and creating target sites for proteins acting on chromatin. Several features make Drosophila a uniquely effective model for studying PTMs. Position effect variegation, polycomb repression, dosage compensation and several other processes extensively studied by the powerful tools of Drosophila genetics as well as polytene chromosome cytology reveal information on the dynamic changes of histone PTMs and factors that deposit, remove and recognize these. Recent determination of the genome-wide distribution of more than 20 different histone PTM types has resulted in a highly detailed view of chromatin landscape. This review samples from the wealth of data these analyses have provided together with data resulting from gene-targeted studies on the distribution and role of specific histone modifications and modifiers. As an example of the complex interactions among PTMs, we will also discuss crosstalk involving specific phosphorylated and acetylated histone forms.
