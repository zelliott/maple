We have investigated the effect of extracellularly applied Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) on tyrosine phosphorylation processes, which represent a major signal transduction pathway of cells of the central nervous system. Primary cultures of rat cerebellar astrocytes or granule cells were incubated with synthetic Tat (10 ng/ml) for various periods of time and analyzed for their phosphotyrosine content by Western blotting. In both types of cultures Tat was able to induce the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) on tyrosine residues, although with different kinetics and isoform specificity. In addition, in neuronal cells, but not in astrocytes, Tat increased the phosphotyrosine content of Shc, a protein involved in signal transduction downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase activation. This study shows that Tat applied extracellularly is able to induce the generation of intracellular signals in neuronal as well as glial cells.
