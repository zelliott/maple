We report the synthesis and biological evaluation of N-[(1-aryl-1H-indazol-5-yl)methyl]amide derivatives as Smoothened antagonists and inhibitors of the Hedgehog pathway. Identification of the lead structure 1 by HTS, followed by SAR study on the amide and aryl portions led to the discovery of antagonists with nanomolar activity.
