The effect of antagonist pretreatment on the signaling properties of the human metabotropic glutamate 1a (hmGlu1a) receptor was examined in stably transfected L929sA cells. Pre-exposure of hmGlu1a receptor-expressing cells to the mGlu1 receptor antagonists (S)-4-carboxy-3-hydroxyphenylglycine and 7-(hydroxyimino)cyclo-propa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester dramatically enhanced subsequent glutamate-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis and intracellular [Ca(2+)] rise. We found clear indications that the antagonist-mediated enhancement of glutamate-evoked mGlu1a receptor signaling is caused by the development of mGlu1a receptor supersensitivity: the potency of glutamate was increased by 3-fold after 24 h antagonist pretreatment and the potency of the antagonists was significantly decreased in antagonist-pretreated cells. The kinetic profile of the antagonist-mediated enhancement showed that the maximal increase in intracellular [Ca(2+)] was already reached after 30-min pretreatment, suggesting that de novo receptor synthesis is not involved in the process of mGlu1a receptor supersensitization. Glutamate-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis increased up to 24 h after antagonist treatment. Although it seemed likely that the hmGlu1a receptor could desensitize after activation by endogenously present glutamate, removal of glutamate from the extracellular medium with GPT resulted in a much smaller enhancement of glutamate responsiveness. Moreover, the magnitude of antagonist-mediated receptor supersensitivity was much larger than the magnitude of agonist-induced receptor desensitization. These results suggest that antagonist-evoked mGlu1 receptor supersensitivity is not merely the result of a blockade of agonist-induced desensitization. Finally, we found that antagonist pretreatment doubled the amount of receptors at the cell surface. Our findings are the first lines of evidence that prolonged antagonist treatment can supersensitize the hmGlu1a receptor. In view of the potential therapeutic application of mGlu1 receptor antagonists, it will be important to know whether these phenomena occur in vivo.
