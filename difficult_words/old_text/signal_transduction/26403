A consolidated map of the signalling pathways that function in the formation of short- and long-term cellular memory could be considered the ultimate means of defining the molecular basis of learning. Research has established that experience-dependent activation of these complex cellular cascades leads to many changes in the composition and functioning of a neuron's proteome, resulting in the modulation of its synaptic strength and structure. However, although generally accepted that synaptic plasticity is the mechanism whereby memories are stored in the brain, there is much controversy over whether the site of this neuronal memory expression is predominantly pre- or postsynaptic. Much of the early research into the neuromolecular mechanisms of memory performed using the model organism, the marine snail Aplysia, has focused on the associated presynaptic events. Recently however, postsynaptic mechanisms have been shown to contribute definitively to long term memory processes, and are in fact critical for persistent learning-induced synaptic changes. In this review, in which we aimed to integrate many of the early and recent advances concerning coordinated neuronal signaling in both the pre- and postsynaptic neurons, we have provided a detailed account of the diverse cellular events that lead to modifications in synaptic strength. Thus, a comprehensive synaptic model is presented that could explain a few of the shortcomings that arise when the presynaptic and postsynaptic changes are considered separately. Although it is clear that there is still much to be learnt and that the exact nature of many of the signalling cascades and their components are yet to be fully understood, this still incomplete but integrated illustrative map of the cellular pathways involved provides an overview which expands understanding of the neuromolecular mechanisms of learning and memory.
