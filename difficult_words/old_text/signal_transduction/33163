Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a pleiotropic cytokine which regulates the growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells and activates platelet maturation. Previous studies have shown that, IL-11 activates a set of signaling cascades involving the JAK/STAT and Raf/MAPK pathways. The purpose of the current studies was to obtain evidence about the possible involvement of PKC in the IL-11 signaling pathway. Evidence presented in this report suggests that IL-11 stimulates rapid PKC activation and markedly induces cytosolic to particulate (membrane) association of alpha and beta PKC isoforms. These findings provide preliminary evidence that PKC may be involved in the IL-11 signaling cascade.
