Positive selection of T cell precursors is an MHC dependent, multistep process by which functionally mature CD4+8- helper and CD4-8+ cytotoxic single positive (SP) T cells are generated from immature CD4+8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes. We investigated the requirement for TCR/MHC class II interactions during different stages of positive selection of human CD4 SP thymocytes. We show that sorted CD69- CD4+8+ DP preselection thymocytes cultured in fetal thymus lobes of normal mice were subject to positive selection and differentiated to CD3(high) CD69+, mature CD8 SP, and CD4 SP cells. When cultured in thymus lobes from MHC class II-deficient mice, these precursors failed to develop into mature CD4 SP T cells, indicating that in the hybrid cultures, murine MHC class II molecules are required for the development of mature human CD4 SP T cells. We have previously identified CD4 SP intermediate thymocytes that have received at least some of the signals involved in positive selection, since these cells are CD69+, CD3/TCR(high), and CD8beta- but that are still phenotypically and functionally immature. Here we demonstrate that in contrast to preselection thymocytes, these CD4 SP intermediate thymocytes can give rise to phenotypically mature and functionally CD4 SP progeny both in normal and in MHC class II-deficient thymus lobes. These results suggest that TCR/MHC interactions are required for the initial stages of positive selection, but are not essential during terminal differentiation to functionally mature CD4 SP T cells.
