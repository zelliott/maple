To investigate the influences of Shensu Yin to RAW 264.7 on the expression of TLR3, TLR4 and the factors of the downstream in RAW 264. 7 cells.

RAW 264.7 cell line was stimulated with Lipopolysaccharide and POLY I: C, respectively, and treated with the drug serum of Shensuyin simultaneously. 24 hours later, collected the supernatant and measured the inflammatory factors TNF-alpha and IFN-beta, extracted mRNA and measured the expression of TLR3, TLR4 and other correlated indexes of the downstream, analyzed and evaluated Shensu Yin's substance basis of pharmacodynamic actions.

Shensu Yin drug serum depressed the expression of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF-6, TRAM and TRIF mRNA, as a result, it decreased the amount of TNF-alpha and IFN-beta.

Depressing the expression of TLR3, MyD88, TRAM and TRIF mRNA may be the elementary basis of Shensu Yin to play heat-clearing and detoxicating effect.
