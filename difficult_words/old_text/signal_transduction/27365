Biomolecular interactions can be defined by combining thermodynamic data on the energetic properties of the interaction with high-resolution structural data. The development of high sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetric equipment provides a dramatic advance in the gathering of thermodynamic data, and the interactions between biological macromolecules can now be described with unprecedented accuracy.
