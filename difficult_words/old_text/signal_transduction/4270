We investigated the role of surface adhesion molecules in regulating vascular permeability, in vitro and in vivo. Cultured rat endothelial cells (RECs) express Thy-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and CD44. Permeability of albumin across the REC monolayer increased through the interaction of Thy-1 and anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), but no increase was seen through ICAM-1 and anti-ICAM-1, CD44 and anti-CD44, and RT1A and anti-RT1A mAbs. The potential of anti-Thy-1 mAb for permeability increase depended on antibody concentration, it peaked at 12h, and was neither mediated by injury nor by growth modulation to the REC monolayer. Effect of anti-Thy-1 mAb was inhibited significantly by the calmodulin antagonist W-7 or the protein kinase inhibitors H-7 and HA-1004, and was completely blocked by the combined addition of W-7 and H-7. It seems likely that both calmodulin and protein kinases are involved in related intracellular signal pathways. Thy-1 expression on RECs was up-regulated with IL-1 beta treatment and was down-regulated with mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) supernatant treatment. Although Thy-1 expression on rat vascular endothelium in vivo was not detected, the expression of Thy-1 was induced on dermal endothelial cells at the site of inflammation induced by Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). Vascular permeability in the inflamed dermis significantly increased when anti-Thy-1 but not anti-ICAM-1, anti-CD44, or anti-RT1A mAbs were given intravenously. The collective evidence suggests that inducible Thy-1 on the endothelium is one important regulatory event in vascular permeability at sites of inflammation.
