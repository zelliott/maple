β-catenin, a key factor in the Wnt signaling pathway, has essential functions in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Aberrant β-catenin signaling has been linked to various disease pathologies, including an important role in tumorigenesis. Here, we review the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway as it relates to β-catenin signaling in tumorigenesis, with particular focus on the role of microRNAs. Finally, we discuss the potential of β-catenin targeted therapeutics for cancer treatment.
