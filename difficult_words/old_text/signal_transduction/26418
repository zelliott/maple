VEGF and EGFR are validated pathways for targeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Once considered to be separate targets, VEGF and EGFR are now shown to have interconnected downstream pathways, potentiating the effectiveness of their dual signaling inhibition in cancer therapy. Molecules such as vandetanib that inhibit VEGFR and EGFR have also been reported to inhibit other receptors, including RET and additional kinases, and may be beneficial in treating patients with solid tumors.

This review covers the significance of targeting VEGF and EGFR in the treatment of NSCLC and the rationale behind their dual inhibition. Clinical trials that evaluate the use of vandetanib in the setting of refractory NSCLC are also explored.

Vandetanib is currently not approved in the setting of NSCLC. However, its approval for medullary thyroid cancer makes it promising for identifying markers and potentially a NSCLC patient population who will benefit from the treatment.
