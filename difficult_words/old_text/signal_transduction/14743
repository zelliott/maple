Nobiletin is a polymethoxylated flavone found in certain citrus fruits. Here we demonstrate that nobiletin enhance differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Nobiletin dose-dependently increased accumulation of lipid droplets in adipocytes. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses indicated that nobiletin increased the expression of genes critical for acquisition of the adipocyte phenotype. Some of them were known peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) targets and PPARgamma itself, however, nobiletin did not exhibit PPARgamma ligand activity. We observed the expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta), a transcription factor for PPARgamma, was increased by nobiletin. The activation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which play important roles in C/EBPbeta expression were also potentiated by nobiletin. Furthermore, nobiletin stimulated lipolysis in differentiated adipocytes, which is known to be stimulated by cAMP pathway. These results suggested that nobiletin enhanced both differentiation and lipolysis of adipocyte through activation of signaling cascades mediated by cAMP/CREB.
