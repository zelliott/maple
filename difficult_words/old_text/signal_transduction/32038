Plants perceive endogenous molecules or their fragments as signals of danger when these appear at increased concentrations in the extracellular space, and they respond with increased endogenous levels of jasmonic acid. The wound hormone jasmonic acid represents a central player in the induced resistance of plants to herbivore feeding and infection by necrotrophic pathogens. This 'damaged self recognition' mechanism of plants exhibits astonishing similarities to the perception of 'damage-associated molecular patterns' (DAMPs) by the human immune system: endogenous cell constituents, or their fragments, that can be released into the extracellular milieu during states of cellular stress or damage function as 'stress signals' and trigger inflammatory and other immunity-related responses. Multicellular organisms use endogenous molecules as danger signals to mount adequate healing and resistance-related responses without depending on exogenous signals and to place exogenous, enemy-derived molecular signals into the adequate functional context.
