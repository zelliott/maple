The past several decades have revealed certain challenges that are inherent to soft-tissue sarcomas with regards to devising, testing and setting treatment paradigms for such a rare and heterogeneous malignancy. Despite this, significant advances have been made through the efforts of scientists, clinicians and patients alike. We are now entering a molecular era of cancer and current biotechnology is beginning to unravel the pathogenic enigma of these often devastating tumors. As our understanding of these malignancies improves, so does our list of potential treatment options. The impetus now lies with the medical/scientific community to direct translational research and subsequently the development and clinical testing of novel compounds in a fashion that best serves this unique patient population. To do so, we must continue to integrate the lessons of the past with the resources and promise of the future. This review will outline current areas of therapeutic interest in soft-tissue sarcomas with regard to agents that have reached clinical testing.
