Menadione is a synthetic vitamin K3 derivative. Here, we examined the effects of menadione on melanogenesis and its related signaling pathways. Our results showed that melanin content was significantly reduced after menadione treatment in a dose-dependent manner. However, menadione treatment did not reduce tyrosinase activity directly. Wnt signaling is known to play a major role in the control of melanin synthesis. Thus, we tested the effects of menadione treatment on GSK3β and β-catenin signaling, but found that menadione did not influence either of these signaling pathways. We also investigated changes in the phosphorylation of ERK, which is related to melanin regulation. These results indicated that menadione treatment led to the phosphorylation of ERK. Additionally, menadione treatment reduced both MITF and tyrosinase protein levels. Treatment with PD98059, a specific ERK pathway inhibitor, restored menadione-induced melanin reduction and also prevented MITF and tyrosinase downregulation by menadione. These results suggest that the hypopigmentary action of menadione is due to MITF and tyrosinase downregulation by ERK activation.
