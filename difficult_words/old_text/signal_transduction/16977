Monocytic cells represent important cellular elements of the innate and adaptive immune responses in viral infections. We assessed the role of Fas/FasL in promoting monocyte apoptosis during HSV-2 infection by using an in vitro model based on the murine RAW 264.7 monocytic cell line and an in vivo murine model of HSV-2 infection applied to C57BL6, MRL-Fas(lpr)/J (Fas-/-) and C3-Fasl(gld)/J (FasL-/-) mice. HSV-2 infection of the monocytic cell line led to early induction of apoptosis, with no protective expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. HSV-2 infected monocytes up-regulated Fas and FasL expression early during in vitro infection but were susceptible to Fas induced apoptosis. The vaginal monocytes in the HSV-2 murine model of infection up-regulated FasL expression and were susceptible to Fas induced apoptosis. HSV-2 infection of Fas and FasL- deficient mice led to decreased apoptosis of monocytes and impaired recruitment of NK, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within the infection sites. The vaginal lavages of HSV-2 infected Fas and FasL- deficient showed decreased production of CXCL9, CXCL10 and TNF-α in comparison to HSV-2 infected wild-type mice strain. The decreased recruitment of immune competent cells was accompanied by delayed virus clearance from the infected tissue. Triggering of the Fas receptor on HSV-2 infected monocytes in vitro up-regulated the expression of CXCL9 chemokines and the cytokine TNF-α. Our study provides novel insights on the role of Fas/FasL pathway not only in apoptosis of monocytes but also in regulating local immune response by monocytes during HSV-2 infection.
