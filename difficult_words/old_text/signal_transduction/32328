The bacterial chemotaxis network features robust adaptation implemented by negative integral feedback. Here, we show that the adaptation module can be characterized by measurement of the response to simple step-addition and removal of a chemoattractant. The method does not rely on a particular form of the receptor module, and thus can be used to characterize other integral feedback networks.
