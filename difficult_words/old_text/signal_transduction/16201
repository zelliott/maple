Sam68, a member of the signal transduction and activation of RNA metabolism (STAR) family of RNA-binding proteins, has been previously implicated as an adaptor molecule in different signaling systems, including leptin receptor (LEPR) signaling. LEPR activation is known to stimulate JAK-STAT, MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, thus mediating the biological effects of leptin in different cell types, including trophoblastic cells. We have recently found that leptin stimulation also promotes the overexpression and tyrosine phosphorylation of Sam68 in human trophoblastic JEG-3 cells, suggesting a role for Sam68 in leptin signaling and action in these cells. In the present work, we have studied the participation of Sam68 in the main signaling pathways activated by LEPR to increase growth and proliferation in trophoblastic JEG-3 cells.

We used an antisense strategy to down-regulate Sam68 expression in these cells, and we studied LEPR signaling by immunoprecipitation and poly-U affinity precipitation and by analyzing phosphorylation levels of signaling proteins by immunoblot. The effect of leptin on protein synthesis and proliferation was studied by ³[H]-leucine and ³[H]-thymidine incorporation.

Sam68 knockdown impaired leptin activation of JAK-STAT, PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways in JEG-3 cells. We have also found that leptin-stimulated Sam68 tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent on JAK-2 activity, since the pharmacological inhibitor AG490 prevents the phosphorylation of Sam68 in JEG-3 cells. Finally, the trophic and proliferative effect of leptin in trophoblastic cells is dependent on Sam68 expression, since its down-regulation impaired the leptin-stimulated DNA and protein synthesis.

These data demonstrate that Sam68 participates in the main signaling pathways of LEPR to mediate the trophic and proliferative effect of leptin in human trophoblastic cells.
