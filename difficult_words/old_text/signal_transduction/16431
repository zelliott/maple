PI3K/AKT signal pathway is an important intracellular signal transduction pathway. It plays important roles in cell apoptosis and survival by affecting the activity of downstream effector molecules, and it is closely associated with the development and progression of human tumors. Recent researches of PI3K/AKT indicate that this pathway plays important roles in tumor cells proliferation, blood vessel neogenesis, tumor metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The profound research of PI3K/AKT is beneficial to the prevention of tumor and to the finding of potential targets for new drugs. This article reviewed the composition, function and regulation of PI3K/AKT signal pathway, and its effect in metastasis and drug resistance of lung cancer.
