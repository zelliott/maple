Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) are crucial elements in eukaryotic signal transduction. Several reports suggested that the LMW-PTP family has oncogenic relevance. Moreover, LMW-PTP has been recognized as a negative regulator of insulin-mediated mitotic and metabolic signaling. Thus, inhibition of the LMW-PTP can be considered an attractive approach for the design of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of type II diabetes and for new antitumoral drugs. To date very few (and weak) inhibitors of LMW-PTP have been identified. On the basis of the reported weak activity of some flavonoids on phosphatases, we discovered a lead that originated a new class of highly active LMW-PTP inhibitors; these compounds inhibit also PTP-1B and are active in cellular assays. Docking experiments and SAR highlighted the possible binding mode of these compounds to the enzyme, putting the background for the future optimization of their inhibitory activity and selectivity towards the closely related enzyme PTP-1B.
