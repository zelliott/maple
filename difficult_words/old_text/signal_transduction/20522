CD151 is a member of the tetraspanin family that is implicated as a promoter             of the tumor metastasis of malignant cells. Tetraspanins form membrane complexes             with integrins. In the present study, we constructed a CD151-AAA mutant to assess             the roles of Rac, cdc42 and phospho-Rac/cdc42 (P-Rac/cdc42) and the effects of             CD151‑integrin complexes on the proliferation, migration and invasion of HepG2             cells. The pAAV-CD151 and pAAV‑CD151‑AAA mutant plasmids were constructed and             used to transiently transfect HepG2 cells using the Qiagen Attractene transfection             reagent. Following transfection, the expression of CD151 was determined by western             blotting. A cell proliferation assay was performed using the cell counting kit-8             (CCK-8) method, cell migration was assessed by a cell wound-healing assay and             cell invasion was evaluated in microchemotaxis chambers using FBS as the chemotactic             stimulus. The potential involvement of various signaling pathways was explored             using relevant antibodies. The association between CD151 and integrins was evaluated             by immunoblotting analysis. We found that CD151 promoted cell proliferation, migration             and chemotaxis and increased P-Rac/cdc42 activity. The CD151-AAA mutant had reduced             cellular proliferation, migration and invasion compared with the CD151 mutant.             Moreover, the CD151-AAA mutant abrogated the association between CD151 and integrins.             These data suggest that CD151 forms complexes by interacting with integrins, particularly             α3β1 and α6β1, and thereby affects the functioning of the HepG2 cells. The mechanism             is possibly related to the Rac, cdc42 and P-Rac/cdc42 signaling pathways.
