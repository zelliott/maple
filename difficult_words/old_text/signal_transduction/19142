It has been reported that genomic DNA methylation decreases gradually during cell culture and an organism's aging. However, less is known about the methylation changes of age-related specific genes in aging. p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p16(INK4a) are cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors that are critical for the replicative senescence of normal cells. In this study, we show that p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p16(INK4a) have different methylation patterns during the aging process of normal human 2BS and WI-38 fibroblasts. p21(Waf1/Cip1) promoter is gradually methylated up into middle-aged fibroblasts but not with senescent fibroblasts, whereas p16(INK4a) is always unmethylated in the aging process. Correspondently, the protein levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT3a increase from young to middle-aged fibroblasts but decrease in the senescent fibroblasts, while DNMT3b decreases stably from young to senescent fibroblasts. p21(Waf1/Cip1) promoter methylation directly represses its expression and blocks the radiation-induced DNA damage-signaling pathway by p53 in middle-aged fibroblasts. More importantly, demethylation by 5-aza-CdR or DNMT1 RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in an increased p21(Waf1/Cip1) level and premature senescence of middle-aged fibroblasts demonstrated by cell growth arrest and high beta-Galactosidase expression. Our results suggest that p21(Waf1/Cip1) but not p16(INK4a) is involved in the DNA methylation mediated aging process. p21(Waf1/Cip1) promoter methylation may be a critical biological barrier to postpone the aging process.
