Until now, ROS-GC1 signal transduction system was thought to be exclusive to photoreceptors in the retina. Two recent reports, however, now show that this is not the case. In one, the ROS-GC1 signal transduction system has been identified and characterized in pinealocyte neurons. This signaling is modulated by norepinephrine. However, the response of the individual pinealocyte neuron to the norepinephrine signal depends on whether the GCAP1-linked (results in hyperpolarization) or S100beta-linked (results in depolarization) pathway is operational in the pinealocyte. The GCAP1-linked pathway results in hyperpolarization, while the S100beta-linked pathway, in depolarization. The two pathways are mutually exclusive. In the other report, the calcium-modulated ROS-GC1:GCAP1 signaling system has been discovered in mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. These findings raise the possibility that a common theme of calcium-modulated ROS-GC signaling may be utilized in a wide variety of neurosensory cells. This idea is also supported from evolutionary and functional perspectives.
