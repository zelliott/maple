In this report we present the first in-depth description of the biochemical and pharmacological properties of rabbit cardiac GH receptors. The apparent M(r)'s of the [125I]human (h) GH-receptor complexes were 380, 205, 90, 62, 52 and 38 kDa as demonstrated by an autoradiograph of affinity-labelled cardiac GH receptors separated under non-reducing conditions by SDS PAGE. The [125I]hGH-cardiac GH receptor complexes were disulfide-linked since the M(r)s of the complexes diminished to 170, 116, 97, 71, 45 and 38 kDa under reducing conditions, indicating the presence of multiple receptors, receptor-associated macromolecules or receptor and ligand in various ratios. The pharmacology of cardiac GH receptors is not typical of GH receptors present in other tissues. In radio receptor assays, both bovine GH and ovine prolactin were 50-fold and 100-fold less potent, respectively, than unlabelled hGH, in blocking the binding of [125I]hGH to cardiac binding sites and were, therefore, extremely weak antagonists. Similarly, neither bovine GH nor ovine prolactin blocked the [125I]hGH affinity-labelling of cardiac GH receptors compared to equivalent doses of unlabelled hGH. Parameters which characterize the kinetics for the association, dissociation and equilibrium binding of [125I]hGH to cardiac GH receptors were ascertained. Association kinetics for the binding of [125I]hGH to heart GH receptors exhibited a maximum specific binding at 17 h and 25 degrees C. The association of [125I]hGH to heart GH receptors was reversible with approximately 15 h required for half of the specifically bound [125I]hGH to dissociate. The coupling of [125I]hGH to heart GH receptors was optimum at pH 6 and the strength of the equilibrium binding, as measured by the ED50, was approximately 2 ng/ml. These data indicate that the cardiac GH receptors are pharmacologically distinct and that there is a M(r) heterogeneity in the [125I]hGH receptor complexes.
