Adenosine acts in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), one of the main brain sites related to cardiovascular control. In the present study we show that A(1) adenosine receptor (A(1R)) activation promotes an increase on alpha(2)-adrenoceptor (Alpha(2R)) binding in brainstem cell culture from newborn rats. We investigated the intracellular cascade involved in such modulatory process using different intracellular signaling molecule inhibitors as well as calcium chelators. Phospholipase C, protein kinase Ca(2+)-dependent, IP(3) receptor and intracellular calcium were shown to participate in A(1R)/Alpha(2R) interaction. In conclusion, this result might be important to understand the role of adenosine within the NTS regarding autonomic cardiovascular control.
