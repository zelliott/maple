Resumption of meiosis of mammalian oocytes is facilitated by the maturation promoting factor (MPF) and accompanied by activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) which are phosphorylated by the MAPK kinase (MEK). In this study we examined the effects of PD 98059, which inhibits the activity of MEK, on in vitro maturation of pig oocytes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were cultured in the presence or absence of the drug (50 microM) for various time periods. To elucidate the influence of cumulus cells, COCs were first cultured in inhibitor-free medium, subsequently denuded, and incubated further in PD 98059 supplemented medium. Reversibility of drug action as tested following PD 98059 treatment of COCs by transferring them to drug-free medium. Culture of COCs in medium supplemented with PD 98059 prevents resumption of nuclear maturation in the majority of COCs. This inhibition was reversible and accompanied by a non-activation of both MAP and MPF. Addition of the MEK inhibitor to extracts of in vitro matured oocytes revealed that the kinase activities were not directly influenced by the inhibitor, suggesting a link between MAP and MPF kinases. Preincubation of COCs in inhibitor-free medium for 6 h followed by further culture of COCs or denuded oocytes in the presence of PD 98059 for various periods resulted in elevated MAP and MPF kinase activities, indicating an early and transient MEK signalling in the oocyte itself. These results support the idea that MAP and MPF are involved in the induction of germinal vesicle breakdown in porcine oocytes.
