MRE11 plays an important role in the signal transduction of DNA damage response, therefore this study was purposed to explore the relationship between hMRE11 focus formation and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused by etoposide (VP-16) in human promonocytic cells U937. After U937 cells were treated with VP-16, the drug-induced DSBs were assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), the gene transcription levels of hMRE11 were evaluated by RT-PCR, the nuclear focus formation of hMRE11 protein was examined using immunofluorescence technique, the cell cycle in parallel was analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed that the percentage of U937 cells with DSBs induced by VP-16 raised from 13.0 +/- 2.3% in VP-16 2 microg/ml to 32.0 +/- 4.3% in VP-16 20 microg/ml (P < 0.01) along with increase of VP-16 dose. No difference of the hMRE11 mRNA level in U937 cells following the treatment with 100 microg/ml VP-16 at different times was discovered (P > 0.05). The hMRE11 protein was abundantly and uniformly distributed in the nuclei of untreated U937 cells outside of nucleoli, however, it formed discrete nuclear foci following VP-16 treatment. The mean value of nuclear foci increased by 5 to 20 times following the drug dosing (P < 0.01). An average of 5 nuclear foci per positive nucleus were observed at a dose of 2 microg/ml, and it was increased to an average of over 14 nuclear foci per positive nucleus after treating with VP-16 20 microg/ml. The percentage of nuclei containing hMRE11 nuclear foci also increased from less than 10% after treatment wiht VP-16 2 microg/ml to over 50% after VP-16 20 microg/ml (P < 0.01) following treatment with VP-16. After U937 cells were treated with 100 microg/ml VP-16 for 2 hours and fixed at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours, the percentage of nuclei with hMRE11 nuclear foci increased to 61.54 +/- 3.6% (the control U937 cells: 0.47 +/- 1.17%, P < 0.01) at 8 hours, with a subsequent decrease in the percentage of nuclear foci-positive cells by 24 hours. The ratio of S-phase U937 cells at 8 hours after being treated with 100 microg/ml VP-16 for 2 hours was 47.55 +/- 2.35%, and that without 100 microg/ml VP-16 was 21.95 +/- 2.91% (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the nuclear focus formation of hMRE11 protein may be a response to DNA damage induced by topoisomerase II inhibitor VP-16 in human promonocytic cell line U937.
