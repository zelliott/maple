In the central nervous system (CNS), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is reported to serve as a fast excitatory neurotransmitter via P2X receptor. To examine possible involvement of inhibition of ATP signal-transmission in anesthetic mechanism, the effect of intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of P2 receptor antagonists on the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane and isoflurane was studied in rat. ICV administration of P2 receptor antagonists, suramin and pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS), significantly reduced MAC of both anesthetics. The reduction of the MAC by both suramin and PPADS was dose-dependent and reached plateau at 150 microgram/rat. These results suggest that the inhibition of ATP-signal transmission may be involved in analgesic or anesthetic effect in brain.
