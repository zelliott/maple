Since colorectal cancer cells are characterized by both high immune- and multidrug-resistance, investigations concerning the search for cytokines, especially interferons, which would delete cancer cells have prospects of success only if cancer cells became sensitive to such treatment. The prerequisite for successful treatment is to discover how the immune system kills colorectal cancer cells. In this article we focus our attention on signal transduction pathways in colorectal cancer cells, which are characterized by a variety of mechanisms that enable them to survive the hostile microenvironment created by immune system attack. Knowledge relevant to cancer cell immunity to defense mechanisms is crucial for the prospects of cytokine-supportet therapy. A case in point is the human colorectal cancer cell line COLO 205, which is not affected by individual cytokines, although it becomes vulnerable to combined treatment with some of them. It is not clear what factors make COLO 205 cells resistant to cytotoxins, however; it seems plausible to point to the complex signaling pathways, and STAT proteins in particular. Another feature of COLO 205 cells avoiding cytokine-mediated death signals is the reverse signaling causing activated macrophages to become dormant in response to soluble TNF-alpha receptors (sTNF-alpha R1, sTNF-alpha R2). Similarly, COLO 205 cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 released by activated macrophages. Cancer cells release anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which ceases the action of PMNCs. It should be stressed that STATs mediate and/or activate the transcription of several genes indispensable for cell death. Cancer cells isolated from large bowel tumors express elevated constitutive activity of STATs inhibitors leading to antiapoptosis. Correspondingly, the increased survival rates of these cells could be attributed to accelerated actions of the PI-3K/Akt, cPKC/Raf1/ERK, NF- kappaB/JNK, or Jak/STAT cascades. Finally, an uncertainty in large bowel cancer cells is whether STATs might redirect the cytokine signal from cell deletion to cell survival.
