Vitexin, a lignan compound, has been shown to exert apoptotic actions on             human breast cancer cell lines and to have anti-inflammatory activities. Nevertheless,             there is currently no study addressing the effects of vitexin on the induction             of apoptosis in U937 human leukemia cells. The aim of this study was to determine             the anticancer effects and molecular mechanisms of vitexin on U937 leukemia cells.             We showed that vitexin can potently induce programmed cell death in U937 leukemia             cell growth as well as morphological changes that were examined by MTT assay and             phase contrast microscopy, respectively. The DNA content and the levels of mitochondrial             membrane potential (∆Ψm) were determined by flow cytometric analysis. The cell             cycle arrest-regulated and apoptosis-associated protein levels were measured by             western blotting. Vitexin-triggered apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease of             the level of ∆Ψm and the percentage of viability and provoked apoptosis in U937             cells. The downregulation of the protein level for Bcl-2 with the simultaneous             upregulation of caspase-3 and -9 protein expression in U937 cells were observed             after treatment with vitexin. Therefore, our data provide a potential mechanism             for the chemopreventive activity of vitexin, and we suggest that vitexin may serve             as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of human leukemia.
