Different protocols of cadmium (Cd) exposure in non-cytotoxic conditions (i.e. 10 microM Cd for 18 h), and their effect on nitric oxide (NO) generation induced by NO inductor agents (NOIA) in peritoneal macrophages (pM) were studied. In all cases, NOIA (i.e. bacterial lipopolysaccharide [LPS], phorbol ester [PMA], okadaic acid [OA] or their combinations [LPS/OA] and [LPS/PMA]) were added at the beginning of the first incubation, only. Simultaneously exposure with 10 microM Cd enhanced NO generation and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression evoked by LPS, OA, PMA; those induced by LPS/PMA were not modified; and those caused by LPS/OA in relation to culture without Cd (medium) decreased. Double incubation, either with or without Cd (Cd+Cd or medium+medium), or Cd added at the start of the first or second incubation only (Cd+medium or medium+Cd), were tested. After the second incubation, medium+Cd protocol produced the highest NO generation in relation to other exposure protocols. When NO production was measured at the end of the second incubation, Cd+medium protocol enhanced NO production induced by OA, and LPS/OA, while medium+Cd protocol enhanced the response to LPS, PMA, and LPS/OA, in both cases in relation to the first incubation. Cd+Cd incubation protocol decreases the response to all NOIA in relation to another protocols. Cd effect on NO generation in macrophages is dependent on protocol and timing of exposure.
