Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) is a key regulator of epithelial cell proliferation, immune function and angiogenesis. Because TGFβ signaling maintains epithelial homeostasis, dysregulated TGFβ signaling is common in many malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Defective TGFβ signaling in epithelial cells causes hyperproliferation, reduced apoptosis and increased genomic instability, and the compensatory increase in TGFβ production by tumor epithelial cells with TGFβ signaling defects further promotes tumor growth and metastases by increasing angiogenesis and inflammation in tumor stromal cells. Here, we review the mouse models that we used to study TGFβ signaling in HNSCC.
