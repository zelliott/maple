Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta) inhibits cell-cycle progression of many types of cells by arresting them in G(1)/S phase through inhibition of the active cyclin-Cdk complexes that lead to inhibition of Rb phosphorylation. In gastric-cancer cells, SNU16, TGF-beta treatment induced enhanced expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) (p21), which inhibited the kinase activity of cyclin-D- and cyclin-E-associated Cdks and blocked p130 phosphorylation. TGF-beta also enhanced the stability of p130, suggesting that hypophosphorylation of p130 and increased stability of p130 contribute to p130-mediated G(1) arrest in gastric-cancer cells. Our results demonstrate that p21 and p130 are major downstream targets of TGF-beta in gastric-cancer cells and that a p21-G(1) cyclin/Cdks-p130/E2F pathway mediates growth inhibition by TGF-beta in these cells.
