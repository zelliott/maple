Differentiation of immature double positive (DP) CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes into single positive (SP) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is referred to as positive selection and requires physical contact with thymic cortical epithelium. We now have identified "coinducer" molecules on DP thymocytes that, together with TCR, signal DP thymocytes to differentiate into SP T cells in vitro in the absence of thymic epithelium. A remarkable number of different molecules on DP thymocytes possessed "coinducing" activity, including CD2, CD5, CD24, CD28, CD49d, CD81, and TSA-1. Interestingly, in vitro differentiation occurred in the absence of lineage-specific signals, yet resulted in the selective generation of CD4+CD8- T cells. Thus, the present study has identified surface molecules that can signal DP thymocytes to differentiate into SP T cells in the absence of thymic epithelium and has characterized a default pathway for CD4+ T cell differentiation.
