1. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the interaction between hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) and carbon monoxide (CO) during recurrent febrile seizures (FS) 2.H(2)S and CO are important intra- and intercellular messengers, regulating various brain functions. Our recent studies showed that both of them alleviate the hippocampal damage induced by recurrent FS. In the present study, on a rat model of recurrent FS, we found that hydroxylamine (an inhibitor of cystathionine b-synthase, CBS) reduced CO level and down regulated heme oxygenase (HO-1) expression, while NaHS (a donor of H(2)S) elevated CO level and upregulated HO-1 expression. ZnPP-IX (an inhibitor of HO-1) decreased H(2)S formation and down regulated CBS expression, while hemin (which increases the production of endogenous CO) enhanced H(2)S formation and elevated CBS expression. 3. Our data demonstrate that endogenous H(2)S and CO are in synergy with each other in recurrent FS.
