The effects of osteogenic inhibitory factors secreted by human periodontal ligament fibroblasts were studied in rat bone marrow stromal cell cultures. Serum-free conditioned medium from cultures of fibroblasts strongly depressed formation of mineralized tissue by bone marrow cell cultures. The inhibitory activity was reduced by treatment of fibroblast cultures with indomethacin or by pretreatment of conditioned medium with specific antibodies to prostaglandins (PGs) E2 and F2 alpha. Passage of conditioned medium over octadecyl columns enriched PGs four-fold and significantly increased inhibitory activity. Inhibition of mineralization was replicated by treatment of bone-cell cultures with PGs B2, D2, E2, F2 alpha and I2 at concentrations of 350 ng/ml to 350 pg/ml. All combinations of these agents were inhibitory but PGE2 and PGF2 alpha exhibited the greatest inhibition at low concentrations (350 pg/ml). These experiments indicate that fibroblasts secrete PGs which can inhibit bone formation, and this may be one mechanism whereby fibroblasts can modulate osteogenesis at the interfaces of soft and mineralizing connective tissues.
