The steroid hormone 17beta-estradiol regulates the normal function and development of the mammalian nervous system. Many of estradiol's effects are mediated via the nuclear hormone estrogen receptors ERalpha and ERbeta. In addition to regulating estrogen-responsive gene expression, estradiol also acts in an immediate and cell-specific fashion to regulate various intracellular signal transduction pathways. The goal of this review is to develop a contextual framework to understand the generalized function of estrogen during development of brain regions not known to be sexually specialized. However, it is first important to build this framework on the more well-developed foundation of estrogen's gonad-driven sex-specific actions. As a result, a discussion of known and proposed mechanisms of estrogen actions in reproductive and other tissues will be presented. Building upon this information, a review of our research group's recent in vitro and in vivo studies that have focused on elucidating the mechanisms of estrogen actions in neurons of the non-sexually specialized cerebellum will be presented. While the full spectrum of estrogen action during normal cerebellar development remains unresolved, results of recent studies have revealed a pathologic role for estrogen and estrogen receptors in medulloblastoma, common pediatric brain tumors that arise from cerebellar granule cell-like precursors. The potential use of anti-estrogen signaling agents as adjuvant therapy for medulloblastoma is proposed based on those finding.
