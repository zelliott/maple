MicroRNAs have recently emerged as key regulators of cancers, miR-329 located on 14q32.31 is one of down-regulated miRNAs in glioma, but the function and molecular mechanisms of miR-329 in determining the malignant phenotype of human glioma are elusive. This study therefore was conducted to investigate the role of miR-329 in biological behaviors of human glioma LN18 and T98G cell lines and its molecular mechanisms.

Nine patients with GBM were analyzed for the expression of miR-329 by quantitative RT-PCR. MiR-329 overexpression was established by transfecting miR-329 precursor into LN18 and T98G cells, and its effects on cell proliferation were studied using MTT assay, anchorage-independent growth ability assay, colony formation assays, Bromodeoxyuridine labeling and immunofluorescence.The effects of miR-329 on cell cycle were studied by flow cytometry. The target of miR-329 was determined by luciferase assays. The regulation of miR-329 on Akt pathway was determined by western blot.

The E2F1 was identified as the target of miR-329. Overexpression of miR-329 blocked G1/S transition in LN18 and T98G cell lines, dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and the ability of colony formation. MiR-329 significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels of intracellular kinases Akt and expression of cyclin D1, but the expression of p21 was upregulated, cell growth was suppressed by inhibiting E2F1-mediated Akt pathway.

MiR-329 may inhibit cell proliferation in human glioma cells through regulating E2F1-mediated suppression of Akt pathway.
