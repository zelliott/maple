Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is oncogenic and indispensable for EBV-mediated B cell transformation. LMP1 is capable of activating several intracellular signaling pathways including the NF-kappaB pathway, which contributes to the EBV-mediated cell transformation. Two regions in the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail of LMP1, namely C-terminal activating regions 1 and 2 (CTAR1 and CTAR2), are responsible for NF-kappaB activation, with CTAR2 being the main NF-kappaB activator. Although the CTAR1-mediated NF-kappaB activation was previously shown to be TRAF3-dependent, we showed here that the CTAR2-mediated NF-kappaB activation is mainly TRAF6-dependent but TRAF2/5-independent. In contrast to the interleukin-1 receptor/toll-like receptor-mediated NF-kappaB pathways, the CTAR2-mediated NF-kappaB pathway does not require MyD88, IRAK1, or IRAK4 for TRAF6 engagement. Furthermore, we showed that TAK1 is required for NF-kappaB activation by LMP1. Thus, LMP1 utilizes two distinct pathways to activate NF-kappaB: a major one through CTAR2/TRAF6/TAK1/IKKbeta (canonical pathway) and a minor one through CTAR1/TRAF3/NIK/IKKalpha (noncanonical pathway).
