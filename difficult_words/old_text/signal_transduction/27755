The ventromedial cells (VM cells) of the moth Manduca sexta belong to a peptide hormone signaling hierarchy that directs an episodic and stereotyped behavior pattern, ecdysis. The VM cells respond to declining ecdysteroid titers at the end of the final larval molt with a transcription-dependent decrease in spike threshold and the abrupt release of the previously stockpiled neuropeptide, eclosion hormone (EH). This report describes whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of acutely isolated VM cell somata made to identify membrane currents that may underlie the increase in VM cell excitability during EH release and that may contribute to abrupt peptide release. There were at least three voltage- and time-dependent conductances in the VM cells. The inward current was carried exclusively by a voltage-dependent inward Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)), and the outward currents were a combination of a Ca(2+)-dependent outward K(+) current (I(K(Ca))) and a transient, voltage-dependent outward K(+) current, the A current (I(A)). In current-clamp recordings, the currents present in the acutely isolated somata were sufficient to generate membrane properties similar to those observed in the VM cells in situ. This study represents the first step toward characterization of the mechanisms underlying the abrupt release of EH stores from the VM cells preceding ecdysis.
