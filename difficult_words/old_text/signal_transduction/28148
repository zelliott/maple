Cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) inhibits death receptor-mediated apoptosis by specific interaction with FADD and procaspase-8, and may thus interfere with activation events mediated by FADD and caspase-8. Recent studies, however, suggest that c-FLIP also transmits activation signals. The role of c-FLIP on T-cell activation was examined here using several transgenic mice with variable c-FLIP expression. In all c-FLIP-transgenic mice, Fas-mediated apoptosis and in vitro activation-induced T-cell death were suppressed, and T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production were inhibited. c-FLIP transgene also promoted in vivo thymocyte death. Higher c-FLIP transgene expression was correlated with a more profound suppression of T-cell activation and a prominent disturbance in mature thymocyte development. There was no evidence of increased activation and proliferation in all c-FLIP-transgenic T cells examined. Instead, suppression of T-cell activation in c-FLIP-transgenic T cells could be a combinatory effect of FADD/caspase-8-dependent signals and c-FLIP-specific activities.
