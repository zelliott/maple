The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has at least five signal pathways containing a MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade. The high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) MAPK pathway is essential for yeast survival in high osmolarity environment. This mini-review surveys recent developments in regulation of the HOG pathway with specific emphasis on the roles of protein phosphatases and protein subcellular localization. The Hog1 MAPK in the HOG pathway is negatively regulated jointly by the protein tyrosine phosphatases Ptp2/Ptp3 and the type 2 protein phosphatases Ptc1/Ptc2/Ptc3. Specificities of these phosphatases are determined by docking interactions as well as their cellular localizations. The subcellular localizations of the osmosensors (Sln1 and Sho1), kinases (Pbs2, Hog1), and phosphatases in the HOG pathway are intricately regulated to achieve their specific functions.
