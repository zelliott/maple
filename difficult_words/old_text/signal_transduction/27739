Thrombopoietin (TPO) plays a critical role in megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation. Using various cultured cell lines, several recent studies have implicated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in megakaryocyte differentiation. In the study reported here, we examined the role played by thrombopoietin-induced MAPK activity in a cytokine-dependent cell line (BAF3/Mpl) and in primary murine megakaryocytes. In both systems, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1 and 2 MAPK phosphorylation was rapidly induced by TPO stimulation. To identify the Mpl domain responsible for MAPK activation, BAF3 cells expressing truncated forms of the Mpl receptor were studied. Phosphorylation of ERKs did not require elements of the cytoplasmic signaling domain distal to Box 2 and was not dependent on phosphorylation of the adapter protein Shc. ERK activation in murine megakaryocytes was maximal at 10 minutes and was markedly decreased over the subsequent 3 hours. Next, the physiologic consequences of MAPK inhibition were studied. Using the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD 98059, blockade of MAPK activity substantially reduced TPO-dependent proliferation in BAF3/Mpl cells and markedly decreased mean megakaryocyte ploidy in cultures. To exclude an indirect effect of MAPK inhibition on stromal cells in whole bone marrow, CD41(+) cells were selected and then cultured in TPO. The number of polyploid megakaryocytes derived from the CD41-selected cells was also significantly reduced by MEK inhibition, as was their geometric mean ploidy. These studies show an important role for MAPK in TPO-induced endomitosis and underscore the value of primary cells when studying the physiologic effects of signaling pathways.
