The effects of staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor, on the signal transduction and proliferation of thymocytes were studied. Signal transduction in response to Concanavalin A (Con A) as well as Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced augmentation of [3H]inositol incorporation into phospholipids were inhibited by staurosporine (> or = 10(-8) M). Staurosporine inhibited thymocyte proliferation in response to Con A in the presence or absence of the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (TPA) (10 nM). This inhibition was observed regardless of whether staurosporine was added together with Con A or 3 hr later. High concentrations of staurosporine (> 10(-8) M) inhibited thymocyte proliferation induced by the calcium ionophore A23187 and the phorbol ester TPA, whereas lower concentrations of the inhibitor (< or = 10(-8) M) enhanced thymidine incorporation in response to these activators. This dual effect of staurosporine was also observed in the presence of the staurosporine-related kinase inhibitor, K252a. In contrast, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG490, inhibited the response to A23187 and TPA at all concentrations of the inhibitor and no augmentation was seen. Interleukin 2 (IL-2)-driven mitogenesis in IL-2-dependent cells was also inhibited by staurosporine. We suggest that the inhibition of thymocyte proliferation by staurosporine results from inhibition of both protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase: the augmentation of the response to A23187 and TPA results from inhibition of protein kinase C. Inhibition of signal transduction as well as inhibition of IL-2-driven mitogenesis result from inhibition of tyrosine kinase.
