Histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity was first discovered about 40 years ago, but it was not until the molecular identification of the first HDACs in 1996 that this family of enzymes gained prominence. In addition to histones, HDACs reverse lysine acetylation of various non-histone proteins located in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Here, we examine the nuclear roles of these enzymes, with a specific focus on their active crosstalk with different chromatin regulators.
