Resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene; RSV), a natural polyphenol found in a variety of daily food including grapes and red wine, has long been suspected to have multifaceted health beneficial properties, including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant, and anticancer activities. Over the past few years, numerous studies have suggested that suppressing the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a critical regulator of cell metabolism, growth, and proliferation, may provide a key mechanism underlying the anticarcinogenic properties of resveratrol. It has been found that resveratrol targets multiple components of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase(PI3K)/Akt and mTOR signaling pathways, including PI3K, Akt, PTEN, and DEPTOR, suggesting that this natural compound and its derivatives may offer a promising new cancer treatment. In the current review, we discuss recent findings on the molecular mechanisms regulating mTOR signaling and the therapeutic potential of resveratrol for cancer treatment by targeting mTOR.
