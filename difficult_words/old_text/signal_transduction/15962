Many moths use sex pheromones to find their mates in the dark. Their antennae are well developed with lateral branches to receive the pheromone efficiently. However, how these structures have evolved remains elusive, because the mechanism of development of these antennae has not been studied at a molecular level. To elucidate the developmental mechanism of this type of antenna, we observed morphogenesis, cell proliferation, cell death and antennal patterning gene expression in the branched antenna of the silk moth, Bombyx mori. Region-specific cell proliferation and almost ubiquitous apoptosis occur during early pupal stages and appear to shape the lateral branch cooperatively. Antennal patterning genes are expressed in a pattern largely conserved among insects with branchless antennae until the late 5th larval instar but most of them change their expression dramatically to a pattern prefiguring the lateral branch during metamorphosis. These findings imply that although antennal primordium is patterned by conserved mechanisms before metamorphosis, most of the antennal patterning genes are reused to form the lateral branch during metamorphosis. We propose that the acquisition of a new regulatory circuit of antennal patterning genes may have been an important event during evolution of the sensory antenna with lateral branches in the Lepidoptera.
