Tight junctions have long been regarded as simple barriers that separate compartments of different compositions, but recent research indicates that different types of signalling proteins and transduction pathways are associated with these junctions. They receive and convert signals from the cell interior to regulate junction assembly and function, and transmit signals to the cell interior to modulate gene expression and cell behaviour.
