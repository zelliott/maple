squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is one of the most common malignancies, the treatment of which constitutes a therapeutic challenge.

the purpose of this review is to provide an update on the pharmacotherapy for the treatment of HNSCC focusing mainly on molecular-targeted therapies. An overview of the different novel therapeutic agents that can selectively inhibit signaling pathways and receptors that are involved in the development and progression of cancer especially in HNSCC is presented.

the treatment of HNSCC is traditionally based on surgery and radiotherapy for early-stage HNSCC; however, chemotherapy is no longer used only for palliation, and individualized patient treatment assisted by molecular-targeted therapies represents a future therapeutic challenge.
