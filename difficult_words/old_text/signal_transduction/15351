The relationship between chronic pancreatitis (CP) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is unclear. CP is a risk factor for PDAC, CP is found within the vicinity of PDAC, and both share many similar genetic alterations. However, it has been long thought that PDAC arises only from duct cells. However, we have recently found that excessive activity within the Ras signaling pathway can lead to acinar cell death or metaplasia and is associated with the development of fibrosis resembling CP and the development of PDAC from acinar cells through the full complement of preneoplastic (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia) lesions. Therefore, it is time to reevaluate the relationship between CP and PDAC. We proposed a new model in which Ras activity is the direct link between these 2 diseases. Here we will briefly review the shared properties between CP and PDAC and describe the new model.
