A hallmark of cystic fibrosis is the massive recruitment of neutrophils into the lung compartment in response to chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The overexuberant neutrophilic response results in release of proteases (e.g. neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinase-9) leading to matrix breakdown, airway remodeling, and progressive loss of lung function. Doxycycline is used clinically for the management of periodontitis due to its potent direct inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases; however, little is known regarding its potential anti-inflammatory properties and clinical utility in the context of cystic fibrosis airway disease. CF (IB3-1) and corrected (S9) bronchial epithelial cell lines were used to determine the cytotoxicity and anti-inflammatory effects of doxycycline in-vitro. Exposure to doxycycline, at low concentrations, resulted in minimal cell death and dose dependent reductions in release of CXCL-8 and MMP-9 protein. To confirm these findings, mechanistic analysis revealed ERK 1/2, p38, and JNK, but not NF-ÎºB p65 dependent cell signaling inhibition with doxycycline treatment. These findings indicate that doxycycline exhibits anti-inflammatory activity in CF lung epithelial cells at concentrations below the cytotoxic potential. These data are encouraging and indicate in-vivo studies are warranted.
