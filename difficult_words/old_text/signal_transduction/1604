The thiazolidenedione, rosiglitazone, increases basal and/or insulin-stimulated glucose transport in various cell types by diverse but uncertain mechanisms that may involve insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1-dependent PI3K. Presently, in 3T3/L1 adipocytes, rosiglitazone induced sizable increases in basal glucose transport that were: dependent on PI3K, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1), and PKC-lambda; accompanied by increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and Cbl-dependent increases in PI3K and PKC-lambda activity; but not accompanied by increases in IRS-1/2-dependent PI3K or protein kinase B activity. Additionally, rosiglitazone increased IRS-1 and IRS-2 levels, thereby enhancing insulin effects on IRS-1- and IRS-2-dependent PI3K and downstream signaling factors PKC-lambda and protein kinase B. Our findings suggest that Cbl participates in mediating effects of rosiglitazone on PI3K, PDK-1, and PKC-lambda and the glucose transport system and that this Cbl-dependent pathway complements the IRS-1 and IRS-2 pathways for activating PI3K, PDK-1, and PKC-lambda during combined actions of rosiglitazone and insulin in 3T3/L1 cells.
