Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) stimulate proliferation, differentiation and motility of different cell types. The cellular effects of FGF are transduced by its interaction with any one of four members of a family of high affinity, cell surface FGF receptors (FGFRs) that have autophosphorylating tyrosine kinase activity. Activation of FGFR causes release of various low molecular weight signaling molecules which are required for the pleotropic effects of FGFs. We report here that basic FGF plays critical role in membrane phospholipid hydrolysis in NIH 3T3 cells that are stably transfected with FGFR1. Upon binding to FGFR1, basic FGF stimulates cytosolic form of phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1) and phospholipase D (PLD), the key enzymes for the production of various lipid second messengers, in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, cPLA2 catalytic activation requires serine phosphorylation by p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and possibly pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein coupling. On the other hand, phosphatidyl inositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis requires direct phosphorylation at tyrosine residue of the PLC-gamma1 isozyme. The activation of PLD needs direct or indirect receptor tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C (PKC) activities. Additionally, it also requires botulinum toxin C-sensitive Rho-like G-protein activation. All these results suggest that the pleotropic effects of FGF are exerted through its tyrosine kinase receptors and individual effectors are activated via distinguishable signaling mechanisms according to the cell's need.
