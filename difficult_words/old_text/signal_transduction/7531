Thiazole is a well-known five-membered heterocyclic compound. Various methods have been worked out for its synthesis. In the last few decades, a lot of work has been done on thiazole ring in order to find new compounds related to this scaffold acting as an antioxidant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, diuretic, anticonvulsant, neuroprotective and antitumor or cytotoxic drugs with lesser side effects. This review presents the up to date development of different thiazole derivatives.

This review gives an account of the recent therapeutic patent literature (2008 - 2012) describing the applications of thiazole and its derivatives on selected activities. In this review, many of the therapeutic applications of thiazole derivatives reported in international patents have been discussed. In addition to selected biological data, some of pharmaceutical applications are also summarized. Because of the large number of patents registered in this period relative to thiazole derivatives the attention was focused, in this first part of the review, on inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, inhibitors of protein kinase and derivatives modulating enzymes related to metabolism.

This review of patented products presents the thiazole ring as the nucleus of the derivatives considered from a medicinal chemistry perspective. The applications are based firstly on the specific enzyme target with very low development in the disease treatment. Most of the described compounds are shown to have beneficial therapeutic effects but at the same time these compounds, selective for 'multi-signaling pathway' targets, may also increase the side-effect potential.
