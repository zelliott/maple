Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a stress-inducible gene and encodes a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors. However, the physiological significance of ATF3 induction by stress signals is not clear. In this report, we describe several lines of evidence supporting a role of ATF3 in stress-induced beta-cell apoptosis. First, ATF3 is induced in beta cells by signals relevant to beta-cell destruction: proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and high concentrations of glucose and palmitate. Second, induction of ATF3 is mediated in part by the NF-kappaB and Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, two stress-induced pathways implicated in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Third, transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in beta cells develop abnormal islets and defects secondary to beta-cell deficiency. Fourth, ATF3 knockout islets are partially protected from cytokine- or nitric oxide-induced apoptosis. Fifth, ATF3 is expressed in the islets of patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and in the islets of nonobese diabetic mice that have developed insulitis or diabetes. Taken together, our results suggest ATF3 to be a novel regulator of stress-induced beta-cell apoptosis.
