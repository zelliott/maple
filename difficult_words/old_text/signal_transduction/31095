Stroma-mediated myelopoiesis depends upon growth-factors and an appropriate intercellular microenvironment, whose polarity is relevant for granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Here we have studied qualitative and quantitative aspects of ganglioside participation in controls of the microenvironment required to sustain myelopoiesis. We analysed ganglioside synthesis, expression and shedding by two primary liver stromal cell cultures isolated from wild type and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) receptor knockout mice. The latter one has a higher capacity to sustain myelopoiesis. FDC-P1 myeloid growth factor-dependent cell line was used as the reporter system, monitoring the cell survival and proliferation that reflect the bio-availability and the activity of GM-CSF. Although the two stromal cells synthesised the same gangliosides their relative content was quite different. FDC-P1 proliferation decreased in cultures in which ganglioside synthesis was inhibited in the stroma, as well as in presence of stroma cell supernatants in which GM3 was neutralised by the anti-GM3 monoclonal antibody. Addition of exogenous GM3 reverted the inhibition and sustained proliferation of FDC-P1 cells. FDC-P1 cells do not accumulate GM3, but they are able to take up the stroma-produced sphingolipids. Thus, stroma has a double role in sustaining myelopoiesis, providing both growth factor(s) and ganglioside(s) required for the optimal stimulation of the myeloid cell proliferation, and the IFNgamma mediated stroma-dependent controls of myelopoiesis are determinant for this cell interaction.
