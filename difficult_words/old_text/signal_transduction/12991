Double-positive thymocytes are short-lived bipotential cells whose developmental fate is determined by the specificity of their TCRs. A relatively small number of double-positive thymocytes undergo positive selection in the thymus and these are signaled to differentiate either into CD4(+) or CD8(+) mature T cells. The mechanism by which double-positive thymocytes determine their appropriate CD4/CD8 fate has been the subject of intense theoretical debate and rigorous experimental analysis. In the last year, 'signal duration' has been offered as a replacement for 'signal strength' as a major determinant of the CD4/CD8 decision, a deceptively minor refinement that requires a major change in our understanding of how signaled double-positive thymocytes differentiate into mature T cells. Indeed, the kinetic signaling model provides a radically new perspective on the mechanism by which the CD4/CD8 lineage decision is made.
