Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) are a family of enzymes that synthesize one of the major second messengers, cAMP, upon stimulation. Since the report of the first adenylyl cyclase (AC) gene in 1989, tremendous efforts have been devoted to identifying and characterizing more AC isozymes. In the past decade, significant knowledge regarding the basic structure, tissue distribution, and regulation of AC isozymes has been accumulated. Because members of the AC superfamily are tightly controlled by various signals, one of the most important impacts of these AC isozymes is their contribution to the complexity and fine-tuning of cellular signalling, especially in the central nervous system (CNS) where multiple signals constantly occur. This review focuses on recent progress toward understanding the physiological roles of ACs in the CNS.
