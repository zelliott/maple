FUS1 is a novel tumor suppressor gene identified in the human chromosome 3p21.3 region where allele losses and genetic alterations occur early and frequently for many human cancers. Expression of FUS1 protein is absent or reduced in the majority of lung cancers and premalignant lung lesions. Restoration of wt-FUS1 function in 3p21.3-deficient non-small cell lung carcinoma cells significantly inhibits tumor cell growth by induction of apoptosis and alteration of cell cycle kinetics. Here we present recent findings indicating that FUS1 induces apoptosis through the activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial-dependent and Apaf-1-associated pathways and inhibits the function of protein tyrosine kinases including EGFR, PDGFR, AKT, c-Abl, and c-Kit. Intravenous administration of a nanoparticle encapsulated FUS1 expression plasmid effectively delivers FUS1 to distant tumor sites and mediates an antitumor effect in orthotopic human lung cancer xenograft models. This approach is the rationale for an ongoing FUS1-nanoparticle-mediated gene delivery clinical trial for the treatment of lung cancer.
