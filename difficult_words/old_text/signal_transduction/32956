Here we summarize recent findings on the biology of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, also known as scatter factor), focusing on its effects on developing neurons. HGF is both a chemoattractant and a survival factor for embryonic motor neurons. In addition, sensory and sympathetic neurons and their precursors respond to HGF with increased differentiation, survival and axonal outgrowth. The broad spectrum of HGF activities and its observed synergy with other neurotrophic factors suggest that the major role of HGF is to potentiate the response of developing neurons to specific signals.
