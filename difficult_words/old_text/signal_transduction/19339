The formation of complex tissues during embryonic development is often accompanied by directed cellular migration towards a target tissue. Specific mutual recognition between the migrating cell and its target tissue leads to the arrest of the cell migratory behavior and subsequent contact formation between the two interacting cell types. Recent studies implicated a novel family of surface proteins containing a trans-membrane domain and single leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain in inter-cellular recognition and the arrest of cell migration. Here, we describe the involvement of a novel LRR surface protein, LRT, in targeting migrating muscles towards their corresponding tendon cells in the Drosophila embryo. LRT is specifically expressed by the target tendon cells and is essential for arresting the migratory behavior of the muscle cells. Additional studies in Drosophila S2 cultured cells suggest that LRT forms a protein complex with the Roundabout (Robo) receptor, essential for guiding muscles towards their tendon partners. Genetic analysis supports a model in which LRT performs its activity non-autonomously through its interaction with the Robo receptors expressed on the muscle surfaces. These results suggest a novel mechanism of intercellular recognition through interactions between LRR family members and Robo receptors.
