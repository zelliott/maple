Accumulating evidence suggests that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway plays a critical role in renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the downstream mechanism that accounts for the proapoptotic actions of JNK during renal ischemia/reperfusion has not been elucidated. We report that SP600125, a potent, cell-permeable, selective, and reversible inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), potently decreased renal epithelial tubular cell apoptosis induced by renal ischemia/reperfusion via suppression of the extrinsic pathway. This corresponds to the decrease in JNK phosphorylation at 20 min and c-Jun phosphorylation (Ser63/73) at 3 h after renal ischemia. Additionally, SP600125 attenuated the increased expression of FasL induced by ischemia/reperfusion at 3 h. The administration of SP600125 prior to ischemia was also protective. Thus, our findings imply that SP600125 can inhibit the activation of the JNK-c-Jun-FasL pathway and protect renal tubular epithelial cells against ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that targeting the JNK pathway provides a promising therapeutic approach for renal ischemia/reperfusion injury.
