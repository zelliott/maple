Cellulysin, a crude cellulase from the plant parasitic fungus Trichoderma viride, induces the biosynthesis of volatiles in higher plants (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, Phaseolus lunatus, and Zea mays) when applied to cut petioles by the transpiration stream. The pattern of the emitted volatiles largely resembles that from a herbivore damage or treatment of the plants with jasmonic acid (JA) indicating that cellulysin acts via activation of the octadecanoid signalling pathway. The treatment with cellulysin raises the level of endogenous JA after 30 min and is followed by a transient emission of ethylene after 2-3 h. Volatile production becomes significant after 12-24 h. Inhibitors of the JA pathway effectively block the cellulysin-dependent volatile biosynthesis.
