To investigate whether arginase pathway abnormalities occur in vessels from rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA), and to determine whether the up-regulation of arginase, which reciprocally regulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by competing for the same substrate, L-arginine, contributes to endothelial dysfunction in AIA.

We performed vascular reactivity experiments on thoracic aortic rings from AIA rats and control rats, and we investigated the response of rings to norepinephrine (NE), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and acetylcholine (ACh). ACh-induced relaxation was evaluated in the presence (or not in the presence) of the NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), the arginase inhibitor N(Ï‰)-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (nor-NOHA), or both. Aortic arginase activity was measured using a spectrophotometric method, and the expression of arginase and endothelial NOS (eNOS) was evaluated by Western blotting.

ACh-induced vasodilation was significantly impaired in AIA rats, while the responses to NE and to SNP did not differ from those in control rats. L-NAME reduced ACh-induced vasodilation to a lesser extent in AIA rats than in control rats. Incubation of aortic rings with nor-NOHA enhanced the vascular response to ACh in AIA rats and reversed the effects of L-NAME. Compared with control rats, AIA rats exhibited increased vascular expression of arginase II (by 22%) (P < 0.05) as well as increased arginase activity (by 49%) (P < 0.05), whereas eNOS expression was unchanged. Finally, arginase activity and expression correlated positively with arthritis severity.

Our results are consistent with the notion that arginase up-regulation plays a role in AIA-associated endothelial dysfunction. They suggest that arginase might be an attractive new target for treating endothelial dysfunction in arthritis.
