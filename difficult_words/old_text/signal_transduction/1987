The transfer of glutamine between cells contributes to signaling as well as to metabolism. The recent identification and characterization of the system N and A family of transporters has begun to suggest mechanisms for the directional transfer of glutamine, and should provide ways to test its physiological significance in diverse processes from nitrogen to neurotransmitter release.
