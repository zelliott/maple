TGF beta-like ligands are involved in many different developmental processes that pattern a variety of tissues in invertebrates and vertebrates. In the last few years, rapid progress has been made toward elucidating the developmental roles of the TGF beta-like pathways and identifying the novel components involved in transducing their signals, particularly the newly discovered Smads. This rapid progress has been the result of a synergy between classical genetic approaches and biochemical approaches, and this combined approach is likely to propel future understanding of the signaling pathway used by TGF beta.
