To understand the role of the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase NOX1 in the vascular system, we have generated NOX1-deficient mice. NOX1-deficient mice had a moderately decreased basal blood pressure. In response to angiotensin II they showed an almost complete loss of the sustained blood pressure response, while the initial increase was conserved. NOX1-deficient mice showed a marked reduction in aortic media hypertrophy. Angiotensin II-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation was conserved, but there was a marked decrease in extracellular matrix accumulation. Our results establish a role for NOX1 in blood pressure regulation and vascular angiotensin II response.
