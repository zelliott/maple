The PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays a central role in cell growth, proliferation and survival not only under physiological conditions but also in a variety of tumor cells. Therefore, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis may be a critical target for cancer therapy.

This review discusses how PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network is constitutively active in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), where it strongly influences proliferation, survival and drug-resistance of leukemic cells, and how effective targeting of this pathway with pharmacological inhibitors, used alone or in combination with existing drugs, may result in suppression of leukemic cell growth, including leukemic stem cells.

We searched the literature for articles dealing with activation of this pathway in AML and highlighting the efficacy of small molecules directed against the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade.

The limit of acceptable toxicity for standard chemotherapy has been reached in AML. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed. Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network with small molecule inhibitors, alone or in combinations with other drugs, may result in less toxic and more efficacious treatment of AML patients. Efforts to exploit selective inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway that show effectiveness and safety in the clinical setting are currently underway.
