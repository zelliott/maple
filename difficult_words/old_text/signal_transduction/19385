I have devoted my life to NMR research for nearly 40 years since I graduated from Tokyo University. Owing to innovative technical developments such as introduction of superconductive magnets into NMR, and development of FT-NMR and two-dimensional NMR, I have spent an interesting and inspired research life. When I look back on my life, I found myself starting from structural chemistry and doing research from the beginning of and all the way to the maturation of structural biology. I have been enjoying scientific challenges with my students and collaborators and I am proud that many young scientists grew up in my laboratory.
