Ion channels regulate the membrane potential and intracellular ionic  concentration and thus serve a central role in various cellular processes.  Several ion channels have been identified in the germ cells, including sperm,  emphasizing their importance in male fertility and reproduction. The molecular  mechanism of ion transport and the nature of the ion channels involved have  begun to emerge only recently despite the fact that several ligand-gated and  voltage-gated channels have been identified and localized on sperm. The  presence of the sperm-associated cation channel (CatSper1-4) gene family,  proton voltage-gated ion channel (Hv1), potassium voltage-gated ion channel  (SLO3/KCNU1), sodium voltage-gated channel (NaV1.1-1.9), and the members of  the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family suggest an indispensable  role for ion channels in sperm physiology and fertility potential. Ion  channels are the key players in very important processes such as capacitation  and the acrosome reaction, which are critical steps in sperm physiology  preparing for fertilization. For example, CatSper, Hv1, SLO3, and TRP channel  family members have been proposed to participate in the acrosome reaction,  thereby making them most important for sperm fertility. Similarly, NaV  channels could play a crucial role in noncapacitated sperm and in the initial  capacitation steps. The role of ion channels seems indispensable for sperm  fertility as evidenced by studies on animal models; however, the functional  defects in infertile human males await further exploration. This article  represents an update on the role of ion channels in sperm physiology, male  fertility, and infertility.
