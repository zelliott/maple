The transcription factor encoded by the murine ecotropic integration site 1 gene (MEIS1) is a partner of HOX and PBX proteins. It has been implicated in embryonic patterning and leukemia, and causally linked to restless legs syndrome. The MEIS1A C terminus harbors a transcriptional activation domain that is stimulated by protein kinase A (PKA) in a manner dependent on the co-activator of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), CREB-binding protein (CBP). We explored the involvement of another mediator of PKA-inducible transcription, namely the CREB co-activators transducers of regulated CREB activity (TORCs). Overexpression of TORC1 or TORC2 bypassed PKA for activation by MEIS1A. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between MEIS1 and TORC2 that is dependent on the MEIS1A C terminus, whereas chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed PKA-inducible recruitment of MEIS1, PBX1, and TORC2 on the MEIS1 target genes Hoxb2 and Meis1. The MEIS1 interaction domain on TORC1 was mapped to the N-terminal coiled-coil region, and TORC1 mutants lacking this domain attenuated the response to PKA on a natural MEIS1A target enhancer. Thus, TORCs physically cooperate with MEIS1 to achieve PKA-inducible transactivation through the MEIS1A C terminus, suggesting a concerted action in developmental and oncogenic processes.
