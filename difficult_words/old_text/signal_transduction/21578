G protein betagamma subunits have potential as a target for therapeutic treatment of a number of diseases. We performed virtual docking of a small-molecule library to a site on Gbetagamma subunits that mediates protein interactions. We hypothesized that differential targeting of this surface could allow for selective modulation of Gbetagamma subunit functions. Several compounds bound to Gbetagamma subunits with affinities from 0.1 to 60 muM and selectively modulated functional Gbetagamma-protein-protein interactions in vitro, chemotactic peptide signaling pathways in HL-60 leukocytes, and opioid receptor-dependent analgesia in vivo. These data demonstrate an approach for modulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling that may represent an important therapeutic strategy.
