Phospholipase C (PLC) family members constitute a family of diverse enzymes. Thirteen different family members have been cloned. These family members have unique structures that mediate diverse functions. Although PLC family members all appear to signal through the bi-products of cleaving phospholipids, it is clear that each family member, and at times each isoform, contributes to unique cellular functions. This chapter provides a review of the current literature. In addition, references have been provided for more in depth information regarding areas that are discussed. Ultimately, understanding the roles of the individual PLC enzymes, and their distinct cellular functions, will lead to a better understanding of the development of diseases and the maintenance of homeostasis.
