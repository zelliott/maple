Whereas most febrile seizures (FSs) carry a benign outcome, a subpopulation of individuals with prolonged FSs are at risk for later temporal lobe epilepsy. Signal changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide early markers for changes in neuronal integrity that may promote epileptogenesis in such individuals. Here, we used serial MRIs, obtained before and at several time points after experimental prolonged FSs, to determine the prevalence and distribution of signal changes on T2-weighted images and to investigate the pathological substrates leading to these changes. Seventy-five percent of immature rats with experimental prolonged FSs had abnormal T2 signal enhancement at 24 hours, and 87.5% at 8 days after the seizures. The altered T2 values involved the dorsal hippocampus (75%), the piriform cortex (87.5%), and the amygdala (25%). However, these changes were not accompanied by evidence of neuronal injury or death in these regions, as assessed using the Fluoro-Jade method. Thus, experimental prolonged FSs lead to relatively frequent abnormal MRI signal in "temporal lobe" structures. Although these changes do not signify cell death, they may denote pathological cellular processes that promote epileptogenesis. .
