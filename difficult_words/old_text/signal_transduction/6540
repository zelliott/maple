The accumulation of misfolded proteins (e.g. mutant or damaged proteins) triggers cellular stress responses that protect cells against the toxic buildup of such proteins. However, prolonged stress due to the buildup of these toxic proteins induces specific death pathways. Dissecting these pathways should be valuable in understanding the pathogenesis of, and ultimately in designing therapy for, neurodegenerative diseases that feature misfolded proteins.
