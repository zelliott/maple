We hypothesized that kallikrein-related peptidase 14 (KLK14) is produced by colonic tumors and can promote tumorigenesis by activating proteinase-activated receptors (PARs). We found that KLK14 is expressed in human colon adenocarcinoma cells but not in adjacent cancer-free tissue; KLK14 mRNA, present in colon cancer, leads to KLK14 protein expression and secretion; and KLK14 signals viaPAR-2 in HT-29 cells to cause (1) receptor activation/internalization, (2) increases in intracellular calcium, (3) stimulation of ERK1/2/MAP kinase phosphorylation, and (4) cell proliferation. We suggest that KLK14, acting via PAR-2, represents an autocrine/paracrine regulator of colon tumorigenesis.
