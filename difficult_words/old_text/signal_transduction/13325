EID1 (empfindlicher im dunkelroten Licht) and SPA1 (suppressor of phytochrome A[phyA]-105) function as negatively acting components in phyA-specific light signaling. Mutants in the respective genes led to very similar phenotypes under weak-light conditions. To examine whether both genes are functionally redundant, detailed physiological and genetic analyses were performed with eid1 and spa1 mutants isolated from the same wild-type background. Measurements of hypocotyl elongation, anthocyanin accumulation, and Lhcb1-transcript accumulation under different light treatments demonstrated that SPA1 has a strong influence on the regulation of very low fluence responses and a weaker influence on high-irradiance responses. In contrast, EID1 severely altered high-irradiance responses and caused almost no change on very low fluence responses. Analyses on eid1 phyA-105 double mutants demonstrated that EID1 could not suppress the phenotype of the weak phyA allele under continuous far-red light. Measurements on eid1 spa1 double mutants exhibited a strong interference of both genes in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation. These results indicate that EID1 and SPA1 are involved in different but interacting phyA-dependent signal transduction chains.
