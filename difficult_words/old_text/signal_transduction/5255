Signaling through the Tie2 receptor on endothelial cells has been shown to play an important role in normal and pathologic vascular development. We generated K1735 murine melanoma tumor cells that inducibly express soluble Tie2 receptor (Tie2Ex) to study the effects of inhibiting Tie2 signaling on tumor vasculature. Tie2Ex induction rapidly decreased AKT activation but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in tumor endothelial cells as detected by immunostaining. This was accompanied by an increase in endothelial cell TUNEL staining but no change in Ki-67 expression. Together with a decrease in the percentage of perfused vessels, this suggested that tumor vessel regression and impaired vascular function rather than angiogenesis inhibition was responsible for the delay in tumor growth following Tie2Ex treatment. However, Tie2Ex failed to inhibit the growth of larger, more established K1735 tumors. These tumors were additionally treated with sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that inhibits tumor endothelial cell ERK activation but not AKT activation. Combining Tie2Ex and sorafenib decreased both endothelial cell AKT and ERK activation, decreased endothelial cell survival and proliferation, and significantly inhibited growth of the more established tumors. These studies indicate that activity of specific signaling pathways and prosurvival effects are brought about by Tie2 activation in tumor endothelial cells, and knowledge of the effects of Tie2 inhibition can lead to development of more effective therapeutic regimens for inhibiting tumor neovascularization.
