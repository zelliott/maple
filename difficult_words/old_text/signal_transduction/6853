MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of post-transcriptional regulators that provide a mechanism of gene silencing by translational repression or degradation of the targeted gene. Gene expression regulation by miRNAs is involved in most if not all physiological and pathophysiological processes. Atherosclerosis is a major cardiovascular disease pathology regulated by miRNAs. Recent miRNA profiling studies have implicated the potential use of miRNAs as biomarkers in patients with atherosclerosis, as both diagnostic and prognostic indicators. This review will discuss the clinical and basic science research information that has been gleaned regarding miRNA roles in dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance which are the major stimulators for the development of atherosclerosis.
