Our understanding of molecular mechanisms of fertilization in mammals has lagged behind the rapid development of reproductive technology over the last decade. Significant advances in knowledge have resulted mainly from studies in laboratory animals in vitro. However, this situation has changed in the last few years as targeted mutagenesis in mice has provided important new information about genes and proteins involved in basic aspects of sperm-egg interactions in vivo. In this brief review the current knowledge about the generic aspects of mammalian fertilization is summarized, together with particular features of reproductive physiology related to cats and dogs.
