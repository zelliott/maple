Human MST/hSAV/LATS/hMOB tumor suppressor cascades are regulators of cell death and proliferation; however, little is known about other functions of MST/hMOB signaling. Mob1p, one of two MOB proteins in yeast, appears to play a role in spindle pole body duplication (the equivalent of mammalian centrosome duplication). We therefore investigated the role of human MOB proteins in centrosome duplication. We also addressed the regulation of human centrosome duplication by mammalian serine/threonine Ste20-like (MST) kinases, considering that MOB proteins can function together with Ste20-like kinases in eukaryotes.

By studying the six human MOB proteins and five MST kinases, we found that MST1/hMOB1 signaling controls centrosome duplication. Overexpression of hMOB1 caused centrosome overduplication, whereas RNAi depletion of hMOB1 or MST1 impaired centriole duplication. Significantly, we delineated an hMOB1/MST1/NDR1 signaling pathway regulating centrosome duplication. More specifically, analysis of shRNA-resistant hMOB1 and NDR1 mutants revealed that a functional NDR/hMOB1 complex is critical for MST1 to phosphorylate NDR on the hydrophobic motif that in turn is required for human centrosome duplication. Furthermore, shRNA-resistant MST1 variants revealed that MST1 kinase activity is crucial for centrosome duplication whereas MST1 binding to the hSAV and RASSF1A tumor suppressor proteins is dispensable. Finally, by studying the PLK4/HsSAS-6/CP110 centriole assembly machinery, we also observed that normal daughter centriole formation depends on intact MST1/hMOB1/NDR signaling, although HsSAS-6 centriolar localization is not affected.

Our observations propose a novel pathway in control of human centriole duplication after recruitment of HsSAS-6 to centrioles.
