Plant photosynthesis is determined by chlorophyll (Chl) metabolism, which is an important factor of determining crop yield. The genes involved in Chl biosynthesis, catabolism, and related signal regulations are numerous, and the mutation of any of them may change the pigment level, causing abnormalities in leaf color and even inducing individual death. Spontaneous or artificial mutants are necessary for functional analysis of Chl related genes. At present, Chl mutants are widely used in foundational research and production practice. This article reviews the latest research progress in this field.
