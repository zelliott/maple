The mechanism by which IGF-1Rs regulate the growth and maintenance of cells in normal and disease states provides an important setting for studies addressing signal transduction events at the nuclear level. With the identification of c-Jun/AP-1 as a nuclear target of IGF-1 action we are provided with a model system for pursuing the molecular mechanisms triggered by IGF-1 action.
