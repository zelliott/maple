The case of a patient with heavily pretreated, irinotecan-resistant, metastatic colorectal cancer is presented by the authors, and they would like to point to the effectiveness of a new therapeutic option, cetuximab treatment. Additionally, they would like to call attention to the need of performing EGFR determination from all of the biopsy samples (primary tumor, lymph nodes and metastases) to start the treatment. A weak EGFR-positivity of the primary tumor in fact does not mean the contraindication of cetuximab treatment, since the metastases, which are usually treated, could be strongly positive. The therapeutic answer could be excellent in this case, as it occurred in our case.
