The goal of this study was to understand roles of nucleoside and nucleobase transport processes in capecitabine pharmacology in cells derived from human renal proximal tubule cells (hRPTCs) and three human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines, A498, A704, and Caki-1. Human equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 and 2 (hENT1 and hENT2) mediated activities and a sodium-independent nucleobase activity were present in hRPTCs. In hRPTCs, uptake of 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (DFUR), a nucleoside metabolite of capecitabine, was pH dependent with highest uptake seen at pH 6.0. In RCC cell lines, hENT1 was the major nucleoside transporter. Nucleobase transport activity was variable among the three RCC cell lines, with Caki-1 showing the highest and A498 showing the lowest activities. Treatment of RCC cell lines with interferon alpha (IFN-α) increased thymidine phosphorylase levels and prior treatment of RCC cell lines with IFN-α followed by 5-FU or DFUR resulted in enhanced sensitivity of all cell lines to 5-FU and two of three cell lines to DFUR. We report for the first time a nucleobase transport activity in hRPTCs and RCC cell lines. In addition, our in vitro cytotoxicity results showed that RCC cell lines differed in their response to 5-FU and DFUR and prior treatment with IFN-α potentiated cytotoxic response to metabolites of capecitabine.
