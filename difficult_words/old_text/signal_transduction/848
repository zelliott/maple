Eukaryotic cells use endocytosis to internalise plasma membrane, surface receptors and their ligands, viruses and various extracellular soluble molecules. Endocytosis has been regarded as a long-term mechanism of signal attenuation via receptor clearance from the cell surface. However, additional, and quite unexpected, functions for endocytosis have emerged, which, together with its attenuation function, project a central role for this process in cellular homeostasis and control of proliferation. Subversion of endocytic control is thus predicted to play a causative role in hyperproliferative conditions, first and foremost cancer.
