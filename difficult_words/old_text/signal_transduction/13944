To analyze the intersections among the western medicine action network for preventing and treating coronary heart disease (CHD), as well as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) action network for activating blood and dissolving stasis. In this article, 11 characteristic parameter values of network nodes, including connectivity, bottleneck, betweenness, were calculated. The target identification model was established based on key node characteristic parameters in the CHD-western medicine intersection network with support vector machine. Its C and y parameters were 5.14 and--1.11, respectively, with the predicted accuracies for positive and negative samples of 81.6% and 79.2%. The predicted sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the test set samples were 81.5%, 78.3% and 79.6%, respectively. Besides, the model was applied to predict potential action targets of the CHD-activating blood and dissolving stasis TCM intersection network, and 180 positive nodes and 42 negative nodes were obtained. In this article, 9 positive nodes, including calnexin, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, were taken as examples to analyze the action mechanism of TCM for preventing and treating CHD. The results showed that the network potential key target analysis method was helpful to explore the potential action targets of activating blood and dissolving stasis TCMs for preventing and treating CHD, methodologically supportive to reveal the action mechanism of TCMs at molecular and systematic levels, and significant in guiding the research and development of new drugs.
