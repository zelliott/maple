It has recently been shown by Ciaofani and Zúñiga-Pflücker that the Notch signaling pathway is important in the regulation of thymocyte glucose metabolism during beta-selection. Control of cell metabolism has key roles in the regulation of cell death pathways. Changes in glucose metabolism might affect cell death pathways and be crucial in the development and selection of T lymphocytes.
