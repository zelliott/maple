Several factors participate in regulation of growth and development as well as angiogenesis of the uterus during pregnancy, and hence little is known about the role of hormonal regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-receptor system expression. This study has examined the effect of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), relaxin (RLX), oxytocin (OT) and prostaglandin (PG) E(2), on VEGF secretion and VEGF-receptor system mRNA expression in the porcine endometrial stromal cells. IGF-I and RLX were identified as the most effective inducers of VEGF secretion and mRNA expression. Although PGE(2) stimulated VEGF secretion and VEGF164 mRNA expression, OT inhibited both secretion and mRNA expression of VEGF. When tested for VEGF receptors (R), all factors failed to affect their mRNA expression. Media conditioned by stromal cells collected after IGF-I and RLX treatment significantly increased endothelial cell proliferation and this effect was blocked by soluble VEGFR-1. These data suggest that during early pregnancy IGF-I, RLX and PGE(2) can affect VEGF expression in the endometrium and therefore may support uterine and embryo development, implantation and pregnancy.
