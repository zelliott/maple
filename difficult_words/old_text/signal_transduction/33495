Activating mutations of FLT3 are found in approximately one-third of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-cases and are considered to represent an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we report that the hydroxystyryl-acrylonitrile compound LS104 inhibits proliferation and induces potent cytotoxic effects in FLT3 expressing leukemic cells in vitro. Immunoblot and phosphoprotein-FACS analysis demonstrated inhibiton of phosphorylation of FLT3-ITD and of its downstream targets. In pharmacokinetic studies, a rapid and dose dependent cellular uptake of LS104 lasting up to 11h could be demonstrated. Combination of LS104 with chemotherapeutic agents markedly enhanced cytotoxic effects. Recently, a phase I clinical trial investigating LS104 in refractory/relapsed hematologic malignancies has been initiated.
