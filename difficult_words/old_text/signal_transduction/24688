Phosphate depletion (PD) causes a rise in basal level of cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) of pancreatic islets, a decrease in their basal and stimulated ATP content, a reduction in the maximum velocity (Vmax) of Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and Na(+)-K+ ATPase, impaired glucose-induced calcium signal and decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion. The sequence of events that lead to these derangements during the evolution of PD are not defined. The present study examined this issue by measuring the metabolic and functional profile of pancreatic islets weekly during the evolution of PD over a period of 6 weeks, and whether phosphate repletion reverses these abnormalities. The results show that initial abnormalities are a rise in Vmax of Ca2+ ATPase and modest rise in basal [Ca2+]i. This was followed by a fall in basal and stimulated ATP content. With the fall in ATP content, the Vmax of Ca2+ ATPase and Na(+)-K+ ATPase decreases and the rise in [Ca2+]i becomes more pronounced. A decrease in glucose-induced insulin secretion becomes evident with the fall in ATP, the decrease in glucose-induced calcium signal, and/or delta[Ca2+]i/basal[Ca2+]i. All functional and metabolic derangements of the pancreatic islets returned to normal after phosphate repletion. Taken together, our data are consistent with the notion that PD is associated with an initial increase in calcium influx into the islets. This is followed by modest but significant rise in [Ca2+]i which, in turn, would inhibit mitochondrial oxidation and ATP generation leading to a decrease in ATP content. The latter compromises the activity of Ca2+ ATPase and Na(+)-K+ ATPase which are involved, directly or indirectly, in calcium extrusion out of the islets. The increased influx of calcium combined with decreased calcium extrusion is followed by a further rise in basal levels of [Ca2+]i. This sequence of events continues until a steady state is reached and is characterized by reduced basal and stimulated ATP content, reduced Vmax of Ca2+ ATPase and Na(+)-K+ ATPase and elevated basal level of [Ca2+]i. Phosphate repletion reverses all these abnormalities.
