Sperm are attracted by chemical substances which are released by the egg. This process is called chemotaxis. Several molecules that are involved in chemotactic signaling of sperm from marine invertebrates are described and a model of the signaling pathway is presented. We discuss the motor response during chemotaxis and propose a model of the navigation strategy of sperm.
