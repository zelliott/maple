Epilepsy, a common neurological disorder and cause of significant morbidity and mortality, places an enormous burden on the individual and society. Presently, most drugs for epilepsy primarily suppress seizures as symptomatic therapies but do not possess actual antiepileptogenic or disease-modifying properties. The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway is involved in major multiple cellular functions, including protein synthesis, cell growth and proliferation and synaptic plasticity, which may influence neuronal excitability and be responsible for epileptogenesis. Intriguing findings of the frequent hyperactivation of mTOR signaling in epilepsy make it a potential mechanism in the pathogenesis as well as an attractive target for the therapeutic intervention, and have driven the significant ongoing efforts to pharmacologically target this pathway. This review explores the relevance of the mTOR pathway to epileptogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target in epilepsy treatment by presenting the current results on mTOR inhibitors, in particular, rapamycin, in animal models of diverse types of epilepsy. Limited clinical studies in human epilepsy, some paradoxical experimental data and outstanding questions have also been discussed.
