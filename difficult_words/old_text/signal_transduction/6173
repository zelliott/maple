Neuronal migrations along glial fibers provide a primary pathway for the formation of cortical laminae. To examine the mechanisms underlying glial-guided migration, we analyzed the dynamics of cytoskeletal and signaling components in living neurons. Migration involves the coordinated two-stroke movement of a perinuclear tubulin 'cage' and the centrosome, with the centrosome moving forward before nuclear translocation. Overexpression of mPar6alpha disrupts the perinuclear tubulin cage, retargets PKCzeta and gamma-tubulin away from the centrosome, and inhibits centrosomal motion and neuronal migration. Thus, we propose that during neuronal migration the centrosome acts to coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics in response to mPar6alpha-mediated signaling.
