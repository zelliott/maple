Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common tumor of the skin and can result in significant morbidity as well as costs. The discovery of aberrant Hedgehog (HH) signaling in patients with genetic propensity to develop BCCs has resulted in a better understanding of the genetic abnormalities leading to the development of BCC. The current state of knowledge with regard to the genetics of BCC is discussed. Existing therapies are reviewed, in particular new targeted therapies to the HH signaling pathway that have resulted in a landmark breakthrough for patients with refractory BCC. Data from recent and ongoing trials are presented.
