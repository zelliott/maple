Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones essential for many developmental processes in plants. In this work, fundamental mechanism of hormone perception by receptor GID1 has been studied by performing computational simulations, revealing a new GA-binding channel of GID1 and a novel hormone perception mechanism involving only one conformational state of GID1. The novel hormone perception mechanism demonstrated here is remarkably different from the previously proposed/speculated mechanism [Murase et al., Nature 2008, 456, 459] involving two conformational states ("OPEN" and "CLOSED") of GID1. According to the new perception mechanism, GA acts as a "conformational stabilizer," rather than the previously speculated "allosteric inducer," to induce the recognition of protein DELLA by GID1. The novel mechanistic insights obtained in this study provide a new starting point for further studies on the detailed molecular mechanisms of GID1 interacting with DELLA and various hormones and for mechanism-based rational design of novel, potent growth regulators that target crops and ornamental plants.
