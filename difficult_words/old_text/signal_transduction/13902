CCL13/MCP-4, is a CC family chemokine that is chemoattractant for eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, macrophages, immature dendritic cells, and T cells, and its capable of inducing crucial immuno-modulatory responses through its effects on epithelial, muscular and endothelial cells. Similar to other CC chemokines, CCL13 binds to several chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR2 and CCR3), allowing it to elicit different effects on its target cells. A number of studies have shown that CCL13 is involved in many chronic inflammatory diseases, in which it functions as a pivotal molecule involved in the selective recruitment of cell lineages to the inflamed tissues and their subsequent activation. Based on these studies, we suggest that blocking the actions of CCL13 can serve as a novel strategy for the generation of agents with anti-inflammatory activity. The main goal of this review is to present the current information about CCL13, its gene and protein structure and the roles of this chemokine during innate/adaptive immune responses in inflammatory diseases.
