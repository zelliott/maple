The nervous and endocrine systems modulate the immune system functions through releasing neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and endocrine hormones as they regulate the other physiological functions. The immune system in turn communicates with the nervous and endocrine systems through secreting immunocompetent substances. In this report we review our concepts and evidence concerning the immunoregulatory role of acetylcholine (ACh) and monoamine neurotransmitters which include noradrenaline (NA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA). The immunoregulatory role comprises two aspects, the modulation of immune functions by neurotransmitters and the effect of the immune system on nervous system functions. The inhibition of ACh biosynthesis in the central nervous system (CNS) caused the enhancement of the humoral immune response of rats to sheep red blood cells (SRBC); by contrast, the inhibition of acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE) activity in the CNS resulted in the suppression of the immune response. It seems that ACh in the brain plays an immunoinhibitory role. The role can be blocked by atropine, a muscarinic antagonist, but not by hexamethonium, a nicotinic antagonist. During the humoral immune response (days 3-6 after SRBC injection), activity of AChE in the hypothalamus and hippocampus was strikingly lower. It is suggested that a functional connection is present in the ACh of the brain and the immune system. In vitro, ACh at 10(-9) to 10(-4) mol/l dose range significantly strengthened the spleen cell proliferation induced by concanavalin (Con A). The action of ACh only occurred either before or just after T lymphocytes were activated through muscarinic cholinergic receptors. In vivo, the depletion of monoamine neurotransmitters or only NA in the CNS caused the impairment of the anti-SRBC response of rats. During the phases of days 2-7 post-immunization, the metabolic alterations of NA, 5-HT and DA emerged in the CNS and the lymphoid organs of rats, which mainly exhibited that in the peak periods of the antibody response, the metabolism of the monoamine neurotransmitters in the hypothalamus and hippocampus was markedly increased, but NA content in the spleen and thymus was significantly decreased. These results provide evidence for the bidirectional information exchange network between the monoamine neurotransmitters and the immune system. Exposure to NA (at 10(-8)-10(-5) mol/l concentration range) in vitro was shown to inhibit the Con A-induced proliferation of the rat spleen cells. This effect of NA was related to the early events involved in the initiation of T cell proliferation and was mediated by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors. The evidence that altering 5-HT level in the central or peripheral nervous systems through various ways of administering the drugs to regulate 5-HT biosynthesis led to the variations of the antibody response, and that cyproheptadine, an antagonist of serotoninergic receptors, can block the action of 5-HT show that 5-HT may exert an immunoinhibitory effect, which appears to be mediated via the peripheral mechanism to relate to the 5-HT receptors. However, the antibody response can cause changes in 5-HT metabolism in the CNS. The possible reasons for these results are discussed. Collectively, the antibody response arouses the metabolic variations of ACh, NA, 5-HT and DA in the central and peripheral nervous systems and then, these alterations can in turn influence immune function through neurotransmitter relevant receptors present on the immunocytes. The purpose of this interaction is most likely to maintain the homeostasis of the immune and other physiological functions.
