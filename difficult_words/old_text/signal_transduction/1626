The SGK1 protein belongs to the AGC gene family of kinases that are regulated by phosphorylation mediated by PDK1. SGK1 regulation is accomplished by several pathways including growth-factor and stress-mediated signaling. We have expanded the analysis of SGK1 regulation in epithelial cells. We used HA-tagged SGK1 to transiently transfect MDCK cells and study the regulation of SGK1 upon stimulation with HGF, cAMP or upon adhesion of the cells to immobilized fibronectin. In addition, we studied the regulation of SGK1 activity by small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family. Treatment of MDCK cells with HGF leads to a time-dependent activation of SGK1 that is blocked by wortmanin. This activation requires the conserved phosphorylation site present in the activation loop of the kinase (T256 in SGK1) and the phosphorylation site present in a hydrophobic domain at its C-terminus (S422 in SGK1), which are targets for PDK1/PDK2-mediated regulation of SGK1. We tested whether SGK1 could be activated by cAMP as it contains a putative PKA site. We were unable to demonstrate a significant activation of HA-SGK1 by cAMP stimulation under conditions where we detect cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB. Cotransfection of SGK1 with activated small GTP-binding proteins revealed that Rac1, but not Rho or Rap1, induces activation of SGK1. However, this activation was wortmanin insensitive and dominant-negative Rac1 did not inhibit the HGF-mediated activation of SGK1. Adhesion of MDCK cells to immobilized fibronectin also leads to activation of SGK1. However, it appears that the integrin-mediated activation of HA-SGK1 differs from AKT activation in the fact that AKT phosphorylation was blocked by wortmanin (or LY294002) whereas HA-SGK1 was not. The adhesion-dependent activation, however, requires the intact phosphorylation sites of SGK1. Co-transfection of HA-SGK1 with RacV12 results in increased activity in adherent cells compared with HA-SGK1 alone. Since RacN17 failed to inhibit adhesion dependent-activation of SGK1, it suggests that integrin activation is achieved by a parallel Rac-independent pathway. The activation of SGK1 by HGF and integrin provides a link between HGF-mediated protection of MDCK from de-attachment induced apoptosis (anoikis). We demonstrate that dephosphorylation of the transcription factor FKRHL1 induced by cell de-attachment is prevented by activated SGK1, suggesting that SGK1 regulates cell survival pathways. In summary, we demonstrate that SGK1 activation could be achieved through signaling pathways involved in the regulation of cell survival, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. SGK1 activation can be accomplished via HGF, PI-3K-dependent pathways and by integrin-mediated, PI-3K independent pathways. In addition, activation of SGK1 by the small GTP-binding protein Rac1 has been observed.
