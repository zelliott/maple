In this study we have investigated the down-regulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in COS1 cells. The 45-kDa variant of the PTP TCPTP (TC45) exits the nucleus upon EGF receptor activation and recognizes the EGF receptor as a cellular substrate. We report that TC45 inhibits the EGF-dependent activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but does not alter the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2. These data demonstrate that TC45 can regulate selectively mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways emanating from the EGF receptor. In EGF receptor-mediated signaling, the protein kinase PKB/Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, function downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). We have found that TC45 and the TC45-D182A mutant, which is capable of forming stable complexes with TC45 substrates, inhibit almost completely the EGF-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase and PKB/Akt. TC45 and TC45-D182A act upstream of PI 3-kinase, most likely by inhibiting the recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase by the EGF receptor. Recent studies have indicated that the EGF receptor can be activated in the absence of EGF following integrin ligation. We find that the integrin-mediated activation of PKB/Akt in COS1 cells is abrogated by the specific EGF receptor protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478, and that TC45 and TC45-D182A can inhibit activation of PKB/Akt following the attachment of COS1 cells to fibronectin. Thus, TC45 may serve as a negative regulator of growth factor or integrin-induced, EGF receptor-mediated PI 3-kinase signaling.
