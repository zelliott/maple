Cotranslational targeting directly couples synthesis of proteins to their translocation across or insertion into membranes. The signal recognition particle (SRP) and its membrane-bound receptor facilitate the targeting of the translation machinery, the ribosome, via recognition of a signal sequence in the nascent peptide chain. By combining structures of free and ribosome-bound SRP we derive a structural model describing the dynamic nature of SRP when it meets the ribosome.
