Recently, multicolour FACS combined with phosphospecific antibodies has been developed, enabling the determination of the relative phosphorylation of signal transduction intermediates in individual cells. It has become clear that, when stimulated with cytokines, individual leukemia cells exhibit marked differences in phosphoprotein patterns and that these patterns correlate with disease outcome. Thus, single cell phosphoproteomic techniques might be superior to other proteomic approaches for the molecular diagnosis of disease and instrumental for the development of personalised medicine.
