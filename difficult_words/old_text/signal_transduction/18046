During limb development, epithelial cells in the apical ectodermal ridge keep the underlying mesenchymal cells in a proliferative state preventing differentiation by secreting signaling molecules such as epidermal growth factor (EGF). We investigated the molecular mechanism of the EGF effect on the regulation of micromass culture-induced chondrogenesis of chick limb bud mesenchymal cells as a model system. We found that expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor was increased transiently during chondrogenesis. Exogenous EGF inhibited chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells, and this effect was reversed by the EGF receptor inhibitor AG1478. EGF treatment also inhibited the expression and activation of protein kinase C-alpha, whereas it activated Erk-1 and inhibited p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, all of which appeared to be involved in the EGF-induced inhibition of chondrogenesis. Stimulation of the EGF receptor blocked precartilage condensation and altered the expression of cell adhesion molecules such as N-cadherin and integrins alpha(5) and beta(1). All these EGF effects were reversible by AG1478. The data indicate that EGF negatively regulate chondrogenesis of chick limb bud mesenchymal cells by inhibiting precartilage condensation and by modulating signaling pathways including those of protein kinase C-alpha, Erk-1, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.
