During inflammation, P-selectin on activated platelets and endothelial cells initiates adhesion of leukocytes through interactions with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). We investigated whether ligation of PSGL-1 also transmits signals into leukocytes. Neutrophils incubated with anti-PSGL-1 monoclonal antibodies, but not with Fab fragments of these antibodies, rapidly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with relative molecular masses of 105-120, 70-84, and 42-44 kDa. PSGL-1-dependent adhesion of neutrophils to P-selectin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of similarly sized proteins. Cytochalasin B did not prevent the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by ligation of PSGL-1, suggesting that an intact cytoskeleton is not required for signaling. Engagement of PSGL-1 activated the GTPase Ras through a mechanism that did not require tyrosine phosphorylation of PSGL-1 or association of the Shc.Grb2.Sos1 complex with PSGL-1. Engagement of PSGL-1 activated the 42-44-kDa extracellular signal-regulated kinase family of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases through a pathway that required activation of the MAP kinase kinase. Ligation of PSGL-1 also stimulated secretion of interleukin-8. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, blocked tyrosine phosphorylation and secretion of interleukin-8, whereas the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 partially inhibited secretion of interleukin-8. Tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated through PSGL-1 on selectin-tethered leukocytes may propagate a signaling cascade that is integrated with signals generated by other mediators.
