The phospholipases associated with the cardiac sarcolemmal (SL) membrane hydrolyze specific membrane phospholipids to generate important lipid signaling molecules, which are known to influence normal cardiac function. However, impairment of the phospholipases and their related signaling events may be contributory factors in altering cardiac function of the diseased myocardium. The identification of the changes in such signaling systems as well as understanding the contribution of phospholipid-signaling pathways to the pathophysiology of heart disease are rapidly emerging areas of research in this field. In this paper, I provide an overview of the role of phospholipid-mediated signal transduction processes in cardiac hypertrophy and congestive heart failure, diabetic cardiomyopathy, as well as in ischemia-reperfusion. From the cumulative evidence presented, it is suggested that phospholipid-mediated signal transduction processes could serve as novel targets for the treatment of the different types of heart disease.
