Lymphocyte development requires cells to progress through a series of stages, each associated with changes in gene expression. Intense effort has been invested into characterising the dynamic networks of transcription factors underlying these regulated changes. Whilst transcription factors determine the tempo at which mRNA is produced, recent results highlight the importance of the selective regulation of mRNA decay and translation in regulating gene expression. These processes are regulated by sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins (RBP) as well as noncoding RNA such as microRNAs. RNA-binding proteins are emerging as important regulators of cell fate and function in both developing and mature lymphocytes. At the molecular level the function of RNA-binding proteins is integrated with signal transduction pathways that also govern gene transcription.
