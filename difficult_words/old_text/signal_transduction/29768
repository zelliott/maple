We have previously reported that ACTH activates a phospholipase C that hydrolyzes glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), which would release inositolphosphoglycan (IPG) to the extracellular medium, and that an IPG purified from Trypanosoma cruzi is able to inhibit ACTH-mediated steroid production in adrenocortical cells. In the present paper, it was found that anti-inositolphosphoglycan antibodies (anti-CRD) increased ACTH-mediated corticosterone production, which indicates that an endogenous IPG is a physiological inhibitor of ACTH response. On the other hand, we investigated the release to the extracellular medium of the GPI-anchored enzyme, alkaline phosphatase, by ACTH. We found that: (a) the released enzyme appeared in the aqueous phase after Triton X-114 partitioning, consistent with loss of the GPI, (b) the phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122, impaired the release of the enzyme by the hormone and (c) two inhibitors of IPG uptake, inositol 2-monophosphate and 2 M NaCl, increased the amount of alkaline phosphatase in the extracellular medium. These results suggest that ACTH releases alkaline phosphatase by activation of a phospholipase C. Dibutyryladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (db-cAMP) was able to increase the release of alkaline phosphatase from adrenocortical cells and this effect was inhibited by U73122, suggesting that cAMP is involved in the activation of phospholipase C. In addition, it was found that a pertussis-toxin sensitive G-protein is required for ACTH- and db-cAMP-mediated release of alkaline phosphatase and that incorporation of anti-Gi antibodies in adrenocortical cells inhibited the release of alkaline phosphatase by ACTH. Our results suggest that ACTH increases the release of alkaline phosphatase by activation of a phospholipase C through cAMP and Gi which would contribute to produce IPG It was also found that the two inhibitors of IPG uptake, inositol-2-monophosphate and 2 M NaCl, increased the amount of alkaline phosphatase in the extracellular medium of ACTH-treated cells more than in control cells, indicating that ACTH also stimulates the uptake of IPG These data support a role of GPI and the involvement of Gi in ACTH action.
