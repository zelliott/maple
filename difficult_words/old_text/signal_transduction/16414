Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) is a transmembrane protein with tyrosine kinase activity activated mainly by ligand, EGF. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteinases that catalyses the destruction of ECM, among which MMP-9 has important role in tumor cell invasion. Secretion of MMP-9 is stimulated by a variety of factors, EGFR being significant. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a major polyphenol of green tea that inhibits cell proliferation and invasion. Here, we study the effect of EGFR alone and in collaboration with fibronectin on the status of MMP-9 in human breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 and its molecular mechanism; study the role of EGCG on the induced MMP-9; and elucidate the signaling molecules involved in the process.

We performed zymography, immunoblots, real-time RT-PCR, cell adhesion assay, siRNA studies, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay to demonstrate the findings.

EGF induces MMP-9 activity and expression; FAK, PI3 K, and ERK are mainly involved in the process. EGF also causes the transactivation of MMP-9 gene by increasing the DNA binding activity of the transcription factors. EGCG downregulates EGF-induced MMP-9 expression by inhibiting the involved regulatory kinases. EGF collaborates with fibronectin to create a synergistic response, and EGCG inhibits the synergistic response in MDA-MB-231.

The study demonstrates the requirement of cross talk between cell matrix adhesion molecules and growth factor receptors to improve biological responses and shows FAK/ERK as the pivotal point of this convergence in human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231. We also establish EGCG as the potential anti-tumor agent in human breast carcinoma.
