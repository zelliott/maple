To study the role of the cytoplasmic domain and particularly the tyrosine residues of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) in erythroid differentiation of human primary stem cells, we infected cord blood-derived CD34+ cells with retroviruses encoding chimeric receptors containing the extracellular domain of the prolactin receptor (PRLR) and the cytoplasmic domain of either the normal EpoR or a truncated EpoR devoid of tyrosine residues. Erythroid differentiation of the infected progenitors could thus be studied after stimulation by PRL. The complete PRLR was used to assess its ability to substitute for EpoR in erythroid differentiation. Typical erythroid day-14 colonies were observed from CD34+ cells grown in PRL when infected with any of the three viral constructs. These results demonstrate that: (i) the activation of the virally transduced PRLR leads to erythroid colony formation showing that erythroid terminal differentiation can be induced by a non-erythroid receptor in human progenitors; (ii) a chimeric receptor PRLR/EpoR is able to transduce a signal leading to terminal erythroid differentiation of human CD34+ cells; (iii) in contrast to results previously reported in murine models, tyrosine residues of the EpoR are not required for growth and terminal differentiation of human erythroid progenitors.
