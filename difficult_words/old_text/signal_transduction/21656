Central nervous system (CNS) destruction in spinal cord injury (SCI) is caused by a complex series of cellular and molecular events. Recent studies have concentrated on signaling by receptors in the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily that mediate diverse biological outcomes ranging from inflammation to apoptosis. From the perspective of basic science research, understanding how receptor signaling mediates these divergent responses is critical in clarifying events underlying irreversible cell injury in clinically relevant models of SCI. From a clinical perspective, this work also provides novel targets for the development of therapeutic agents that have the potential to protect the spinal cord from irreversible damage and promote functional recovery. In this review, we discuss how the formation of alternate signaling complexes and receptor membrane localization after SCI can influence life and death decisions of cells stimulated through two members of the TNFR superfamily, Fas/CD95 and TNFR1.
