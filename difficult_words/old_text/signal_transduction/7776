Previous studies propose 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a major arachidonic acid metabolite of cytochrome P-450 (CYP), as a possible mediator of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase inhibition by dopamine (DA). The aim of this study was to investigate the intracellular mechanisms involved in this effect and to elucidate the DA receptor associated with the 20-HETE pathway in the rat kidney. DA (10(-5) M) inhibited Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in microdissected tubular segments to 59.4 +/- 3.8% of control activity. This response was suppressed by the CYP4A inhibitor 17-octadecynoic acid (10(-6) M), which had no effect per se, thus confirming the participation of CYP arachidonic acid metabolites in DA-induced Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase inhibition. We next examined whether 20-HETE is involved in the signaling pathways triggered by either D(1) or D(2) receptors. Neither fenoldopam nor quinpirole (D(1) and D(2) agonists, respectively, both 10(-5) M) modified Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity when tried alone. However, coincubation of a threshold concentration of 20-HETE (10(-9) M) with fenoldopam resulted in a synergistic inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity (66 +/- 2% of control activity), while 20-HETE plus quinpirole had no effect. Furthermore, 20-HETE (10(-9) M) synergized with forskolin (10(-5) M) and with the diacylglycerol analog 1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-sn-glycerol (OAG; 10(-11) M; 62.0 +/- 5.3 and 69.9 +/- 2.0% of control activity, respectively), indicating a cooperative role of 20-HETE with the D(1)-triggered pathways. In line with these results, no additive effect was observed when OAG and 20-HETE were combined at concentrations which per se produced maximal inhibition (10(-6) M). These results demonstrate that the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity by DA in the proximal tubule may be the result of the synergism between 20-HETE and the D(1) signaling pathway.
