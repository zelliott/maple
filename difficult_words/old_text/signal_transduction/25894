PPARγ agonists exert neuroprotective effects against various types of brain injuries. In the present study, we investigated the effects of KR-62980, a new PPARγ agonist, and rosiglitazone on the neuronal cell death induced by chemical ischemia-reperfusion in SK-N-SH cells and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Both agonists inhibited chemical ischemia-reperfusion-induced cell death, and the effects were associated with anti-apoptotic action. KR-62980 and rosiglitazone suppressed NO and ROS formation, and N-acetyl-N-acetoxy-4-chlorobenzenesulfonamide, an NO generator, reversed the protective effects of the agonists on cell viability. In the agonist-induced anti-apoptotic process, PTEN expression was suppressed in parallel with increased Akt and ERK phosphorylation, whereas PD98059 (an ERK inhibitor) or wortmannin (a PI-3K inhibitor) abolished the cell survival by KR-62980 and rosiglitazone. All of the effects of KR-62980 and rosiglitazone appeared to be PPARγ-dependent because the effects were reversed by bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, a PPARγ antagonist, or by PPARγ knockdown. Our results demonstrate that two PPARγ agonists, KR-62980 and rosiglitazone, inhibited chemical ischemia-reperfusion-induced neuronal cell death by PPARγ-mediated anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant mechanisms related to PTEN suppression and ERK phosphorylation.
