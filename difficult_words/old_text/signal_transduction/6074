Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P(2)) regulates key reactions of the primary carbohydrate metabolism in all eukaryotes. In plants, Fru-2,6-P(2) coordinates the photosynthetic carbon flux into sucrose and starch biosynthesis. The use of transgenic plants has allowed the regulatory models to be tested by modifying the Fru-2,6-P(2) levels and the enzymes regulated by Fru-2,6-P(2). Genes for the bifunctional plant enzyme that synthesizes and degrades Fru-2,6-P(2) have been isolated and molecular characterization has provided new insight into structure and molecular regulation of the enzyme. Advances in Fru-2,6-P(2) physiology and molecular biology are discussed. These advances have not only enlightened in vivo operation of Fru-2,6-P(2) but also revealed that the Fru-2,6-P(2) regulatory system is highly complex and interacts with other regulatory mechanisms.
