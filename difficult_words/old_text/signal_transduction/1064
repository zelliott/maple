A long term objective of our research effort is to define factors that influence the specificity and efficiency of signal propagation by heterotrimeric G-proteins (G). G-proteins play a central role in cellular communication mediating the cell response to numerous hormones and neurotransmitters. A major determinant of signalling specificity for heterotrimeric G-proteins is the cell specific expression of the subtypes of the primary signalling entities, receptor, G and effector (E). Another major site for regulating signalling specificity lies at the R-G or G-E interface where these interactions are influenced by cell architecture, the stoichiometry of signalling components and accessory proteins that may segregate the receptor to microdomains of the cell, regulate the efficiency and/or specificity of signal transfer and/or influence the activation state of G-protein independent of a classical G-protein coupled receptor. One strategy to address these issues in our laboratory involves the identification of cellular proteins that regulate the transfer of signal from receptor to G or directly influence the activation state of G independent of a classical G-protein coupled receptor. We identified three proteins, AGS1, AGS2 and AGS3 (for Activators of G-protein Signaling), that activated heterotrimeric G-protein signalling pathways in the absence of a typical receptor. AGS1, 2 and 3 interact with different subunits and/or conformations of heterotrimeric G-proteins, selectively activate different G-proteins, provide unexpected mechanisms for regulation of the G-protein activation cycle and have opened up a new area of research related to the cellular role of G-proteins as signal transducers.
