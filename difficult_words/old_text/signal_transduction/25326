Insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are important regulators of energy metabolism and growth. Several findings have outlined an important role played by this family of molecules in both tumor maintenance and development. Despite the established contribution of the IGF system in carcinogenesis, little and contrasting data have been reported concerning the intertwined relationships between melanoma and this family of molecules. The present minireview aims to summarize the main topics and evidence concerning this malignant skin cancer, with a focus on the following: i) melanoma and cell proliferation effects induced by the IGF system, ii) in vitro and in vivo experimental data, and iii) targeting studies. Because of consistent findings regarding the role of the IGF-1 receptor in the modulation of IGF-1 activity, possible therapeutic strategies combining the use of antisense oligonucleotides against IGF-1 receptor mRNA could be applied in the future.
