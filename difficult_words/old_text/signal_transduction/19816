The heterogeneity of human breast cancer has been well described at the morphological, molecular, and genomic levels. This heterogeneity presents one of the greatest obstacles in the effective treatment of breast cancer since the distinct forms of breast cancer that reflect distinct mechanisms of disease will require distinct therapies. Although mouse models of cancer have traditionally been used to simplify the study of human disease, we suggest that there are opportunities to also model the complexity and heterogeneity of human cancer. Here, we illustrate the similarities of mouse models to the human condition in the heterogeneity of both pathologies and gene expression. We then provide an illustration of the potential of gene expression analysis methods when used in conjunction with current treatment options to model individualized therapeutic regimes.
