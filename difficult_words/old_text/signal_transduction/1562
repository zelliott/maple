HemAT-Bs is a heme-containing signal transducer protein responsible for aerotaxis of Bacillus subtilis. The recombinant HemAT-Bs expressed in Escherichia coli was purified as the oxy form in which oxygen was bound to the ferrous heme. Oxygen binding and dissociation rate constants were determined to be k(on) = 32 microm(-1) s(-1) and k(off) = 23 s(-1), respectively, revealing that HemAT-Bs has a moderate oxygen affinity similar to that of sperm whale myoglobin (Mb). The rate constant for autoxidation at 37 degrees C was 0.06 h(-1), which is also close to that of Mb. Although the electronic absorption spectra of HemAT-Bs were similar to those of Mb, HemAT-Bs showed some unique characteristics in its resonance Raman spectra. Oxygen-bound HemAT-Bs gave the nu(Fe-O(2)) band at a noticeably low frequency (560 cm(-1)), which suggests a unique hydrogen bonding between a distal amino acid residue and the proximal atom of the bound oxygen molecule. Deoxy HemAT-Bs gave the nu(Fe-His) band at a higher frequency (225 cm(-1)) than those of ordinary His-coordinated deoxy heme proteins. CO-bound HemAT-Bs gave the nu(Fe-CO) and nu(C-O) bands at 494 and 1964 cm(-1), respectively, which fall on the same nu(C-O) versus nu(Fe-CO) correlation line as that of Mb. Based on these results, the structural and functional properties of HemAT-Bs are discussed.
