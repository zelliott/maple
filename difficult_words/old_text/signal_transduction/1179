Phospholipase C-beta 2 (PLC-beta 2) is a key enzyme in mammalian taste signal transduction. To analyze the taste system in fishes at molecular level, we cloned mfplc-beta 2 as a medaka fish homologue of PLC-beta 2. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that mfplc-beta 2 is expressed in the lip and branchial region where chemosensory tissues are distributed. Immunohistochemical detection of nerve fibers near the mfplc-beta 2 positive cells suggests the characteristic of peripheral sensory cells. These results suggest that mfplc-beta 2 is expressed in the gustatory sensory cells of medaka. This may provide a molecular basis for the taste reception at multiple tissues in fish species.
