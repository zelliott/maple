nt signalling pathways regulate cell proliferation, cell fate and morphogenetic movements. Here, we demonstrate that the Frizzled (Fz) family of Wnt receptors, similarly to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), form specific homo- and hetero-oligomers. Two lines of evidence suggest that oligomerization occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum: first, a mutant allele of Fz4, encoding a truncated protein that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, is linked to the autosomal-dominant retinal degenerative disease, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR). We show that this mutant form of Fz4 oligomerizes with wild-type Fz4, retains it in the endoplasmic reticulum and inhibits its signalling. Second, a derivative of Fz1 targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum traps wild-type Fz1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and blocks its signalling. These data support the hypothesis that oligomerization of mutant and wild-type Fz proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and may explain the genetic dominance of this FEVR allele.
