Earlier studies have revealed beneficial effects of metabolic therapy in animals with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to myocardial infarction. Because heart failure is also associated with attenuated response to catecholamines, we examined the effects of propionyl L-carnitine (PLC) (a carnitine derivative) therapy on the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) signal transduction in the failing heart.

Heart failure in rats was induced by occluding the coronary artery and 3 weeks later the animals were treated with or without 100 mg/kg (intraperitoneally, daily) PLC for 5 weeks. The animals were assessed for their left ventricular function and inotropic responses to isoproterenol. Crude membranes were isolated from the remote, nonischemic (viable) left ventricle and examined for changes in beta-AR and adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity.

Animals with heart failure exhibited depressions in ventricular function, positive inotropic response to isoproterenol, beta-AR receptor density and basal AC activity; these changes were also attenuated by PLC treatment. The stimulation of AC activities with isoproterenol, 5'-guanyl imidodiphosphate, forskolin and sodium fluoride was decreased in the failing hearts and these changes were also prevented by PLC treatment.

The results indicate that metabolic therapy with PLC not only attenuates the defects in heart function but also prevents changes in the beta-AR signal transduction in CHF due to myocardial infarction.
