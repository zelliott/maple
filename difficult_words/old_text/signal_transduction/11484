Many of the effects of nitric oxide are mediated by the direct modification of cysteine residues resulting in an adduct called a nitrosothiol. Here, we describe a novel method for detecting proteins that contain nitrosothiols. In this three-step procedure, nitrosylated cysteines are converted to biotinylated cysteines. Biotinylated proteins can then be detected by immunoblotting or can be purified by avidin-affinity chromatography. We include examples of the detection of S-nitrosylated proteins in brain lysates after in vitro S-nitrosylation, as well as the detection of endogenous S-nitrosothiols in selected neuronal proteins.
