A dimorphic transition from the yeast form to filamentous one in Candida tropicalis pK233 is triggered by the addition of ethanol into the glucose semi-defined liquid medium and the process of filamentation accompanies temporal depolarization of yeast cells. The transition is completely prevented by further supplementation of myo-inositol at the start of cultivation. The addition of ethanol caused an increase in membrane fluidity during the process of depolarization, and then fluidity was gradually lowered to the level equivalent with that of the stationary-phase yeast cells in accordance with filamentation. The increase in membrane fluidity of ethanol-induced cells appeared parallel with reduction in the content of membrane phosphatidylinositol, which was rich in saturated palmitic acid. Introduction of exogenous myo-inositol or 1 M sorbitol into the ethanol-supplemented culture at the start of cultivation restored yeast growth and the reduction of membrane fluidity occurred, coupled with the recovery of the phosphatidylinositol content.
