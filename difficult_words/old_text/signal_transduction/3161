Ran-binding protein microtubule-organizing center (RanBPM) appears to function as a scaffolding protein in several signal transduction pathways. RanBPM is a crucial component of multiprotein complexes that regulate the cellular function by modulating and/or assembling with a wide range of proteins in different intracellular regions and thereby mediate diverse cellular functions. This suggests a role for RanBPM as a scaffolding protein. In this article, we have summarized the diverse functions of RanBPM and its interacting partners that have been investigated to date. Also, we have categorized the role of RanBPM into four divisions: RanBPM as a modulator/protein stabilizer, regulator of transcription activity, cell cycle and neurological functions.
