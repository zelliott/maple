The erythrocyte (or HepG2/brain) type glucose transporter (GLUT 1) was the first of the family of facilitative glucose transporter proteins to be cloned [M. Mueckler et al., Science 229, 941-945, 1985]. GLUT 1 is expressed in most tissue types, all cell lines, transformed cells and tumour cells. It is thought to be responsible for "housekeeping" levels of glucose transport, i.e. the uptake of glucose required for oxidative phosphorylation. The rate of glucose transport via GLUT 1 can be regulated under conditions in which the metabolic rate must be adjusted such as cell division (mitosis and meiosis), differentiation, transformation and nutrient starvation. Here we review the recent literature on the control of glucose transport of mitogens, growth factors and oncogenes, and discuss some of the implications for the integration of cellular signalling pathways and cell growth.
