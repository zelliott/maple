Autocrine motility factor (AMF), which is identical to phosphohexose isomerase (PHI)/glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), a ubiquitous enzyme essential for glycolysis, neuroleukin (NLK), a neurotrophic growth factor, and maturation factor (MF) mediating the differentiation of human myeloid cells, enhances the motility and metastatic ability of tumor cells. AMF/PHI activity is elevated in the serum or urine in patients with malignant tumors. Here, we constructed an amf/phi/nlk/mf gene using adenovirus vector and transfected into two tumor cell lines. Overexpression of AMF/PHI/NLK/MF enhanced AMF secretion into the culture media in both tumor cell lines. However, upregulation of motility and metastatic ability was found only in metastatic fibrosarcoma cells expressing an AMF receptor, gp78, and was not found in gp78-undetectable osteosarcoma cells. Thus, not only serum AMF activity but also gp78-expression in tumor cells may be required for metastasis-related motility induction. With the use of microarray analyses, we detected two augmented genes, rho GDP dissociation inhibitor beta and kinesin motor 3A, as well as AMF itself. The RNA message and protein expression of these two molecules was confirmed to be upregulated, suggesting a possible association with AMF-induced signaling for cell motility and metastasis.
