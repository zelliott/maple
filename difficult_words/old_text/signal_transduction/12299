The p53-induced protein with a death domain, PIDD, was identified as a p53 target gene whose main role is to execute apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. To investigate the physiological role of PIDD in apoptosis, we generated PIDD-deficient mice. Here, we report that, although PIDD expression is inducible upon DNA damage, PIDD-deficient mice undergo apoptosis normally not only in response to DNA damage, but also in response to various p53-independent stress signals and to death receptor (DR) engagement. This indicates that PIDD is not required for DNA damage-, stress-, and DR-induced apoptosis. Also, in the absence of PIDD, both caspase-2 processing and activation occur in response to DNA damage. Our findings demonstrate that PIDD does not play an essential role for all p53-mediated or p53-independent apoptotic pathways.
