In brown algae fertilization takes place free from surrounding tissue layers. The cytoskeleton and transmembrane links to the cell wall are involved in establishing and stabilizing the polar axis and in determining the fate of cells in the early embryo. In seed plants, the egg cell and zygote exhibit apical basal polarity. Mutant studies suggest that axes of polarity of the early embryo depend on signalling between the apical and basal compartments, possibly involving auxin. Development of somatic cells into plant embryos involves extracellular matrix-derived arabinogalactan proteins. This suggests a role for the cell wall in plant embryogenesis.
