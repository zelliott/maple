The cellular adhesion status and the exposure to soluble growth factors both contribute to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. To date, however, whether mitogens acting through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) need cell adhesion to activate MAP kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1, 2 has been poorly investigated. We addressed this point in primary cultures of Sertoli cells experimentally maintained in suspension, considering that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) activates ERK1, 2 in attached Sertoli cells by acting through a GPCR. We found that FSH actively repressed ERK1, 2, in a cAMP-dependent but cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-independent manner, and this inhibition required the activity of a tyrosine phosphatase. In comparison, in the absence of anchorage, ERK1, 2 were still activated by epidermal growth factor, in a PKA-dependent manner. Altogether, these data suggest that sensitivity of the MAP kinase response toward cell adhesion may depend, at least in part, on the class of receptor, GPCR or receptor with tyrosine kinase activity, by which it is triggered.
