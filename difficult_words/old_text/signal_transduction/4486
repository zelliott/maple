CXCL12/CXCR4 plays an important role in metastasis of gastric carcinoma. Rapamycin has been reported to inhibit migration of gastric cancer cells. However, the role of mTOR pathway in CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated cell migration and the potential of drugs targeting PI3K/mTOR pathway remains unelucidated. We found that CXCL12 activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in MKN-45 cells. Stimulating CHO-K1 cells expressing pEGFP-C1-Grp1-PH fusion protein with CXCL12 resulted in generation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, which provided direct evidence of activating PI3K by CXCL12. Down-regulation of p110β by siRNA but not p110α blocked phosphorylation of Akt and S6K1 induced by CXCL12. Consistently, p110β-specific inhibitor blocked the CXCL12-activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Moreover, CXCR4 immunoprecipitated by anti-p110β antibody increased after CXCL12 stimulation and G(i) protein inhibitor pertussis toxin abrogated CXCL12-induced activation of PI3K. Further studies demonstrated that inhibitors targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway significantly blocked the chemotactic responses of MKN-45 cells triggered by CXCL12, which might be attributed primarily to inhibition of mTORC1 and related to prevention of F-actin reorganization as well as down-regulation of active RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Furthermore, rapamycin inhibited the secretion of CXCL12 and the expression of CXCR4, which might form a positive feedback loop to further abolish upstream signaling leading to cell migration. Finally, we found cells expressing high levels of cxcl12 were sensitive to rapamycin in its activity inhibiting migration as well as proliferation. In summary, we found that the mTOR pathway played an important role in CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated cell migration and proposed that drugs targeting the mTOR pathway may be used for the therapy of metastatic gastric cancer expressing high levels of cxcl12.
