We recently showed that c-kit signal synergizes with glycoprotein (gp)130 signal mediated by a complex of interleukin (IL)-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6/sIL-6R) to stimulate the expansion of human primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells and erythropoietin-independent erythropoiesis. In the present study, we examined the effect of a ligand for Flt3 (FL), whose receptor tyrosine kinase is closely related to c-kit, in combination with IL-6/sIL-6R on human hematopoiesis in vitro. In serum-containing methylcellulose clonal culture of cord blood CD34(+) cells, whereas FL alone stimulated only granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony formation, erythroid bursts and mixed colonies in addition to GM colonies were induced by FL with IL-6/sIL-6R, but not IL-6/sIL-6R alone. In suspension culture, CD34(+) cells generated a small number of myeloid cells in the presence of FL or IL-6/sIL-6R alone. However, the addition of IL-6/sIL-6R to the culture with FL induced the generation of a significant number of erythroid cells and megakaryocytes in addition to myeloid cells. The combination of FL and IL-6/sIL-6R also induced a remarkable expansion of GM colony- and erythroid burst-forming cells and multipotential progenitors, although FL or IL-6/sIL-6R alone induced the generation of only a small number of progenitors for GM colonies. The synergistic effects of FL and IL-6/sIL-6R were confirmed in serum-free clonal and suspension cultures. In addition, the addition of anti-human gp130 monoclonal antibodies abrogated the synergistic action. These results indicate that Flt3 signal, as well as c-kit signal, synergizes with gp130 signal to stimulate human myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, and the expansion of primitive multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cells.
