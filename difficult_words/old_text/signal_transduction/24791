Acid sphingomyelinase-deficient (asmase-/-) mice generated by gene targeting abundantly store sphingomyelin in the reticuloendothelial system of liver, spleen, bone marrow, and in brain. Liver cells of asmase-/- mice accumulate sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids in purified lipid bilayers of microsomes, Golgi, and the plasma membrane, but cholesterol is depleted in the plasma membrane. Detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched membrane microdomains (GEM) can be isolated from hepatocytes, embryonic fibroblasts, and splenocytes of wild-type, but not of asmase-/- mice, by sucrose gradient density centrifugation. Lck and other Src-family kinases are reduced in isopycnic fractions of asmase-/- splenocytes compared to GEM-containing fractions of wild-type cells. The proliferation of asmase-/- T lymphocytes is reduced, whereas their susceptibility to Fas-induced apoptosis is increased after T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. TNF receptor I signaling remains unimpaired. The perturbation of GEM impairs tyrosine phosphorylation and, consequently, mitogenic signaling of the TCR. Reduced MAPK activity-dependent FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) expression in asmase-/- T lymphocytes increases their sensitivity towards Fas-mediated apoptosis.
