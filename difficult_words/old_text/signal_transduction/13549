It is well known that Fc receptors for IgG (FcRII) on macrophages mediate the endocytosis of antibody-antigen complexes and signal the release of inflammatory and cytotoxic agents. FcRII are also expressed at high levels on B cells where they are less involved in endocytosis than in modulating B-cell activation by membrane immunoglobulins. Although crosslinking of membrane immunoglobulins can result in B-cell differentiation and proliferation through stimulation of phospholipase C, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, and activation of protein kinase C, crosslinking FcR with membrane immunoglobulins confers a dominant inhibitory signal that prevents or aborts activation. This form of regulation may have a role in the induction of tolerance by IgG and in controlling the B-cell repertoire by anti-idiotypes. The different functions of FcR on B cells and macrophages may reflect the fact that these cell types express closely related but distinct FcR isoforms. We have recently found that the main lymphocyte FcR isoform, FcRII-B1, is unable to mediate endocytosis by way of coated pits and coated vesicles owing to an in-frame insertion of 47 amino acids in its cytoplasmic tail. Here we show that this insert, absent from the FcRII-B2 macrophage isoform, also contains serine phosphorylation sites that may have a role in the ability of FcR to regulate B-cell activation through membrane immunoglobulins.
