Increasing evidence for receptors for uracil nucleotides has focused interest on specific signalling mechanisms involving UTP and UDP. At least three metabotropic P2 receptors are stimulated by uracil nucleotides with equal or greater potency than by adenine nucleotides, and there might be ionotropic receptors as well. Regulation of uridine and uracil nucleotide levels is important when considering the receptor-mediated effects of these compounds. Cells can synthesize uracil nucleotides de novo or by salvage of uridine. UTP made from salvage might be preferentially used for RNA synthesis in the nucleus, while UTP synthesized de novo seems to be used for UDP-sugar and CDP-phospholipid production. UTP from both pathways can enter a free UTP pool, from which UTP can be released from cells. UTP and UDP can stimulate pyrimidinoceptors, but metabolism by ecto-nucleotidases limits their effects. Alternatively, UTP might be a substrate for ecto-protein kinases, and this could contribute to its extracellular regulation. Cells can reclaim uridine, using nucleoside transport processes, following dephosphorylation of UTP, UDP and UMP. In this article Christopher Anderson and Fiona Parkinson discuss how understanding the processes that regulate uridine and uracil nucleotide concentrations will enhance our ability to manipulate UTP/UDP signalling pathways for pharmacological effect.
