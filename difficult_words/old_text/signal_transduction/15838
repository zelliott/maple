Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death. Understanding lung tumours physiopathology should provide opportunity to prevent tumour development or/and improve their therapeutic management. Cancer stem cell theory refers to a subpopulation of cancer cells also named tumour initiating cells that can drive cancer development. Cells presenting these characteristics have been identified and isolated from lung cancer. Exploring cell markers and signalling pathways specific to lung cancer stem cells may lead to progress in therapy and improve the prognosis of patients with lung cancer. Continuous efforts in developing in vitro and in vivo models may yield reliable tools to better understand cancer stem cell abilities and to test new therapeutic targets. Even if some data are in favour of a higher chemo and radioresistance of cancer stem cells this issue remains disputed. Preclinical data on putative cancer stem cell targets are emerging by now. These preliminary studies are critical for the next generation of lung cancer therapies.
