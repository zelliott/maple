The salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) are a family of related serine-threonine kinases. In cultured adrenocortical cells, SIK1 is rapidly but transiently induced by adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) treatment, suggesting that it contributes to ACTH-mediated induction of steroidogenic enzymes. However, ACTH treatment of Y1 mouse adrenocortical cells stimulates a rapid translocation of SIK1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and SIK1 represses the transcription of a steroidogenic enzyme by inhibiting the action of cAMP-responsive elements in the promoter. These studies suggest that SIK1 has a role in the fine tuning of steroidogenic enzyme production during the initial phase of steroidogenesis. SIK2 is found in adipocytes and phosphorylates a specific serine residue in insulin receptor substrate-1. This finding, along with the fact that its expression is raised in the white adipose tissue of mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus, suggests that SIK2 might be involved in metabolic regulation in adipose tissue. Thus, members of the SIK family are emerging as important modulators of key processes such as steroid hormone biosynthesis by the adrenal cortex and insulin signaling in adipocytes.
