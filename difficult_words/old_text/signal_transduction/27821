The regulation of metabolic gene expression is a major mechanism by which insulin modulates glucose homeostasis. Defective transcription factors or signal transduction molecules that are required for insulin regulated gene expression could contribute to insulin resistance. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and hexokinase II (HKII) genes are involved in metabolic processes that represent opposing facets of glucose homeostasis, namely gluconeogenesis and glucose utilization. The regulation of the PEPCK and HKII genes by insulin has been studied in great detail at the level of both transcription and signal transduction. Recent work on the insulin signaling pathways that lead to down-regulation of PEPCK gene expression and upregulation of HKII gene expression has shown that they both require activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) for the transmission of the insulin signal. However, the pathways diverge after PI3K and lead to activation of different downstream effectors. In this paper we review the results of studies on the transcriptional regulation of these genes by insulin and the signal transduction pathways that mediate these responses.
