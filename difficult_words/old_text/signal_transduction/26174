Decreased Mg(2+) concentration has been implicated in altered vascular reactivity, endothelial dysfunction and structural remodeling, processes important in vascular changes and target organ damage associated with hypertension. Unlike our knowledge of other major cations, mechanisms regulating cellular Mg(2+) handling are poorly understood. Until recently little was known about protein transporters controlling transmembrane Mg(2+) influx. However, new research has uncovered a number of genes and proteins identified as transmembrane Mg(2+) transporters, particularly transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) cation channels, TRPM6 and TRPM7. Whereas TRPM6 is found primarily in epithelial cells, TRPM7 is ubiquitously expressed. Vascular TRPM7 has been implicated as a signaling kinase involved in vascular smooth muscle cell growth, apoptosis, adhesion, contraction, cytoskeletal organization and migration, and is modulated by vasoactive agents, pressure, stretch and osmotic changes. Emerging evidence suggests that vascular TRPM7 function might be altered in hypertension. The present review discusses the importance of Mg(2+) in vascular biology in hypertension and focuses on transport systems, mainly TRPM7, that might play a role in the control of vascular Mg(2+) homeostasis. Elucidation of the relationship between the complex systems responsible for regulation of Mg(2+) homeostasis, the role of TRPM7 in vascular signaling, and the cardiovascular impact will be important for understanding the clinical implications of hypomagnesemia in cardiovascular disease.
