Hematopoietic progenitor cells can be mobilized from the bone marrow to the blood by a wide variety of stimuli, including hematopoietic growth factors, chemotherapy, and chemokines. Increasingly, mobilized peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor cells instead of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells have been used to reconstitute hematopoiesis after myeloablative therapy because of their reduced engraftment times and relative ease of collection. A striking feature of hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization is the ability of hematopoietic growth factors with distinct cellular targets and biologic activities to mobilize a similar spectrum of pluripotent and lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitor cells into the blood. Recent studies have identified some of the key adhesive interactions that regulate hematopoietic progenitor cell trafficking in the bone marrow. In addition, pathways linking mobilizing agents to hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization have begun to be elucidated. This review summarizes these advances, emphasizing the mechanisms regulating granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced mobilization.
