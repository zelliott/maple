Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies in recent years have allowed in-depth study of somatic mutations in over 1,000 breast cancer samples.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is the largest single genome-characterization effort to date. It is remarkable for the integration of DNA sequencing with genome-wide profiling of the epigenome, microRNAome, transcriptome, and proteome for more than 500 diverse primary untreated breast cancers. This article aims to provide an overview ofTCGA findings, with a particular focus on their potential biological relevance and therapeutic implications.
