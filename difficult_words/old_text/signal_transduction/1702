Early experiments investigating the effects of CO(2) enrichment on plants frequently showed photosynthetic stimulation and reduced stomatal aperture over short time periods. Work on the effects of elevated CO(2) has advanced in two major areas: by the extension of long-term and field experiments, and through investigations on the wide range of negative feedbacks affecting plant responses to CO(2). Downward photosynthetic acclimation in response to CO(2) enrichment is frequently observed over the short and long term, and indicates the activity of diverse feedback mechanisms. CO(2) is generally viewed as a limiting photosynthetic resource. However, recent work on stomatal development has shown that this view is simplistic: long- and short-distance signalling of CO(2) concentration are necessary components of normal plant development.
