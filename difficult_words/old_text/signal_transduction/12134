Plant hormones have pivotal roles in almost every aspect of plant development. Over the past decades, physiological and genetic studies have revealed that hormone action in plants is determined by complex interactions between hormonal signalling pathways. Evidence is accumulating for the existence of crosstalk between the auxin and jasmonate (JA) signalling pathways. Recently, the JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins have been identified as the long-sought repressors of JA signalling. Here, we show that expression of JAZ1/TIFY10A is not solely inducible by JA, but that it is also an early auxin-responsive gene. Furthermore, we could show that the auxin-inducible expression of JAZ1/TIFY10A is independent of the JA signalling pathway but is controlled by the auxin/indole-3-acetic acid-auxin response transcription factor signalling pathway. Our results provide evidence for the existence of at least two different input signals regarding JAZ1/TIFY10A expression and thus support the idea of an intimate molecular interplay between auxin and JA signalling.
