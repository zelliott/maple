The heart is one of the first functional embryonic organs occurring during development. The fundamental developmental processes and genes involved in cardiogenesis are conserved between the invertebrates and vertebrates. In the past fifteen years, one of signaling pathways that has been best characterized in heart development in both invertebrates and vertebrates is the Wg/Wnt signaling pathways. Since our discovery of the Wg signaling required for the early heart development in Drosophila, the past fifteen years have witnessed tremendous progress in the understanding of specific Wnt signaling pathways in vertebrate cardiogenesis. This review will summarize the current state of knowledge of Wg signaling transduction in Drosophila heart development, which will benefit our understanding of vertebrate cardiogenesis and human congenital malformations.
