The Second International Workshop on Cytokines was held two years after its predecessor. The scope was extremely broad--cytokines. This attracted a large and extremely diverse group of participants (700 people and 526 abstracts), interested in many different cytokines (interleukins 1-8, tumor necrosis factors, interferons, colony-stimulating factors, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factors and others) from the perspective mainly of research laboratories devoted to studies of diverse disciplines such as immunology, endocrinology, neurobiology, molecular biology, pharmacology and biochemistry.
