Remarkable advances have recently been made in the study of visceral sensitivity. Both electrophysiological and histological data emphasize the richness and the complexity of information elicited in the visceral area including the digestive tract. In addition these afferents are largely involved in physiological mechanisms which are not only restricted to the visceral area. The current knowledge of visceral sensitivity leads us to reconsider the classical ideas and concepts previously accepted in this field and raises questions to help gain a better comprehension of sensory physiology in general.
