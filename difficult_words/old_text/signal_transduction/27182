The experiments presented here were designed to examine the contribution of p125 focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) tyrosine phosphorylation to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade induced by bombesin, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in Swiss 3T3 cells. We found that tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in response to these growth factors is completely abolished in cells treated with cytochalasin D or in cells that were suspended in serum-free medium for 30 min. In marked contrast, the activation of p42mapk by these factors was independent of the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and of the interaction of the cells with the extracellular matrix. The protein kinase C inhibitor GF 109203X and down-regulation of protein kinase C by prolonged pretreatment of cells with phorbol esters blocked bombesin-stimulated activation of p42mapk, p90rsk, and MAPK kinase-1 but did not prevent bombesin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK. Furthermore, LPA-induced p42mapk activation involved a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanylate nucleotide-binding protein, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in response to LPA was not prevented by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Finally, PDGF induced maximum p42mapk activation at concentrations (30 ng/ml) that failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK. Thus, our results demonstrate that p42mapk activation in response to bombesin, LPA, and PDGF can be dissociated from p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in Swiss 3T3 cells.
