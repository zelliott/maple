Although microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many biological processes, the mechanisms whereby miRNAs regulate osteoblastic differentiation are poorly understood. Here, we found that BMP-4-induced osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow-derived ST2 stromal cells was promoted and repressed after transfection of sense and antisense miR-210, respectively. A reporter assay demonstrated that the activin A receptor type 1B (AcvR1b) gene was a target for miR-210. Furthermore, inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/activin signaling in ST2 cells with SB431542 promoted osteoblastic differentiation. We conclude that miR-210 acts as a positive regulator of osteoblastic differentiation by inhibiting the TGF-beta/activin signaling pathway through inhibition of AcvR1b.
