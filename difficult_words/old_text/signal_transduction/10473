Both CCL27 and CCL28 are ligands for CCR10 and attract CCR10(+) lymphocytes. We previously demonstrated that CCL27 and CCL28 were strongly expressed in sera and lesional keratinocytes of patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis vulgaris. However, the regulation of CCL27 and CCL28 production in keratinocytes has not been well documented. In this study, we showed that CCL27 and CCL28 expression and production by a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT cells, were strongly induced by inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta. CCL27 production was downregulated by inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). By contrast, CCL28 production was downregulated by inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and NF-kappaB. Our study results suggest that CCL28 produced by keratinocytes is mediated by different signal pathways from CCL27 and that both CCL27 and CCL28 are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases.
