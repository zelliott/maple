We investigate how the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR), an essential regulator of inflammation, contributes to the α7 agonist nicotine-enhanced Escherichia coli K1 invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) through lipid rafts/caveolae-mediated signaling.

α7 nAChR-mediated signaling and bacterial invasion were defined by lipid raft fractionation, immunofluorescence microscopy and siRNA knockdown.

Nicotine-enhanced bacterial invasion was dose-dependently inhibited by two raft-disrupting agents, nystatin and filipin. Significant accumulation of the lipid raft marker GM3 was observed in HBMEC induced by E. coli K1 and nicotine. The recruitment of α7 nAChR and related signaling molecules, including vimentin, and Erk1/2, to caveolin-1 enriched lipid rafts was increased upon treatment with E44 or E44 plus nicotine. Erk1/2 activation (phosphorylation), which is required for α7 nAChR-mediated signaling and E44 invasion, was associated with lipid rafts and nicotine-enhanced bacterial infection. Furthermore, E44 invasion, E44/nicotine-induced activation of Erk1/2 and clustering of α7 nAChR and caveolin-1 was specifically blocked by both siRNAs.

α7 nAChR-mediated signaling through lipid rafts/caveolae is required for nicotine-enhanced E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC.
