The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Porphyromonas gingivalis is thought to induce periodontitis. In this study, we isolated Schisandrin from the dried fruits of Schisandra chinensis and examined the anti-inflammatory effect of Schisandrin in macrophages stimulated with LPS from P. gingivalis. First, Schisandrin inhibited LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. And Schisandrin suppressed the nuclear translocation and activity of NF-κB and phosphorylation of IκBα in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Next, the presence of a selective inhibitor of HO-1 (SnPP) and a siRNA specific for HO-1 inhibited Schisandrin-mediated anti-inflammatory activity. Furthermore, Schisandrin induced HO-1 expression of RAW 264.7 cells through Nrf-2, PI3K/Akt, and ERK activation. Therefore, these results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of Schisandrin on P. gingivalis LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells may be due to a reduction of NF-κB activity and induction of the expression of HO-1, leading to TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 down-regulation.
