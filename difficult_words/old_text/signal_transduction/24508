We describe the isolation of a protein, SWAP-70-like adapter of T cells (SLAT), which is expressed at high levels in thymocytes and differentiated Th2 cells. SLAT expression was upregulated in differentiating Th2 cells and downregulated in Th1 cells. Ectopic SLAT expression exerted positive or negative effects on IL-4 versus IFNgamma induction, respectively. TCR signaling induced translocation of SLAT to the immunological synapse and its association with ZAP-70 kinase. SLAT reduced the association of ZAP-70 with TCR-zeta and interfered with ZAP-70 but not Lck signaling. Consistent with these results, pharmacological inhibition of ZAP-70 also induced Th2 skewing. Thus, SLAT is a protein which plays a role in Th2 development and/or activation, perhaps by interfering with ZAP-70 signaling.
