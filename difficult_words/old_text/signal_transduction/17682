The p53 protein is a key player in the cellular response to stress. Proper regulation of p53 is imperative for the suppression of tumor development. This regulation is largely governed by its master inhibitor, Mdm2, which both blocks p53 activities and promotes its destabilization. This tight regulation of p53 by Mdm2 must be interrupted under stress conditions in order for p53 to be stabilized in an active form. A combined action of partner proteins and modifying enzymes is essential for the relief of p53 from Mdm2. The recent revelation of p53 association with the PML-nuclear bodies provides one explanation of how this regulatory network is coordinated within the nucleus in response to certain stress conditions. Thus, it is not only the nature of the p53 regulatory complex but also the spatial and temporal context of this association that governs the output inhibitory signals mediated by p53.
