Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction that probably due to a deficit in synaptic plasticity. One member of neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is known to be involved in the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model for learning and memory. Moreover, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated gene (Arc), an immediate early gene, is found to be a downstream effector of the BDNF signaling cascade. Inhibition of Arc protein synthesis impairs both the maintenance of LTP and the consolidation of long-term memory. In addition, the formation of senile plaques is a pathological feature in AD and mainly consists of the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta), a proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein. Several studies concerning neurobehavioral performance have suggested that Abeta at sublethal levels interfere with the signaling cascades critical for synaptic plasticity and thus lead to the cognitive impairment in early stage of AD. Whether the BDNF-mediated Arc synthesis is impaired by sublethal Abeta in early AD is still unclear. Therefore, in the present study, primary cultures of neonatal rat cortical neurons were used to evaluate the effect of sublethal Abeta on the BDNF-induced Arc protein expression. Consistent with the literature, Arc, an indicator of synaptic plasticity, was induced by BDNF (25 ng/ml) in both dose- and time-dependent manners. After treating cultures with sublethal Abeta (5 microM), a significant suppression was observed on the level of BDNF-induced Arc protein expression. This result indicates that Abeta at sublethal level impairs the BDNF-mediated signaling in cortical neurons and thus underlies the deficits of synaptic plasticity occurred at the early stage of AD before significant neuronal loss.
