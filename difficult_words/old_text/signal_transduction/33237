Induction of anergy and deletion due to apoptosis are two of the mechanisms involved in peripheral tolerance. To clarify the relationship between these two phenomena we have used an in vitro system of T cell Ag presentation. The recognition of Ag displayed by MHC class II-expressing T cells (T-APC) induces partial signals in Ag-specific T cell clones. This leads to a blunted intracellular calcium flux, and the T cells become unable to proliferate in response to further challenge with professional APC. These T cells are unable to produce IL-2, but retain the ability to release IL-4. In the present study, we report that for some T cell clones, the predominant outcome of Ag recognition on T cells is cell death. For susceptible T cell clones, the number of cells that die is proportional to the peptide concentration. This cell death resulted from Fas/Apo-1 (CD95)/Fas-ligand interactions between the T cells, in that Fas ligand expression was detected following overnight culture of T cells with T-APC and neutralizing anti-CD95 Ab protected from death. Most notably, following anti-CD95-mediated protection from apoptosis, the rescued T cells remained unable to respond to rechallenge with Ag-pulsed, professional APC. These data suggest that anergy and apoptosis can be separated as consequences of partial T cell signaling.
