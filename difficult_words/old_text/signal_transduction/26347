Signaling via heterotrimeric G-proteins is evoked by agonist-mediated stimulation of seven transmembrane spanning receptors (GPCRs). During the last decade it has become apparent that Gα subunits can be activated by receptor-independent mechanisms. Ric-8 belongs to a highly conserved protein family that regulates heterotrimeric G-protein function, acting as a non-canonical guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) over a subset of Gα subunits. In this review we discuss the roles of Ric-8 in the regulation of diverse cell functions, emphasizing the contribution of its multiple domain protein structure in these diverse functions.
