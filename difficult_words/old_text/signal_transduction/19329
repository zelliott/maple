We previously showed that offspring of rat dams receiving a protein-restricted (low protein) diet throughout pregnancy and lactation develop mammary tumors more quickly. Rapid post-weaning mammary growth and mammary tissue overexpression of insulin receptor, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), estrogen receptor isoform alpha and v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2), correlated with this risk. The objectives of this study were therefore (i) to identify underlying mechanisms of increased risk through candidate and global approaches; (ii) to determine if excessive calorie intake further increased risk and if so, (iii) to identify the molecular mechanisms mediating this. We provide evidence for transcriptional upregulation of IGF-1R by Sp1 in LP mammary tissue (P < 0.01). Cell cycle control and DNA damage repair gene cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) (p21waf1) was also upregulated (P < 0.05) as was transcription factor nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cell (P < 0.05) and adhesion gene CDH1 (P < 0.05). Invasion and metastasis markers matrix metalloproteinase 9 and serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade E, member 1 (SERPIN1) were upregulated (both P < 0.05), whereas metastasis suppressor gene NME1 was downregulated (P < 0.01). Feeding a highly palatable diet (HPD) to increase calorie intake from puberty, additively and independently increased early mammary tumor risk, which correlated with increased serum insulin and triglyceride concentrations (P < 0.05). PTEN gene expression was reduced both by early protein restriction (P < 0.05) and HPD (P < 0.01), which may induce Akt in cell survival pathways. Progesterone receptor and ERBB2 (both P < 0.05) expression increased as an effect of an interaction between maternal diet and adult nutrition, with subsequent downstream activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. We conclude that poor early growth and excessive calorie intake exert independent and additive effects on mitogenic growth factor signaling to influence mammary tumor susceptibility.
