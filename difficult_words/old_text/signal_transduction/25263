Stimulation of mouse peritoneal macrophages with zymosan or bacteria results in activation of 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) and release of arachidonate. We have investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) in the signalling leading to activation of cPLA(2) and release of arachidonate in response to zymosan and the bacterium Prevotella intermedia. The specific PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin completely inhibited zymosan- and bacteria-induced release of arachidonate with an IC(50) value of 10-20 nM. Wortmannin also completely inhibited the zymosan-induced activation of cPLA(2), while the cPLA(2) activation by bacteria was partially inhibited by about 50%. Further experiments showed that zymosan-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase was inhibited, and bacteria-induced activation of the kinase strongly reduced, in the presence of wortmannin. Also zymosan-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was inhibited by wortmannin, while p38 activation induced by bacteria was not. The zymosan- and bacteria-induced activation of phospholipase C, as determined by the generation of inositol phosphates, was also inhibited by wortmannin. Moreover, zymosan caused activation of PtdIns 3-kinase, which was totally inhibited by wortmannin. In contrast to zymosan and bacteria, arachidonate release induced by calcium ionophore alone, or further amplified by phorbol ester, was not sensitive to wortmannin. These results suggest that PtdIns 3-kinase constitutes a critical component in the zymosan- and bacteria-induced signalling leading to release of arachidonate and that PtdIns 3-kinase is positioned upstream of phospholipase C in this pathway.
