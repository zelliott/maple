Integrins mediate cell adhesion and signal transduction at focal adhesions. Here we investigate the roles of integrin beta subunits in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal structure and the activities of Rho and Rac. The overexpression of beta3 integrin in Chinese hamster ovary cells enhances Rho activity and stress fiber formation, whereas the overexpression of beta1 integrin increases Rac activity and lamellipodia formation. The overexpression of a mutant beta1-3-1 integrin, in which the extracellular I-domain-like sequence of beta1 integrin has been replaced with the corresponding sequence of beta3 integrin, also enhances Rho activity and the formation of stress fibers. Our results demonstrate that beta1 and beta3 integrins differentially regulate the activities of Rho family GTPases and that the extracellular domains of integrin beta subunits play a critical role in transducing the extracellular ligand-binding information into specific intracellular signaling events.
