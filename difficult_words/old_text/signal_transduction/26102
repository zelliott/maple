Endocytosis plays an important role in cell function and the activation and propagation of signaling pathways. Signaling occurs on endocytic pathways and signaling endosomes, and endocytosis is subjected to high-order regulation by cellular signaling mechanisms. Marginal cells showed active endocytosis of microperoxidase (MPO) via the clathrin-independent pathway. We examined the signaling pathway that regulates MPO endocytosis in marginal cells using specific inhibitors and activators of signaling molecules. The results showed that pertussis toxin - which inhibits the ribosylation of G-protein-coupled receptor - did not affect MPO endocytosis, but Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin - which induces RhoA inactivation resulting in extracellular-signal-related kinase inactivation - inhibited MPO endocytosis. The main endocytotic pathway of MPO did not depend on the Rho-associated protein kinase molecular switch or actin/myosin motor system, but was mainly regulated by the RhoA signaling cascade.
