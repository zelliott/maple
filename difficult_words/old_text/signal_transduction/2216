The extracellular signal regulated kinases (Erks) cascade is a major signalling system by which cells transduce extracellular signals into intracellular responses. To obtain information about the role of Erks in retrograde neuronal reaction, we investigated the changes of Erk 1 and Erk 2 with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical study in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve, which shows degenerative changes, and the hypoglossal nucleus, which shows regenerative changes, of adult rats after axotomy. The expression of mRNA and protein of Erk 1 increased between 7 and 28 days after axotomy both in the vagal and hypoglossal nuclei, however, there was no remarkable change in those of Erk 2. The increased expression of Erk 1 is common to both regenerative hypoglossal and degenerative vagal neurons. These findings indicate that Erk 1 is closely related with the retrograde neuronal reaction but whether neurons are destined to survive or die depends on some other factors.
