Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that regulates not only immune and inflammatory responses but also the growth of some tumors, including prostate carcinomas. IL-6 signals through Janus kinase, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and mitogen-activated protein kinase and is also able to induce androgen receptor (AR)-mediated gene activation in prostate cancer, which is an important process in prostate cancer androgen-independent progression. We now show that IL-6-induced AR-mediated gene activation requires the activation of STAT3 by IL-6 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. In particular, STAT3 associates with AR in an androgen-independent but IL-6-dependent manner. Inhibition of STAT3 rather than mitogen-activated protein kinase results in inhibition of AR-mediated gene activation in response to IL-6. These findings not only identify STAT3 as an important signaling molecule required for IL-6-signaling to induce AR-mediated gene activation in prostate carcinoma cells but also reveal the importance of activated STAT3 in human tumor development and progression.
