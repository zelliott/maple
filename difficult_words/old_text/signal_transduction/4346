We determined the distributional patterns of phospholipase C isozymes within the rat kidneys. PLC-beta1 was localized in the inner medulla at the highest degree followed by the inner stripe of the outer medulla, the cortex and the outer stripe of the outer medulla. PLC-gamma1 was distributed homogeneously along the corticomedullary axis. PLC-delta1 showed gradual increase from the cortex to the inner medulla. Tissue osmotic gradients were measured using 4 slices, resulting in gradual increase from the cortex to the inner medulla. The pattern of PLC-delta1 appeared very similar to the osmotic gradient in the kidney. The results suggest that the distinct patterns of the PLC isozymes may be associated with different signal transduction pathways along the corticomedullary axis and PLC-delta1 may play a role in the osmoregulation of the medullary region.
