Several platelet agonists, including thrombin, collagen, and thromboxane A(2), cause dense granule release independently of thromboxane generation. Because protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms are implicated in platelet secretion, we investigated the role of individual PKC isoforms in platelet dense granule release. PKCdelta was phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner that coincided with dense granule release in response to protease-activated receptor-activating peptides SFLLRN and AYPGKF in human platelets. Only agonists that caused platelet dense granule secretion activated PKCdelta. SFLLRN- or AYPGKF-induced dense granule release and PKCdelta phosphorylation occurred at the same respective agonist concentration. Furthermore, AYPGKF and SFLLRN-induced dense granule release was blocked by rottlerin, a PKCdelta selective inhibitor. In contrast, convulxin-induced dense granule secretion was potentiated by rottlerin but was abolished by Go6976, a classical PKC isoform inhibitor. However, SFLLRN-induced dense granule release was unaffected in the presence of Go6976. Finally, rottlerin did not affect SFLLRN-induced platelet aggregation, even in the presence of dimethyl-BAPTA, indicating that PKCdelta has no role in platelet fibrinogen receptor activation. We conclude that PKCdelta and the classical PKC isoforms play a differential role in platelet dense granule release mediated by protease-activated receptors and glycoprotein VI. Furthermore, PKCdelta plays a positive role in protease-activated receptor-mediated dense granule secretion, whereas it functions as a negative regulator downstream of glycoprotein VI signaling.
