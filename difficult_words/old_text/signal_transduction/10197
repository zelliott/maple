Carbohydrates, either bound to proteins or in lipids, play essential roles as communication molecules in many intercellular and intracellular processes. In particular, carbohydrates are important mediators of cell-cell recognition events and have been implicated in related processes such as cell signaling regulation, cellular differentiation and immune response. This diverse utility has long suggested the power of carbohydrates in therapeutic approaches. This Concepts article highlights the recent potential uses of glycoconjugates as therapeutics, with particular reference to glycopeptides, glycoproteins, glycodendrimers, and glycoarrays.
