Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-4 are known to differentially promote T helper (Th) cell differentiation. While IL-12 induces interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production and maturation of Th1 cells, IL-4 is thought to antagonize IL-12 and to favour Th2 development. Here we studied the combined action of various concentrations of common gamma-chain (gamma(c)-chain) cytokines, including IL-4 and the Th1 cytokine IL-12, in human activated lymphoblasts and Th1 cells. IL-4 and IL-7 potentiated IL-12-induced proliferation at every concentration tested (1-10 ng/ml) without increasing rescue from apoptosis, indicating that proliferation was directly affected by these cytokine combinations. With regards to cytokine secretion, IL-2 together with IL-12 initiated tumour necrosis factor-alpha synthesis, enhanced IFN-gamma production, and shedding of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha as expected. Importantly, combining IL-4 with IL-12 also enhanced IFN-gamma secretion in lymphoblasts and a Th1 cell line. Investigating signal transduction in lymphoblasts induced by these cytokines, we found that not only IL-2 but also IL-4 enhances signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) tyrosine phosphorylation by IL-12. Tyrosine phosphorylations of janus kinase 2 (JAK-2), tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and STAT4, STAT5 and STAT6 were not potentiated by combinations of these cytokines, suggesting specificity for increased STAT3 phosphorylation. In conclusion, two otherwise antagonizing cytokines co-operate in activated human lymphoblasts and Th1 cells, possibly via STAT3 as a converging signal. These data demonstrate that IL-4 can directly enhance human Th1 cell function independently of its known actions on antigen-presenting cells. These findings should be of importance for the design of cytokine-targeted therapies of human Th-cell-driven diseases.
