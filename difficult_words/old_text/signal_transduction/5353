Although bladder cancer represents a serious health problem worldwide, relevant mouse models for investigating disease progression or therapeutic targets have been lacking. We show that combined deletion of p53 and Pten in bladder epithelium leads to invasive cancer in a novel mouse model. Inactivation of p53 and PTEN promotes tumorigenesis in human bladder cells and is correlated with poor survival in human tumors. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of p53 and Pten deletion are mediated by deregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, consistent with the ability of rapamycin to block bladder tumorigenesis in preclinical studies. Our integrated analyses of mouse and human bladder cancer provide a rationale for investigating mTOR inhibition for treatment of patients with invasive disease.
