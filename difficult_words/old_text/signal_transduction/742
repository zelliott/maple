To explore the role of nitric oxide (NO)--NF-kappaB signaling pathway in the differentiation of human naive T lymphocytes into Th1/Th2 cells.

Human naive T lymphocytes were isolated from umbilical blood. Various concentrations of NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), NO inhibitor NAME and NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC were added to the culture medium to induce the differentiation of naive T cells towards Th1/Th2 cells. The expressions of intracellular cytokine IFN-gamma and IL-4 were detected by flow cytometry.

The treatment of SNP, NAME and PDTC made no difference on the percentage of cells expressing IFN-gamma (Th1) or IL-4 (Th2) in comparison with that of the control group (P < 0.05).

Signaling pathway of NO--NF-kappaB had no effect on differentiation of human naive T lymphocytes into Th1 and Th2 cells. The role of NO--NF-kappaB signaling pathway in the regulation of types 1 and 2 cytokines may occur mainly at the level of mature Th cells.
