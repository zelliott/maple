The development of GluR5-selective kainate receptor ligands is helping to elucidate the functions of kainate receptors in the CNS. Here we have further characterised the actions of a GluR5 selective agonist, ATPA, and a GluR5 selective antagonist, LY382884, in the CA3 region of rat hippocampal slices. In addition, we have used LY382884 to study a novel synaptic mechanism. This antagonist substantially reduces frequency facilitation of mossy fibre synaptic transmission, monitored as either AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs. This suggests that GluR5-containing kainate receptors on mossy fibres function as autoreceptors to facilitate the synaptic release of L-glutamate, in a frequency-dependent manner.
