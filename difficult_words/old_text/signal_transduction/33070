These studies sought to determine the intracellular mechanisms underlying muscarinic receptor stimulated phasic contractions of myometrial smooth muscle. Utilizing cytosolic calcium imaging studies with Fura-2 loaded muscle strips, along with in vitro isometric contraction studies, we have demonstrated that phasic myometrial contractions stimulated in response to (+)cis-dioxolane, a muscarinic selective acetylcholine agonist, are mediated by activation of the M3 receptor subtype resulting in stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway and the generation of cytosolic calcium oscillations.
