Multicellular organisms arise from the generation of different cell types and the organization of cells into tissues and organs. Cells of metazoa display two main phenotypes, the ancestral epithelial state and the recent mesenchymal derivative. Epithelial cells are usually stationary and reside in two-dimensional sheets. By contrast mesenchymal cells are loosely packed and can move to new positions, thereby providing a vehicle for cell rearrangement, dispersal and novel cell-cell interactions. Transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal states drive key morphogenetic events in the early vertebrate embryo, including gastrulation, germ layer formation and somitogenesis. The cell behaviors and molecular mechanisms promoting transitions between these two states in the early mouse embryo are discussed in this review.
