To observe the effects of curcumin on expression of PDGF-BB, PDGFRbeta and ERK1 of rat Hepatic stellate cell (HSC-T6).

The cultured HSC were divided into control group, each curcumin treating group. The influence of curcumin on HSC proliferation was detected by MTT assay. The protein levels of PDGF-BB, PDGFRbeta and ERK1 was detected by immunhistochemical examination; The influence of curcumin on expression of PDGF-BB, PDGFRbeta and ERK1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR.

Immunohistiochemical results showed that normal cultured HSC-T6 cell expressed PDGF-BB, PDGFRbeta and ERK1 remarkably. After the intervention of different concentration of curcumin,the masculine degrees of PDGF-BB, PDGFRbeta and ERK1 and the masculine cell population decreased obviously. The RT-PCR results indicated that the expressions of PDGF-BB, PDGFRbeta and ERK1 mRNA could be obviously seen in control and TGF-beta1 stimulus group. After the intervention of different concentration of curcumin, the expression of PDGF-BB, PDGFRbeta and ERK1 mRNA decreased in a dose-dependent manner.

Curcumin could inhibit the expression of PDGF-BB, PDGFRbeta and ERK1 which might be the mechanism of action curcumin on anti-fibrosis.
