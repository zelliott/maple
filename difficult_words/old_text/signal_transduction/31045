Most viral vectors used for gene therapy lack the ability to target a defined cell population. Parvovirus B19 has a restricted tropism for human erythroid progenitor cells and uses activated alpha5beta1 integrins as coreceptors for entry [Weigel-Kelley, K.A., Yoder, M.C., and Srivastava, A. (2003). Blood 102, 3927-3933]. In this study we examined the role of coexpressed integrins in alpha5beta1 integrin coreceptor function. Antibody-mediated cross-linking of beta1, beta2, and beta3 integrins and the integrin-associated protein (IAP) increased parvovirus B19 entry into nontarget K562 cells. Functional silencing of one integrin group, however, reduced the virus uptake- promoting function of a subsequently activated integrin group, indicating that the three integrins did not operate in isolation but through shared signaling pathways. This was further corroborated by direct competition between simultaneously clustered beta2 and beta1 integrins that could be overcome by stabilizing clustered beta1 integrins in a high-affinity conformation. In contrast, parvovirus B19 entry into primary erythroid progenitor cells was characterized by strong clustering-induced beta1 integrin coreceptor activity that was not abolished by subsequent beta2 and beta3 integrin activation and was, in fact, substantially increased in the presence of preclustered beta2 and beta3 integrins. Thus, integrin function is regulated in a cell type-specific manner through coexpressed integrins and preferential parvovirus B19 entry into erythroid progenitor cells is promoted by a robust beta1 integrin response that is enhanced through stable preclustering of coexpressed integrins. These results have implications for other viral vectors that use integrins as receptors/coreceptors and for gene therapy of hematopoietic progenitor cells using parvovirus B19 vectors.
