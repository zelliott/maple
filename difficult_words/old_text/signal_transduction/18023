The interferons (IFNs) are a group of cytokines, which in addition to their antiviral activity are capable of modulating a variety of cellular responses. One such prominent effect of IFNs is their potent antimitogenic action, which can be observed both on malignant and non-malignant cells of many different origins. IFNs are also used in the clinic, mainly in malignant and viral diseases, and their cell growth -inhibitory effect has been suggested to be of major importance in their antitumour and antiviral action. The aim of the present review is to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which IFNs modulate cell cycle progression in various cell types. With the recent progress in our understanding of how the cell cycle is regulated at the molecular level, it has become possible to delineate intracellular effectors of IFN in this respect. Understanding the antiproliferative effects of IFN may not only help in understanding its antineoplastic and antiviral activities, but may also provide an insight into cell cycle regulation in general and aid in making IFNs a more useful tool in treating disease.
