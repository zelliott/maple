The Insulin Receptor/PI 3-kinase (INSR/PI3K) signalling pathway is a key regulator of cell and organismal metabolism. Phosphoinositides generated by PI 3-kinases following insulin and other metabolic hormone receptor activation give rise to signalling cascades involving a multitude of effector molecules. The physiological roles of these molecules have been dissected with the use of both pharmacological and genetic tools. Furthermore, tissue-specific mutagenesis has revealed the extent to which individual insulin-target organs and signalling molecules contribute to whole-body carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis. These studies have generated important information with respect to the function of these molecules in normal physiology and their implication in the development of metabolic diseases such as type-2 diabetes and obesity.
