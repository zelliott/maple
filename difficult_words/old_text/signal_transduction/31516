The close apposition of osteoblasts and chondrocytes in bone and their interaction during bone development and regeneration suggest that they may each regulate the other's growth and differentiation. In these studies, osteoblasts and chondrocytes were co-cultured in vitro, with both direct and indirect contact. Proliferation of the co-cultured chondrocytes was enhanced using soluble factors produced from the osteoblasts, and the differentiation level of the osteoblasts influenced the differentiation level of the chondrocytes. In addition, the chondrocytes regulated differentiation of the co-cultured osteoblasts using soluble factors and direct contact. These data support the possibility of direct, reciprocal instructive interactions between chondrocytes and osteoblasts in a variety of normal processes and further suggest that it may be necessary to account for this signaling in the regeneration of complex tissues comprising cartilage and mineralized tissue.
