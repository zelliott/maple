The neuromodulatory peptide somatostatin-14 (SRIF) plays an important inhibitory role in epilepsy, but little is known on the signalling mechanisms coupled to this effect of SRIF. We have previously demonstrated that SRIF induces reduction of epileptiform bursting in a model of interictal-like activity in mouse hippocampal slices. In this same model, we investigated whether the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) pathway is part of those signalling mechanisms mediating SRIF anti-epileptic actions. Both the expression of COX-2 (mRNA and protein) and the endogenous release of PGE(2) increased in concomitance with epileptiform bursting. In particular, COX-2 protein increased in CA1/CA3 pyramidal layer and in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus. In addition, the selective inhibition of COX-2 by NS-398 markedly decreased endogenous PGE(2) release induced by epileptiform bursting and the epileptiform bursting itself. Similar effects on epileptiform bursting were obtained with another COX-2 inhibitor, i.e., meloxicam. SRIF application counteracted the increase of both COX-2 expression and PGE(2) release which occurred in concomitance with epileptiform bursting. Interestingly, SRIF and NS-398 comparably reduced epileptiform bursting in a non-additive manner and PGE(2) abolished the inhibitory effect of SRIF on epileptiform bursting. These results demonstrate that: i) the COX-2/PGE(2) pathway facilitates epileptiform bursting; and ii) SRIF exerts an anti-epileptic role by coupling to the COX-2/PGE(2) pathway. In conclusion, we have identified a key set of signalling events that underlie anti-convulsant effects of SRIF in a mouse model of hippocampal bursting, thus providing useful data not only to identify alternative intervention points for the modulation of SRIF function, but also to exploit new chemical space for drug-like molecules.
