Our previous study revealed that plasma visfatin levels were lower in pregnant women with gestational diabetes (GDM) than non-GDM independent of prepreganacy BMI. We examined whether central visfatin modulates energy and glucose homeostasis via altering insulin resistance, insulin secretion or islet morphometry in diabetic rats.

Partial pancreatectomized, type 2 diabetic, rats were interacerbroventricularly infused with visfatin (100ng/rat/day, Px-VIS), visfatin+visfatin antagonist, CHS-828 (100μg/rat/day, Px-VIS-ANT), or saline (control, Px-Saline) via osmotic pump, respectively, for 4weeks.

Central visfatin improved insulin signaling (pAkt→pFOXO-1) but not pSTAT3 in the hypothalamus. Central visfatin did not alter serum visfatin levels in diabetic rats whereas the levels were higher in non-diabetic rats than diabetic rats. Body weight at the 2nd week was lowered in the Px-VIS group due to decreased food intake in the first two weeks compared to the Px-Saline group and energy expenditure was not significantly different among the treatment groups of diabetic rats. Visfatin antagonist treatment nullified the central visfatin effect. Px-VIS increased whole body glucose disposal rates in euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp compared to Px-Saline and lowered hepatic glucose output, whereas Px-VIS-ANT blocked the visfatin effect on insulin resistance (P<0.05). In hyperglycemic clamp study, the area under the curve of insulin in first and second phase were significantly higher in the Px-VIS group than the Px-Saline group without modifying insulin sensitivity at the hyperglycemic state, whereas the increase in serum insulin levels was blocked in the Px-VIS-ANT group. Central visfatin also increased β-cell mass by increasing β-cell proliferation.

Central visfatin improved glucose homeostasis by increasing insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity at euglycemia through the hypothalamus in diabetic rats. Therefore, visfatin is a positive modulator of glucose homeostasis by delivering the hypothalamic signals into the peripheries.
