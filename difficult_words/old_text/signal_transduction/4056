We have studied signaling mechanisms that stimulate exocytosis and luteinizing hormone secretion in isolated male rat pituitary gonadotropes. As judged by reverse hemolytic plaque assays, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) stimulates as many gonadotropes to secrete as does gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). However, PMA and GnRH use different signaling pathways. The secretagogue action of GnRH is not very sensitive to bisindolylmaleimide I, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, but is blocked by loading cells with a calcium chelator, 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. The secretagogue action of PMA is blocked by bisindolylmaleimide I and is not very sensitive to the intracellular calcium chelator. GnRH induces intracellular calcium elevations, whereas PMA does not. As judged by amperometric measurements of quantal catecholamine secretion from dopamine- or serotonin-loaded gonadotropes, the secretagogue action of PMA develops more slowly (in several minutes) than that of GnRH. We conclude that exocytosis of secretory vesicles can be stimulated independently either by calcium elevations or by activation of protein kinase C.
