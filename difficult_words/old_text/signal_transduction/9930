Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) inhibits type I interferon-induced gene expression by decreasing expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)2. To identify the RSV protein that mediates effects on Stat2, airway epithelial cells were infected with vaccinia virus vectors that express single RSV proteins. Expression of RSV nonstructural (NS)2 protein alone was sufficient to decrease Stat2 levels. Furthermore, decreasing RSV NS2 levels using RNA interference in respiratory epithelial cells inhibited the RSV-mediated decrease in Stat2 expression. Airway epithelial cells were also infected with equivalent inoculums of RSV without or with single gene deletions of NS1 or NS2. RSV infection without NS2 expression did not result in decreased Stat2 levels or loss of type I interferon-dependent signaling, indicating that NS2 expression is necessary for RSV effects on Stat2. Taken together, our results indicate that NS2 regulates Stat2 levels during RSV infection, thereby modulating viral effects on interferon-dependent gene expression.
