Our understanding of the effects of aldosterone and its mechanisms has increased substantially in recent years, probably because of the importance of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists in several major cardiovascular diseases. Recent clinical studies have confirmed the benefits of MR antagonists in patients with heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, hypertension or diabetic nephropathy. However, it would be a gross oversimplification to conclude that the role of aldosterone is unequivocally negative. Aldosterone is synthesized in the adrenal glands and binds to specific MRs in target epithelial cells. The steroid-receptor complex penetrates the cell nucleus where it modulates gene expression and activates specific aldosterone-induced proteins that control sodium reabsorption. Recent studies have shown that aldosterone also impacts a wide range of non-epithelial tissues such as the heart and blood vessels. Remarkably, aldosterone can also be synthesized in extra-adrenal tissues and it may act in a rapid non-genomic manner.We note the existence of glucocorticoids that exhibit plasma concentrations much higher than those of aldosterone and that are structurally very similar to aldosterone. It is thus possible that glucocorticoids may bind to the aldosterone receptor in some cell types. Diverse experimental models and several strains of transgenic mice have allowed us to better understand the effects of aldosterone on the heart. Specifically, it seems that a slight increase in cardiac aldosterone concentrations induces a decreased coronary reserve in mice by decreasing the BKCa potassium channels associated with coronary smooth muscle cells. Taken together, these experiments indicate that vascular cells are the primary targets of aldosterone in the cardiovascular system. The hormone directly affects NO and EDHF-mediated coronary relaxation. Both mechanisms may contribute to the deleterious cardiovascular effects of MR stimulation.
