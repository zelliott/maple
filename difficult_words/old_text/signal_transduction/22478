Congenital heart diseases associated with increased pulmonary blood flow commonly leads to the development of pulmonary hypertension. However, most patients who undergo histological evaluation have advanced pulmonary hypertension, and therefore it has been difficult to investigate aberrations in signaling cascades that precede the development of overt vascular remodeling. This review discusses the role played by both oxidative and nitrosative stress in the lung and their impact on the signaling pathways that regulate vasodilation, vessel growth, and vascular remodeling in the neonatal lung exposed to increased pulmonary blood flow.
