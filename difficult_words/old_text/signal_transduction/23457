Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) is a relatively minor component of sunlight, but can induce stress-related physiological processes or UV-B-specific photomorphogenic responses in plants. In the last decade, significant progress has been made in understanding the UV-B photomorphogenic pathway, including identification of the key components in the pathway, molecular characterization of UV-B photoreceptor and perception mechanism, and elucidation of the signal transduction mechanisms from the photoactivated UV-B receptor to downstream gene expression. This review summarizes the key players identified to date in the UV-B photomorphogenic pathway and their roles in mediating UV-B signal transduction.
