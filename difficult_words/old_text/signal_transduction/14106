The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is a key pathway in the progression of different cancers and in the homeostasis of stem cells. Here, we investigated the link between mTOR signaling and cancer stem cells (CSCs) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We found that human primary NPC expressed embryonic stem cell (ESC) markers: CD133, SOX2 and OCT4 as well as pmTOR and pS6. Primary ESC-positive NPC cells could form secondary NPC in BALB/c nude mice. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, significantly suppressed ESC-positive NPC cell growth in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Our findings suggest that mTOR signaling is activated in CSC-like cells and plays an important role in NPC growth.
