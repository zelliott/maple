Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) regulates signal transduction by modulating the balance between the two signaling lipids, diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. DGK and its homologs occur in a wide range of multicellular organisms and the mammalian DGK is known to consist of nine members with a considerable incidence of alternative splicing. Recent work has established that DGK serves as a key attenuator of diacylglycerol of signaling functions and that the mammalian isozymes are equipped with molecular machineries which enable them to act in specific intracellular sites and/or in signaling protein complexes.
