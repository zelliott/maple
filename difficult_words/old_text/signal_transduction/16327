Astragali radix is a traditional Chinese medicine that has long been used for treatment of diabetes and diabetes-associated disease, but its active component and mechanism on the disease is not well defined.

Infiltration of leukocytes within the glomeruli and vasculature is one of the early and characteristic features of diabetic nephropathy. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) play pivotal role in the progression of diabetic-associated diseases. The present study was designed to explore the therapeutic effect of calycosin, an active component from A. radix, on AGEs-induced macrophages infiltration in HUVECs.

Transwell HUVEC-macrophage co-culture system was established to evaluate macrophage migration and adhesion. Immunocytochemistry was applied to examine TGF-beta1, ICAM-1 and RAGE protein expressions; real-time PCR was carried out to determine mRNA expression of TGF-beta1, ICAM-1 and RAGE. Immunofluorescence was carried out to observe estrogen receptor-alpha, ICAM-1, RAGE expression and the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 and NF-κB.

Calycosin significantly reduced AGEs-induced macrophage migration and adhesion to HUVEC. Pre-treatment with calycosin strikingly down-regulated HUVEC TGF-beta1, ICAM-1 and RAGE expressions in both protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, calycosin incubation significantly increased estrogen receptor expression and reversed AGEs-induced ERK1/2 and NF-κB phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in HUVEC, and this effect of calycosin could be inhibited by estrogen receptor inhibitor, ICI182780.

These findings suggest that calycosin can reduce AGEs-induced macrophage migration and adhesion to endothelial cells and relieve the local inflammation; furthermore, this effect was via estrogen receptor-ERK1/2-NF-κB pathway.
