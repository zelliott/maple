Metabolic networks have been an interesting starting point not only for the design of synthetic routes in a similar sequence of reactions, e.g., in biomimetic syntheses, but also for assembling a number of biocatalytic steps by preparing the required enzymes and auxiliary reagents. Retrosynthetic analysis involving multiple biocatalytic reactions steps therefore needs to consider the practically realized biocatalytic single steps. The opportunities for route selection are enlarged if novel synthetic reactions connecting easily available starting materials and products are found, and/or both biocatalytic and classical reactions of organic chemistry are utilized. Tools and ingredients for biocatalytic synthesis are of special interest for reactions difficult to achieve by classical organic synthesis. Densely and differentially functionalized small molecules do not allow much space for protecting or activating groups. Biocatalytic reactions have therefore performed well for a number of useful metabolites in enantiopure form to achieve full functionality. Although many well-known metabolites from classical biochemistry have only been prepared in racemic form, it is of fundamental interest to have these available in enantiomerically pure form. Biocatalytic reactions with nature's privileged chiral catalysts appear to be a promising synthetic strategy towards these metabolites, especially when sensitive or stable-isotope-labeled metabolites are to be prepared. The main applications for these metabolites are as references materials in metabolomics, as enzyme substrates for the characterization of metabolic enzyme activities and as potential pharmaceuticals in biomedical research. The use of stable-isotope-labeled metabolites can thereby simplify in vivo applications and metabolic flux analyses.
