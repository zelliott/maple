BMP-4 is an extracellular signalling molecule belonging to the TGF-beta superfamily that plays a central role in dorsoventral patterning in vertebrate gastrulae. We review the evidence indicating that BMP-4 acts as a morphogen, specifying dorsoventral positional values in a concentration-dependent manner. An activity gradient of BMP-4 is established not by simple diffusion from a localised source, but by diffusion of inhibitory binding proteins that act on a uniform level of BMP-4 protein. These in turn are regulated by the activity of tolloid-related metalloproteases, such as Xenopus xolloid and zebrafish tolloid.
