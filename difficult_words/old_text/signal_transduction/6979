Cardiovascular complications are common in patients with type 2 diabetes. Adipokines have been implicated in the induction of proliferative and pro-atherogenic alterations in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMC). Other reports demonstrated the importance of the miRNA cluster miR-143/145 in the regulation of VSMC homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Here we investigated whether the detrimental effects of adipokines on hVSMC function could be ascribed to alterations in miR-143/145 expression. The exposure of hVSMC to conditioned media (CM) from primary human subcutaneous adipocytes increased the expression of smooth muscle Î±-actin (SMA), and the miR-143/145 cluster, but markedly impaired the insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt and its substrate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Furthermore, CM promoted the phosphorylation of SMAD2 and p38, which have both been linked to miR-143/145 induction. Accordingly, the induction of miR-143/145 as well as the inhibition of insulin-mediated Akt- and eNOS-phosphorylation was prevented when hVSMC were treated with pharmacological inhibitors for Alk-4/5/7 and p38 before the addition of CM. The transfection of hVSMC with precursor miR-143, but not with precursor miR-145, resulted in impaired insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. This inhibition of insulin signaling by CM and miR-143 is associated with a reduction in the expression of the oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 8 (ORP8). Finally, the knock-down of ORP8 resulted in impaired insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt in hVSMC. Thus, the detrimental effects of adipocyte-derived conditioned media on insulin action in primary hVSMC can be ascribed to the Alk- and p38-dependent induction of miR-143 and subsequent downregulation of ORP8.
