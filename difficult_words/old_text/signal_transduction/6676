The characterisation and purification of the ethylene binding protein from developing cotyledons of Phaseolus vulgaris is described. Polyclonal antibodies to this protein recognise homologous proteins in peas, tomatoes and Arabidopsis. Direct binding assays and results from immunological studies indicate that more binding protein is present in abscission zones of Phaseolus than in petioles; ethylene treatment increases binding site abundance in abscission zones. Binding sites for ethylene in peas. Arabidopsis and rice are described indicating that there exist two classes differing only in their rate constants of association and dissociation. Arabidopsis mutants wholly insensitive to ethylene may be receptor deficient and their possible use in receptor studies is assessed. It is proposed that those binding sites with high rate constants of association are functional receptors. The sites with low rate constants of association may be receptors but may also represent receptor precursors or internalised receptors.
