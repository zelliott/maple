Mastoparan, a widely used tetradecapeptide activator of Gi/Go G proteins, has been reported to be a potent co-mitogen for Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. However, we have previously shown that the peptide promotes the release of lactate dehydrogenase from Swiss 3T3 cells and evokes only a modest and delayed increase in DNA. We suggested that the ability of the peptide to permeabilise these cells may account for its mitogenic action. Here we show that mastoparan caused a rapid release of fluorescein from cells which had been pre-incubated with fluorescein diacetate, indicating that the peptide increases membrane permeability to small molecules. Furthermore, the release of lactate dehydrogenase evoked by mastoparan was lost after prolonged (24 h) incubation of cells with the peptide. Together, these data indicate that mastoparan-induced cell permeabilisation is both rapid and transient. We have also shown that mastoparan increased c-fos mRNA accumulation and that this response was not influenced by pertussis toxin or indomethacin. Although mastoparan increased the intracellular calcium concentration, the removal of extracellular calcium had no effect on mastoparan stimulated c-fos mRNA accumulation. These data show that mastoparan-induced c-fos mRNA accumulation is not mediated by activation of a G protein and subsequent activation of phospholipase D nor by a non-selective increase in calcium influx. The data have significance for the interpretation of studies in which mastoparan is, or has been, used as an activator of Gi/Go.
