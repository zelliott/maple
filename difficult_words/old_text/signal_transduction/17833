PGs produced from arachidonic acid by the action of cyclooxygenase enzymes play a pivotal role in the regulation of both inflammatory and immune responses. Because leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a product of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway, can exert numerous immunoregulatory and proinflammatory activities, we examined the effects of PGs on LTB4 release from dendritic cells (DC) and from peritoneal macrophages. In concentration-dependent manner, PGE1 and PGE2 inhibited the production of LTB4 from DC, but not from peritoneal macrophage, with an IC50 of 0.04 microM. The same effect was observed with MK-886, a 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP)-specific inhibitor. The decreased release of LTB4 was associated with an enhanced level of IL-10. Furthermore, the inhibition of LTB4 synthesis by PGs was significantly reversed by anti-IL-10, suggesting the involvement of an IL-10-dependent mechanism. Hence, we examined the effects of exogenous IL-10 on the 5-LO pathway. We demonstrate that IL-10 suppresses the production of LTB4 from DC by inhibiting FLAP protein expression without any effect on 5-LO and cytosolic phospholipase A2. Taken together, our results suggest links between DC cyclooxygenase and 5-LO pathways during the inflammatory response, and FLAP is a key target for the PG-induced IL-10-suppressive effects.
