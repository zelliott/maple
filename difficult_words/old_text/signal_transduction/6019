Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare but particularly aggressive form of primary breast cancer. The molecular mechanisms responsible for IBC are largely unknown.

To obtain further insight into the molecular pathogenesis of IBC, we used real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to quantify the mRNA expression of 538 selected genes in IBC relative to non-IBC.

Twenty-seven (5.0%) of the 538 genes were significantly up-regulated in IBC compared with non-IBC. None were down-regulated. The 27 up-regulated genes mainly encoded transcription factors (JUN, EGR1, JUNB, FOS, FOSB, MYCN, and SNAIL1), growth factors (VEGF, DTR/HB-EGF, IGFBP7, IL6, ANGPT2, EREG, CCL3/MIP1A, and CCL5/RANTES) and growth factor receptors (TBXA2R, TNFRSF10A/TRAILR1, and ROBO2). We also identified a gene expression profile, based on MYCN, EREG, and SHH, which discriminated subgroups of IBC patients with good, intermediate, and poor outcome.

Our study has identified a limited number of signaling pathways that require inappropriate activation for IBC development. Some of the up-regulated genes identified here could offer useful diagnostic or prognostic markers and could form the basis of novel therapeutic strategies.
