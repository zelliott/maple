Diabetes mellitus is a complex disorder that arises from various causes, including dysregulated glucose sensing and impaired insulin secretion (maturity onset diabetes of youth, MODY), autoimmune-mediated beta-cell destruction (type 1), or insufficient compensation for peripheral insulin resistance (type 2). Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent form that usually occurs at middle age; it afflicts more than 30 million people over the age of 65, but is appearing with greater frequency in children and adolescents. Dysregulated insulin signaling exacerbated by chronic hyperglycemia promotes a cohort of systemic disorders--including dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and female infertility. Understanding the molecular basis of insulin resistance can prevent these disorders and their inevitable progression to type 2 diabetes.
