Changes in dopaminergic function can be regulated by receptor-receptor interaction, or interaction with other proteins with dopamine receptors, and/or elements of the downstream signaling cascades. The complexity of dopaminergic signaling is far from being completely elucidated. It could, however, hold the key to the comprehension of the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as to the identification of putative new targets for, and development of, more efficacious and selective drugs. Here, we review some of the current evidence and new ideas that are being proposed as a result, as well as future perspectives that are now being recognized.
