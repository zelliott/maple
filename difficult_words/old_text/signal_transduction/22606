Interleukin-4 (IL-4) triggers cellular responses by interaction with the bipartite interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R). IL-4-responsive cells specifically endocytose IL-4. We studied the ligand internalization properties of the human IL-4R and analyzed the specific functions of its two subunits IL-4Ralpha and gammac in this process. IL-4 mutant RY, which binds to IL-4Ralpha but does not recruit gammac into the receptor complex was used as a tool to show that IL-4Ralpha can promote independent ligand uptake in human T cells. Internalization was limited, however, by rapid IL-4 dissociation, suggesting that one important function of gammac in IL-4 endocytosis is to retain the ligand sufficiently long within the ternary receptor complex. We then measured IL-4 internalization by murine Ba/F3 cells that were stably transfected with various human IL-4R constructs. Efficient IL-4 uptake required the cytoplasmic section of the receptor. The intracellular domains of IL-4Ralpha and gammac were responsible for independent endocytosis processes with distinct kinetics. IL-4Ralpha-mediated internalization resulted in long-term intracellular maintainance of IL-4, whereas gammac directed the associated radioligand to intracellular breakdown and rapid release in the form of degraded protein. Mutants of either IL-4R subunit deficient in Janus kinase activation were not impaired in internalization, indicating that IL-4 endocytosis is not functionally connected to signal transduction.
