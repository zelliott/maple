To study the effects of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on the proliferation and the migration force of human breast cancer SKBR-3 cell and the expression of Notch1.

SKBR-3 cells were cultured with different concentrations of As2O3 for 24 h and with the final concentration of 8 micromol/L for 24, 48, and 72 h. The effects of As2O3 on the cell proliferation of SKBR-3 were detected by MTT assay. The effects of the migration force of SKBR-3 cells were detected by Transwell. The expression of Notch1 mRNA was detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of Notch1 protein was detected using Western blot.

As2O3 could significantly inhibit the proliferation of SKBR-3 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (P < 0.05). It also could inhibit the migration force of SKBR-3 cells (P < 0.05). Results of RT-PCR and Western blot showed that Notch1 mRNA and protein levels obviously decreased (P < 0.05).

As2O3 could inhibit the expression of Notch1 and the cell proliferation and the migration force of SKBR-3 cells, which primarily revealed that As2O3 might affect the biological behavior of human breast cancer cells possibly through Notch1 signaling pathway, thus providing theoretical and experimental bases for treating breast cancer by arsenic.
