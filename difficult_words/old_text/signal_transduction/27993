Inflammatory events in the central nervous system (CNS) contribute to the disease process in a variety of neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and cerebral ischemia, and activated macrophages/microglia are central to this response. Immunological activation of these cells leads to the production of a wide array of cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases and neurotoxins, and ultimately to glial/neuronal injury and death. The CD40 molecule has an important role in promoting inflammatory responses by macrophages/microglia, since interaction with its cognate ligand, CD154, leads to secretion of cytokines and neurotoxins. Aberrant CD40 expression by macrophages/microglia, induced by cytokines such as IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, contributes to neuroimmunologic cascades in the CNS. Strategies to suppress CD40 expression may attenuate inflammation and neuronal damage within the CNS, which will ultimately be of benefit in neuroinflammatory diseases. The mediators that regulate expression of CD40 in macrophages/microglia (both induction and inhibition) function at the level of gene transcription. In this review, we present an overview of the molecular basis of CD40 expression in macrophages/microglia. The signal transduction pathways and transcription factors employed by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha to induce CD40 expression are described, as are the cis-elements in the CD40 promoter that are critical for CD40 transcription. Information is provided on the mechanism(s) underlying suppression of CD40 in macrophages/microglia by immunomodulatory agents such as IL-4, TGF-beta, neuropeptides, neurotrophins, and statins. A comprehensive assessment of CD40 production and function in macrophages/microglia will establish the foundation for future therapeutic manipulation of this critical immunoregulatory protein.
