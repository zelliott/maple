We compared human endothelial cell (EC) responses to interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) and oncostatin M (OnM), cytokines that utilize Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. Both cytokines cause phosphorylation of Tyr residue 701 and Ser residue 727 of STAT1, as shown by immunoblotting. Both activate DNA binding of STAT1 homodimers, shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. However, only IFN gamma increases expression of three STAT1-dependent gene products examined, namely transporter associated with antigen processing-1 (TAP1), interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1), and class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein, as demonstrated by immunoblotting. Only IFN gamma increases TAP1 transcription assessed by reporter gene assay. OnM pretreatment or co-treatment does not inhibit IFN gamma responses. Interestingly, IFN gamma activation of STAT1 is considerably more long-lived than that produced by OnM. To determine whether duration is functionally significant, we transduced EC with a chimeric receptor containing extracellular domains of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta and intracellular regions of gp130, the signaling subunit of the OnM receptor, mutated to prevent binding of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. Addition of platelet-derived growth factor to such transduced cells produces STAT1 activation that is comparable in magnitude and duration to that caused by IFN gamma, but still fails to induce TAP1, IRF1, or class I MHC molecules. OnM also activates STAT1 but not transcription of STAT1-dependent genes in HepG2 cells. Transient transfection of HepG2 cells with a STAT-defective mouse IFN gamma receptor failed to complement the OnM STAT signal. We conclude that STAT1 activation is necessary but not sufficient for induction of transcription of IFN gamma-responsive genes. However, signals provided by IFN gamma other than STAT1 activation cannot be provided in trans to complement the response to OnM.
