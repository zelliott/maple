It has recently been demonstrated that the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) PTP1B and the T-cell PTP (TC-PTP) target several substrates involved in immune cell signaling. Recent data have furthered the view of these 2 PTP members as key regulators of the immune response. This review will focus on the substrate specificities of PTP1B and TC-PTP and their roles in immune cell signaling, and will discuss some new data implicating PTP1B and TC-PTP in myeloid development.
