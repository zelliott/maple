It is now generally accepted that protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation has a role in the regulation of essentially all cellular functions. Thus, it is of interest that this process is involved in signal transduction. Nonetheless, the extent to which protein phosphorylation participates in signaling is truly remarkable. Almost every known signaling pathway eventually impinges on a protein kinase, or in some instances, a protein phosphatase. The diversity of these enzymes is noteworthy, and it is of interest that many biotechnology companies are eyeing them as potentially important targets for drugs. Such drugs may have important therapeutic applications, and in any event, they certainly will be useful to investigators who study signal transduction. Indeed, this already has been proven to be true.
