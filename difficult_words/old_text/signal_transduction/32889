The fibronectin fibril matrix on the blastocoel roof of the Xenopus gastrula contains guidance cues that determine the direction of mesoderm cell migration. The underlying guidance-related polarity of the blastocoel roof is established in the late blastula under the influence of an instructive signal from the vegetal half of the embryo, in particular from the mesoderm. Formation of an oriented substratum depends on functional activin and FGF signaling pathways in the blastocoel roof. Besides being involved in tissue polarization, activin and FGF also affect fibronectin matrix assembly. Activin treatment of the blastocoel roof inhibits fibril formation, whereas FGF modulates the structure of the fibril network. The presence of intact fibronectin fibrils is permissive for directional mesoderm migration on the blastocoel roof extracellular matrix.
