We undertook an extensive antigenic characterization of the SCN 2.2 cell line in order to further evaluate whether the line expresses components of circadian regulatory pathways common to the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian clock in mammals. We found that differentiated SCN 2.2 cultures expressed a broad range of putative clock genes, as well as components of daytime, nighttime, and crepuscular circadian regulatory pathways found within the SCN in vivo. The line also exhibits several antigens that are highly expressed in a circadian pattern and/or differentially localized in the SCN relative to other hypothalamic regions. Expression of a broad complement of circadian regulatory proteins and putative clock genes further support growing evidence in recent reports that the SCN 2.2 cell line is an appropriate model for investigating the regulation of central mammalian pacemaker.
