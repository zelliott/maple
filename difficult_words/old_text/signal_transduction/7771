In leukemic cells, glucose transport is activated by SCF and H2O2 through a common signal cascade involving Akt, PLCgamma, Syk, and the Src family, in this order. An explanation can be provided by the phosphorylation of c-kit, the SCF receptor, elicited by either SCF or H2O2. Moreover, antioxidants prevent the SCF effect on glucose transport, confirming the involvement of H2O2 in the pathway leading to glucose-transport activation and suggesting a potential role for reactive oxygen species in leukemia proliferation.
