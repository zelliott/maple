The carotid body is essential to detecting levels of oxygen in the blood and initiating the compensatory response. Increasing evidence suggests that the purines ATP and adenosine make a key contribution to this signaling by the carotid body. The glomus cells release ATP in response to hypoxia. This released ATP can stimulate P2X receptors on the carotid body to elevate intracellular Ca(2+) and to produce an excitatory response. This released ATP can be dephosphorylated to adenosine by a series of extracellular enzymes, which in turn can stimulate A(1), A(2A) and A(2B) adenosine receptors. Levels of extracellular adenosine can also be altered by membrane transporters. Endogenous adenosine stimulates these receptors to increase the ventilation rate and may modulate the catecholamine release from the carotid sinus nerve. Prolonged hypoxic challenge can alter the expression of purinergic receptors, suggesting a role in the adaptation. This review discusses evidence for a key role of ATP and adenosine in the hypoxic response of the carotid body, and emphasizes areas of new contributions likely to be important in the future.
