Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and its main receptor FGFR1 have been shown to promote hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and proliferation. However, scant information is available on the anti-fibrogenic activity of FGFR1 inhibitors. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a selective FGFR1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor NP603 on HSC proliferation and hepatic fibrosis. We demonstrated that rat primary HSCs secreted significant amounts of FGF-2, and its tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR1 was attenuated by NP603. NP603 inhibited HSC activaton by measuring the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and the production of type I collagen using ELISA. Furthermore, NP603 (25 μM) in vitro strongly suppressed HSC growth induced by FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) and FCS. This effect correlated with the suppression of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activity and its downstream targets cyclin D1 and p21. In addition, PO NP603 (20 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) administration significantly decreased hepatic collagen deposition and α-SMA expression in CCl(4)-treated rats. Collectively, these studies suggest that selective blocking of the FGFR1-mediated pathway could be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis.
