Guided by an understanding of signal transduction in pain-processing systems, high-efficacy 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)1A receptor activation, by means of F-13640, has been discovered as a new molecular mechanism of pain relief in laboratory animals, inducing two neuroadaptive phenomena. Firstly, this activation cooperates with nociceptive stimulation, paradoxically causing analgesia, and secondly, inverse tolerance develops so that the resulting analgesia grows rather than decays. As an apparent result of these novel neuroadaptive mechanisms, F-13640 exerts an analgesic action in rat models of acute, tonic and chronic nociceptive pain that is rivaled only by large doses of high-efficacy mu-opioid receptor agonists. In models of neuropathic allodynia of peripheral or central origin, chronic F-13640 administration causes an analgesia that surpasses that observed with morphine or other agents exemplifying other central nervous system drug mechanisms of pain relief (e.g., ketamine, imipramine and gabapentin). Indeed, F-13640 produces long-lasting, preemptive and, most remarkably, curative-like actions in neuropathic allodynia. Although awaiting proof-of-concept evidence in humans, high-efficacy 5-HT(1A) receptor activation may uniquely challenge the opioids for pain therapy.
