In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, small GTPase Rho1 controls polarized actin distribution and cell wall expansion in response to many different environmental and intracellular stimuli. Its activity is essential for cell survival and adaptation under various stress conditions. A recent study identified the TOR complex 1 (TORC1), a central regulator in cell growth and metabolism, as a direct target of the small GTPase. This novel crosstalk extends the signaling network of Rho1 into many TORC1-dependent processes and sheds light on how yeast cells coordinate polarized spatial expansion with mass increase.
