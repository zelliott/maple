Although the signaling pathway involving polyphosphoinositide (poly-PI) hydrolysis and release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] is an important mechanism for regulation of neuronal calcium homeostasis, the effect of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion on this calcium signaling pathway is not well understood. Because activity of this pathway is dependent on availability of ATP, this study is aimed at examining the poly-PI signaling pathway and high-energy metabolites in a rat stroke model.

Focal cerebral ischemia in rats was induced by temporary occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery and both common carotid arteries. Levels of Ins(1,4,5)P3 were determined by use of the radioreceptor binding assay. Poly-PI turnover in rat cortex was assessed with an in vivo protocol involving intracerebral injection of [3H] inositol and systemic administration of lithium. High-energy metabolites (ATP, ADP, and AMP) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Ischemia induced an increase in poly-PI turnover in the right middle cerebral artery cortex, but reperfusion led to a decline in this signaling activity. However, Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels decreased during ischemia, and these levels were not restored if ischemic insults were longer than 30 minutes. ATP levels decreased to 26% of control during ischemia and recovered to 80% of control during the initial 4 hours of reperfusion; these changes were followed by a second phase of decline.

Results show an important relationship between ischemia-induced depletion of high-energy metabolites and poly-PI signaling activity. However, the uncoupling between Ins(1,4,5)P3 and ATP during reperfusion after severe ischemia suggests that metabolism of Ins(1,4,5)P3 is more stringently regulated than ATP.
