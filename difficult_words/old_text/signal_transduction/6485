Cell survival is maintained by growth factors and critically depends on sufficient energy supply. New evidence suggests that a rise in cellular energy production is not merely a homeostatic response to increased demand but subject to regulation by extrinsic factors. The mechanisms operating in this control are largely enigmatic. Work on transformed cells identified direct targeting of glycolytic enzymes by signaling proteins as one possibility. But mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and biogenesis may also be subject to regulation by growth and survival factors. Both, positive and negative regulators of cell survival impinge on the processes of cellular energy production to regulate growth and survival versus death.
