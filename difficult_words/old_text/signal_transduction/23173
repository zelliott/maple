Formation of non-native disulfide bonds within or between proteins can lead to protein misfolding and disruption to cellular metabolism. Such a process is defined as disulfide stress. A marked effect of disulfide stress in cells is the elevated accumulation of the intracellular aluminium ion (Al(3+)) accompanied by increased cytotoxicity. To gain an in-depth understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism for disulfide stress-induced aluminium toxicity, the complete set of Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion mutants (5047) was screened in this study simultaneously with a combination of the two stressors, diamide and Al(3+). The combined treatment of a benign concentration of diamide (0.8 mM) with a sublethal concentration of aluminium sulfate (0.4 mM) revealed 494 sensitive deletion mutants, distinct from those found when either of the single stressors (0.8 mM diamide or 0.4 mM aluminium sulfate) was used. Hierarchical clustering and functional analyses of the 494 mutants sensitive to the dual stressors indicated a significant enrichment in the genes involved in cell wall homeostasis, signaling cascades, secretory transport machinery and detoxification. The results highlight the process of maintaining cell wall integrity as the central response to the combined exposure of diamide and Al(3+), which is mediated by the signaling pathways and transcription activation via Rlm1p and Swi6p for biosynthesis of the essential cell wall components such as glucan and chitin. Sensitivity of mutants associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER), vesicle and vacuole functions demonstrates that secretory machinery is essential for surviving the stress conditions, probably due to their roles in transporting polysaccharides to the cell wall and detoxification of accumulated Al(3+). Finally, the phenotype of 100 previously uncharacterized genes against the dual stressors will contribute to their eventual functional annotation.
