Mutations in Notch3 cause the syndrome CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). The mechanism by which these mutations result in a CADASIL phenotype has been widely speculated upon. A first step toward understanding a disease mechanism is to learn whether the mutations result in the loss of Notch3 function, in particular, its role in signaling or in the gain of a novel function. Notch3 genomic sequences were analyzed for sites of conservation across species. We present here a bioinformatic analysis of the Notch paralogs and orthologs that suggest that CADASIL mutations result in a gain of function. This finding diminishes the likelihood that a Notch3 signaling deficit is responsible for the phenotype and increases the likelihood that CADASIL joins the growing list of neurological diseases with protein deposits due to misfolding and aggregation.
