Microarray analyses and gene targeting have recently enhanced the understanding of factors involved in normal plasma cells and multiple myeloma. Plasma cells develop from marginal zone or germinal center B cells following stimulation by antigen, microbial products, TNF family signals and cytokines. Transcription factors, B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1) and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) are required for plasma cell development. They regulate sets of genes that induce immunoglobulin secretion, halt proliferation and block alternative B-cell fates. In multiple myeloma, transforming events lead to proliferation and survival, but programs for plasma cell differentiation and the inhibition of B-cell genes appear to be largely intact.
