Adenylate/uridylate-rich elements (AREs) are found in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that code for proto-oncogenes, nuclear transcription factors and cytokines. They represent the most common determinant of RNA stability in mammalian cells. Moreover, ARE-directed mRNA degradation is influenced by many exogenous factors, including phorbol esters, calcium ionophores, cytokines and transcription inhibitors. These observations suggest that AREs play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression during cell growth and differentiation, and in the immune response.
