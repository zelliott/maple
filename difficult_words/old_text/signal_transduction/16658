Although many overgrowth and growth deficient patients have apparently normal neuropsychological and cognitive functions, there is evidence to suggest that in some instances these functions are somewhat impaired. Altered growth hormone (GH) signaling is primarily responsible for many growth phenotypes and its signaling is regulated by a number of molecules, including members of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, in particular SOCS2. GH and SOCS2 have recently been shown to regulate neuronal differentiation by controlling expression of a neurogenic transcription factor, Neurogenin-1. Furthermore, SOCS2 regulates neurite outgrowth from neurons. Together, GH and SOCS2 play a role in regulating the numbers and types of neurons formed during development, as well as the connections they make in the central nervous system. This review will explore the possibility that an alteration in the balance of GH and SOCS2 may therefore lead to neural defects and some possible mechanisms will be examined.
