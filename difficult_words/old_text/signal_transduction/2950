Apoptosis has emerged as a fundamental process important in tissue homeostasis, immune response, and during development. CD95 (also known as Fas), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) superfamily, has been initially cloned as a death receptor. Its cognate ligand, CD95L, is mainly found at the plasma membrane of activated T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells where it contributes to the elimination of transformed and infected cells. According to its implication in the immune homeostasis and immune surveillance, and since several malignant cells of various histological origins exhibit loss-of-function mutations, which cause resistance towards the CD95-mediated apoptotic signal, CD95 has been classified as a tumor suppressor gene. Nevertheless, this assumption has been recently challenged, as in certain pathophysiological contexts, CD95 engagement transmits non-apoptotic signals that promote inflammation, carcinogenesis or liver/peripheral nerve regeneration. The focus of this review is to discuss these apparent contradictions of the known function(s) of CD95.
