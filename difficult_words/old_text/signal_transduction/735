Protein kinases play a central role in signal transduction pathways in eukaryotes. A highly conserved group of kinases, termed mitogen-activated-protein kinases (MAPKs) was shown to mediate many diverse stress responses. In plants, MAPKs were shown to function in resistance responses to many biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we show that exposure of Arabidopsis roots to hydrogen peroxide or to nitric oxide resulted in rapid activation of protein kinases in the shoots that exhibited MAPK properties. The same pattern of kinases was induced by direct injection of these compounds into leaves, indicating accurate long-distance transmission of H2O2 and NO signals. These results are important for the understanding of redox signal transmission from the rhizosphere throughout the plant.
