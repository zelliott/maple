Expression of the anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) gene is a novel prognostic factor in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Vascular and endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are able to upregulate MCL-1 via autocrine signaling loops. In 88 B-CLL patients, we found a strong correlation of MCL-1 gene expression with VEGF (P<10(-7)) but not with IL-6 mRNA levels. VEGF but not IL-6 expression influenced patient prognosis. VEGF may be a positive autocrine in vivo regulator of MCL-1 in B-CLL. Inhibition of VEGF and its signaling may prove to be useful in the treatment of B-CLL patients.
