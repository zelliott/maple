The transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is critical for normal trafficking of T lymphocytes, but its role in B cells is unclear. We report that B cell-specific KLF2 deficiency leads to decreased expression of the trafficking molecules CD62L and β7-integrin, yet expression of sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 1 (which is a critical target of KLF2 in T cells) was, unexpectedly, minimally altered. Unexpectedly, Klf2 deletion led to a drastic reduction in the B1 B-cell pool and a substantial increase in transitional and marginal zone B-cell numbers. In addition, we observed that KLF2-deficient B cells showed increased apoptosis and impaired proliferation after B-cell receptor cross-linking. Gene expression analysis indicated that KLF2-deficient follicular B cells display numerous characteristics shared by normal marginal zone B cells, including reduced expression of several signaling molecules that may contribute to defective activation of these cells. Hence, our data indicate that KLF2 plays a critical role in dictating normal subset differentiation and functional reactivity of mature B cells.
