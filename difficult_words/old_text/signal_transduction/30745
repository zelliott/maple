Phagotrophic protists are major consumers of microbial biomass in aquatic ecosystems. However, biochemical mechanisms underlying prey recognition and phagocytosis by protists are not well understood. We investigated the potential roles of cell signaling mechanisms in chemosensory response to prey, and in capture of prey cells, by a marine ciliate (Uronema sp.) and a heterotrophic dinoflagellate (Oxyrrhis marina). Inhibition of protein kinase signal transduction biomolecules caused a decrease in both chemosensory response and predation. Inhibition of G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways significantly decreased chemosensory response but had no effect on prey ingestion. Inhibitor compounds did not appear to affect general cell health, but had a targeted effect. These results support the idea that cell signaling pathways known in other eukaryotic organisms are involved in feeding behavior of free-living protists.
