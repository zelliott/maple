Previously, we have found that lipid rafts/caveolae were essential for insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor signaling during 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation induction. However, it was not identified as to which of the membrane lipid-ordered microdomains mediates the receptor signal. Using small double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi), we successfully suppressed the caveolin-1 protein expression. In cells stably transfected with vector expressing small interfering RNA (siRNA) fragment, no caveolin-1 protein or caveola was detected. On the other hand, removal of caveolin-1 did not affect the caveolinless lipid rafts or the localization of IGF-1 receptor in lipid rafts on plasma membrane. IGF-1 receptor signal transduction and induced cellular differentiation were normal in RNAi cells with only lipid rafts. Furthermore, these IGF-1 receptor signaling events were still sensitive to the cholesterol-binding reagents. Thus, our results suggest that lipid rafts are sufficient for IGF-1 receptor signaling and the recruitment of signal molecules by caveolin-1 is not essential for IGF-1 receptor signaling.
