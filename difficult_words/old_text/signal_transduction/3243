STAT5 plays a crucial role in B and T lymphocyte development. However, whether STAT5 primarily plays a role as a permissive factor, involved in lymphocyte survival, or an instructive factor, involved in lymphocyte differentiation, has been unclear. In addition, while STAT5 has been suggested to act as a transcriptional repressor, the mechanism by which it represses transcription was undefined. Recent reports have begun to shed new light on these roles for STAT5 in lymphocyte development, transcriptional repression, and leukemic transformation.
