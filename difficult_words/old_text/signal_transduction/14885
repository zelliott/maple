Viruses, which are among the simplest infective pathogens, can produce characteristic endocrine manifestations in infected patients. In addition to the classic modification of the host endocrine system by either direct or indirect destruction of the endocrine organs and/or effects exerted by systemic production of inflammatory and/or stress mediators, recent progress in molecular virology and endocrinology has revealed that virus-encoded molecules might alter the host endocrine-signaling systems by affecting extracellular and/or intracellular signal transduction and hormone sensitivity of host target tissues. Here, we provide a brief overview of such viral-mediated modulation of host endocrine signaling systems. We propose that virus-encoded molecules and the signaling systems they influence are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of disorders that are associated with some viral infections.
