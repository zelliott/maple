Coagulation proteases have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of tissue remodeling and fibrosis. We therefore assessed the proinflammatory and fibroproliferative effects of coagulation protease factor (F)Xa. We show that FXa elicits a signaling response in C2C12 and NIH3T3 fibroblasts. FXa-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was dependent on protease-activated receptor (PAR)-2 cleavage because desensitization with a PAR-2 agonist (trypsin) but not a PAR-1 agonist (thrombin) abolished FXa-induced signal transduction and PAR-2 siRNA abolished FXa-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The PAR-2-dependent cellular effects of FXa led to fibroblast proliferation, migration, and differentiation into myofibroblasts, as demonstrated by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and desmin, followed by the secretion of the cytokines monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and interleukin-6 as well as the expression of the fibrogenic proteins transforming growth factor-beta and fibronectin. To assess the relevance of FXa-induced proliferation and cell migration, we examined the effect of FXa in a wound scratch assay. Indeed, FXa facilitated wound healing in a PAR-2- and ERK1/2-dependent manner. Taken together, these results support the notion that, beyond its role in coagulation, FXa-dependent PAR-2 cleavage might play a role in the progression of tissue fibrosis and remodeling.
