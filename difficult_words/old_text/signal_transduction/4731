The morphology and duration of contacts between cells and adhesive surfaces play a key role in several biological processes, such as cell migration, cell differentiation, and the immune response. The interaction of receptors on the cell membrane with ligands on the adhesive surface leads to triggering of signaling pathways, which allow cytoskeletal rearrangement, and large-scale deformation of the cell membrane, which allows the cell to spread over the substrate. Despite numerous studies of cell spreading, the nanometer-scale dynamics of the membrane during formation of contacts, spreading, and initiation of signaling are not well understood. Using interference reflection microscopy, we study the kinetics of cell spreading at the micron scale, as well as the topography and fluctuations of the membrane at the nanometer scale during spreading of Jurkat TÂ cells on antibody-coated substrates. We observed two modes of spreading, which were characterized by dramatic differences in membrane dynamics and topography. Formation of signaling clusters was closely related to the movement and morphology of the membrane in contact with the activating surface. Our results suggest that cell membrane morphology may be a critical constraint on signaling at the cell-substrate interface.
