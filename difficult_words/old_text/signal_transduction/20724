We investigated alterations in protein kinase C (PKC) activity of PANC-1 cells following treatment with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or TNF-beta by an in vitro autoradiographic method. Binding studies performed on whole cells using [3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) as a ligand revealed strong activation of PKC by TNFs within 30 min. The effect was similar to that seen after 30 min treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). After treatment for 24 h, TNF-beta caused a marked down-regulation of PKC similar to that seen after 24 h treatment with TPA; significant activation persisted, however, in the cells treated for 24 h with TNF-alpha. Our data suggest that PKC activation may play a more important role in the TNF-alpha signal transduction pathway than in that of TNF-beta.
