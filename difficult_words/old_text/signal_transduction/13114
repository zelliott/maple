In this article, the authors review current and latest evidence linking helminth infections and the development of atopy. Although there is intense ongoing investigation and debate on this issue, the review of experimental, clinical and epidemiological data apparently shows that helminth infections can have beneficial aspects in regard to the pathogenesis of atopy and allergic diseases. Despite the fact that simplistic views are not recommended, it seems that polyclonal IgE production and mainly the stimulation of host immunoregulatory networks leading to synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-beta and others) can provide new insights into how mechanisms that helminths have developed throughout their evolution and that are useful for parasite evasion and persistence, could also be used in humans in order to provide new approaches in atopy prevention.
