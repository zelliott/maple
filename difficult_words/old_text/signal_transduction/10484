Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive signalling molecule that has numerous targets in plants. Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic synthesis of NO has been detected in several plant species, and NO functions have been characterized during diverse physiological processes such as plant growth, development, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. This wide variety of effects reflects the basic signalling mechanisms that are utilized by virtually all mammalian and plant cells and suggests the necessity of detoxification mechanisms to control the level and functions of NO. During the last two years an increasing number of reports have implicated non-symbiotic haemoglobins as the key enzymatic system for NO scavenging in plants, indicating that the primordial function of haemoglobins may well be to protect against nitrosative stress and to modulate NO signalling functions. The biological relevance of plant haemoglobins during specific conditions of plant growth and stress, and the existence of further enzymatic and non-enzymatic NO scavenging systems, suggest the existence of precise NO modulation mechanisms in plants, as observed for different NO sources.
