The lipid-derived hormone jasmonate (JA) regulates diverse aspects of plant immunity and development. Among the central components of the JA signaling cascade are the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFCOI1 and Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins that repress transcription of JA-responsive genes. Recent studies provide evidence that amino acid-conjugated forms of JA initiate signal transduction upon formation of a coronatine-insensitive1 (COI1)-JA-JAZ ternary complex in which JAZs are ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded. Coronatine, a virulence factor produced by the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, is a potent agonist of this hormone receptor system. Coronatine-induced targeting of JAZs to COI1 obstructs host immune responses to P. syrinage, providing a striking example of how pathogens exploit hormone signaling pathways in the host to promote disease. These findings, together with homology between COI1 and the auxin receptor, TIR1, extend the paradigm of F-box proteins as intracellular sensors of small molecules, and suggest a common evolutionary origin of the auxin and JA response pathways.
