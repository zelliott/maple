Phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated signal transduction processes in rat hepatocytes are subject to modulation by protein phosphatases (PPases) and protein kinases, including protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C. Ethanol (EtOH) stimulates PLC activity in liver cells in the absence of hormones, and EtOH pretreatment inhibits the subsequent stimulation of PLC by hormonal stimuli. There is evidence that protein kinase activities are involved in these actions of EtOH. We investigated the effects of okadaic acid (OKA), a PPase inhibitor, and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cpt-cAMP), a cell permeant cAMP analog that activates PKA, on EtOH-induced PLC activation. In addition, we studied the combined effects of cpt-cAMP and EtOH/OKA on vasopressin-induced PLC activation. PLC activation (cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization and inositol trisphosphate accumulation) induced by EtOH and vasopressin was inhibited by treatment with OKA, and was potentiated by cpt-cAMP. OKA treatment prevented the effect of cpt-cAMP. Pretreatment with EtOH caused inhibition of vasopressin-induced PLC activation. EtOH also decreased the enhancing effect of cpt-cAMP on the responses to vasopressin. The susceptibility to enhancement by cpt-cAMP plotted as a function of the initial rate of vasopressin-induced Ca2+ mobilization in EtOH-treated cells was similar to the pattern observed in OKA-treated cells. These data suggest that interactions of OKA and PKA on EtOH-induced PLC activation occurred at the level of G-protein, and indicate that EtOH may act as an inhibitory agent of PPase.
