Gene profile analysis of ILT3-Fc-induced Ts revealed a significant upregulation of Zink finger proteins, most of which act as transcriptional repressors. Included among these repressors is BCL6, which was shown to play a critical role in the differentiation of ILT3-Fc-induced T suppressor (Ts) cells. Genes implicated in cell cycle progression were downregulated. Genes encoding numerous inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were also downregulated. In contrast, antiapoptotic genes, as well as members of the WNT and transforming growth factor-Î² pathways, were upregulated. This study elucidates certain important aspects of Ts differentiation and function.
