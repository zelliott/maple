Recent data suggest that internalized receptor and arrestin complexes are actively involved in signal transduction. Miller and Lefkowitz discuss evidence from the Drosophila visual system that suggests that intracellular rhodopsin and arrestin2 complexes induce apoptosis. Experiments with activated mammalian G protein-coupled receptor and arrestin complexes point to a mechanism by which proliferative or proapoptotic signals can be mediated largely independent from G protein activation.
