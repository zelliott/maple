We explored the role of Gi protein signaling in the regulation of interleukin (IL)-12 production and T helper cell type 1 (Th1) T cell differentiation. In initial studies, we showed that treatment of normal mice with pertussis toxin (PT), which inhibits Gi protein signaling, enhanced the capacity of splenocytes to produce IL-12 in response to both microbial and nonmicrobial stimuli. In addition, PT treatment increased the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-10 by stimulated cells. These findings were corroborated by the fact that untreated Gi2alpha(2/-) mice exhibited enhanced production of IL-12 and TNF-alpha by splenocytes, and of IL-12 p40 by purified spleen CD8alpha(+) lymphoid dendritic cells. Finally, we showed that while normal BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania major exhibited a nonhealing phenotype, those treated with PT when infection was initiated exhibited a healing phenotype along with an enhancement of leishmania-specific Th1 responses in draining lymph nodes. Further, healing was prevented by coadministration of anti-IL-12 and PT. These data demonstrate that endogenous Gi protein signaling has a primary role in the regulation of IL-12 production and the induction of Th1 responses in vivo.
