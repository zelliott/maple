The mTOR protein kinase controls anabolic processes as part of mTOR complexes 1 and 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2). The two complexes are now shown to be involved in a negative feedback regulatory mechanism, in which mTORC1 stimulation inactivates mTORC2 through the inhibitory phosphorylation of the mTORC2 component Sin1.
