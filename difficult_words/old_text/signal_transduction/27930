Interleukin-17 is a T-cell-derived pro-inflammatory cytokine, exhibiting multiple biological activities in a variety of cells and believed to fine tune all general phases of hematopoietic response. However, the signaling mechanism of this novel cytokine remains unknown. Here, we report for the first time that the early signaling events triggered by interleukin-17 involve tyrosine phosphorylation of several members of the JAK and STAT proteins in human U937 monocytic leukemia cells. Immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies followed by Western blot analysis with antiphosphotyrosine antibody has shown that in U937 cells, interleukin-17 induces time-dependent stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK 1, 2 and 3, Tyk 2 and STAT 1, 2, 3 and 4 within 0.5 to 30 min. Interleukin-17-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins strongly suggests that the JAK/STAT signaling pathway may play a major role in transducing signals from interleukin-17 receptors to the nucleus.
