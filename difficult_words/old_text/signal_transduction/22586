The effects of a transient exposure to hydrogen peroxide (10 min at 200 microM H(2)O(2)) on pancreatic beta cell signal transduction and insulin secretion have been evaluated. In rat islets, insulin secretion evoked by glucose (16.7 mM) or by the mitochondrial substrate methyl succinate (5 mM) was markedly blunted following exposure to H(2)O(2). In contrast, the secretory response induced by plasma membrane depolarization (20 mM KCl) was not significantly affected. Similar results were obtained in insulinoma INS-1 cells using glucose (12.8 mM) as secretagogue. After H(2)O(2) treatment, glucose no longer depolarized the membrane potential (DeltaPsi) of INS-1 cells or increased cytosolic Ca(2+). Both DeltaPsi and Ca(2+) responses were still observed with 30 mM KCl despite an elevated baseline of cytosolic Ca(2+) appearing approximately 10 min after exposure to H(2)O(2). The mitochondrial DeltaPsi of INS-1 cells was depolarized by H(2)O(2) abolishing the hyperpolarizing action of glucose. These DeltaPsi changes correlated with altered mitochondrial morphology; the latter was not preserved by the overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) was increased following exposure to H(2)O(2) up to the micromolar range. No further augmentation occurred after glucose addition, which normally raises this parameter. Nevertheless, KCl was still efficient in enhancing mitochondrial Ca(2+). Cytosolic ATP was markedly reduced by H(2)O(2) treatment, probably explaining the decreased endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+). Taken together, these data point to the mitochondria as primary targets for H(2)O(2) damage, which will eventually interrupt the transduction of signals normally coupling glucose metabolism to insulin secretion.
