Genetic analyses in mice have contributed significantly to the understanding of the physiological functions of platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and their receptors. Phenotypic analyses of gene knockouts of PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGF alpha-receptors (PDGFRalpha) and beta-receptors (PDGFRbeta) have shown that these ligands and receptors play major roles during embryonic development. Conditional and subtle mutations in the same genes and analysis of chimeric mice have provided additional information about the roles of these genes in postnatal development. Transgenic over-expression studies have also demonstrated that PDGF ligands are capable of inducing pathological cell proliferation in a number of different organs. The present review summarizes these findings and discusses their implications for mammalian development and disease.
