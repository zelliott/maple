Our laboratory is interested in identifying genes relevant to diseases. Our approach is to use spontaneous mouse mutants with immunological defects and decipher the molecular basis of the phenotypes. In the early 1990s, our attention was focused on the motheaten and viable motheaten mouse mutants. We used these mutant mice as a model system for elucidating the genetic and cellular events contributing to expression of normal hematopoietic and immune function. Our initial goal was to identify the gene responsible for the motheaten and viable motheaten phenotype. In 1993, we and others reported that both motheaten and viable motheaten mice have mutations in the SHP-1 gene. Currently, there are more than 600 publications involving SHP-1. In this review, rather than summarizing all these studies, we highlight work involving SHP-1 that were/are carried out in our and our collaborators' laboratories.
