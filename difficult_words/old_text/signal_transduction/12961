High-density lipoprotein (HDL) protects against cardiovascular diseases by removal of excess lipids from cells. HDL apolipoprotein-mediated lipid efflux involves multiple cellular proteins to remove both cholesterol and phospholipids that are otherwise stored in the cells. This article reviews recent progress in the understanding of receptors, signal mediators, Golgi and vesicle transport related to the pathway and proposes a model of HDL apolipoprotein receptor-mediated exocytosis of cellular cholesterol. Such an exocytotic pathway could provide the most effective mechanism to remove excess cellular lipids and prevent atherogenesis.
