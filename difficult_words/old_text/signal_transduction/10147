ATP has been shown to mediate stress responses in the brain. The present study examined the ATP-stimulated stress protein expression of RBA-2 type-2 astrocytes. Our results revealed that ATP stimulated HSP60 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The stimulation requires a minimal ATP concentration of 500 microM and high concentration of extracellular ATP (1 mM) stimulated a significant increase of HSP60 expression from 2 to 24 h. In addition, the ATP-stimulated HSP60 expressions were inhibited by inhibitors for protein kinase C (PKC) and phospholipase D (PLD), and by antioxidants, resveratrol, and catalase. Furthermore, ATP stimulated the expression of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD). In addition, ATP and P2X7 receptor selective agonist BzATP also decreased mitochondria membrane potential measured by flow cytometry. To further examine the proteins involving in ATP-mediated stress responses, we conducted proteomic analysis. We found that RBA-2 astrocytes possess abundant peroxiredoxin II (Prx II), an antioxidant enzyme. ATP and exogenous H2O2 stimulated Prx II shifting from oxidized form to reduced form. Thus, we concluded that ATP potentiated the expression of HSP60 and Cu/Zn SOD, and decreased mitochondria membrane potential. In addition, RBA-2 astrocytes expressed Prx II that might also serve as a protective mechanism to control the concentration of reactive oxygen species.
