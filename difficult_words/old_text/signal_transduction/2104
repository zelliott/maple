The effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) to activate c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) was studied in a Chinese hamster ovary fibroblast cell line overexpressing the rat vascular type-1a Ang II receptor (CHO-AT1a). Ang II treatment induced a time-dependent activation of JNK. Ang II (10(-7) mol/L) activated JNK activity, with a peak at 30 minutes (9.39 +/- 2.52-fold, n = 7, P < .02 versus control), which was maintained until 3 hours (2.7 +/- 0.65-fold, n = 3, P < .02 versus control). Ang II-induced JNK activation at 30 minutes was inhibited by a specific lipoxygenase (LO) pathway inhibitor, cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-alpha-cyanocinnamate (1 mumol/L) by 87.5% (n = 4, P < .01 versus Ang II-induced JNK activity). The direct addition of 12-HETE also induced a time-dependent JNK activation. 12-HETE (10(-7) mol/L) activated JNK activity, with a peak at 10 minutes (3.43 +/- 0.87-fold, n = 6, P < .02 versus control), which remained elevated until 1 hour. These results suggest that the LO pathway is a mediator of Ang II-induced JNK activation. 15-HETE can also activate JNK at 5 minutes, but this activity was reduced at 30 minutes and could not be seen at 1 hour, indicating that the time course was different from that seen with 12-HETE. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, was used to perturb intracellular reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) levels to assess the role of endogenous ROIs in regulating JNK activity. Pretreatment of cells with 500 mumol/L NAC for 1 hour attenuated approximately 50% of Aug II-induced JNK activation, suggesting that ROIs, at least partially, mediate Ang II-induced JNK activation. Furthermore, 12-HETE-induced JNK activation was reduced by approximately 90% by NAC. Finally, pertussis toxin completely blocked 12-HETE-induced JNK activation, suggesting that Gi-protein signaling participates in 12-HETE-induced effects. These results suggest that LO activation plays a role in mediating Ang II-induced JNK activation in part by altering the redox tone and Gi-protein signaling of cells.
