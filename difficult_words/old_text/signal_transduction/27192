A taxonomically diverse group of bacterial pathogens have evolved a variety of strategies to subvert host-cellular functions to their advantage. This often involves two-way biochemical interactions leading to responses in both the pathogen and host cell. Central to this interaction is the function of a specialized protein secretion system that directs the export and/or translocation into the host cells of a number of bacterial proteins that can induce or interfere with host-cell signal transduction pathways. The understanding of these bacterial/host-cell interactions will not only lead to novel therapeutic approaches but will also result in a better understanding of a variety of basic aspects of cell physiology and immunology.
