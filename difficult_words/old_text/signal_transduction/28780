Immune-based therapy confers limited benefits to hosts bearing late-stage tumors. Mounting evidence points to local suppression of T cell function as the most substantial barrier to effective antitumor immunity in hosts with large tumor burdens. Despite this, events responsible for locally defective T cells and immune suppression in tumors remain unclear. We describe in this study a predominant T cell population localized within two murine tumors that is characterized by expression of apoptotic markers and TCRalphabeta/CD3, but not CD4, CD8, or NK-associated markers. These defective cells resembled double negative (DN) T cells in lpr mice, harbored defects in the expression of T cell signaling molecules, and produced the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Conditions known to increase or decrease the accumulation of lpr DN T cells had corresponding effects on local DN tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) levels and inversely impacted host survival. Adoptive transfer into s.c. tumors demonstrated that naive CD8(+) T cells were highly susceptible to becoming DN TIL, and local supplementation of tumors with nontumor Ag-bearing MHC class I-expressing fibroblasts decreased both this susceptibility and endogenous DN TIL levels. These findings identify a major defective T cell population with suppressive potential within tumors. The data also suggest that local T cell defectiveness is controlled by the tumor environment independent of cognate Ag specificity per se. Decreasing defective DN TIL levels by increasing noncognate peptide MHC class I availability, or modulating TCR or cytokine signaling may facilitate host survival by bolstering endogenous immunity to late-stage tumors, and may help improve therapeutic tumor vaccines.
