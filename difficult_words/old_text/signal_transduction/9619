Angiotensin (ANG) II via AT1 receptors (AT1Rs) maintains sodium homeostasis by regulating renal sodium transporters including Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE3) in a biphasic manner. Low-ANG II concentration stimulates whereas high concentrations inhibit NHE3 activity. Oxidative stress has been shown to upregulate AT1R function that could modulate the ANG II-mediated NHE3 regulation. This study was designed to identify the signaling pathways responsible for ANG II-mediated biphasic regulation of proximal tubular NHE3 and the effect of oxidative stress on this phenomenon. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically treated with a pro-oxidant L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) with and without an antioxidant tempol in tap water for 3 wk. BSO-treated rats exhibited oxidative stress and high blood pressure. At low concentration (1 pM) ANG II increased NHE3 activity in proximal tubules from all animals. However, in BSO-treated rats, the stimulation was more robust and was normalized by tempol treatment. ANG II (1 pM)-mediated NHE3 activation was abolished by AT1R blocker, intracellular Ca(2+) chelator, and inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC) and Ca(2+)-dependent calmodulin (CaM) but it was insensitive to Giα and protein kinase C inhibitors or AT2R antagonist. A high concentration of ANG II (1 μM) inhibited NHE3 activity in control and tempol-treated rats. However, in BSO-treated rats, ANG II (1 μM) continued to induce NHE3 stimulation. Tempol restored the inhibitory effect of ANG II (1 μM) in BSO-treated rats. The inhibitory effect of ANG II (1 μM) involved AT1R-dependent, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activation and was independent of AT2 receptor and nitric oxide signaling. We conclude that ANG II stimulates NHE3 via AT1R-PLC-CaM pathway and inhibits NHE3 by AT1R-PKG activation. Oxidative stress impaired ANG II-mediated NHE3 biphasic response in that stimulation was observed at both high- and low-ANG II concentration.
