Dermal fibroblasts are required for skin wound repair; they migrate into the wound bed, proliferate, synthesize extracellular matrix components and contract the wound. Although fibroblasts express beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-AR) and cutaneous keratinocytes can synthesize beta-AR agonists (catecholamines), the functional significance of this hormonal mediator network in the skin has not been addressed. Emerging studies from our laboratory demonstrate that beta2-AR activation modulates keratinocyte migration, essential for wound re-epithelialization. Here we describe an investigation of the effects of beta2-AR activation on the dermal component of wound healing. We examined beta2-AR-mediated regulation of biological processes in dermal fibroblasts that are critical for wound repair: migration, proliferation, contractile ability and cytoskeletal conformation. We provide evidence for the activation of at least two divergent beta2-AR-mediated signaling pathways in dermal fibroblasts, a Src-dependent pro-migratory pathway, transduced through the epidermal growth factor receptor and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and a PKA-dependent pro-proliferative pathway. beta2-AR activation attenuates collagen gel contraction and alters the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion distribution through PKA-dependent mechanisms. Our work uncovers a previously unrecognized role for the adrenergic hormonal mediator network in the cutaneous wound repair process. Exploiting these divergent beta2-AR agonist responses in cutaneous cells may generate novel therapeutic approaches for the control of wound healing.
