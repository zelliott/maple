A complex set of cell interactions is required to achieve fertilization. The pollen grain must be recognized by the pistil, take up water, and grow a pollen tube directionally through the style in order to deliver the sperm to the ovule. In many families of flowering plants, self-fertilization can be prevented by recognition mechanisms that allow self-pollen rejection by the pistil. The self-incompatibility response is under the genetic control of a single multi-allelic locus, the (Self-incompatibility) locus. There are two major classes of self-incompatibility systems. Gametophytic self-incompatibility has been well characterized in the Solanaceae and in the Papaveraceae, while sporophytic self-incompatibility has been well characterized in the Brassicaceae. In this review article, we present recent advances in understanding the signals mediating pollen recognition and pollen tube growth, in both compatible and incompatible interactions.
