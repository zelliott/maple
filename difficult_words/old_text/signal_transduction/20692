Both the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and the phosphoinositide second messenger systems are involved in olfactory signal transduction. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor is one of the principal intracellular calcium channels responsible for mobilizing stored calcium. The precise location of the 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (endoplasmic reticulum vs surface) and its role in the events of olfactory signal transduction need to be defined. By light microscopic and confocal immunohistochemistry we show expression of the olfactory-enriched G-protein, G(olf), associated with cyclic AMP responses, and of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor in the dendritic projections and cilia of essentially all olfactory receptor neurons, indicating that individual neurons express components of both second messenger systems. By immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrate that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor is localized to the surface membrane of rat olfactory cilia. This is the first morphological demonstration of the surface membrane localization of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor in olfactory cilia. Our findings, taken in conjunction with electrophysiological data from other workers, are supportive of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor playing a novel role in regulating calcium flux at the ciliary surface membrane.
