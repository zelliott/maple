Activity of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is required for optimal migration of human neutrophils [Niggli and Keller (1999) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 335, 43-52]. We have tested the direct effect of a product of PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP(3)), on neutrophil migration. To this end, a membrane-permeant ester of PIP(3), dilauroyl phosphatidylinositol 3,4, 5-trisphosphate-heptakis-(acetooxymethyl)ester (PIP(3)/AM) was used. PIP(3)/AM (ED(50): 10-17 microM) induced development of polarity and accumulation of F-actin in the leading lamellae in up to 70% of the cells. These cells exhibited stimulated random migration, comparable to that observed in uniform concentrations of chemotactic peptide. Evidence is provided for a role of Rho-kinase and for activation of PI 3-kinase in a positive feedback loop in PIP(3)/AM-induced motility.
