CUEDC2, a newly reported protein, has been found to be ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and repress NF-κB activity. To study the role of CUEDC2 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), we explored the function of CUEDC2 in CML cells through using the CML cell line K562 and its imatinib resistant cells K562/G01. K562 cells expressed a relatively higher level of CUEDC2 compared to K562/G01 cells. Knockdown of CUEDC2 in K562 cells resulted in decreased cell apoptosis after imatinib treatment; when CUEDC2 was overexpressed in K562/G01 cells, imatinib induced more cell apoptosis. By analyzing the activity of NF-κB, the results indicated a negative association between the expression of CUEDC2 and NF-κB signaling pathway in these CML cells. Our data suggested that the expression level of CUEDC2 has an inverse correlation with imatinib resistance and activity of NF-κB signaling pathway in CML cells, CUEDC2 could regulate imatinib sensitivity in CML cells at least partially through NF-κB signaling pathway.
