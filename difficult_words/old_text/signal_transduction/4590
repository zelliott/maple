To discuss the mechanisms of electroacupuncture at "Neiguan" (PC 6) on p38 MAPK signaling pathway in rats with cardiac hypertrophy.

Forty SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: a normal group, a model group, a model plus p38 MAPK inhibitor group, a model plus electroacupuncture group, ten rats in each group. The model rats were established by subcutaneous injection 3 mg/(kg x d) of Isoprenaline Hydrochloride; model plus p38 MAPK inhibitor group were injected 0.3 mg/(kg x d) of specific inhibitor SB 203580; model plus electroacupuncture group was treated by electroacupuncture at "Neiguan"(PC 6) with continuous-wave, 2 Hz and 1 mA for 20 minutes, once a day for 14 days. There was no treatment in other two groups. The contents of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in heart tissue were detected by radioimmunoassay and the p38 MAPK, p-p38 MAPK by western blot.

Compared with normal group, the contents of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, p38 MAPK, p-p38 MAPK were significantly increased in model group (all P < 0.01). The contents of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, p38 MAPK, p-p38 MAPK were significantly decreased in model plus p38 MAPK inhibitor group and model plus electroacupuncture group, compared with model group, all P < 0.05; compared with normal group, P < 0.05, P < 0.01; but no significant difference between model plus p38 MAPK inhibitor group and model plus electroacupuncture group (P > 0.05).

Electroacupuncture at "Neiguan" (PC 6) can prevent the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK of myocardial hypertrophy, and the mechanism maybe adjust p38 MAPK signaling pathway by inhibiting the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta.
