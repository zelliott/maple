The importance of hormones in endogenous aging has been displayed by recent studies performed on animal models and humans. To decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in aging we maintained human sebocytes at defined hormone-substituted conditions that corresponded to average serum levels of females from 20 (f20) to 60 (f60) years of age. The corresponding hormone receptor expression was demonstrated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Cells at f60 produced significantly lower lipids than at f20. Increased mRNA and protein levels of c-Myc and increased protein levels of FN1, which have been associated with aging, were detected in SZ95 sebocytes at f60 compared to those detected at f20 after 5 days of treatment. Expression profiling employing a cDNA microarray composed of 15 529 cDNAs identified 899 genes with altered expression levels at f20 vs. f60. Confirmation of gene regulation was performed by real-time RT-PCR. The functional annotation of these genes according to the Gene Ontology identified pathways related to mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, cell cycle, immune responses, steroid biosynthesis and phospholipid degradation - all hallmarks of aging. Twenty-five genes in common with those identified in aging kidneys and several genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases were also detected. This is the first report describing the transcriptome of human sebocytes and its modification by a cocktail of hormones administered in age-specific levels and provides an in vitro model system, which approximates some of the hormone-dependent changes in gene transcription that occur during aging in humans.
