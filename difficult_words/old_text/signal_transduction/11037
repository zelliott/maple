The Ras superfamily of small GTPases constitutes a large group of structurally and functionally related proteins. They function as signalling switches in numerous signalling cascades in the cell. During the recent years, an increased awareness of a communication between signalling systems employing Ras-like GTPases and signalling systems employing calcium has emerged. For instance, the intensity of the activation of Ras-like GTPases is regulated by calcium-dependent mechanisms, acting on proteins that facilitate the activation or inactivation of the small GTPases. Other Ras-like GTPases have a direct influence on calcium signalling by regulating the activity of certain calcium channels. In addition, several small GTPases collaborate with calcium signalling in regulating cellular processes, such as cell adhesion, cell migration and exocytosis.
