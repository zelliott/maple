Transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a well-documented mechanism by which vasoactive peptides and H2O2 elicit their cellular responses. However, a role for the insulin-like growth factor type-1 receptor (IGF-1R) transactivation in mediating the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) and H2O2 in vascular smooth muscle cells from different artery types have also been recently recognized. By using a series of pharmacological inhibitors of various growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and a direct analysis of the phosphorylation status of the beta-subunit of IGF-1R, a requirement of this growth factor receptor in Ang II and H2O2 response has been demonstrated. This review discusses some of the studies that highlight the importance of IGF-1R transactivation in mediating Ang II- and H2O2-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase B signaling pathways.
