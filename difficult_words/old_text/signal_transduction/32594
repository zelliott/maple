Exposure of primary human lung fibroblasts (HLF) to interleukin-6 (IL-6) rapidly induced Stat3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 3) tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells, alpha-thrombin did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3; however, it potently induced its serine phosphorylation. Interestingly, a short pretreatment of cells with alpha-thrombin significantly inhibited IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. The inhibition by alpha-thrombin was attenuated if cells were pretreated with U0126, a specific inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase 1 (MAPKK1). Exposure of HLF cells to IL-6 induced a twofold increase in gp130 mRNA levels; however, alpha-thrombin inhibited this IL-6-induced response almost to control levels. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that in HLF cells alpha-thrombin inhibits IL-6-induced Stat3 signaling via activation of MAPKK1 and that this cross-talk regulates IL-6-induced gp130 gene expression.
