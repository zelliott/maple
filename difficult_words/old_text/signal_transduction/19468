Inflammasomes are high-molecular-weight, multiprotein complexes in cells, which are assembled after cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain like receptors (NLRs) sense pathogens and danger signals. The inflammasome can activate caspase-1, and later makes the pro-IL-1Î², proIL-18 precursor mature by cleavaging, thereby mediates the innate immunity. Dysregulation of inflammasomes plays an important role in the development of sepsis and other immune inflammatory diseases, thus inflammasome may be a new target for prevention and treatment of sepsis.
