The modification of proteins with ubiquitin is involved in the regulation of various important biological pathways. A crucial step in this process is the modification of specific substrate proteins with ubiquitin by E3 ligases. The ubiquitylation of proteins can result in altered protein function or degradation by the 26S proteasome. Various proteins playing an important role during hematopoiesis are regulated via ubiquitin modification. Recently, alterations in ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation have been implicated in hematological cancers. Based on these findings, novel therapies that specifically target ubiquitylation or the proteasome are currently being developed. In this review, we will highlight the role of ubiquitylation in normal and malignant hematopoiesis and discuss novel therapeutical approaches that are now tested in various hematological malignancies.
