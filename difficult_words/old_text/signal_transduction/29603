Notch4, a member of the Notch family of transmembrane receptors, is expressed primarily on endothelial cells. Activation of Notch in various cell systems has been shown to regulate cell fate decisions, partly by regulating the propensity of cells to live or die. Various studies have demonstrated a role for Notch1 in modulating apoptosis, either in a positive or negative manner. In this study, we determined that constitutively active Notch4 (Notch4 intracellular domain) inhibited endothelial apoptosis triggered by lipopolysaccharide. Notch signals are transmitted by derepression and coactivation of the transcriptional repressor, RBP-Jkappa, as well as by less well defined mechanisms that are independent of RBP-Jkappa. A Notch mutant lacking the N-terminal RAM domain showed only partial antiapoptotic activity relative to Notch4 intracellular domain but stimulated equivalent RBP-Jkappa-dependent transcriptional activity. Similarly, constitutively active RBP-Jkappa activated a full transcriptional response but only demonstrated partial antiapoptotic activity. Additional studies suggest that Notch4 provides endothelial protection in two ways: inhibition of the JNK-dependent proapoptotic pathway in an RBP-Jkappa-dependent manner and induction of an antiapoptotic pathway through an RBP-Jkappa-independent up-regulation of Bcl-2. Our findings demonstrate that Notch4 activation inhibits apoptosis through multiple pathways and provides one mechanism to explain the remarkable capacity of endothelial cells to withstand apoptosis.
