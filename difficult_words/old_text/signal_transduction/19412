To evaluate whether the Notch signalling pathway is involved in the senescence of human dental pulp cells.

Human dental pulp cells were isolated and cultured. The Notch signalling pathway was blocked by adding DAPT (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester, γ-secretase inhibitor, 5 μmol/L) into the culture medium. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay. Cell senescence was evaluated through expression of senescenceassociated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) using β-galactosidase staining.

The proliferation of the human dental pulp cells decreased dramatically after treatment with DAPT, compared with the control. SA-β-Gal positive staining cells were seen in the DAPT group, but not in the control group.

The Notch signalling pathway is involved in the senescence of human dental pulp cells.
