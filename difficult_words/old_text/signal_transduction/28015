Recently, we and others demonstrated that JNK is essential for cell migration in a number of cell types. We also showed that JNK phosphorylates serine 178 on paxillin, a focal adhesion adaptor, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, phosphorylation of Ser 178 on paxillin is essential for cell migration and involved in modulating cell adhesions. A model is proposed to depict the role of JNK-paxillin signaling in cell migration.
