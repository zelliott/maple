This chapter describes methods for the analysis of B and T lymphocyte development in mice deficient in Rac1 and/or Rac2 GTPases. The development of both B and T cells is critically dependent on transition through checkpoints monitoring for correct rearrangement of antigen receptor genes. Progression through these checkpoints depends on signaling from the antigen receptors. In addition, signals from cytokine, chemokine, Notch, and death receptors play important roles in the survival, proliferation, and migration of developing lymphocytes. Analysis of these processes in mice deficient in these GTPases can illuminate their roles in transducing signals from these different receptors.
