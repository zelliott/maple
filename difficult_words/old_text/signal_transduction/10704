Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia and one of the most important factors for embolic stroke. In recent years, a tremendous amount has been learned about the pathophysiology and molecular biology of AF. Thus, pharmacologic interference with specific signal transduction pathways appears promising as a novel antiarrhythmic approach to maintain sinus rhythm and to prevent atrial clot formation. This review highlights the underlying molecular biology of atrial fibrillation, which may also be relevant for AF therapy.
