Annexin (Anx) A3 increases and plays important roles in the signalling cascade in hepatocyte growth in cultured hepatocytes. However, no information is available on its expression and role in rat liver regeneration. In the present study, AnxA3 expression was investigated to determine whether it also plays a role in the signalling cascade in rat liver regeneration. AnxA3 protein and mRNA level both increase in liver after administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or 70% partial hepatectomy. AnxA3 protein level increases in isolated parenchymal hepatocytes, but not in non-parenchymal liver cells, in these rat liver regeneration models. AnxA3 mRNA increases in hepatocytes after CCl4 administration. Anti-hepatocyte growth factor antibody suppresses this increase in AnxA3 mRNA level. These results demonstrate that AnxA3 expression increases in hepatocytes through a hepatocyte growth factor-mediated pathway in rat liver regeneration models, suggesting that AnxA3 plays an important role in the signalling cascade in rat liver regeneration.
