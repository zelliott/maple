Cells of the inner ear face constant metabolic and structural stress. Exposure to intense sound or certain drugs destroys cochlea hair cells, which in mammals do not regenerate. Thus, an endogenous stress response system may exist within the cochlea to protect it from everyday stressors. We recently described the existence of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the mouse cochlea. The CRF receptor type 1 (CRFR1) is considered the primary and canonical target of CRF signaling, and systemically it plays an essential role in coordinating the body-wide stress response via activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Here, we describe an essential role for CRFR1 in auditory system development and function, and offer the first description of a complete HPA equivalent signaling system resident within the cochlea. To reveal the role of CRFR1 activation in the cochlea, we have used mice carrying a null ablation of the CRFR1 gene. CRFR1(-/-) mice exhibited elevated auditory thresholds at all frequencies tested, indicating reduced sensitivity. Furthermore, our results suggest that CRFR1 has a developmental role affecting inner hair cell morphology and afferent and efferent synapse distribution. Given the role of HPA signaling in maintaining local homeostasis in other tissues, the presence of a cochlear HPA signaling system suggests important roles for CRFR1 activity in setting cochlear sensitivity, perhaps both neural and non-neural mechanisms. These data highlight the complex pleiotropic mechanisms modulated by CRFR1 signaling in the cochlea.
