Previous studies have reported that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulate mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) production via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in human airway cells. Moreover, this production was shown to depend on the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), which is increased in COPD patients' serum. In the present study we investigated the signaling pathway mediating LPS-stimulated secretion and activation of MMP-9, and the regulatory effects of this pathway on the production of MUC5AC in the human airway cells NCI-H292. Using specific inhibitors, we found that LPS-stimulated cells secreted and activated MMP-9 via EGFR. Our results also indicate that signaling events downstream of EGFR involved PI3K-dependent activation of Rac1, which mediated the NADPH-generated reactive oxygen species responsible for MMP-9 secretion and activation. Finally, we observed that EGFR/PI3K/Rac1/NADPH/ROS/MMP-9 regulate MUC5AC production in LPS-challenged NCI-H292 cells.",

In this study we showed that Axl expression was upregulated in drug-resistant cancer cells, as compared to those in parental cells. Downregulation of Axl expression by RNAi led to a decrease of K562/ADR and MCF-7/ADR cells invasion, proliferation in soft agar, and increased cells chemosensitivity in vitro. In nude mice bearing xenografts, downregulation of Axl in MDR cells enhanced the anticancer activity of intraperitoneally applied chemotherapeutic drugs.

For example, four island and one mainland subspecies of ermine, Mustela erminea, have been described as endemic to southeast Alaska alone. To better understand the role of past climatic change in generating diversity in the region, we examined DNA sequence variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of 210 ermine from across North America, with an emphasis on Alaska and British Columbia. We found three distinct (1.5-3.6% uncorrected 'p') lineages of ermine, all of which occur in southeast Alaska. One lineage includes a southeast Alaska endemic and specimens from Alaska (outside of southeast) and Eurasia. A second lineage includes two southeast Alaskan endemics and ermine from western Canada and the coterminous United States. The close relationships of these purported endemics to ermine outside of southeast Alaska suggest that they colonized the region from Beringian and southern glacial refugia, respectively, following deglaciation of the NPC. The third lineage appears restricted to the Prince of Wales Island complex in southeast Alaska (two subspecies) and Graham Island (Haida Gwaii), British Columbia. This restricted distribution suggests that these populations may be derived from relicts that persisted in a coastal refugium during the Wisconsin glaciation. Studies of nuclear genes and adaptive morphological evolution are necessary to further explore discrepancies between the geographical pattern of differentiation based on mtDNA and the existing subspecific taxonomy based on morphology.",

Ectopic expression of IL-24 in anchorage-independent cells inhibited their growth in monolayer culture, in soft agar, and in nude mice in vivo and inhibited their ability to migrate and invade in in vitro assays. Furthermore, growth suppression by IL-24 was associated with the transcriptional up-regulation of p27(Kip1) via the activation of Stat3. We showed, for the first time, that beta(4) integrin is a downstream target of IL-24. However, beta(4) does not play a direct role in regulating the proliferative capacity of rat mammary tumor cells.

We demonstrate that such complexes are also present in secretions of cultured cells. To study the formation and properties of the complexes, we purified proCD and proSAP from culture media of Spodoptera frugiperda cells that were infected with baculoviruses bearing the respective cDNAs. The biological activity of proCD was demonstrated by its pH-dependent autoactivation to pseudocathepsin D and that of proSAP was demonstrated by feeding to saposin-deficient cultured cells that corrected the storage of radioactive glycolipids. In gel filtration, proSAP behaved as an oligomer and proCD as a monomer. ProSAP altered the elution of proCD such that the latter was shifted into proSAP-containing fractions. ProSAP did not change the elution of mature cathepsin D. Using surface plasmon resonance and an immobilized biotinylated proCD, binding of proSAP was demonstrated under neutral and weakly acidic conditions. At pH 6.8, specific binding appeared to involve more than one binding site on a proSAP oligomer. The dissociation of the first site was characterized by a K(D1) of 5.8+/-2.9x10(-8) M(-1) (calculated for the monomer). ProSAP stimulated the autoactivation of proCD and also the activity of pseudocathepsin D. Concomitant with the activation, proSAP behaved as a substrate yielding tri- and disaposins and smaller fragments. Our results demonstrate that proSAP forms oligomers that are capable of binding proCD spontaneously and independent of the mammalian type N-glycosylation but not capable of binding mature cathepsin D. In addition to binding proSAP, proCD behaves as an autoactivable and processing enzyme and its binding partner as an activator and substrate.",

As such, it should exhibit the classic hallmarks of nonlinearity, multistability, and \"nondiffusivity\" (large coherent fluctuations). Surprisingly, at least at the very large scale of neocortical dynamics, there is little empirical evidence to support this, and hence most computational and methodological frameworks for healthy brain activity have proceeded very reasonably from a purely linear and diffusive perspective. By studying the temporal fluctuations of power in human resting-state electroencephalograms, we show that, although these simple properties may hold true at some temporal scales, there is strong evidence for bistability and nondiffusivity in key brain rhythms. Bistability is manifest as nonclassic bursting between high- and low-amplitude modes in the alpha rhythm. Nondiffusivity is expressed through the irregular appearance of high amplitude \"extremal\" events in beta rhythm power fluctuations. The statistical robustness of these observations was confirmed through comparison with Gaussian-rendered phase-randomized surrogate data. Although there is a good conceptual framework for understanding bistability in cortical dynamics, the implications of the extremal events challenge existing frameworks for understanding large-scale brain systems.",

Biomechanical data have shown that blood causes harmful effects on overall cartilage function under loading conditions. Therefore, haemophilic patients suffering a haemarthrosis should be subjected to blood aspiration (arthrocentesis) to prevent cartilage damage. MRI and ultrasonography have shown themselves to be excellent noninvasive tools for the evaluation of early cartilage damage that remains undetectable by conventional radiography in haemophilic patients. Prophylaxis with the deficient factor can prevent cartilage deterioration and reduce the incidence of joint haemorrhage in children with haemophilia. Radiosynovectomy has proved to be a highly effective procedure to decrease both the frequency and the severity of recurrent intra-articular bleeding episodes. Nowadays, the most usual surgical procedures for treating articular cartilage defects (cartilage repair) include abrasion chondroplasty, microfracture, mosaicplasty, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), and matrix-induced ACI. In small defects (<2-4 cm(2)), ostechondral autograft or microfracture are the recommended options. In large defects (>2-4 cm(2)), ACI or osteochondral allograft are indicated. However, these techniques have not been applied in haemophilic patients because inflammatory conditions and advanced degenerative change (>50% joint space narrowing) are contraindications for cartilage repair. Thus, prevention of cartilage damage is paramount in haemophilia. The definitive remedy for advanced cartilage damage is either (knee or hip) replacement or (ankle) arthrodesis. Primary prophylaxis and radiosynovectomy are the best alternatives at our disposal to protect our patients against cartilage damage and arthropathy in haemophilic joints.",

High signal intensity on both nonenhancing and enhancing lesions noted only on precontrast T1-weighted magnetization transfer suggests a lipid signal was unmasked. If magnetization transfer is used in multiple sclerosis patients, a precontrast magnetization transfer image is necessary.",

A negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) test and much higher eosinophil counts (9947 vs. 3657/microL, respectively, p < 0.001) distinguished patients with cardiac involvement from those without. Impaired left ventricular function (50%), mild to severe valvular insufficiencies (73%), and pericardial effusions (41%) were common findings in these patients. Endomyocarditis was found in 13 patients (59%) as detected by cardiac MRI, cardiac thrombus formation, and endomyocardial biopsy, and was associated with impaired cardiac function. After a mean follow-up of 47 months, most patients had regained or maintained good cardiac function. However, patients with endomyocarditis had a more severe outcome. Two patients died (61 and 99 mo after diagnosis, respectively), both due to severe cardiomyopathy and heart failure.Cardiac involvement is common in patients with CSS and is associated with the absence of ANCA and high eosinophil counts.

We report here biochemical evidence for a DNA repair deficiency that correlates with the cytogenetic studies. In the alkaline elution technique, after a pulse label with radioactive thymidine in the presence of 3-acetylaminobenzamide (a G2-phase blocker) and X irradiation, DNA from tumor or cancer-prone cells elutes more rapidly during the postirradiation period than that from normal cells. These results indicate that the DNA of tumor and cancer-prone cells either repairs more slowly or acquires more breaks than that of normal cells; breaks can accumulate during incomplete or deficient repair processes. The kinetic difference between normal and tumor or cancer-prone cells in DNA strand-break repair reaches a maximum within 2 h, and this maximum corresponds to the kinetic difference in chromatid aberration incidence following X irradiation reported previously. These findings support the concept that cells showing enhanced G2 chromatid radiosensitivity are deficient in DNA repair. The findings could also lead to a biochemical assay for cancer susceptibility.",

The other series comprised 105 patients who had undergone FDG PET scan ( n=70) or [(11)C]choline PET scan ( n=35) alone; in this series, PET findings were correlated with the results of morphological imaging (MI) studies, i.e. CT ( n=92) or MR imaging ( n=13) (PET+MI group). Regions of abnormal tracer uptake at PET scanning were classified as ambiguous or unambiguous depending on their precise anatomical localisation. A total of 207 and 196 lesions were found in the PET/CT and PET+MI groups, respectively. The difference in terms of number of lesions per patient detected with the two imaging protocols was not statistically significant ( P=0.718). When analysis of lesion localisation was performed, there were 7/207 (3.4%) and 30/196 (15.3%) ambiguous lesions in the PET/CT and PET+MI groups, respectively. The number of ambiguous lesions was significantly higher in the PET+MI group than in the PET/CT group (chi(2)=15.768, P&lt;0.0001). Comparison of the effect of use of the different tracers on reporting of PET/CT versus PET+MI revealed that the improvement in the final report in [(11)C]choline PET/CT studies was similar to that observed in [(18)F]FDG studies.

Degrees of resistance were assessed in terms of IC(50) values in an MTT assay and the P-gp function was evaluated in terms of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) accumulation and efflux. The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. The levels of P-gp and MDR mRNA expression were estimated using the PE-conjugated anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody 17F9 and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.\n\nThree MOLT-4 sublines were established and revealed a 2- to 115-fold resistance to the anticancer reagents DNR, VBL and DOX as compared to the parental cell line. The highest MDR was expressed in MOLT-4/DNR cells, which was overcome by the P-gp modulator, cyclosporin A (CsA). The resistant sublines showed a decreased accumulation and an increased efflux of Rh123 in proportion to the degree of resistance, and these were completely reversed in the presence of 8 microM CsA. The decreased apoptotic response in these cell lines was clearly associated with the degree of drug resistance. P-gp antigen and MDR1 mRNA were highly expressed in both the MOLT-4/DNR and MOLT-4/DOX sublines. Less-resistant MOLT-4/VBL cells expressed lower levels of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp, even though the cell line was established by exposing the parental MOLT-4 cells to VBL for longer (5 months) than to the other two reagents (3 months).\n\nMOLT-4 cells were able to acquire a high level of drug resistance by culturing the cells in the presence of certain anticancer drugs, and acquisition of the resistance was relatively reagent-specific.

Clinicopathological factors and postoperative outcomes were compared between high and low subgroups of MCs or Tregs. Compared to low denstiy, higher peritumoral MCs were associated with poorer clinical outcomes, and independently related to elevated 5-year recurrence incidence (54.1%vs 39.2%, P = 0.026). High-dense MCs were especially related to increased probability of early recurrence (within 2 years) (P = 0.004). We also found that peritumoral Tregs were positively correlated with MCs in density (r = 0.353, P < 0.001) and reversely related to HCC outcomes. Notably, MCs in combination with Tregs displayed better prognostic performances than MCs alone (area under curve [AUC](survival) = 0.629 vs 0.589, AUC(recurrence) = 0.632 vs 0.591). Moreover, MCs were positively correlated to alanine aminotransferase, a serum inflammatory marker (P = 0.014). Therefore, peritumoral MCs are promising prognostic parameters for HCC mainly through inflammation response-related mechanisms, and we propose that MCs and Tregs may cooperate with each other and result in poorer prognosis.",

This is due to the inherent self-navigation and motion correction of PROPELLER-based techniques. However, it is unknown how various acquisition parameters that determine k-space sampling affect the accuracy of motion correction in PROPELLER and Turboprop MRI. The goal of this work was to evaluate the accuracy of motion correction in both techniques, to identify an optimal rotation correction approach, and determine acquisition strategies for optimal motion correction. It was demonstrated that blades with multiple lines allow more accurate estimation of motion than blades with fewer lines. Also, it was shown that Turboprop MRI is less sensitive to motion than PROPELLER. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the number of blades does not significantly affect motion correction. Finally, clinically appropriate acquisition strategies that optimize motion correction are discussed for PROPELLER and Turboprop MRI.",

In fact, the likelihood of the data under complex stochastic models is often analytically or numerically intractable in many areas of sciences. This makes it even more important to simultaneously investigate the adequacy of these models-in absolute terms, against the data, rather than relative to the performance of other models-but no such procedure has been formally discussed when the likelihood is intractable. We provide a statistical interpretation to current developments in likelihood-free Bayesian inference that explicitly accounts for discrepancies between the model and the data, termed Approximate Bayesian Computation under model uncertainty (ABCmicro). We augment the likelihood of the data with unknown error terms that correspond to freely chosen checking functions, and provide Monte Carlo strategies for sampling from the associated joint posterior distribution without the need of evaluating the likelihood. We discuss the benefit of incorporating model diagnostics within an ABC framework, and demonstrate how this method diagnoses model mismatch and guides model refinement by contrasting three qualitative models of protein network evolution to the protein interaction datasets of Helicobacter pylori and Treponema pallidum. Our results make a number of model deficiencies explicit, and suggest that the T. pallidum network topology is inconsistent with evolution dominated by link turnover or lateral gene transfer alone.",

With such an arrangement, a temporal lens equation with a form identical to that of conventional light optics is derived. The analog of ray diagrams, but for electrons, are constructed to help the visualization of the process of compressing electron packets. It is shown that such temporal lenses not only compensate for electron pulse broadening due to velocity dispersion but also allow compression of the packets to durations much shorter than their initial widths.

Following a one-step acetylation reaction to transform the dendrimer terminal amines to acetyl groups, a series of dendrimer-entrapped or dendrimer-stabilized Au-Ag alloy NPs with terminal acetyl groups were formed. The formed Au-Ag alloy NPs before and after acetylation reaction were characterized using different techniques. We showed that the optical property and the size of the bimetallic NPs were greatly affected by the metal composition. At the constant total metal atom/dendrimer molar ratio, the size of the alloy NPs decreased with the gold content. The formed Au-Ag alloy NPs were stable at different pH (pH 5-8) and temperature (4-50°C) conditions. X-ray absorption coefficient measurements showed that the attenuation of the binary NPs was dependent on both the gold content and the surface modification. With the increase of gold content in the binary NPs, their X-ray attenuation intensity was significantly enhanced. At a given metal composition, the X-ray attenuation intensity of the binary NPs was enhanced after acetylation. Cytotoxicity assays showed that after acetylation, the cytocompatibility of Au-Ag alloy NPs was significantly improved. With the controllable particle size and optical property, metal composition-dependent X-ray attenuation characteristics, and improved cytocompatibility after acetylation, these dendrimer-entrapped or dendrimer-stabilized Au-Ag alloy NPs should have a promising potential for CT imaging and other biomedical applications.",

SSFP imaging protocols, however, are frequently set up with minimal pulse repetition times and RF pulses can thus constitute a considerable amount to the actual pulse repetition time. As a result, finite RF pulse effects can lead to 10-20% signal deviation from common SSFP theory in the transient and in the steady state which may impair the accuracy of SSFP-based quantitative imaging techniques. In this article, a new and generic approach for intrinsic compensation of finite RF pulse effects is introduced. Compensation is based on balancing relaxation effects during finite RF excitation, similar to flow or motion compensation of gradient moments. RF pulse balancing, in addition to the refocusing of gradient moments with balanced SSFP, results in a superbalanced SSFP sequence free of finite RF pulse effects in the transient and in the steady state; irrespective of the RF pulse duration, flip angles, relaxation times, or off-resonances. Superbalancing of SSFP sequences can be used with all quantitative SSFP techniques where finite RF pulse effects are expected or where elongated RF pulses are used.",

A modified statistical back-projection method was used to reconstruct HIV incidence by jurisdiction.\n\nHIV incidence among MSM peaked for all jurisdictions in the early 1980s and then declined into the early 1990s, after which incidence increased.

    "originalString": "The 2-year cost of a new diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is estimated to be $27,987. These costs are thought to be secondary to hospitalization, amputation, and the duration of care. Treatments that accelerate rapid and complete healing of DFUs reduce the need for hospitalization, thus reducing the costs of care. One of the therapies previously shown to lead to more rapid and complete wound healing of DFUs is recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF). Many centers, however, do not initiate rhPDGF therapy, based on patient cost issues. Therefore, many centers reserve a potentially cost-saving therapy as a second- or third-line therapy. The goal of the authors' analysis was to examine the actual cost to patients of a policy of initiating rhPDGF as the initial therapy for appropriately debrided DFUs.\n\nA 12-month retrospective analysis of all patients presenting to a tertiary care referral wound practice with the diagnosis of DFUs was performed. The algorithm the authors followed specified that all wounds of patients with an ankle brachial index of greater than 0.7 and a diagnosis of DFUs (that were not enrolled in a research protocol) were debrided widely (ie, all wounds were debrided sharply with a 45-degree bevel on the border and the bases of the wounds were sharply debrided to a clean granular base), provided off-loading, and initiated on rhPDGF at the patients' first center visit. The patient payer mix and average cost-per-patient per year were analyzed, and the average number of tubes of rhPDGF was recorded.\n\nThere were 121 patients with the diagnosis of DFUs, representing 766 visits. A total of 187 tubes of rhPDGF were prescribed for these 121 patients over the course of 12 months. There was an average use of 1.54 tubes per patient. The primary payer mix was Medicare, 44%; Medicaid, 27%; and private-payer mix, 29%, representing 10 companies. The average patient cost per tube was $28, the average cost for Medicare was $25 (many with secondary payers, as data predate 2006 Medicare D), Medicaid was $2, and private insurance was $71. Therefore, the average patient cost per course of therapy was $42.\n\nThe average cost to patients with prescription benefits for a course of rhPDGF therapy, over a diverse and representative patient mix, is less than $50 in an inner-city tertiary care facility. Thus, patient cost alone should not provide a barrier to initiating active therapy in the form of rhPDGF to the patient presenting with a DFU. This early initiation could potentially lead to lower overall health costs by improving wound-healing outcomes.",

In addition to the 3D localization of the target region, it has been shown that MRI can provide real-time thermometry and allows online, automatic control of temperature evolution of the focal point. Treatment of a large tissue volume (as compared to the focal spot size, i.e., the ultrasound wavelength) can be achieved rapidly by moving the focal point along an inside-out spiral trajectory. It has been shown previously that under linear conditions of energy deposition versus temperature, the spatial profile of the temperature within a large area can be controlled. In this study, a proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) spatial-and-temporal controller is described for the control of the temperature evolution within the target region under more variable conditions. The aim was to reach a predefined temperature profile after a few successive trajectories. Heat conduction in tissue is exploited to obtain a uniform temperature increase in a volume using discrete sonications without any waiting time. Input data sets consisted of 3D temperature maps provided online by a MR scanner. For each new trajectory, the controller recalculates the number of sonications per surface unit (spatial density of points describing the trajectory) and the applied power. Its performance was tested ex vivo and in vivo. Diameters of the target region ranged from 9 mm to 19 mm. Targeted temperature increase ranged from +8 degrees C to +18 degrees C.

Therefore their detection is an important step of AFL/AF recognition as well as P-wave detection is for AV block identification. Many approaches to P-wave identification are based on correlation with a manually selected template. The developed method and algorithm use a universal synthesized template and apply a modified convolution for P-wave detection. In order to emphasize the true coincidences, the sample differences between the template and P-wave candidates are introduced in a denominator. Each convolution is calculated twice with a shifted template, which locates once its first term closely to the corresponding signal sample and secondly does the same with its middle term. The convolution sum is compared with adaptive threshold Tr to mark P-wave occurrences. To accelerate the computation process, the two convolutions are accomplished only if a preliminary convolution over a reduced number of samples gives an outcome higher than the decreased threshold Tr/2. Further, a rule for AF recognition is applied. The results show that missed or wrong P-wave detections are observed in a limited number of RR intervals. They do not hamper the discovery of AFL/AF arrhythmias. The algorithm can be successfully used for such cases except for prediction of paroxysmal AF. The mean delay in AF onset recognition over a 10 h recording taken from MIT-BIH-Afdb is 2.7 s. This value for AF offset is 5.5 s.

During fasting, the average T3 MBC increased to 1.43 +/- 0.31 pmol/mg DNA and the average T4 MBC increased to 9.63 +/- 2.46 pmol/mg DNA, values that are both significantly higher than those in the fed period; the dissociation constants were unaltered in obese subjects (compared to normals) in fed and fasting states. Gel filtration with 0.5 M agarose was employed to ascertain if the physicochemical properties of the solubilized mononuclear human cell receptor were similar to those previously observed in rat and human liver and kidney receptors. The elution profile obtained was similar to that reported earlier. The major binding activity has an estimated Stokes radius of 35 A and a molecular weight ratio of approximately 50,000 daltons. These studies indicate that: 1) high affinity T3 and T4 receptors exist in human mononuclear cells and have properties similar to those for T3 and T4 described previously in rat liver; 2) T3 and T4 receptor number tends to increase in hypothyroid subjects and tend to be lower in obese patients than in normal weight control subjects; 3) fasting is associated with an increase in both T3 and T4 MBC; and 4) despite their apparent physicochemical similarity, T3 receptors in rat liver and human mononuclear cells may be regulated differently, at least during fasting since hepatic T3 receptors decrease in the fasted rat. Collectively, these observations support the concept that human white cell T3 nuclear receptor binding is capable of rapid fluctuations, suggesting a mechanism for homeostatic regulation of T3 action.",

As oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA) and Barrett's oesophagus (BO) represent a neoplastic series, we postulated that curcumin supplementation may slow neoplastic progression at this site. Our aim was to investigate the effects of curcumin in vitro and in vivo on markers of oesophageal cancer progression.\n\nWe investigated the in vitro ability of curcumin to prevent bile acid-induced DNA damage using micronucleus assay and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activity in the oesophageal cell lines (OE33) using real-time PCR of the extracted RNA. We also analysed NF-κB p65 activation in curcumin-pre-treated OE33 cells exposed to deoxycholic acid (DCA) using ELISA. In another pilot study, BO patients took a daily 500 mg curcumin tablet for 7 days prior to their endoscopy. In biopsies collected from these patients (n=33, 16 curcumin, 17 control), we examined NF-κB-driven gene expression (interleukin (IL)-8, inhibitor- kappaB (I-κB)) using real-time PCR of the extracted RNA from the biopsy sample. The apoptotic frequency was assessed by counting the number of apoptotic bodies in the epithelial cells from the Barrett's tissue with and without curcumin.\n\nIn vitro, curcumin (50 μM) significantly abrogated DNA damage and NF-κB activity induced by bile. Pretreating OE33 cells with curcumin (50 μM) completely abolished the ability of DCA (300 μM) to activate NF-κB. In vivo, IL-8 expression was non-significantly suppressed in the curcumin-supplemented patients compared to the squamous control tissue, whilst also showing a doubling in the apoptotic frequency compared to non-supplemented control patients.\n\nCurcumin abrogated bile-driven effects in vitro. The in vivo data also suggests that curcumin supplementation had beneficial effects (increased apoptosis, potentially reduced NF-κB activity) in the Barrett's tissues themselves, despite poor delivery of the curcumin to the oesophagus.",

A digit coding test was performed before, and at the end of the treatment period and a third 15 days later. The improvement of performance from the first to the third test (learning effect) was significantly better in the placebo group than in the B6 treated groups. This could be attributed to memorization of skills. Trial II was performed in obese patients starting a low calorie diet in whom vitamins are routinely prescribed. Performance in a work recognition test and in a visual retention test was lower for the group receiving 1 g of pyridoxine a day. Thus, high doses of oral pyridoxine are likely to impair memorization in man. Disturbances of neuro-transmitter metabolism such as increase of GABA production might explain the effect. As the benefit of high doses of pyridoxine has not been well-documented and as the study has suggested that undesired effects may indeed exist, the widespread use of such doses is questionable.",

The etiology of obesity is multifactorial, and genetic inheritance and behavioral/environmental causes are considered the main etiological factors. Moreover, evidence that specific infections might promote the development of obesity has steadily accumulated.

The aim of this paper was to review the available data regarding the various aspects of the association between obesity and infections and to highlight the possibility that infectious agents may have an etiological role in obesity, an idea known as \"infectobesity\". Several microbes have been considered as possible promoter of obesity, but most of the data concern adenovirus-36 that exerts an adipogenic action mainly via a direct effect on adipose tissue leading to weight gain, at least in animal models.Obesity affects the immune response leading to an increased susceptibility to infections. Obese adults and children show an increased incidence of both nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Furthermore, obesity may alter the pharmacokinetics of antimicrobial drugs and impact on vaccine response. However, the various aspects of the association of obesity infections remain poorly studied, and a call to research is necessary to better investigate the problem.In conclusion, obesity impacts millions globally, and greater understanding of its etiology and its effects on immunity, infections, and prevention and management strategies is a key public health concern.",

The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of Id-1 and NF-κB/p65 in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and NPC cell lines were examined using reverse transcription-PCR and western blot analysis, whereas the mRNA and protein levels of Id-1 and NF-κB/p65 in clinical NPC specimens were determined by reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to silence Id-1 and NF-κB/p65 to allow for the examination of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression and migratory capacity changes in CNE-2 cells. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that elevated Id-1 expression was a significant independent predictor of the 5 year overall survival rate (hazards ratio = 16.720, P = 0.005). Furthermore, elevated expression of both Id-1 and NF-κB/p65 was associated with poor clinical survival (P = 0.049). Targeting Id-1 and NF-κB/p65 mRNA with shRNA in CNE-2 cells inhibited MMP-9 expression and decreased the migratory capacity of CNE-2 cells. In conclusion, Id-1 expression is a novel independent prognostic marker molecule that helps identify NPC patients with a poor prognosis. Additionally, combined analysis of Id-1 and NF-κB/p65 can be useful for identifying patients at risk for unfavorable clinical outcomes.

Since published results were presented in different formats, these were all converted to correlation coefficients. Biases were considered as additive or proportional on the correlation scale. Opinions about the extent of each bias in each study, together with its uncertainty, were elicited in a formal process from quantitatively trained assessors for the internal biases and subject-matter specialists for the external biases. Bias-adjusted results for each study were combined across assessors using median pooling, and results combined across studies by random-effects meta-analysis.\n\nBefore adjusting for bias, the pooled correlation is difficult to interpret because the studies varied substantially in quality and design, and there was considerable heterogeneity. After adjusting for both the internal and external biases, the pooled correlation provides a meaningful quantitative summary of all available evidence, and the confidence interval incorporates the elicited uncertainties about the extent of the biases. In the adjusted meta-analysis, there was no apparent heterogeneity.\n\nThis approach provides a viable method of bias adjustment for meta-analyses of observational studies, allowing the quantitative synthesis of evidence from otherwise incompatible studies.

Results described here show that increased HSP27 phosphorylation not only does not underlie hypoxia-induced permeability, but may actually augment the endothelial barrier. Hypoxia causes gap formation between RPMEC and increases MLC2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of MYPT1, which inhibits MLC2 phosphatase, is also increased in hypoxia. In addition, FAK phosphorylation, which alters focal adhesion signaling, is increased in hypoxia. Overexpressing phosphomimicking HSP27 (pmHSP27), which induces significant actin stress fiber formation, surprisingly renders RPMEC resistant to hypoxia- or TGFbeta-induced permeability. siRNA against pmHSP27 reverses the increased actin stress fiber formation in pmHSP27-overexpressing cells, and disrupting actin stress fibers in pmHSP27-overexpressing RPMEC renders them more susceptible to hypoxia. Finally, hypoxia-induced gap formation, as well as phosphorylation of MLC2, MYPT1 and FAK are almost abolished by overexpressing pmHSP27 in RPMEC. These effects of pmHSP27 overexpression might represent decreased cytoskeletal plasticity and increased tethering which counteracts permeability-inducing contractility. Thus hypoxia activates two pathways one leading to contractility and increased permeability, the other leading to actin stress fibers, stronger adhesion, and reduced permeability. Altering HSP27 phosphorylation, which tips the balance towards decreased permeability, might be targeted in managing endothelial barrier dysfunction.",

Although CXCL10 could be induced by IFN-gamma depending on cell type, the mechanisms regulating CXCL10 production following treatment with combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha have not been adequately elucidated in human monocytes. In this study, we showed that TNF-alpha had more potential than IFN-gamma to induce CXCL10 production in THP-1 monocytes. Furthermore, IFN-gamma synergistically enhanced the production of CXCL10 in parallel with the activation of NF-kappaB in TNF-alpha-stimulated THP-1 cells. Blockage of STAT1 or NF-kappaB suppressed CXCL10 production. JAKs inhibitors suppressed IFN-gamma plus TNF-alpha-induced production of CXCL10 in parallel with activation of STAT1 and NF-kappaB, while ERK inhibitor suppressed production of CXCL10 as well as activation of NF-kappaB, but not that of STAT1. IFN-gamma-induced phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2, whereas TNF-alpha induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Interestingly, IFN-gamma alone had no effect on phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha, whereas it significantly promoted TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha. These results suggest that TNF-alpha induces CXCL10 production by activating NF-kappaB through ERK and that IFN-gamma induces CXCL10 production by increasing the activation of STAT1 through JAKs pathways. Of note, TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB may be the primary pathway contributing to CXCL10 production in THP-1 cells. IFN-gamma potentiates TNF-alpha-induced CXCL10 production in THP-1 cells by increasing the activation of STAT1 and NF-kappaB through JAK1 and JAK2.",

In this review, we focus on the various roles of CK2 in the mammalian cell, with particular attention on its functions through the stages of the cell cycle and during the decision to undergo cell death. We highlight how these roles are controlled in part through direct transcriptional regulation by CK2, and how the constitutive activity of CK2 can be hijacked in the case of viral infection.

In this study, we investigated the role of human growth hormone (GH) and its receptor (GHR) in human prostate cancer. We first demonstrated mRNA expression of GHR and of its exon 9-truncated isoform (GHR(tr)) in benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate adenocarcinoma patient tissues, as well as in LNCaP, PC3 and DU145 human prostate cancer cell lines. GHR mRNA levels were 80% higher and GHR(tr) only 25% higher, in the carcinoma tissues than in BPH. Both isoforms were also expressed in LNCaP and PC3 cell lines and somewhat less so in DU145 cells. The LNCaP cell GHR protein was further characterized, on the basis of its M(r) of 120kDa, its binding to two different GHR monoclonal antibodies, its high affinity and purely somatogenic binding to (125)I-hGH and its ability to secrete GH binding protein, all characteristic of a functional GHR. Furthermore, GH induced rapid, time- and dose-dependent signaling events in LNCaP cells, including phosphorylation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase, of GHR itself and of STAT5A (JAK2-STAT5A pathway), of p42/p44 MAPK and of Akt/PKB. No effect of GH (72h) could be shown on basal or androgen-induced LNCaP cell proliferation nor on PSA secretion. Interestingly, however, GH caused a rapid (2-12h) though transient striking increase in immunoreactive androgen receptor (AR) levels (< or =5-fold), followed by a slower (24-48h) reduction (< or = 80%), with only modest parallel changes in serine-phosphorylated AR. In conclusion, the GH-induced activation of signaling pathways, its effects on AR protein in LNCaP cells and the isoform-specific regulation of GHR in prostate cancer patient tissues, suggest that GH, most likely in concert with other hormones and growth factors, may play an important role in progression of human prostate cancer.",

By using this antibody, active state of Notch1 came to be detectable with a higher sensitivity than using conventional antibody against Notch1. We found that activated Notch1 was mainly detected in the nuclei of a subpopulation of radial glial cells, the majority of proliferating precursor cells in the ventricular zone (VZ). However, Notch1 activation was not detected in neuronal precursor cells positive for neuronal basic helix-loop-helix proteins or in differentiating neurons in the embryonic forebrain.

We studied temporal cortex from 20 cases of sporadic AD and 20 matched controls. The cellular distribution of ET-1 was assessed immunohistochemically in paraffin sections. PreproET-1 (EDN1) mRNA and ET-1 protein were measured in homogenates of superior temporal cortex by real-time PCR and sandwich ELISA respectively. Cultured SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were incubated with 10 μM oligomeric Aβ42 for 24 h, and ET-1 protein level was measured in cell culture supernatants by sandwich ELISA. Antibody to ET-1 labeled neurons throughout the temporal cortex, and the walls of some cerebral blood vessels. ET-1 mRNA measured in the temporal neocortex was significantly elevated in AD when normalized for expression of GAPDH (p = 0.0256) or the neuronal marker neuron-specific enolase (NSE, p = 0.0001). ET-1 protein was also significantly higher in AD than in control tissue, when adjusted for neuronal content by measurement of NSE (p = 0.0275). ET-1 protein in SH-SY5Y cell supernatant rose 1.7-fold after exposure to 10 μM oligomeric Aβ (p = 0.024).

A change in the activity of keratinocytes is required for reepithelialization to occur, and this is likely to be regulated by the altered expression of effector genes, mediated by transcription factors. The injury itself provides a stimulus for transcription factor activation either directly due to mechanical stress, or via paracrine mechanisms such as the release of growth factors from damaged cells. Members of the activator protein-1 family, in particular c-fos and c-jun, have been the most widely studied wound-induced transcription factors. The signal transduction pathways linking cellular injury to activator protein-1 stimulation appear to involve an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Given that a number of genes involved in the reepithelialization of wounds are regulated by activator protein-1, a distinct role for this transcription factor in reepithelialization is beginning to emerge. This article reviews the evidence for activator protein-1 involvement in reepithelialization, with particular focus on the activation of this transcription factor in response to wounding, the second messenger/kinase pathways involved, and the modulation of downstream genes that have the capacity to regulate keratinocyte function.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine the role of postreceptor calcium signaling pathways in AVP-induced renal vasoconstriction in vivo. Renal blood flow (RBF) was measured by electromagnetic flowmetry in anesthetized, water-loaded, 8-week-old WKY and SHR pretreated with indomethacin to avoid interactions with prostaglandins. AVP was injected into the renal artery to produce a transient 25% to 30% decrease in RBF without affecting arterial pressure. To achieve similar control levels of vasoconstriction, SHR received a lower dose (2 versus 5 ng). Coadministration of nifedipine with AVP produced dose-dependent inhibition of the AVP-induced renal vasoconstriction. Nifedipine exerted maximum inhibition by blocking 30% to 35% of the peak AVP response, indicating the involvement of dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent calcium channels. To evaluate intracellular calcium mobilization, 8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8) or heparin was coadministered with AVP. Each agent produced a dose-dependent inhibition of up to 65% of the maximum blood flow change produced by AVP. The degrees of inhibition produced by maximum effective doses of nifedipine and TMB-8 were additive; the combination blocked up to 85% of the response to AVP. These observations indicate that about one third of the AVP-induced constriction of renal resistance vessels is mediated by voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels responsive to the dihydropyridine nifedipine. Approximately two thirds of the change in vascular tone is due to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated calcium mobilization from intracellular sources sensitive to TMB-8 and heparin. The results suggest that the exaggerated renal vascular reactivity to AVP challenge in SHR is probably not due to a strain difference in postreceptor calcium signal transduction. After AVP receptor stimulation, calcium mobilization and calcium entry signaling pathways participate to similar degrees in WKY and SHR.",

The rat embryonic MHC polypeptide is encoded by exons 3 to 41 and contains 1939 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 223,900. Its amino acid sequence displays the structural features typical for all sarcomeric MHCs, i.e. an amino-terminal \"globular\" head region and a carboxy-terminal alpha-helical rod portion that shows the characteristics of a coiled coil with a superimposed 28-residue repeat pattern interrupted at only four positions by \"skip\" residues. The complex structure of the rat embryonic MHC gene and the conservation of intron locations in this and other MHC genes are indicative of a highly split ancestral sarcomeric MHC gene. Introns in the rat embryonic gene interrupt the coding sequence at the boundaries separating the proteolytic subfragments of the head, but not at the head/rod junction or between the 28-residue repeats present within the rod. Therefore, there is little evidence for exon shuffling and intron-dependent evolution by gene duplication as a mechanism for the generation of the ancestral MHC gene. Rather, intron insertion into a previously non-split ancestral MHC rod gene consisting of multiple tandemly arranged 28-residue-encoding repeats, or convergent evolution of an originally non-repetitive ancestral MHC rod gene must account for the observed structure of the rod-encoding portion of present-day MHC genes.",

NbRae1 was mainly associated with the nuclear envelope during interphase, and NbRae1 deficiency caused accumulation of poly(A) RNA in the nuclei of leaf cells, suggesting defective mRNA export. In the shoot apex, depletion of NbRae1 led to reduced mitotic activities, accompanied by reduced cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity and decreased expression of cyclin B1, CDKB1-1, and histones H3 and H4. The secondary growth of stem vasculature was also inhibited, indicating reduced cambial activities. Differentiated leaf cells of NbRae1-silenced plants exhibited elevated ploidy levels. Immunolabeling in BY-2 cells showed that NbRae1 protein localized to mitotic microtubules and the cell plate-forming zone during mitosis, and recombinant NbRae1 directly bound to microtubules in vitro. Inhibition of NbRae1 expression in BY-2 cells using a beta-estradiol-inducible RNAi system resulted in severe defects in spindle organization and chromosome alignment and segregation, which correlated with delays in cell cycle progression. Together, these results suggest that NbRae1 plays a dual role in mRNA export in interphase and in spindle assembly in mitosis.",

Increasingly, OIS is viewed as an important barrier to tumorgenesis. Surprisingly, relatively little is known about the metabolic changes that accompany and therefore may contribute to OIS. Here, we have performed a metabolomic and bioenergetic analysis of Ras-induced senescence. Profiling approximately 300 different intracellular metabolites reveals that cells that have undergone OIS develop a unique metabolic signature that differs markedly from cells undergoing replicative senescence. A number of lipid metabolites appear uniquely increased in OIS cells, including a marked increase in the level of certain intracellular long chain fatty acids. Functional studies reveal that this alteration in the metabolome reflects substantial changes in overall lipid metabolism. In particular, Ras-induced senescent cells manifest a decline in lipid synthesis and a significant increase in fatty acid oxidation. Increased fatty acid oxidation results in an unexpectedly high rate of basal oxygen consumption in cells that have undergone OIS. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, the rate-limiting step in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, restores a pre-senescent metabolic rate and, surprisingly, selectively inhibits the secretory, pro-inflammatory state that accompanies OIS. Thus, Ras-induced senescent cells demonstrate profound alterations in their metabolic and bioenergetic profiles, particularly with regards to the levels, synthesis and oxidation of free fatty acids. Furthermore, the inflammatory phenotype that accompanies OIS appears to be related to these underlying changes in cellular metabolism.",

They principally function in clathrin-mediated trafficking and membrane deformation. Both epsin and epsinR possess clathrin-binding motifs, but only epsin incorporates a ubiquitin-interaction motif (UIM). To better understand the origins of ENTH-domain proteins and their functions, we performed detailed comparative genomics and phylogenetics on the epsin family. The epsin ENTH-UIM configuration is an architecture restricted to yeast and animals. Further, we undertook functional analysis in Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a divergent organism possessing a single ENTH-domain protein (TbEpsinR). TbEpsinR has a cellular location similar to both epsin and epsinR at plasma membrane clathrin budding sites and endosomal compartments, and associates with clathrin, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation. Knockdown of TbEpsinR leads to a significant decrease in the intracellular pools of multiple surface antigens, without affecting bulk membrane internalization. Therefore, despite lacking the UIM, TbEpsinR maintains a similar role to metazoan epsin in endocytosis and participates as a clathrin-associated adaptor. We suggest that recruitment of a UIM to the ENTH-domain proteins was not essential for participation in endocytosis of ubiquitylated molecules, and is presumably a specific innovation restricted to higher eukaryotes.",

Serological studies have classified the >170 named virus isolates into 18 serogroups, with a few additional as yet ungrouped viruses. Until now, molecular studies and full-length S-segment nucleotide sequences were available for representatives of eight serogroups; in all cases, the S segment encodes two proteins, N (nucleocapsid) and NSs (nonstructural), in overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) that are translated from the same mRNA. The NSs proteins of Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) and California serogroup viruses have been shown to play a role in inhibiting host cell mRNA and protein synthesis, thereby preventing induction of interferon (IFN). We have determined full-length sequences of the S segments of representative viruses in the Anopheles A, Anopheles B, and Tete serogroups, and we report here that these viruses do not show evidence of having an NSs ORF. In addition, these viruses have rather longer N proteins than those in the other serogroups. Most of the naturally occurring viruses that lack the NSs protein behaved like a recombinant BUNV with the NSs gene deleted in that they failed to prevent induction of IFN-beta mRNA. However, Tacaiuma virus (TCMV) in the Anopheles A serogroup inhibited IFN induction in a manner similar to that of wild-type BUNV, suggesting that TCMV has evolved an alternative mechanism, not involving a typical NSs protein, to antagonize the host innate immune response.",

The phenotypic sex of XX/XY-type frogs such as Rana rugosa can be reversed from female to male by injection of testosterone into tadpoles, but little is known about the molecular mechanism of this sex reversal. To elucidate the mechanism of the sex differentiation, we examined the role of P450 aromatase (P450arom), an enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen, during gonadal differentiation of amphibians. In this study, we first cloned a P450arom cDNA homolog of the frog R. rugosa and analyzed by RT-PCR its expression profile in developing and in female-to-male sex-reversed gonads. P450arom expression was observed in the gonad of tadpoles during ovarian differentiation and became much stronger in the developing ovary in which only immature oocytes were observed. However, its expression declined significantly in the ovary of frogs 2 months after metamorphosis, when oocytes were growing; and it was no longer seen in adult ovaries. By RT-PCR, we also examined the expression of P450arom and SF-1 (steroidogenic factor-1; the orphan nuclear receptor) in the female-to-male sex-reversed gonad. The level of P450arom mRNA was high in the ovary, but it declined rapidly after the injection of testosterone. In contrast, no change in the SF-1 (also known as Ad4BP) expression was observed. Moreover, to identify the type(s) of cells expressing P450arom protein, we performed immunostaining with an antibody against frog P450arom protein. Cells giving positive signals were observed around oocytes in the ovary of frogs 1 month after metamorphosis. They were identified as follicle cells by both light and electron microscopy. The results, taken together, indicate that P450arom protein is synthesized in follicle cells and that P450arom is very much involved in ovarian differentiation in R. rugosa.",

The organomercurial lyase (MerB) catalyzes the protonolysis of the carbon-mercury bond resulting in the formation of ionic mercury and a reduced hydrocarbon. The ionic mercury [Hg(II)] is subsequently reduced to the less reactive elemental mercury [Hg(0)] by a specific mercuric reductase (MerA). To better understand MerB's unique enzymatic activity, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structure of the free enzyme. MerB is characterized by a novel protein fold consisting of three noninteracting antiparallel beta-sheets surrounded by six alpha-helices. By comparing the NMR data of free MerB and the MerB/Hg/DTT complex, we identified a set of residues that likely define a Hg/DTT binding site. These residues cluster around two cysteines (C(96) and C(159)) that are crucial to MerB's catalytic activity. A detailed analysis of the structure revealed the presence of an extensive hydrophobic groove adjacent to this Hg/DTT binding site. This extensive hydrophobic groove has the potential to interact with the hydrocarbon moiety of a wide variety of substrates and may explain the broad substrate specificity of MerB.",

To examine the mechanisms by which these apolipoproteins stimulate hPL release, we have studied hPL secretion in response to several synthetic peptide analogs of the amphipathic helical structure of the apolipoproteins. The magnitude of the stimulation of hPL release in response to the analog peptides correlated with the ability to displace apolipoproteins from high density lipoprotein and with other measures of phospholipid binding affinity such as the increase in alpha-helicity and the size of complexes formed between the peptide and phospholipid. The correlation of stimulatory ability and lipid affinity suggests that the action of the apolipoproteins on hPL release may be mediated through an interaction with plasma membrane phospholipids.",

The monomer of the repeat is approximately 180 bp long and is 64% GC rich. Hybridisation of the cloned fragment with size-fractionated large DNA molecules of 3 T. vivax stocks revealed a band in the position expected for minichromosomes, although these were believed absent in T. vivax. This band migrated to the 100-250 kb area of the gel at 4 different pulse frequencies and also hybridised with a telomeric repeat probe from T. brucei. The band is unlikely to be simply degraded material, since it failed to hybridise with another highly repetitive sequence from T. vivax and was consistently present in different trypanosome preparations. We conclude that T. vivax does possess mini-chromosomes, although possibly only 1 or 2 per cell.",

By analyzing a human lung cancer cell line subtraction cDNA library, we have identified and characterized a new member of the human S100 family that we named S100A14 (GenBank acc. no. NM_020672). It encodes a mRNA present in several normal human tissues of epithelial origin, with the highest level of expression in colon. The full-length cDNA is 1067 nt in length, with a coding region predicting a protein of 104 amino acids that is 68% homologous to the S100A13 protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of the human S100A14 and its mouse homolog (identified as GenBank entry) contains two EF-hand Ca2+-binding domains, a myristoylation motif, a glycosylation site, and several potential protein kinase phosphorylation sites. We have mapped this gene to human chromosome 1q21, within a region where at least 15 other S100 genes are tightly clustered. A 3.2-kb genomic fragment containing the entire S100A14 was cloned and sequenced. The gene is split into four exons and three introns spanning a total of 2165 bp of genomic sequence. We examined the intracellular distribution of the epitope-tagged S100A14 protein in two human lung carcinoma cell lines and one immortalized monkey cell line. Pronounced staining was observed in the cytoplasm, suggesting an association with the plasma membrane and in the perinuclear area. We also provide evidence for heterogenic expression of S100A14 in tumors, demonstrating its overexpression in ovary, breast, and uterus tumors and underexpression in kidney, rectum, and colon tumors, a pattern suggesting distinct regulation with potentially important functions in malignant transformation.",

The neuronal processes in neuropils of the medulla externa, medulla interna, medulla terminalis, sinus gland and some nerve fibers in the optic nerve were also recognized. The small cell bodies, approximately 1500 cells, anterior to the medulla externa were stained inconsistently and the neuronal processes were not observed from these cells. Isolation of FLPs from 9000 eyestalks was performed using methanol/acetic/water (90:1:9) extraction.

BLAST searches of the nuclear and mitochondrial genome sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana did not find any obvious homologue of the alpha-proteobacterial-type ftsZ genes. To determine whether mitochondrial division of higher plants depends on a dynamin-like protein, we cloned a cDNA for ADL2b, an Arabidopsis homologue of Dnm1p, and tested its subcellular localization and its dominant-negative effect on mitochondrial division. The fusion protein of green fluorescent protein and ADL2b was observed as punctate structures localized at the tips and at the constriction sites of mitochondria in live plant cells. Cells expressing dominant-negative mutant ADL2b proteins (K56A and T77F) showed a significant fusion, aggregation, and/or tubulation of mitochondria. We propose that mitochondrial division in higher plants is conducted by dynamin-like proteins similar to ADL2b in Arabidopsis. The evolutional points of loss of mitochondrial FtsZ and the functional acquisition of dynamin-like proteins in mitochondrial division are discussed.",

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis separated the 24-kDa protein into four basic isoforms. The most abundant and basic isoform had a high glycine content. In-gel digestion of this basic 24-kDa isoform generated three partial peptide fragments, of which one exhibited homology to the dehydrin protein family. An anti-dehydrin polyclonal antibody cross-reacted with the 24-kDa protein, providing further evidence that this protein is related to dehydrins.
