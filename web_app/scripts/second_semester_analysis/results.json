        "fullAbstract": "Dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) mutations in Pneumocystis jiroveci have been associated epidemiologically with resistance to sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Since P. jiroveci cannot be cultured, inherent drug resistance cannot be measured. This study explores the effects of these mutations in a tractable model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on the sequence conservation between the DHPS enzymes of P. jiroveci and S. cerevisiae, together with the structural conservation of the three known DHPS structures, DHPS substitutions commonly observed in P. jiroveci were reverse engineered into the S. cerevisiae DHPS.

The requirement of computer simulation for the understanding of cellular processes is now widely accepted, and a variety of modelling frameworks have been designed to meet this need. Here, we present a novel public release of the Gene Interaction Network simulation suite (GINsim), a software designed for the qualitative modelling and analysis of regulatory networks. The main functionalities of GINsim are illustrated through the analysis of a logical model for the core network controlling the fission yeast cell cycle. The last public release of GINsim (version 2.3), as well as development versions, can be downloaded from the dedicated website (http://gin.univ-mrs.fr/GINsim/), which further includes a model library, along with detailed tutorial and user manual."

Data for this analysis were from the Third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

The analysis of internal transcribed spacer 1 sequences of ribosomal DNA showed that M. monorchis specimens from Parablennius gattorugine were strongly divergent (12.9%) from specimens of this species collected in Spondyliosoma cantharus and Diplodus puntazzo. This high genetic variation was confirmed by the analysis of morphological structures and morphometrics, which showed that M. monorchis specimens from P. gattorugine can be distinguished from those of S. cantharus and D. puntazzo by several morphological characteristics, including body size, number and distribution of vitelline follicles, testis shape, structure of the cirrus pouch, and number of eggs. Our results show that M. monorchis specimens isolated from P. gattorugine represent a clearly distinct entity from M. monorchis found in the other hosts, which has enabled us to describe a new species, Monorchis blennii n. sp."

        "fullAbstract": "One of the most important issues in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)-based brain functional magnetic resonance imaging is the understanding of the vascular structures that are responsible for the signal changes observed. The T2*-related signal changes observed during variations in susceptibility-induced magnetic field gradients are a function both of non-refocusable mechanisms, such as diffusion, and of refocusable effects such as field inhomogeneities. Conversely, T2-related signal changes are only a function of non-refocusable effects. It has been suggested that T2-weighted images could be less sensitive to blood susceptibility changes in a macrovascular environment than T2*-weighted images and could thus be more accurate in identifying the \"activation\" of the parenchyma rather than \"draining vein\" effects. In this study we use hypoxia and hypercapnia challenges in cats to provide a change in blood deoxyhemoglobin concentration (as a model for classic BOLD changes and not as a model for neuronal activation).

Reduced down-regulation and TNF-receptor shedding by 1,10-phenanthroline was reversed by Zn2+, indicating involvement of a Zn(2+)-dependent metalloprotease. Thus, both serine proteases and metalloproteases are involved in the processing of TNF-receptors."

The structure of the Fyn SH2 domain in complex with a phosphotyrosyl peptide (EPQpYEEIPIYL) was determined by high resolution NMR spectroscopy. The overall structure of the complex is analogous to that of other SH2-peptide complexes. Noteworthy aspects of the <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> are: the BG loop, which contacts the bound peptide, contains a type-I' turn; a capping-box-like interaction is present at the N-terminal end of helix alpha A; cis-trans isomerization of the Val beta G1-Pro beta G2 peptide bond causes conformational heterogeneity of residues near the N and C termini of the domain.

Conservation of helix capping interactions among various SH2 domains is suggestive of a role in protein stabilisation.

The molecular basis of the signalling roles observed for different Src family members is still not well understood; although structures have been determined for the SH2 domains of other Src family molecules, this is the first structure of the Fyn SH2 domain.\n\nThe structure of the Fyn SH2 domain in complex with a phosphotyrosyl peptide (EPQpYEEIPIYL) was determined by high resolution NMR spectroscopy. The overall structure of the complex is analogous to that of other SH2-peptide complexes. Noteworthy aspects of the structure are: the BG loop, which contacts the bound peptide, contains a type-I' turn; a capping-box-like interaction is present at the N-terminal end of helix alpha A; cis-trans isomerization of the Val beta G1-Pro beta G2 peptide bond causes conformational heterogeneity of residues near the N and C termini of the domain.\n\nComparison of the Fyn SH2 domain structure with other structures of SH2 domains highlights several interesting features. Conservation of helix capping interactions among various SH2 domains is suggestive of a role in protein stabilisation. The presence of a type-I' turn in the BG loop, which is dependent on the presence of a glycine residue at position BG3, is indicative of a binding pocket, characteristic of the Src family, SykC and Abl, rather than a binding groove found in PLC-gamma 1C, p85 alpha N and Shc, for example."

        "fullAbstract": "In Compton cameras, the measured scattering angle is associated with an uncertainty which becomes larger as the incident gamma-ray energy decreases. Since this uncertainty degrades the spatial resolution of reconstructed images, Hirasawa and Tomitani (2003 Phys. Med. Biol. 48 1009-26) previously revised their analytical reconstruction algorithm to compensate for it. As the new algorithm improved the spatial resolution in effect, they expected an enhancement of the statistical noise. In this paper, the effect of this compensation has been analysed in view of spatial resolution (the FWHM of the noise-free reconstructed image for a point source distribution), statistical noise (the relative standard deviation of reconstructed images for an isotropic source distribution) and image quality (the roughness of reconstructed images for a phantom). The results describe not only the effect of the compensation, but also the relation between the statistical noise and three parameters, i.e., the incident gamma-ray energy, the spatial resolution and the measured total event numbers, in reconstruction with compensation. This relation should be taken into account for the design of Compton cameras with good quality images, i.e., useful image, output."

In such applications, energy consumption rate and durability are key properties. Here, we developed a valveless micropump system that utilizes a hydrogel as the main actuator, and tested its performance over 6 months of continuous operation. The proposed micropump system, powered by a single 1.5 V commercial battery, expended very little energy (less than 750 μWs per stroke) while pumping 0.9 wt% saline solution under a low voltage (less than 1 V), and remained fully functional after 6 months.

RNA would thus have provided the machinery responsible for the assembly of peptides and the beginning of the <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> world of today.

        "fullAbstract": "It is generally accepted that, during evolution, replicating RNA molecules emerged from pools of random polynucleotides. This prebiotic RNA world was followed by an era of RNA-mediated catalysis of amide-bond formation. RNA would thus have provided the machinery responsible for the assembly of peptides and the beginning of the protein world of today. Naturally occurring ribozymes, which catalyze the cleavage or ligation of oligonucleotide phosphodiester bonds, support the idea that RNA could self-replicate. But was RNA constrained to this path and were RNA-acylated carriers required before RNA could catalyze the formation of amide bonds?\n\nWe have isolated RNA catalysts that are capable of mediating amide-bond synthesis without the need for specifically designed templates to align the substrates, and we have kinetically characterized these catalysts. The rate enhancement observed for these RNA amide synthases exceeds the noncatalyzed amidation rate by a factor of approximately 10(4). In addition, Cu2+ ions caused a change in the affinity of RNA for the substrate rather than being directly involved in amide-bond formation.\n\nThe discovery of these new amide synthases shows how functionally modified nucleic acids can facilitate covalent-bond formation without templating.

        "fullAbstract": "The use of Bayesian algorithm on theophylline pharmacokinetics was studied in asthmatic patients. Each patient received multiple oral doses of the sustained-release theophylline tablet formulation, Theo-Dur, in an amount of 200-400 mg as maintenance dose. Plasma theophylline concentration was measured by a commercially available substrate-labeled fluorescent immunoassay. The data were analyzed by applying a one-compartment model with both zero-order and first-order absorptions based on a nonlinear least squares method, Bayesian algorithm. The present study indicated that the zero-order absorption model provided better estimated pharmacokinetic parameters than the first-order absorption model. It was also found that prediction by the Bayesian method is dependent on number of sampling trials, but the best sampling time is still unknown. This may be due to the small peak-trough plasma concentration differences. From these findings, we suggest that parameters with larger variances should be chosen by considering the interindividual and intraindividual variabilities in order to improve the accuracy of population pharmacokinetics."

The technique was tested on computer simulations, an experimental canine cardiac study using 99mTc-teboroxime, and a patient planar 99mTc-MAG3 renal study. The results show that the technique works well in comparison to the truth in computer simulations and to region of interest (ROI) measurements in the experimental studies."

        "fullAbstract": "Seventeen patients with disseminated cancer were treated with a human leukocyte interferon preparation in doses ranging from 3 X 10(6) to 50 X 10(6) IU daily for 30 days. Doses above 18 X 10(6) IU were considered intolerable in this schedule of administration due to severe fatigue and weight loss. Serum concentrations of interferon were lower than those achieved with either partially pure native or recombinant leukocyte interferon. Three of 17 patients in this study showed minimal evidence of tumor regression. Two patients treated at doses of 18 X 10(6), 36 X 10(6), and 50 X 10(6) IU also received a 5 X 10(6)-IU dose of a second human leukocyte interferon preparation. The latter resulted in less toxicity but similar serum levels. These results suggest that human leukocyte interferons prepared in the same manner may differ significantly in their in vivo biologic properties."

They often derive from breast, lung, and gastroenteric tract adenocarcinomas, very rarely from thyroid carcinoma. Presenting symptoms of thyroid carcinoma metastatic to the pituitary gland are usually chiasmatic with central neurological impairment due to space-occupying expansion in the parasellar region. Hypopituitarism is more often associated with papillary and medullary rather than follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Here we describe a patient with pituitary metastasis from FTC who had hypopituitarism with thyrotropin (TSH) deficiency. A 61-year-old woman, who presented with visual deficits and pain to the right orbit, was found on <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> resonance imaging to have a large mass involving the pituitary gland. She was found to have pituitary insufficiency based on corticotropin-releasing hormone and TSH-releasing hormone testing.

        "fullAbstract": "Pituitary metastases are found in about 1% of all pituitary resections. They often derive from breast, lung, and gastroenteric tract adenocarcinomas, very rarely from thyroid carcinoma. Presenting symptoms of thyroid carcinoma metastatic to the pituitary gland are usually chiasmatic with central neurological impairment due to space-occupying expansion in the parasellar region. Hypopituitarism is more often associated with papillary and medullary rather than follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Here we describe a patient with pituitary metastasis from FTC who had hypopituitarism with thyrotropin (TSH) deficiency.\n\nA 61-year-old woman, who presented with visual deficits and pain to the right orbit, was found on magnetic resonance imaging to have a large mass involving the pituitary gland. She was found to have pituitary insufficiency based on corticotropin-releasing hormone and TSH-releasing hormone testing. Transnasopharyngeal biopsy of the mass revealed metastases from FTC. After total thyroidectomy, which confirmed widely invasive FTC, the patient underwent external beam radiation therapy of the metastases for progressive neurological symptoms and an increase in orbit pain. Since endogenous TSH production was insufficient, we used recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) as preparation for a series of radioiodine treatments. rhTSH administration, followed by 7.4 GBq of (131)I, was repeated seven times over a 10-year period. This was associated with a marked decrease in serum thyroglobulin levels accompanied by substantial clinical improvement, but after 7 years disease progression occurred.\n\nSeven patients with pituitary metastases from FTC have been reported.

Guidelines based on these causes however are poorly suited to developing countries, where treatable infections predominate as causes of HFBL.\n\nTo determine a practical approach to the management of HFBL in developing countries.\n\nCase series.\n\nPatients (n = 32) were managed based on presumed aetiologies of the focal brain lesions, determined by collating information from CT scans, CSF and blood studies, concurrent non-neurological illness and response to treatment.\n\nThe principal presumed cause of HFBL was tuberculosis (69%). The therapeutic response was good in 69% of patients.\n\nIn developing countries, infections are the predominant cause of HFBL, the principal causes being infections that are endemic to the populations being studied. Empiric treatment based on limited investigations should be directed according to the nature of such infections. A modified algorithm is proposed."

This gene contains a 990-bp open reading frame encoding a 329-amino-acid protein, M.HpyI. Sequence analysis revealed that M.HpyI was closely related to CATG-recognizing adenine DNA methyltransferases, including M.NlaIII in N. lactamica. hpyIM was present in all H. pylori strains tested. DNA from wild-type H. pylori strains was resistant to digestion by SphI and NlaIII, which recognize DNA at sites containing CATG, whereas their isogenic hpyIM mutants were susceptible, indicating lack of modification. Overexpression of hpyIM in Escherichia coli rendered DNA from these cells resistant to NlaIII digestion, confirming the role of hpyIM in modifying CATG sites. We conclude that hpyIM encodes a DNA methyltransferase, M.HpyI, that is well conserved among diverse H. pylori strains and that modifies H. pylori genomes at CATG sites."

Peripheral administration of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) increased Fos expression in the SCN, increased energy expenditure, and reduced food intake in WT, but not Npy6r(-/-), mice. Moreover, intraperitoneal (i.p.) PP injection increased hypothalamic Ghrh mRNA expression and serum IGF-1 levels in WT, but not Npy6r(-/-), mice, an effect blocked by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VPAC) receptors antagonism. Thus, PP-initiated signaling through Npy6r in VIP neurons regulates the growth hormone axis and body composition."

Physicians were less likely than nurses to deal with weight problems prophylactically in women with primary breast cancer (p = 0.0009) and they expressed greater concern over scientific validity of psychosocial interventions addressing weight than nurses (p = 0.0008); nurses were more concerned about excessive expectations of patients regarding potential benefits of such interventions (p &<0.0001). Regardless, nurses were more likely than physicians to favour a psychosocial intervention study focused on weight management over drug studies in pre- (p = 0.0006) and postmenopausal women (p = 0.05) with primary breast cancer. Canadian oncology practitioners are aware of the common occurrence of psychosocial distress in women with breast cancer. Physicians and nurses assigned differing priorities to psychosocial interventions in both clinical and research situations."

This study was designed to evaluate this efficacy and possible mechanisms using a novel highly bone metastatic ARCaP(M) cell model. Four prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, PC-3, DU145, and ARCaP(M), were used in this study. These cells were treated with increasing concentrations of silibinin (50, 100, and 200 micromol/L) for different periods of time. After treatment, <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">2</button> viabilities of four prostate cancer cells were compared by MTT assay. Alterations of ARCaP(M) cell invasion, motility and <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> were assessed by cell invasion, motility and wound healing assays. The changes of vimentin expression were observed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining, and the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ARCaP(M) cells showed less sensitivity to the growth inhibition of pharmacological doses of silibinin than LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 cells.

        "fullAbstract": "Silibinin is known to exert growth inhibition and cell death together with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. Whether silibinin could inhibit the invasion, motility and migration of prostate cancer cells remains largely unknown. This study was designed to evaluate this efficacy and possible mechanisms using a novel highly bone metastatic ARCaP(M) cell model.\n\nFour prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, PC-3, DU145, and ARCaP(M), were used in this study. These cells were treated with increasing concentrations of silibinin (50, 100, and 200 micromol/L) for different periods of time. After treatment, cell viabilities of four prostate cancer cells were compared by MTT assay. Alterations of ARCaP(M) cell invasion, motility and migration were assessed by cell invasion, motility and wound healing assays. The changes of vimentin expression were observed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining, and the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\n\nARCaP(M) cells showed less sensitivity to the growth inhibition of pharmacological doses of silibinin than LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 cells. However, silibinin exerted significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effects on the invasion, motility and migration of ARCaP(M) cells. Furthermore, the expression of vimentin and MMP-2, but not MMP-9 or uPA, was down-regulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner after treatment of silibinin.\n\nThis study shows that silibinin could inhibit the invasion, motility and migration of ARCaP(M) cells via down-regulation of vimentin and MMP-2 and therefore may be a promising agent against prostate cancer bone metastasis."

To clarify this discrepancy, we compared the patterns of tyrosine phosphoprotein expression in human <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> cells and primary tumors. Immunoaffinity chromatography, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting were combined with mass spectrometry to determine the phosphoproteomic signatures of 40 matched normal and malignant tissues from patients with <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> or liver cancer. The <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> and abundance of the detected tyrosine phosphoproteins were compared with those of ligand-responsive A431 cells. Patterns of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are similar among normal tissues of the same origin but vary markedly between different tissues. Primary breast tumors exhibit a strikingly homogeneous tyrosine phosphorylation profile, whereas liver cancers display greater phosphoproteomic diversity.

To clarify this discrepancy, we compared the patterns of tyrosine phosphoprotein expression in human cancer cells and primary tumors.\n\nImmunoaffinity chromatography, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting were combined with mass spectrometry to determine the phosphoproteomic signatures of 40 matched normal and malignant tissues from patients with breast or liver cancer. The identities and abundance of the detected tyrosine phosphoproteins were compared with those of ligand-responsive A431 cells.\n\nPatterns of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are similar among normal tissues of the same origin but vary markedly between different tissues. Primary breast tumors exhibit a strikingly homogeneous tyrosine phosphorylation profile, whereas liver cancers display greater phosphoproteomic diversity.

Mutations encoding the corresponding changes in the S. cerevisiae dhps were made in a yeast centromere vector, p414FYC, which encodes the native yeast DHPS as part of a trifunctional protein that also includes the two enzymes upstream of DHPS in the folic acid synthesis pathway, dihydroneopterin aldolase and 2-amino-4-hydroxymethyl dihydropteridine pyrophosphokinase. A yeast strain with dhps deleted was employed as the host strain, and transformants having DHPS activity were recovered. Mutants having both T(597) and P(599) substitutions had a requirement for p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), consistent with resistance being associated with altered substrate binding. These mutants could be adapted for growth in the absence of PABA, which coincided with increased sulfa drug resistance. Upregulated PABA synthesis was thus implicated as a mechanism for sulfa drug resistance for mutants having two DHPS substitutions."

Inherent advantages of the heterokaryon system merit further investigation in the pursuit of directed cloning."

Regarding tumors arising in non-PJS patients, we recently observed that at least one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (LADs) harbor somatic LKB1 gene mutations, supporting a role for LKB1 in the origin of some sporadic tumors. To characterize the pattern of LKB1 mutations in LADs further, we first screened for LKB1 gene <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">1</button> (gene mutations, promoter hypermethylation and homozygous deletions) in 19 LADs and, in agreement with our previous data, five of them (26%) were shown to harbor mutations, all of which gave rise to a truncated protein. Recent reports demonstrate that LKB1 is able to suppress cell growth, but little is known about the specific mechanism by which it functions. To further our understanding of LKB1 function, we analysed global expression in lung primary <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> using cDNA microarrays to identify LKB1-specific variations in gene expression. In all, 34 transcripts, 24 of which corresponded to known genes, differed significantly between tumors with and without LKB1 gene alterations. Among the most <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> findings was deregulation of transcripts involved in signal transduction (e.g. FRAP1/mTOR, ARAF1 and ROCK2), cytoskeleton (e.g. MPP1), transcription <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">2</button> (e.g. MEIS2, ATF5), metabolism of AMP (AMPD3 and APRT) and ubiquitinization (e.g. USP16 and UBE2L3). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR on 15 tumors confirmed the upregulation of the homeobox MEIS2 and of the AMP-metabolism AMPD3 transcripts in LKB1-mutant tumors. In addition, immunohistochemistry in 10 of the lung tumors showed the absence of phosphorylated FRAP1/mTOR protein in LKB1-mutant tumors, indicating that LKB1 mutations do not lead to FRAP1/mTOR protein kinase activation. In conclusion, our results reveal that <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> important factors contribute to LKB1-mediated carcinogenesis in LADs, confirming previous observations and identifying new putative pathways that should help to elucidate the biological role of LKB1.",

Preleukapheresis peripheral blood CD34+ cells correlated significantly with collected CD34+ cells/kg (r = 0.94; p &lt; 0.0001) and with CFU-GM/kg (r = 0.52; p &lt; 0.0001). A value &gt; 4 x 10(4) CD34+ cells/ml was highly predictive for a collection yield &gt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg harvested by a single leukapheresis. Sixty patients were evaluated for hematologic reconstitution and engrafted in a median time of 10 days for WBC &gt; 1.0 x 10(9)/l (range: 7-21 days), 10 days for ANC &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/l (7-20) and 11 days for PLT &gt; 20 x 10(9)/l (7-62). Reinfused CD34+ cells/kg correlated significantly with hematologic engraftment (r = 0.44-0.52 and p &lt; 0.006-0.001) as well as CFU-GM/kg (r = 0.36-0.44 and p &lt; 0.007-0.001). A progenitor cell dose &gt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg or &gt; 8.0 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg led to a significantly faster recovery for WBC, ANC, and PLT when compared with patients receiving &lt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg or &lt; 8.0 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg. We conclude that rapid hematopoietic engraftment after high-dose therapy and PBPC reinfusion correlates well with a progenitor cell dose &gt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg or &gt; 8.0 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg, and that above a preleukapheresis threshold of 4 x 10(4) CD34+ cells/ml a PBPC autograft containing &gt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg can be collected by a single leukapheresis. We suggest that patients recovering from myelosuppression should be monitored for CD34+ cells in serial blood samples to determine the course of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells. This issue will help to define the optimal time point to start apheresis and to predict a PBPC autograft harvested by a single leukapheresis, which will lead to rapid and stable hematopoietic reconstitution following transplantation."

Their endolysin (ply) genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as demonstrated by the <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> lytic phenotype when colonies of <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">2</button> cells were overlaid with a lawn of Listeria cells. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned DNA fragments were determined and the individual enzymes (PLY118, 30.8 kDa; PLY500, 33.4 kDa; PLY511, 36.5 kDa) were shown to have varying degrees of homology within their N-terminal or C-terminal domains. Transcriptional analysis revealed them to be 'late' genes with transcription beginning 15-20 min post-infection. The enzymes were overexpressed and partially purified and their individual specificities examined. When applied exogenously, the lysins induced rapid lysis of Listeria strains from all species but generally did not affect other bacteria. <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> of purified listerial cell walls, PLY511 was characterized as an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28) and shows homology in its N-terminal domain to other enzymes of this type. In contrast, PLY118 and PLY500 were shown to represent a new class of cell wall lytic enzymes which cleave between the L-alanine and D-glutamate residues of listerial peptidoglycan; these were designated as L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidases.

        "fullAbstract": "Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophages A118, A500 and A511 are members of three distinct phage groups with characteristic host ranges. Their endolysin (ply) genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as demonstrated by the conferred lytic phenotype when colonies of recombinant cells were overlaid with a lawn of Listeria cells. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned DNA fragments were determined and the individual enzymes (PLY118, 30.8 kDa; PLY500, 33.4 kDa; PLY511, 36.5 kDa) were shown to have varying degrees of homology within their N-terminal or C-terminal domains. Transcriptional analysis revealed them to be 'late' genes with transcription beginning 15-20 min post-infection. The enzymes were overexpressed and partially purified and their individual specificities examined. When applied exogenously, the lysins induced rapid lysis of Listeria strains from all species but generally did not affect other bacteria. Using hydrolysis of purified listerial cell walls, PLY511 was characterized as an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28) and shows homology in its N-terminal domain to other enzymes of this type. In contrast, PLY118 and PLY500 were shown to represent a new class of cell wall lytic enzymes which cleave between the L-alanine and D-glutamate residues of listerial peptidoglycan; these were designated as L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidases. These two enzymes share homology in the N-terminal domain which we propose determines hydrolytic specificity. Highly conserved holin (hol) gene sequences are present upstream of ply118 and ply500. They encode proteins of structural similarity to the product of phage lambda gene S, and are predicted to be membrane proteins which form pores to allow access of the lysins to their peptidoglycan substrates. This arrangement of conserved holin genes with downstream lysin genes among the siphoviral lysis cassettes explains why the cytoplasmic endolysins alone are not lethal, since they require a specific transport function across the cell membrane."

        "fullAbstract": "Astrocyte swelling is an integral component of cytotoxic brain edema in ischemic injury. While mechanisms underlying astrocyte swelling are likely multifactorial, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are hypothesized to contribute to such swelling. We investigated the protective effects of cinnamon polyphenol extract (CPE) that has anti-oxidant and insulin-potentiating effects on cell swelling and depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) in ischemic injury. C6 glial cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and cell volume determined using the 3-O-methyl-[3H]-glucose method at 90 min after the end of OGD.

Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to analyze the expressions of miR-155 and its potential target genes in paired <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> tissues and adjacent tumor-free tissues and in disease-free liver tissue samples. The in silico predicted target genes of miR-155 were assessed by dual-luciferase reporting assay, real-time RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses. U6 promoters that drive miR-155 precursor overexpression and miR-155 tough decoy knock-down constructs were used to study its <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> on cell proliferation in <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">1</button> and on tumor formation in nude mice. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated a gradual ascension of miR-155 expression in cirrhotic liver tissues and in HCC tumor tissues compared with low expression levels in normal liver tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-155 in HepG2 cells enhanced its tumorigenesis, whereas depletion of the endogenous miR-155 reversed these tumorigenic properties. Ectopic expression of sex-determining region Y box 6 (SOX6) was able to reverse the growth-promoting property of miR-155. Concordantly, the results demonstrated for the first time that SOX6 is a direct target of miR-155. Further analysis revealed that SOX6 reduced cell growth by up-regulating p21waf1/cip1 expression in a p53-dependent manner. In addition, a decline in p21waf1/cip1 expression caused by miR-155 could be reversed by SOX6 expression. The current <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> indicated that SOX6 is a novel target of miR-155 and that miR-155 enhances liver cell tumorigenesis at least in part through the novel miR-155/SOX6/p21waf1/cip1 axis.

In this study, the authors investigated the tumorigenic mechanism of this oncomir in the development of HCC.\n\nQuantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to analyze the expressions of miR-155 and its potential target genes in paired tumor tissues and adjacent tumor-free tissues and in disease-free liver tissue samples. The in silico predicted target genes of miR-155 were assessed by dual-luciferase reporting assay, real-time RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses. U6 promoters that drive miR-155 precursor overexpression and miR-155 tough decoy knock-down constructs were used to study its affects on cell proliferation in vitro and on tumor formation in nude mice.\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR demonstrated a gradual ascension of miR-155 expression in cirrhotic liver tissues and in HCC tumor tissues compared with low expression levels in normal liver tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-155 in HepG2 cells enhanced its tumorigenesis, whereas depletion of the endogenous miR-155 reversed these tumorigenic properties. Ectopic expression of sex-determining region Y box 6 (SOX6) was able to reverse the growth-promoting property of miR-155. Concordantly, the results demonstrated for the first time that SOX6 is a direct target of miR-155. Further analysis revealed that SOX6 reduced cell growth by up-regulating p21waf1/cip1 expression in a p53-dependent manner. In addition, a decline in p21waf1/cip1 expression caused by miR-155 could be reversed by SOX6 expression.\n\nThe current data indicated that SOX6 is a novel target of miR-155 and that miR-155 enhances liver cell tumorigenesis at least in part through the novel miR-155/SOX6/p21waf1/cip1 axis. These findings suggest that miR-155 may be a potential target for HCC treatment."

A transformed P. pastoris clone, containing five copies of the lipase/acyltransferase gene, was selected for the production of recombinant enzyme. The fed-batch culture supernatant contained 5.8 gl(-1) (weighted) of almost pure recombinant lipase/acyltransferase displaying the same catalytic behavior as the original enzyme."

Fifty-nine patients with acromegaly who were undergoing surgical treatment were studied randomly before surgery; 37 patients were untreated, and 22 were treated with OCT at doses ranging 150-600 micrograms/day for 3-6 months. At study entry, untreated and OCT-treated <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> had similar circulating GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), glucose, and cholesterol levels as well as prevalence of overt diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ECG abnormalities. In untreated and OCT-treated patients, respectively, radiological imaging documented microadenoma in 0 and 1, intrasellar macroadenoma in 10 and 6, intra- and suprasellar macroadenoma in 18 and 11, invasive macroadenoma in 9 and 4 patients. Before surgery, serum GH and IGF-I levels significantly decreased in the 22 OCT-treated acromegalics, and in 5 of them, a significant shrinkage was documented. ECG abnormalities disappeared in 7 of 11 (63.6%) OCT-treated patients. In 3 of the 7 patients with diabetes mellitus, treatment with OCT together with low carbohydrate intake normalized blood glucose levels, whereas in 2 patients, insulin could be replaced by oral antidiabetics, and in 2 patients, the insulin dose was reduced. Presurgical blood glucose, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as systolic (145.2 +/- 3.4 vs. 132.9 +/- 2.5 mm Hg; P < 0.01) and diastolic (94.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 84.3 +/- 1.6 mm Hg; P < 0.001) blood pressure levels were significantly higher in untreated than in OCT-treated patients. Two weeks after surgery, circulating GH and IGF-I levels were normalized in 11 untreated (29.7%) and 12 OCT-treated (54.5%) patients (P < 0.005, by chi 2 test). Macroscopically, no difference was found between untreated and OCT-treated adenomas, whereas at pathology, a significant increases in cellular atypia (31.6% vs. 19.2%; P < 0.05) was found in OCT-treated adenomas.

Our study indicates that miR-125b has a significantly promoting effect on chemoresistance of C13* cells and up-regulation of miR-125b expression contributes to cisplatin resistance through suppression of Bak1 expression.

Moreover, Bak1 was a direct target of miR-125b, and down-regulation of Bak1 suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis and led to an increased resistance to cisplatin. Our study indicates that miR-125b has a significantly promoting effect on chemoresistance of C13* cells and up-regulation of miR-125b expression contributes to cisplatin resistance through suppression of Bak1 expression. This finding has important implications in the development of targeted therapeutics for overcoming cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer."

One patient had a gastric corpus apudocarcinoma found prospectively with hypergastrinemia which required excision of the tumor. One patient had acromegaly with hypergastrinemia and antral gastrinosis treated by pituitary irradiation,  One patient had the antral or intermediary type of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome with moderate hypergastrinemia, duodenal ulcer and antral gastrinosis, treated by vagotomy and antrectomy. One patient had hyperparathyroidism with antral gastrinosis, treated by parathyroidectomy. One patient had malignant Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and developed associated thyroid parafollicular cell hyperplasia and parathyroid chief cell hyperplasia, treated by total gastrectomy and multiple endocrine excisions. These investigative observations demonstrate ectopic loci and associated hyperplasias which support the concept of migration and bizarre potentiality of polypeptide-secreting cells of the foregut."

The studies show that thyroid hormones a) influence LDL-cholesterol by an action on the catabolism of LDL-independent of alterations in synthesis, catabolism, absorption, or excretion: b) stimulate synthesis of cholesterol; and c) affect biliary lipid metabolism in large part by influencing energy balance and cholesterol synthesis."

        "fullAbstract": "Clinical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain is typically performed in the standard three orthogonal planes of the magnet, with little regard to head positioning. Multiple sequences with different imaging parameters are performed, and gray-scale images are obtained and displayed separately. The authors have implemented, and currently advocate, the routine acquisition of coregistered transverse images after roll, yaw, and pitch correction to Talairach space. Talairach, anterior commissure (AC)-posterior commissure (PC) referenced, stereotactic space has been widely embraced by the neuroscience community. This standardization should lead to more reproducible and readily interpretable MR examinations. A method is described to obtain direct AC-PC referenced (Talairach space) MR images. Sample protocols are provided. Coregistered T1-weighted, T1-weighted with contrast material administration, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), MR angiography, fractional anisotropy, and functional MR imaging sequences are presented, depicting a wide range of imaging parameters applied to normal brain anatomy in Talairach space.

Finally, brief descriptions are provided for several emerging chemical entities that show promise as potential adjunctive agents to sensitize cells to the effects of IR.\n\nUsing DNA damaging agents or kinase inhibitors to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of IR has significantly improved patient outcomes. However, several advancements in instrumentation as well as new molecular targets are changing the landscape of applying IR as a therapeutic modality."

Inflammation may influence the relationship between depression and <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">2</button> disease. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between symptoms of depression and high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) in an obese clinical population. We also sought to determine whether this relationship was different in men and women, given prior reports of a <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> effect. Symptoms of depression and hs-CRP were measured in 390 participants enrolled in a weight loss intervention trial that was delivered in a primary care setting. Symptoms of depression were evaluated with the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), in which a score ≥ 10 is consistent with major depression. A total of 58 (15.2%) participants reported a PHQ-8 score ≥ 10.

        "fullAbstract": "Depression has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) has also been identified as an independent predictor of short- and long-term cardiovascular disease events. Inflammation may influence the relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the association between symptoms of depression and high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) in an obese clinical population. We also sought to determine whether this relationship was different in men and women, given prior reports of a gender effect.\n\nSymptoms of depression and hs-CRP were measured in 390 participants enrolled in a weight loss intervention trial that was delivered in a primary care setting. Symptoms of depression were evaluated with the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), in which a score ≥ 10 is consistent with major depression.\n\nA total of 58 (15.2%) participants reported a PHQ-8 score ≥ 10. The median (interquartile range) hs-CRP concentration was significantly higher in participants with symptoms consistent with major depression (7.7 (4.2-13) mg l(-1)) compared with those without depression (5.1 (3-9.7) mg l(-1); P&<.01).

One hundred fourteen nontraumatic chest pain patients (median delay from onset of chest pain to hospital admission, 3 h; range, 0.33 to 22): 26 Q-wave and 19 non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions, 49 patients with unstable angina pectoris, and 20 patients with chest pain caused by other diseases.

By classification and regression trees, a decision tree for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was developed.\n\nEmergency room of a Department of Internal Medicine (University Hospital).\n\nOne hundred fourteen nontraumatic chest pain patients (median delay from onset of chest pain to hospital admission, 3 h; range, 0.33 to 22): 26 Q-wave and 19 non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions, 49 patients with unstable angina pectoris, and 20 patients with chest pain caused by other diseases.\n\nOf each parameter taken by itself, the ECG was tendentiously most informative (areas under receiver operating characteristic plots: 0.87 +/- 0.04 [ECG], 0.80 +/- 0.08 [myoglobin], 0.80 +/- 0.04 [creatine kinase MB mass], 0.77 +/- 0.04 [creatine kinase activity], 0.69 +/- 0.06 [clinical symptoms] 0.67 +/- 0.06 [creatine kinase MB activity], 0.67 +/- 0.05 [troponin T]). In patients presenting 3 h or less after the onset of chest pain, ECG signs of acute transmural myocardial ischemia were the best discriminator between patients with and without myocardial infarction. In patients presenting more than 3 h, however, creatine kinase MB mass concentrations (discriminator value, 6.7 micrograms/L) were superior to the ECG, clinical symptoms, and all other biochemical markers tested. This algorithm for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction was superior to each parameter by itself and was characterized by 0.91 sensitivity, a 0.90 specificity, a 0.90 positive and negative predictive value, and a 0.90 efficiency.\n\nWe found an algorithm that could accurately separate the myocardial infarction patients from the others on admission to the emergency department. Therefore, this classifier could be a valuable diagnostic aid for rapid confirmation of a suspected myocardial infarction."

        "fullAbstract": "Tomosynthesis is a 3-dimensional mammography technique that generates thin slices separated one to the other by typically 1 mm from source data sets. The relatively high image noise in these thin slices raises the value of 1-cm thick slices computed from the set of reconstructed slices for image interpretation. In an initial evaluation, we investigated the potential of different algorithms for generating thick slices from tomosynthesis source data (maximum intensity projection-MIP; average algorithm-AV, and image generation by means of a new algorithm, so-called softMip). The three postprocessing techniques were evaluated using a homogeneous phantom with one textured slab with a total thickness of about 5 cm in which two 0.5-cm-thick slabs contained objects to simulate microcalcifications, spiculated masses, and round masses. The phantom was examined by tomosynthesis (GE Healthcare). Microcalcifications were simulated by inclusion of calcium particles of four different sizes. The slabs containing the inclusions were examined in two different configurations: adjacent to each other and close to the detector and with the two slabs separated by two 1-cm thick breast equivalent material slabs. The reconstructed tomosynthesis slices were postprocessed using MIP, AV, and softMip to generate 1-cm thick slices with a lower noise level.

We report that PEL cell lines have constitutive active <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">1</button> NF-kappa B pathway and demonstrate high-level expression of NF-kappa B2/p100 precursor and its processed subunit p52. To elucidate the mechanism of activation of the alternative NF-kappa B pathway in PEL cells, we have investigated the role of KSHV-encoded viral Fas-associated death domain-like IL- beta 1-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (vFLIP) K13. We demonstrate that stable expression of K13, but not other FLIPs, in a variety of cell lines constitutively up-regulates p100/NF-kappa B2 expression and leads to its processing into the p52 subunit. K13-induced up-regulation and processing of p100 critically depends on the I kappa B kinase (IKK)alpha/IKK1 subunit of the IKK complex, whereas IKK beta/IKK2, receptor-interacting protein, and NF-kappa B-inducing kinase are dispensable for this process. Silencing of endogenous K13 expression by siRNA inhibits p100 processing and cellular proliferation. Our <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> demonstrate for the <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> time, to our knowledge, that KSHV vFLIP K13 is required for the growth and proliferation of PEL cells and alternative NF-kappa B pathway plays a key <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">2</button> in this process.

Indirect ImmunoFluorescence (IIF) method with HEp-2 cells provides the major screening method to detect ANA for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. Fluorescence patterns at present are usually examined laboriously by experienced physicians through manually inspecting the slides with the help of a microscope, which usually suffers from inter-observer variability that limits its reproducibility. Previous researches only provided simple segmentation methods and criterions for cell segmentation and recognition, but a fully automatic framework for the segmentation and recognition of HEp-2 cells had never been reported before. This study proposes a method based on the watershed algorithm to automatically detect the HEp-2 cells with different patterns. The experimental results show that the segmentation performance of the proposed method is satisfactory when evaluated with percent volume overlap (PVO: 89%). The classification performance using a SVM classifier designed based on the features calculated from the segmented cells achieves an average accuracy of 96.90%, which outperforms other methods presented in previous studies. The proposed method can be used to develop a computer-aided system to assist the physicians in the diagnosis of auto-immune diseases."

At dose level III dose-limiting nausea and emesis were observed in one patient despite maximal antiemetic support. Importantly, neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were not observed at the JM-216 dose levels examined in this study. This observation is consistent with results seen with single agent JM-216.\n\nFor JM-216 and UFT administered at 20 mg/day and 300 mg/day over 14 days, nausea and emesis were observed as the principal dose-limiting toxicities. These doses are considerably below the maximally tolerated doses of single agent JM-216 and UFT. Shorter administration schedules should be explored in an attempt to increase the dose intensity and minimize the toxicity of this combination oral regimen."
