Previous studies have reported that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulate mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) production via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in human airway cells. Moreover, this production was shown to depend on the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), which is increased in COPD patients' serum. In the present study we investigated the signaling pathway mediating LPS-stimulated secretion and activation of MMP-9, and the regulatory effects of this pathway on the production of MUC5AC in the human airway cells NCI-H292. Using specific inhibitors, we found that LPS-stimulated cells secreted and activated MMP-9 via EGFR. Our results also indicate that signaling events downstream of EGFR involved PI3K-dependent activation of Rac1, which mediated the NADPH-generated reactive oxygen species responsible for MMP-9 secretion and activation. Finally, we observed that EGFR/PI3K/Rac1/NADPH/ROS/MMP-9 regulate MUC5AC production in LPS-challenged NCI-H292 cells.",

Cells isolated from metastatic colon carcinoma (SW620) produce greater amounts of pericellular HA than cells isolated from a primary tumor (SW480). Inhibition of hyaluronan synthases (HAS) by transfection with antisense cDNA decreases HA production. Because adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) is required for invasion and metastasis, we hypothesized that pericellular HA mediates adhesion to ECM proteins such as laminin, collagen, and fibronectin and that inhibition of HA production or removal of HA by digestion with hyaluronidase would impair adhesion.\n\nSW480, SW620, and antisense transfectants (SW620 cells transfected with vector alone, antisense HAS2, antisense HAS3, and both antisense HAS2 and HAS3) were assessed for adhesion to laminin, Type 1 collagen, or fibronectin-coated plates. To confirm that adhesion was mediated by HA, cells were treated with or without hyaluronidase prior to the assays.\n\nMetastatic SW620 cells adhered well to laminin; SW480 cells demonstrated 46% less adhesion (P < 0.05; Student's t test). SW620 cell adhesion to Type 1 collagen and fibronectin was >50% less than adhesion to laminin. Inhibition of HAS2 and/or HAS3 or pretreatment with hyaluronidase significantly decreased adhesion of SW620 cells to laminin (P < 0.05), suggesting that adhesion was dependent upon pericellular HA.\n\nMetastatic SW620 cells that produce large amounts of pericellular HA adhered well to laminin. Inhibition of HAS2 and/or HAS3 expression, or hyaluronidase digestion of pericellular HA significantly inhibited adhesion. These data suggest that HA promotes adhesion to laminin and may thereby facilitate invasion of the basement membrane and metastasis in colon carcinoma.",

Factors that regulate AbetaQ22 levels in the central nervous system (CNS) are largely unknown. By using ventriculo-cisternal perfusion technique in guinea pigs, we demonstrated that clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid and transport from the CNS to blood of [(125)I]-AbetaQ22 (1 nM) were reduced by 36% and 52%, respectively, in comparison to the wild type Abeta(1-40) peptide. In contrast to significant uptake and transport of Abeta(1-40) across the brain capillaries and leptomeningeal vessels, AbetaQ22 was not taken up at these CNS vascular transport sites, which was associated with its 53% greater accumulation in the brain. The CNS clearance of Abeta(1-40) was half-saturated at 23.6 nM; AbetaQ22 had about 6.8-fold less affinity for the CNS efflux transporters and its elimination relied mainly on transport across the choroid plexus. Thus, the Dutch mutation impairs elimination of Abeta from brain by reducing its rapid transport across the blood-brain barrier and the vascular drainage pathways, which in turn may result in accumulation of the peptide around the blood vessels and in brain.",

DNA and RNA were isolated from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) colon tissues. DNA was tested for methylation using methylation-specific polymerase chain reation (PCR) and bisulfite sequencing. RNA was used for mRNA quantification using qRT-PCR. The RKO cell line was treated with 5-Aza-dC and SAHA. RKO cells were also stably transfected with a CHD5-expressing vector. The transcriptional activity was studied in the 1 kb upstream region of the CHD5 promoter using the dual reporter assay. We performed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion assays using the RKO cell line.\n\nIn most adenoma samples, CHD5 expression was not detected in contrast to normal tissues. In RKO cells, CHD5 silencing was associated with DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications. CHD5 expression was restored after treatment with 5-Aza-dC and SAHA. CHD5 reactivation reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The reporter assay indicated that the main regulatory region of the CHD5 promoter is encompassed in the -489 to -823 region with important transcriptional regulatory sites (TCF/LEF, SP1, and AP-2).\n\nThe CHD5 gene is repressed in all types of adenomas, either epigenetically or by chromosomal deletion. CHD5 activity is regulated by DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications. CHD5 likely acts as a tumor-suppressor gene in early colorectal carcinogenesis.",

Western blotting analysis and qRT-PCR confirmed that Bcl-2 is inhibited by miR-34a overexpression.

As such, it should exhibit the classic hallmarks of nonlinearity, multistability, and \"nondiffusivity\" (large coherent fluctuations). Surprisingly, at least at the very large scale of neocortical dynamics, there is little empirical evidence to support this, and hence most computational and methodological frameworks for healthy brain activity have proceeded very reasonably from a purely linear and diffusive perspective. By studying the temporal fluctuations of power in human resting-state electroencephalograms, we show that, although these simple properties may hold true at some temporal scales, there is strong evidence for bistability and nondiffusivity in key brain rhythms. Bistability is manifest as nonclassic bursting between high- and low-amplitude modes in the alpha rhythm. Nondiffusivity is expressed through the irregular appearance of high amplitude \"extremal\" events in beta rhythm power fluctuations. The statistical robustness of these observations was confirmed through comparison with Gaussian-rendered phase-randomized surrogate data. Although there is a good conceptual framework for understanding bistability in cortical dynamics, the implications of the extremal events challenge existing frameworks for understanding large-scale brain systems.",

Eighty-one previously untreated patients were enrolled in a multicenter phase-III clinical trial. All patients had a noncontrast MR, a Sinerem MR, and surgery within a period of 15 days. The MR exams were analyzed both on site and by two independent radiologists (centralized readers). Correlation between histology and imaging was done per lymph node groups, and per individual lymph nodes when the short axis was > or = 10 mm. For individual lymph nodes, Sinerem MR showed a high sensitivity (> or = 88%) and specificity (> or = 77%). For lymph node groups, the sensitivity was > or = 59% and specificity > or = 81%. False-positive results were partially due to inflammatory nodes; false-negative results from the presence of undetected micrometastases. Errors of interpretation were also related to motion and/or susceptibility artifacts and problems of zone assignment. Sinerem MR had a negative predictive value (NPV) > or = 90% and a positive predictive value (PPV) > or = 51%. The specificity and PPV of Sinerem MR were better than those of precontrast MR. Precontrast MR showed an unexpectedly high sensitivity and NPV which were not increased with Sinerem MR. The potential contribution of Sinerem MR still remains limited by technical problems regarding motion and susceptibility artifacts and spatial resolution.

Despite evidence suggesting a role of frontal cortex in seizure generation, group studies have not detected consistent AS-related changes in this region. We hypothesized that only a subgroup may show frontal cortical activation.\n\nWe studied 13 subjects with AS during EEG-fMRI to classify the different individual patterns of frontal cortical activation associated with AS.\n\nBased upon visual inspection of surface-rendered activation maps we identified 2 subgroups that could be distinguished by the activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). One group of patients (n = 7) showed a primarily positive signal change (DLPFC-POS), whereas the other group (n = 6) showed a primarily negative signal change (DLFPC-NEG). When the DLPFC-POS group was compared to the DLPFC-NEG group, time-course analysis revealed a larger positive blood oxygenation level-dependent deflection following onset of the AS in cortical and subcortical areas beyond the DLPFC. This suggests a basic biological difference between these groups.\n\nThese observations suggest that there may be at least 2 mechanisms underpinning AS in individuals with absence epilepsy.

Coronal magnetic resonance (MR) images of patients with AD often demonstrate outward rotation of the hippocampus that is altered from a long horizontal elliptical to a long vertical elliptical shape. Such rotation may be related to the disease process of AD.\n\nTo determine whether hippocampal rotation is associated with AD, we investigated MR images from 11 patients with AD and 11 normal controls, measuring the hippocampal angle (HA) and the volume of the left hippocampus on coronal T(1)-weighted MR images. The HA is the angle between a horizontal line orthogonal to the falx cerebri and the uncal sulcus line between the deepest point of the uncal sulcus and the point nearest to the side of the ambient cistern in the uncal gyrus facing the uncal sulcus. The HA is measured on the most rostral slice in which the uncal sulcus can be identified and increases with hippocampal rotation.\n\nWe found correlation between the HA and standardized hippocampal volume in the AD group, but not in controls.\n\nHippocampal rotation is a new marker associated with the pathology of AD.",

Previous studies with DNA repair-deficient mutants and DNA repair inhibitors strongly indicate that the enhancement results from a G2 deficiency(ies) in DNA repair. We report here biochemical evidence for a DNA repair deficiency that correlates with the cytogenetic studies. In the alkaline elution technique, after a pulse label with radioactive thymidine in the presence of 3-acetylaminobenzamide (a G2-phase blocker) and X irradiation, DNA from tumor or cancer-prone cells elutes more rapidly during the postirradiation period than that from normal cells. These results indicate that the DNA of tumor and cancer-prone cells either repairs more slowly or acquires more breaks than that of normal cells; breaks can accumulate during incomplete or deficient repair processes. The kinetic difference between normal and tumor or cancer-prone cells in DNA strand-break repair reaches a maximum within 2 h, and this maximum corresponds to the kinetic difference in chromatid aberration incidence following X irradiation reported previously. These findings support the concept that cells showing enhanced G2 chromatid radiosensitivity are deficient in DNA repair. The findings could also lead to a biochemical assay for cancer susceptibility.",

As such, there are many promising new combination radio-gene therapy approaches being developed and assessed in pre-clinical and clinical studies for several different malignancies. Combination of such modalities aims to increase the therapeutic index, giving rise to increased tumor cell killing with a simultaneous reduction in normal cell toxicity. Restricted delivery and/or targeting modalities combined with conformal radiotherapy regimes could provide significant local control of tumors, impeding their development into metastatic disease, which poses a greater challenge for palliative and curative treatments.

Resistance to oxazaphosphorines is poorly understood, although increased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity may be a significant factor. Although both compounds share a common metabolic pathway, 4-hydroxylation of ifosfamide occurs at a slower rate and to a lesser extent than that of cyclophosphamide. This difference significantly alters the toxicity profile of ifosfamide. Leukopenia is the dose-limiting toxicity of cyclophosphamide, and neurotoxicity is the dose-limiting toxicity of ifosfamide when preventive measures are taken to reduce urotoxicity.

Clinicopathological factors and postoperative outcomes were compared between high and low subgroups of MCs or Tregs. Compared to low denstiy, higher peritumoral MCs were associated with poorer clinical outcomes, and independently related to elevated 5-year recurrence incidence (54.1%vs 39.2%, P = 0.026). High-dense MCs were especially related to increased probability of early recurrence (within 2 years) (P = 0.004). We also found that peritumoral Tregs were positively correlated with MCs in density (r = 0.353, P < 0.001) and reversely related to HCC outcomes. Notably, MCs in combination with Tregs displayed better prognostic performances than MCs alone (area under curve [AUC](survival) = 0.629 vs 0.589, AUC(recurrence) = 0.632 vs 0.591). Moreover, MCs were positively correlated to alanine aminotransferase, a serum inflammatory marker (P = 0.014).

Crucial to accomplishing the strategy was the establishment of End-of-Life Networks within health care planning regions. The networks were instrumental in developing end-of-life care service delivery models in the various regions, bringing key stakeholders together toward a common vision, and building strong collaborations across providers and settings. Cancer Care Ontario, an organization dedicated to improving cancer care at the regional and provincial levels, also leads improvements in palliative care through the implementation of a palliative strategy for cancer patients aimed at improved measurement of quality indicators, increased use of evidence and standards, and increased efficiency and access to care. A regional network of organizations in Southeastern Ontario created a quality improvement project, the Palliative Care Integration Project (PCIP), which disseminated common symptom assessment tools, collaborative care plans, and evidence-based guidelines across the continuum of care.

Here we report the establishment of an SM RT-PCR system of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and the analysis of gene expression in human cancer tissues and cell lines. We also demonstrate that the SM RT-PCR system, which was developed for cDNA expression analysis, could also be used successfully for more exquisite analysis of copy number changes in genomic DNA. We observed a decrease in band intensity of HRAS, TP73, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B genes in most of the breast and prostate cancer cell lines examined. The decrease in copy number of HRAS proto-oncogene leads us to suspect the presence of tumor suppressor genes in the vicinity of this gene on chromosome 11p15.5.",

However, it is unknown how various acquisition parameters that determine k-space sampling affect the accuracy of motion correction in PROPELLER and Turboprop MRI. The goal of this work was to evaluate the accuracy of motion correction in both techniques, to identify an optimal rotation correction approach, and determine acquisition strategies for optimal motion correction. It was demonstrated that blades with multiple lines allow more accurate estimation of motion than blades with fewer lines. Also, it was shown that Turboprop MRI is less sensitive to motion than PROPELLER. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the number of blades does not significantly affect motion correction.

This makes it even more important to simultaneously investigate the adequacy of these models-in absolute terms, against the data, rather than relative to the performance of other models-but no such procedure has been formally discussed when the likelihood is intractable. We provide a statistical interpretation to current developments in likelihood-free Bayesian inference that explicitly accounts for discrepancies between the model and the data, termed Approximate Bayesian Computation under model uncertainty (ABCmicro). We augment the likelihood of the data with unknown error terms that correspond to freely chosen checking functions, and provide Monte Carlo strategies for sampling from the associated joint posterior distribution without the need of evaluating the likelihood. We discuss the benefit of incorporating model diagnostics within an ABC framework, and demonstrate how this method diagnoses model mismatch and guides model refinement by contrasting three qualitative models of protein network evolution to the protein interaction datasets of Helicobacter pylori and Treponema pallidum. Our results make a number of model deficiencies explicit, and suggest that the T. pallidum network topology is inconsistent with evolution dominated by link turnover or lateral gene transfer alone.",

The analog of ray diagrams, but for electrons, are constructed to help the visualization of the process of compressing electron packets. It is shown that such temporal lenses not only compensate for electron pulse broadening due to velocity dispersion but also allow compression of the packets to durations much shorter than their initial widths.

Hemodynamic parameters were recorded and blood samples were drawn for determination of clevidipine plasma concentrations during infusion and after discontinuation of clevidipine. The concentration-response relation was analyzed using logistic regression, and pharmacokinetic models were applied to the data using population analysis.\n\nThere were significant decreases in mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance at doses greater than or equal to 1.37 microg. kg-1. min-1. There were no changes in heart rate, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, or cardiac index with increasing doses of clevidipine. The clevidipine C50 value for a 10% or greater decrease in mean arterial pressure was 9.7 microg/l and for a 20% or greater decrease in mean arterial pressure was 26.3 microg/l. The pharmacokinetics of clevidipine were best described with a three-compartment model with a volume of distribution of 32.4 l and clearance of 4.3 l/min.

Jets of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, however, are opposed by flows entering the atria. Despite their low velocities, these counterflows may have considerable momentum that can limit jet penetration. The purpose of this study was to address the hypothesis that such counterflow fields influence regurgitant jet size. Steady flow was driven through 2.4- and 5.1-mm-diameter circular orifices at 2 to 6 m/s. At a constant orifice velocity and flow rate, the velocity of a uniform counterflow field was varied from 5 to 30 cm/s. Jet dimensions were measured by both fluorescent dye visualization and Doppler color flow mapping. The results showed that despite its relatively low velocities, counterflow dramatically curtailed jet length and area. Jet dimensions were functions of the ratio of jet to counterflow momentum. Thus, atrial inflow may participate in determining jet size and can alter the relation between jet size and lesion severity in mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.",

The goal of this study was to develop a physiologically based algorithm capable of mimicking the biological system to control multiple joints in the lower extremities for producing over-ground walking. The algorithm used state-based models of the step cycle each of which produced different stimulation patterns. Two configurations were implemented to restore over-ground walking in five adult anaesthetized cats using intramuscular stimulation (IMS) of the main hip, knee and ankle flexor and extensor muscles in the hind limbs. An open loop controller relied only on intrinsic timing while a hybrid-CPG controller added sensory feedback from force plates (representing limb loading), and accelerometers and gyroscopes (representing limb position). Stimulation applied to hind limb muscles caused extension or flexion in the hips, knees and ankles. A total of 113 walking trials were obtained across all experiments. Of these, 74 were successful in which the cats traversed 75% of the 3.5 m over-ground walkway. In these trials, the average peak step length decreased from 24.9 ± 8.4 to 21.8 ± 7.5 (normalized units) and the median number of steps per trial increased from 7 (Q1 = 6, Q3 = 9) to 9 (8, 11) with the hybrid-CPG controller. Moreover, within these trials, the hybrid-CPG controller produced more successful steps (step length ≤ 20 cm; ground reaction force ≥ 12.5% body weight) than the open loop controller: 372 of 544 steps (68%) versus 65 of 134 steps (49%), respectively. This supports our previous preliminary findings, and affirms that physiologically based hybrid-CPG approaches produce more successful stepping than open loop controllers. The algorithm provides the foundation for a neural prosthetic controller and a framework to implement more detailed control of locomotion in the future.",

Many research applications for solvation modeling, such as fragment-based drug design, require algorithms that are both accurate and computationally inexpensive. We have developed a calculation of solvation free energy which runs fast enough for interactive applications, functions for a wide range of chemical species relevant to simulating molecules for biological and pharmaceutical applications, and is readily extended when data for new species becomes available. We have also demonstrated that the incorporation of ab initio data provides necessary access to sufficient reference data for a broad range of chemical features. Our empirical model, including an electrostatic term and a different set of atom types, demonstrates improvements over a previous, solvent-accessible surface area-only model by Wang et al. when fit to identical training sets (mean absolute error of 0.513 kcal/mol versus the 0.538 kcal/mol reported by Wang). The incorporation of ab initio solvation free energies provides a significant increase in the breadth of chemical features for which the model can be applied by introducing classes of compounds for which little or no experimental data is available. The increased breadth and the speed of this solvation model allow for conformational minimization, conformational search, and ligand binding free energy calculations that economically account for the complex interplay of bonded, nonbonded, and solvation free energies as conformations with varying solvent-accessible surfaces are sampled.",

Available guidelines and algorithms are wound type-specific, not evidence-based, and many lack clearly described relative and absolute contraindications and stop criteria. The purpose of this research was to: (1) develop evidence-based algorithms for the safe use of NPWT in adults with acute and chronic wounds by nonwound expert clinicians, and (2) obtain face validity for the algorithms. Using NPWT meta-analyses and systematic reviews (n = 10), NPWT guidelines of care (n = 12), general evidence-based guidelines of wound care (n = 11), and a framework for transitioning between moisture-retentive and NPWT care (n = 1), a set of three algorithms was developed. Literature-based validity for each of the 39 discreet algorithm steps/decision points was obtained by reviewing best available evidence from systematic literature reviews (n = 331 publications) and abstraction of all NPWT-relevant publications (n = 182) using the patient-oriented Strength of Recommendation (SORT) taxonomy. Of the 182 NPWT studies abstracted, 25 met criteria for level 1 and 2 evidence but only one general assessment step had both level 1 evidence and an \"A\" strength of recommendation. Next, an Institutional Review Board-approved, cross-sectional mixed methods survey design face validation pilot study was conducted to solicit comments on, and rate the validity of, the 51 discreet algorithm-related statements, including the 39 decisions/steps. Twelve (12) of the 15 invited interdisciplinary wound experts agreed to participate. The overall algorithm content validity index (CVI) was high (0.96 out of 1). Helpful design suggestions to ensure safe use were made, and participants suggested an examination of commonly used wound definitions in follow-up studies. Results of the literature-based face validation confirm that the evidence base for using NPWT remains limited, especially for chronic wounds, and that safety guidance may be affected by the fact that evidence-based ratings cannot accurately reflect relative or absolute product contraindications because they simply are not included in clinical studies. These findings, the positive expert panel comments, and the high CVI confirm the need for an algorithm with explicit NPWT start-and-stop criteria and suggest that follow-up content and construct validation of these algorithms is warranted.",

Surface curvatures have been proposed extensively for segmentation and labeling of image and surface regions based on their appearance and shape. The surface curvature is an invariant that can be exploited for reliable detection of geometric features. In this paper, we investigate the potentiality of the algorithm termed mean-shift (MS), as applied to a non-linear combination of the minimum and maximum curvatures of a surface. We exploited a sensitivity analysis of the algorithm parameters across increasing surface resolutions. Results obtained with femur and pelvic bone surface data, reconstructed from cadaveric CT scans, demonstrated that the information content derived by the MS non-linear curvature overcomes both the mean and the Gaussian curvatures and the original non-linear curvature. By applying a threshold-based clustering algorithm to the curvature distribution, we found that the number of clusters yielded by the MS non-linear curvature is significantly lower (by a factor of up to 6) than that obtained by using the original non-linear curvature. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the use of surface curvature for automatic shape analysis.",

Thus, this study indicates that the major determinants of the persistently low frequency of OC use in the Northern Italian population are social rather than reproductive or medical factors.  These findings have important implications for epidemiological research on OCs and disease in this population, and underline the importance of selection and screening of OC users on the basis of knowledge of medical factors and lifestyle habits.",

Reaction of 2 with triethyl phosphite followed by deprotection with trimethylsilyl bromide led to the omega-phosphonylalkyluracil derivatives. These products could be further phosphorylated by converting them into their imidazolides and subsequent treatment with diphosphate yielding the corresponding UTP analogs. Nucleoside analogs with an oxygen atom in the 2'-position, which are more similar to the natural ribosides, were synthesized from silylated uracil and trimethylsilyl iodide-treated 1,3-dioxolane, or 1,3-dioxane, respectively, and subsequently phosphorylated by standard procedures. The nucleotide analogs were investigated in a functional assay at NG108-15 cells, a neuroblastomaxglioma hybrid cell line which expresses the UTP- and ATP-activated nucleotide receptor subtype P2Y(2). The acyclic nucleotide analogs were generally weaker ligands than UTP, and-in contrast to UTP-they were antagonistic. The most potent compound was diphosphoric 5-(2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl)pentylphosphonic anhydride (5c) with an IC(50) value of 92microM showing that the replacement of the alpha-phosphate by phosphonate, which leads to enhanced stability, was well tolerated.",

This assay utilizes the technique of salt solubilization to isolate nuclear receptors and employs standard saturation analysis for T3 and T4 to determine maximal binding capacity (MBC) and equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd). We have determined that 11 normal subjects had a MBC for T3 of 1.20 +/- 0.20 pmol/mg DNA (+/- SE) and a Kd of 3.4 +/- 0.2 X 10(-10) M; the T4 MBC was 8.44 +/- 1.22 pmol/mg DNA and the Kd was 2.7 +/- 0.3 X 10(-10) M. Hypothyroid patients had a mean T3 MBC of 7.32 +/- 2.28 pmol/mg DNA and a mean T4 MBC of 40.04 +/- 21.36 pmol/mg DNA (P less than 0.05 compared to normal). Obese subjects (n = 12) had a basal fed MBC that was 0.66 +/- 0.13 pmol/mg DNA for T3 (P less than 0.05 compared to normal) and was 3.58 +/- 0.56 pmol/mg DNA for T4 (P less than 0.01 compared to normal). During fasting, the average T3 MBC increased to 1.43 +/- 0.31 pmol/mg DNA and the average T4 MBC increased to 9.63 +/- 2.46 pmol/mg DNA, values that are both significantly higher than those in the fed period; the dissociation constants were unaltered in obese subjects (compared to normals) in fed and fasting states. Gel filtration with 0.5 M agarose was employed to ascertain if the physicochemical properties of the solubilized mononuclear human cell receptor were similar to those previously observed in rat and human liver and kidney receptors. The elution profile obtained was similar to that reported earlier. The major binding activity has an estimated Stokes radius of 35 A and a molecular weight ratio of approximately 50,000 daltons. These studies indicate that: 1) high affinity T3 and T4 receptors exist in human mononuclear cells and have properties similar to those for T3 and T4 described previously in rat liver; 2) T3 and T4 receptor number tends to increase in hypothyroid subjects and tend to be lower in obese patients than in normal weight control subjects; 3) fasting is associated with an increase in both T3 and T4 MBC; and 4) despite their apparent physicochemical similarity, T3 receptors in rat liver and human mononuclear cells may be regulated differently, at least during fasting since hepatic T3 receptors decrease in the fasted rat. Collectively, these observations support the concept that human white cell T3 nuclear receptor binding is capable of rapid fluctuations, suggesting a mechanism for homeostatic regulation of T3 action.",

A digit coding test was performed before, and at the end of the treatment period and a third 15 days later. The improvement of performance from the first to the third test (learning effect) was significantly better in the placebo group than in the B6 treated groups. This could be attributed to memorization of skills. Trial II was performed in obese patients starting a low calorie diet in whom vitamins are routinely prescribed. Performance in a work recognition test and in a visual retention test was lower for the group receiving 1 g of pyridoxine a day. Thus, high doses of oral pyridoxine are likely to impair memorization in man. Disturbances of neuro-transmitter metabolism such as increase of GABA production might explain the effect.

In an effort to study the correlations between DNA methylation, nucleosome remodeling, and gene reactivation, we investigate the integrated epigenetic events that worked coordinately to reprogram the methylated and closed promoters back to permissive chromatin configurations after 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. The ChIP results indicate that H2A.Z is deposited at promoter regions by the Snf2-related CBP activator protein (SRCAP) complex following DNA demethylation. According to our genome-wide expression and DNA methylation profiles, we find that the complete re-activation of silenced genes requires the insertion of the histone variant H2A.Z, which facilitates the acquisition of regions fully depleted of nucleosome as demonstrated by NOMe-seq (Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome-sequencing) assay. In contrast, SRCAP-mediated H2A.Z deposition is not required for maintaining the active status of constitutively expressed genes. By combining Hpa II digestion with NOMe-seq assay, we show that hemimethylated DNA, which is generated following drug incorporation, remains occupied by nucleosomes. Our data highlight H2A.Z as a novel and essential factor involved in 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine-induced gene reactivation. Furthermore, we elucidate that chromatin remodeling translates the demethylation ability of DNMT inhibitors to their downstream efficacies, suggesting future therapeutic implications for chromatin remodelers.",

    "originalString": "This manuscript describes how the permeability of pulmonary artery microvascular endothelial cell (RPMEC) monolayer is elevated by hypoxia and the role played by HSP27 phosphorylation. p38 MAP kinase activation leading to HSP27 phosphorylation was previously shown by our laboratory to alter the actin cytoskeleton and tethering properties of RPMEC. This effect was independent of hypoxia-induced contractility which was ROCK-dependent rather than HSP27-dependent. Results described here show that increased HSP27 phosphorylation not only does not underlie hypoxia-induced permeability, but may actually augment the endothelial barrier. Hypoxia causes gap formation between RPMEC and increases MLC2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of MYPT1, which inhibits MLC2 phosphatase, is also increased in hypoxia. In addition, FAK phosphorylation, which alters focal adhesion signaling, is increased in hypoxia. Overexpressing phosphomimicking HSP27 (pmHSP27), which induces significant actin stress fiber formation, surprisingly renders RPMEC resistant to hypoxia- or TGFbeta-induced permeability. siRNA against pmHSP27 reverses the increased actin stress fiber formation in pmHSP27-overexpressing cells, and disrupting actin stress fibers in pmHSP27-overexpressing RPMEC renders them more susceptible to hypoxia. Finally, hypoxia-induced gap formation, as well as phosphorylation of MLC2, MYPT1 and FAK are almost abolished by overexpressing pmHSP27 in RPMEC. These effects of pmHSP27 overexpression might represent decreased cytoskeletal plasticity and increased tethering which counteracts permeability-inducing contractility. Thus hypoxia activates two pathways one leading to contractility and increased permeability, the other leading to actin stress fibers, stronger adhesion, and reduced permeability. Altering HSP27 phosphorylation, which tips the balance towards decreased permeability, might be targeted in managing endothelial barrier dysfunction.",

Although CXCL10 could be induced by IFN-gamma depending on cell type, the mechanisms regulating CXCL10 production following treatment with combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha have not been adequately elucidated in human monocytes. In this study, we showed that TNF-alpha had more potential than IFN-gamma to induce CXCL10 production in THP-1 monocytes. Furthermore, IFN-gamma synergistically enhanced the production of CXCL10 in parallel with the activation of NF-kappaB in TNF-alpha-stimulated THP-1 cells. Blockage of STAT1 or NF-kappaB suppressed CXCL10 production. JAKs inhibitors suppressed IFN-gamma plus TNF-alpha-induced production of CXCL10 in parallel with activation of STAT1 and NF-kappaB, while ERK inhibitor suppressed production of CXCL10 as well as activation of NF-kappaB, but not that of STAT1. IFN-gamma-induced phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2, whereas TNF-alpha induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Interestingly, IFN-gamma alone had no effect on phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha, whereas it significantly promoted TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha. These results suggest that TNF-alpha induces CXCL10 production by activating NF-kappaB through ERK and that IFN-gamma induces CXCL10 production by increasing the activation of STAT1 through JAKs pathways. Of note, TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB may be the primary pathway contributing to CXCL10 production in THP-1 cells. IFN-gamma potentiates TNF-alpha-induced CXCL10 production in THP-1 cells by increasing the activation of STAT1 and NF-kappaB through JAK1 and JAK2.",

This interaction is important for IRS-1 phosphorylation. Studies using the yeast two-hybrid system and sequence identity analysis between IRS-1 and IRS-2 have identified two putative elements, the PTB and SAIN domains, between amino acids 108 and 516 of IRS-1 that are sufficient for receptor interaction. However, their precise function in mediating insulin's bioeffects is not understood. We expressed the PTB and SAIN domains of IRS-1 in HIRcB fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes utilizing replication-defective adenoviral infection to investigate their role in insulin signalling. In both cell types, overexpression of either the PTB or the SAIN protein caused a significant decrease in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc proteins, IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) enzymatic activity, p70s6k activation, and p44 and p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. However, epidermal growth factor-induced Shc and MAPK phosphorylation was unaffected by the overexpressed proteins. These findings were associated with a complete inhibition of insulin-stimulated cell cycle progression. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PTB or SAIN expression extinguished IRS-1 phosphorylation with a corresponding 90% decrease in IRS-1-associated PI 3-K activity. p70s6k is a downstream target of PI 3-K, and insulin-stimulated p70s6k was inhibited by PTB or SAIN expression. Interestingly, overexpression of either PTB or SAIN protein did not affect insulin-induced AKT activation or insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose transport, even though both of these bioeffects are inhibited by wortmannin. Thus, interference with the IRS-1-IR interaction inhibits insulin-stimulated IRS-1 and Shc phosphorylation, PI 3-K enzymatic activity, p70s6k activation, MAPK phosphorylation and cell cycle progression. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, interference with the IR-IRS-1 interaction did not cause inhibition of insulin-stimulated AKT activation or glucose transport. These results indicate a bifurcation or subcompartmentalization of the insulin signalling pathway whereby some targets of PI 3-K (i.e., p70s6k) are dependent on IRS-1-associated PI 3-K and other targets (i.e., AKT and glucose transport) are not. IR-IRS-1 interaction is not essential for insulin's effect on glucose transport, and alternate, or redundant, pathways exist in these cells.",

Both subtypes of imidazoline binding sites are present on either crude membrane fractions, purified plasma membranes, and mitochondrial membranes of the adrenal medulla. Although the density of I1- and I2-sites on the plasma membrane fraction is almost equal, on the mitochondrial membrane fraction Bmax of I2-binding sites was double that of the I1-binding number. An increase in intracellular calcium signal could be obtained during stimulation of chromaffin cells by various I1- and I2-receptor modulators.

Digoxin was used as a representative DLC for inhibition of Na,K-ATPase. The activation of Src kinase was measured as the degree of its autophosphorylation. It was observed that in addition to digoxin, Src activation was dependent on concentrations of other specific ligands of Na,K-ATPase: Na(+), K(+), vanadate, ATP and ADP. The magnitude of the steady-state ATPase activity therefore seemed to affect Src activation. Further experiments with an ATP regenerating system showed that the ATP/ADP ratio determined the extent of Src activation. Thus, our model system which represents the proposed very proximal part of the Na,K-ATPase-Src signaling cascade, shows that Src kinase activity is regulated by both ATP and ADP concentrations and provides no evidence for a direct interaction between Na,K-ATPase and Src.",

Moreover, we show that trichothecene-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation is dependent on Src tyrosine kinase activity. In addition, gene silencing of c-Cbl, a negative autophagy-related regulator of c-Src, resulted in enhanced secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in response to trichothecene mycotoxin stimulation in human macrophages.

The rat embryonic MHC polypeptide is encoded by exons 3 to 41 and contains 1939 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 223,900. Its amino acid sequence displays the structural features typical for all sarcomeric MHCs, i.e. an amino-terminal \"globular\" head region and a carboxy-terminal alpha-helical rod portion that shows the characteristics of a coiled coil with a superimposed 28-residue repeat pattern interrupted at only four positions by \"skip\" residues. The complex structure of the rat embryonic MHC gene and the conservation of intron locations in this and other MHC genes are indicative of a highly split ancestral sarcomeric MHC gene. Introns in the rat embryonic gene interrupt the coding sequence at the boundaries separating the proteolytic subfragments of the head, but not at the head/rod junction or between the 28-residue repeats present within the rod. Therefore, there is little evidence for exon shuffling and intron-dependent evolution by gene duplication as a mechanism for the generation of the ancestral MHC gene. Rather, intron insertion into a previously non-split ancestral MHC rod gene consisting of multiple tandemly arranged 28-residue-encoding repeats, or convergent evolution of an originally non-repetitive ancestral MHC rod gene must account for the observed structure of the rod-encoding portion of present-day MHC genes.",

    "originalString": "Rae1 performs multiple functions in animal systems, acting in interphase as an mRNA export factor and during mitosis as a mitotic checkpoint and spindle assembly regulator. In this study we characterized multiple functions of Rae1 in plants. Virus-induced gene silencing of Nicotiana benthamiana Rae1, NbRae1, which encodes a protein with four WD40 repeats, resulted in growth arrest and abnormal leaf development. NbRae1 was mainly associated with the nuclear envelope during interphase, and NbRae1 deficiency caused accumulation of poly(A) RNA in the nuclei of leaf cells, suggesting defective mRNA export. In the shoot apex, depletion of NbRae1 led to reduced mitotic activities, accompanied by reduced cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity and decreased expression of cyclin B1, CDKB1-1, and histones H3 and H4. The secondary growth of stem vasculature was also inhibited, indicating reduced cambial activities. Differentiated leaf cells of NbRae1-silenced plants exhibited elevated ploidy levels. Immunolabeling in BY-2 cells showed that NbRae1 protein localized to mitotic microtubules and the cell plate-forming zone during mitosis, and recombinant NbRae1 directly bound to microtubules in vitro. Inhibition of NbRae1 expression in BY-2 cells using a beta-estradiol-inducible RNAi system resulted in severe defects in spindle organization and chromosome alignment and segregation, which correlated with delays in cell cycle progression. Together, these results suggest that NbRae1 plays a dual role in mRNA export in interphase and in spindle assembly in mitosis.",

This study was to observe inhibitory effect of MT1-MMP antisense nucleotide on proliferation and invasive potential of human highly metastatic ovarian carcinoma cell line SW626.\n\nReverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify MT1-MMP cDNA fragments with 2 different restriction sites at its 5c-end. RT-PCR products were cloned into plasmid pcDNA3.1 in antisense direction. The recombinant pMMP14as was transfected into SW626 cells. Changes of cell proliferation, MT1-MMP protein expression, activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and cell invasion ability were detected by MTT assay, Western blot, optimized gelatin zymography, and matrigel in vitro invasion assay, respectively.\n\nAntisense MT1-MMP eukaryotic expression vector pMMP14as was constructed successfully. After 48-h transfection with pMMP14as, proliferation of pMMP14as-transfected SW626 cells was significantly lower than that of control cells. Compared with control cells, the expression of endogenous MT1-MMP protein in pMMP14as-transfected cells was decreased with a inhibition rate of 65.8%. The activation of proMMP-2 was remarkably inhibited, and the mean invasive cell percentage was (63.3+/-5.8)% in pMMP14as-transfected cells, which was far less than (97.6+/-7.5)% in control cells (P< 0.05).\n\nBoth cell proliferation and invasive potential of SW626 cells were inhibited effectively by antisense MT1-MMP, suggesting that MT1-MMP may be a proper molecular target of anti-invasion therapy for human ovarian cancer.",

    "originalString": "Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domains occur in proteins of either the epsin or epsin-related (epsinR) form. They principally function in clathrin-mediated trafficking and membrane deformation. Both epsin and epsinR possess clathrin-binding motifs, but only epsin incorporates a ubiquitin-interaction motif (UIM). To better understand the origins of ENTH-domain proteins and their functions, we performed detailed comparative genomics and phylogenetics on the epsin family. The epsin ENTH-UIM configuration is an architecture restricted to yeast and animals. Further, we undertook functional analysis in Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a divergent organism possessing a single ENTH-domain protein (TbEpsinR). TbEpsinR has a cellular location similar to both epsin and epsinR at plasma membrane clathrin budding sites and endosomal compartments, and associates with clathrin, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation. Knockdown of TbEpsinR leads to a significant decrease in the intracellular pools of multiple surface antigens, without affecting bulk membrane internalization. Therefore, despite lacking the UIM, TbEpsinR maintains a similar role to metazoan epsin in endocytosis and participates as a clathrin-associated adaptor. We suggest that recruitment of a UIM to the ENTH-domain proteins was not essential for participation in endocytosis of ubiquitylated molecules, and is presumably a specific innovation restricted to higher eukaryotes.",

We characterized P. falciparum histone PTMs using advanced mass spectrometry driven proteomics. Acid-extracted proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE, in-gel trypsin digested, and analyzed by reversed-phase LC-MS/MS. Through the combination of Q-TOF and LTQ-FT mass spectrometry we obtained high mass accuracy of both precursor and fragment ions, which is a prerequisite for high-confidence identifications of multisite peptide modifications. We utilize MS/MS fragment marker ions to validate the identification of histone modifications and report the m/z 143 ion as a novel MS/MS marker ion for monomethylated lysine. We identified all known P. falciparum histones and mapped 44 different modifications, providing a comprehensive view of epigenetic marks in the parasite. Interestingly, the parasite exhibits a histone modification pattern that is distinct from its human host. A general preponderance for modifications associated with a transcriptionally permissive state was observed. Additionally, a novel differentiation in the modification pattern of the two histone H2B variants (H2B and H2Bv) was observed, suggesting divergent functions of the two H2B variants in the parasite. Taken together, our results provide a first comprehensive map of histone modifications in P. falciparum and highlight the utility of tandem MS for detailed analysis of peptides containing multiple PTMs.",

Herein, a click peptide (26-O-acyl isoAbeta1-42 (E22Delta)) of a new mutant Abeta1-42 (E22Delta) was synthesized. The mutant click peptide was more water-soluble than Abeta1-42 (E22Delta). Moreover it quantitatively converted to the native peptide under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C). CD analyses showed a conformational change from a random-coil structure of the click peptide to a beta-sheet structure of the in situ produced Abeta1-42 (E22Delta).

However, the exact mechanism of FTF regulation is unknown. In this study, the role of a two-component regulatory system (covRS) in FTF expression was investigated. A CovR-defective mutant of S. mutans NG8 was constructed by homologous recombination. By use of immunoblotting, the mutant was shown to overexpress FTF in the absence of sucrose, while the wild type and a covRS-complemented mutant showed sucrose-inducible FTF expression. Reverse transcription-PCR showed that the ftf transcript levels were increased in the covR mutant, suggesting regulation at the transcriptional level. The covR mutant was also found to overproduce extracellular carbohydrate, and this phenotype was reversed by covRS complementation. Paper chromatographic studies and chemical tests showed that the extracellular carbohydrate contained glucose and glucuronic acid but not fructose. These results suggest that the extracellular carbohydrate was not fructan. The production of a glucose- and glucuronic acid-containing extracellular carbohydrate has not been reported for S. mutans and may be considered novel. In conclusion, the results indicate that the expression of FTF and a glucose- and glucuronic acid-containing carbohydrate was negatively regulated by the covRS two-component regulatory system in S. mutans.",

    "originalString": "Mutation of Arg(423) at the N-domain of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase resulted in a large decrease of both TNP-ATP and ATP binding. Thus, this residue, localized outside the binding pocket, seems to play a key role in supporting the proper structure and shape of the binding site. In addition, mutation of Glu(472) also caused a large decrease of both TNP-ATP and ATP binding. On the basis of our computer model, we hypothesized that a hydrogen bond between Arg(423) and Glu(472) supports the connection of two opposite halves of the ATP-binding pocket. To verify this hypothesis, we have also prepared the construct containing both these mutations. Binding of neither TNP-ATP nor ATP to this double mutant differed from binding to any of the single mutants. This strongly supported the existence of the hydrogen bond between Arg(423) and Glu(472). Similarly, the conserved residue Pro(489) seems to be substantial for the proper interaction of the third and fourth beta-strands of the N-domain, which both contain residues that take part in ATP binding. Mutation of Asp(443) affected only ATP, but not TNP-ATP, binding, suggesting that these ligands adopt different positions in the nucleotide-binding pocket. On the basis of a recently published crystal structure [Håkansson, K. O. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 332, 1175-1182], we improved our model and computed the interaction of these two ligands with the N-domain. This model is in good agreement with all previously reported spectroscopic data and revealed that Asp(443) forms a hydrogen bond with the NH(2) group of the adenosine moiety of ATP, but not TNP-ATP.",

A size difference of approximately 500 base pairs (bp) was demonstrated between the alleles of this and several other RFLPs that mapped to the same 300-bp region near the transmembrane coding region of the cDNA beta-chain, thus suggesting the presence of an insertion in this region that could affect insulin-receptor function. Genomic DNA fragments containing this RFLP were cloned from an individual heterozygous for the putative insertion, and the differing fragments of the two alleles were sequenced. The presence of a 400-bp insertion was thus confirmed and was demonstrated to be entirely within an intron. No significant coding-region differences from published cDNA sequences were detected in four exons sequenced from the region of the insertional allele. The sequenced regions included multiple Alu repeat sequences. The RFLP was unusual in that the larger allele consisted of an additional Alu repeat sequence that included a new Pst I site. Because the nature and location of the insertion did not suggest a role in insulin-receptor function, the association of this RFLP with NIDDM and hyperinsulinemia was reexamined in a small sample of Whites. No association could be demonstrated, and the insertion also failed to segregate with NIDDM in five White pedigrees.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Identical sequences were obtained for cDNAs constructed with mRNA from four different sources, lung and liver of untreated rabbits and liver from rabbits treated once or four times with phenobarbital. Isozyme 5 shows significant sequence identity only with rabbit P-450p2 (54%) and rat P-450LA omega (53%), which places it in a previously unrecognized cytochrome P-450 gene subfamily (IVB). A cDNA library was also constructed from rat pulmonary mRNA and screened with cDNA encoding rabbit isozyme 5. The amino acid sequence derived from a positive clone was compared with that of rabbit isozyme 5 and found to be 87% identical, significantly greater than observed between other similar forms of cytochrome P-450 from rabbit and rat. Alignment of the primary structures of rabbit isozyme 5 (506 residues), rat isozyme 5 (511 residues), rabbit P-450p2, and rat P-450LA omega shows 43% structural identity and a common 16-residue peptide near position 300 that is unique to these forms of cytochrome P-450. Analysis of mRNA from lung and liver of rabbit, rat, guinea pig, and hamster indicates that species and tissue differences in the expression and induction of isozyme 5 are likely regulated at the level of transcription. These differences fall into one of the following three groups: first, expression in lung and liver and induction in liver by phenobarbital (rabbit); second, expression in lung and liver but no hepatic induction (hamster); and third, expression in lung and little or no expression in liver regardless of treatment (rat and guinea pig).",

The A1PI/Z gene exhibits two point mutations which specify amino acid substitutions, Val-213 to Ala and Glu-342 to Lys. The functional importance of these substitutions in A1PI deficiency was investigated by studying the secretion of A1PI synthesized in COS cells transfected with A1PI genes altered by site-directed mutagenesis. This model system correctly duplicates the secretion defect seen in individuals homozygous for the A1PI/Z allele and shows that the substitution of Lys for Glu-342 alone causes defective secretion of A1PI. The substitution of Lys for Glu-342 eliminates the possibility for a salt bridge between residues 342 and 290, which may decrease the conformational stability of the molecule and thus account for the secretion defect. However, when we removed the potential to form a salt bridge from the wild-type inhibitor by changing Lys-290 to Glu (A1PI/SB-290Glu), secretion was not reduced to the 19% of normal level seen for A1PI/Z-342Lys; in fact, 75% of normal secretion was observed. When the potential for salt bridge formation was returned to A1PI/Z-342Lys by changing Lys-290 to Glu, only 46% of normal secretion was seen. These data indicate that the amino acid substitution at position 342, rather than the potential to form the 290-342 salt bridge, is the critical alteration leading to the defect in A1PI secretion.",

    "originalString": "Protein engineering experiments and Phi(F)-value analysis of SH3 domains reveal that their transition state ensemble (TSE) is conformationally restricted, i.e. the fluctuations in the transition state (TS) structures are small. In the TS of src SH3 and alpha-spectrin SH3 the distal loop and the associated hairpin are fully structured, while the rest of the protein is relatively disordered. If native structure predominantly determines the folding mechanism, the findings for SH3 folds raise the question: What are the features of the native topology that determine the nature of the TSE? We propose that the presence of stiff loops in the native state that connect local structural elements (such as the distal hairpin in SH3 domains) conformationally restricts TSE. We validate this hypothesis using the simulations of a \"control\" system (16 residue beta-hairpin forming C-terminal fragment of the GBl protein) and its variants. In these fragments the role of bending rigidity in determining the nature of the TSE can be directly examined without complications arising from interactions with the rest of the protein. The TSE structures in the beta-hairpins are determined computationally using cluster analysis and limited Phi(F)-value analysis. Both techniques prove that the conformational heterogeneity decreases as the bending rigidity of the loop increases. To extend this finding to SH3 domains a measure of bending rigidity based on loop curvature, which utilizes native structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), is introduced. Using this measure we show that, with few exceptions, the ordering of stiffness of the distal, n-src, and RT loops in the 29 PDB structures of SH3 domains is conserved. Combining the simulation results for beta-hairpins and the analysis of PDB structures for SH3 domains, we propose that the stiff distal loop restricts the conformational fluctuations in the TSE. We also predict that constraining the distal loop to be preformed in the denatured ensemble should not alter the nature of TSE. On the other hand, if the amino and carboxy terminals are cross-linked to form a circular polypeptide chain, the pathways and TSs are altered. These contrasting scenarios are illustrated using simulations of cross-linked WT beta-hairpin fragments. Computations of bending rigidities for immunoglobulin-like domain proteins reveal no clear separation in the stiffness of their loops. In the beta-sandwich proteins, which have large fractions of non-local native contacts, the nature of the TSE cannot be apparently determined using purely local structural characteristics. Nevertheless, the measure of loop stiffness still provides qualitative predictions of the ordered regions in the TSE of Ig27 and TenFn3.",
