Previous studies have reported that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulate mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) production via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in human airway cells. Moreover, this production was shown to depend on the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), which is increased in COPD patients' serum. In the present study we investigated the signaling pathway mediating LPS-stimulated secretion and activation of MMP-9, and the regulatory effects of this pathway on the production of MUC5AC in the human airway cells NCI-H292. Using specific inhibitors, we found that LPS-stimulated cells secreted and activated MMP-9 via EGFR. Our results also indicate that signaling events downstream of EGFR involved PI3K-dependent activation of Rac1, which mediated the NADPH-generated reactive oxygen species responsible for MMP-9 secretion and activation. Finally, we observed that EGFR/PI3K/Rac1/NADPH/ROS/MMP-9 regulate MUC5AC production in LPS-challenged NCI-H292 cells.",

The levels of sEng increased in sera obtained from preeclampsia. The factors that increase the sEng in preeclampsia have not been known well. To investigate the factors that may increase sEng in preeclampsia, we examined the effect of preeclampsia sera on the production of sEng from human choriocarcinoma (JEG-3) cells.\n\nSerum samples were taken from women with normal pregnancy and from those with preeclampsia. JEG-3 cells were cultured with serum for 24 hrs, and the sEng levels in supernatants and expression of sEng and Hemo oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA in cells were measured.\n\nThe addition of preeclampsia sera into JEG-3 cells led to increased release of sEng and expression of Eng mRNA. Preeclampsia sera inhibited the expression of HO-1 mRNA in JEG-3 cells.\n\nThe results suggest that preeclampsia sera may increase the protein production of sEng and mRNA expression of Eng from JEG-3 cells like trophoblast without hypoxia and that in addition to hypoxia, preeclampsia sera may play a role of high level of serum sEng in preeclampsia patients. Decreased HO-1 activity may relate to increased sEng release.",

TGF-β is a potent inducer of EMT, and increased TGF-β signaling in cancer cells is thought to drive cancer-associated EMT. Here, we examine the physiological requirement for mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) in cells undergoing EMT. TGF-β rapidly induces mTORC2 kinase activity in cells undergoing EMT, and controls epithelial cell progression through EMT. By regulating EMT-associated cytoskeletal changes and gene expression, mTORC2 is required for cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, inactivation of mTORC2 prevents cancer cell dissemination in vivo. Our results suggest that the mTORC2 pathway is an essential downstream branch of TGF-β signaling, and represents a responsive target to inhibit EMT and prevent cancer cell invasion and metastasis.",

    "originalString": "The tumour suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is mutated in most colorectal cancer cases, leading to the synthesis of truncated APC products and the stabilization of β-catenin. Truncated APC is almost always retained in tumour cells, suggesting that it serves an essential function. Here, RNA interference has been used to down-regulate truncated APC in several colorectal cancer cell lines expressing truncated APCs of different lengths, thereby performing an analysis covering most of the mutation cluster region (MCR). The consequences on proliferation in vitro, tumour formation in vivo and the level and transcriptional activity of β-catenin have been investigated. Down-regulation of truncated APC results in an inhibition of tumour cell population expansion in vitro in 6 cell lines out of 6 and inhibition of tumour outgrowth in vivo as analysed in one of these cell lines, HT29. This provides a general rule explaining the retention of truncated APC in colorectal tumours and defines it as a suitable target for therapeutic intervention. Actually, we also show that it is possible to design a shRNA that targets a specific truncated isoform of APC without altering the expression of wild-type APC. Down-regulation of truncated APC is accompanied by an up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in 5 out of 6 cell lines. Surprisingly, the increased signalling is associated in most cases (4 out of 5) with an up-regulation of β-catenin levels, indicating that truncated APC can still modulate wnt signalling through controlling the level of β-catenin. This control can happen even when truncated APC lacks the β-catenin inhibiting domain (CiD) involved in targeting β-catenin for proteasomal degradation. Thus, truncated APC is an essential component of colorectal cancer cells, required for cell proliferation, possibly by adjusting β-catenin signalling to the \"just right\" level.",

We recently reported that platelets contain numerous proteins that regulate angiogenesis. We now show that accumulation of angiogenesis regulators in platelets of animals bearing malignant tumors exceeds significantly their concentration in plasma or serum, as well as their levels in platelets from non-tumor-bearing animals. This process is selective, as platelets do not take up a proportional amount of other plasma proteins (eg, albumin), even though these may be present at higher concentrations. We also find that VEGF-enriched Matrigel pellets implanted subcutaneously into mice or the minute quantities of VEGF secreted by microscopic subcutaneous tumors (0.5-1 mm(3)) result in an elevation of VEGF levels in platelets, without any changes in its plasma levels. The profile of other angiogenesis regulatory proteins (eg, platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor) sequestered by platelets also reflects the presence of tumors in vivo before they can be macroscopically evident. The ability of platelets to selectively take up angiogenesis regulators in cancer-bearing hosts may have implications for the diagnosis and management of many angiogenesis-related diseases and provide a guide for antiangiogenic therapies.",

This study was conducted to investigate the role of PKG isoforms in the regulation of cell growth in human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB468. The expression levels of PKG isoforms were also examined using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. No differences in the gene expression of PKG isoforms were observed between MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. To investigate the effects of PKG isoforms on the regulation of cell growth, the cGMP analogues 8-APT-cGMP (PKGIα activator), 8-Br-PET-cGMP (PKGIβ activator) and 8-pCPT-cGMP (PKGII activator) were employed. Apoptosis was assessed with the Annexin-V-propidium iodide (PI) staining, cell cycle analysis and caspase-3/9 activity assay. Treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells with 8-Br-PET-cGMP resulted in a concentration-dependent cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, whereas neither PKGIα nor PKGII activators had any effect on the cell growth. The role of PKGIβ in the inhibition of cell growth was confirmed using PKGI and PKGII inhibitors.

As such, it should exhibit the classic hallmarks of nonlinearity, multistability, and \"nondiffusivity\" (large coherent fluctuations). Surprisingly, at least at the very large scale of neocortical dynamics, there is little empirical evidence to support this, and hence most computational and methodological frameworks for healthy brain activity have proceeded very reasonably from a purely linear and diffusive perspective. By studying the temporal fluctuations of power in human resting-state electroencephalograms, we show that, although these simple properties may hold true at some temporal scales, there is strong evidence for bistability and nondiffusivity in key brain rhythms. Bistability is manifest as nonclassic bursting between high- and low-amplitude modes in the alpha rhythm. Nondiffusivity is expressed through the irregular appearance of high amplitude \"extremal\" events in beta rhythm power fluctuations. The statistical robustness of these observations was confirmed through comparison with Gaussian-rendered phase-randomized surrogate data. Although there is a good conceptual framework for understanding bistability in cortical dynamics, the implications of the extremal events challenge existing frameworks for understanding large-scale brain systems.",

Three children with myxopapillary ependymomas of the conus medullaris and filum terminale were treated by the author over a 2-year period with an at least 24-month follow-up. These children, ages 7, 8 and 13 years, included 1 male and 2 females. Their salient presentation was an acute exacerbation of chronic lower back pain. The duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis ranged from 16 to 18 months. A preoperative MRI, with and without contrast, was available for every case.

At T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging, the nasopharyngeal roof and adenoid was classified as follows: 1, pencil thin, less than 3 mm; 2, smooth thickening, 3 mm or larger; 3, small tags or stripes; or 4, focal adenoid mass with a vertical striped appearance. The posterior and lateral walls were classified as follows: pattern 1, pencil thin, less than 3 mm; pattern 2, mild thickening, 3 mm or larger with moderate enhancement; or pattern 3, thickening with hypoenhancement along the posterior wall. The frequency of these patterns, as well as cysts, symmetry, and pharyngeal recess patency, were documented. Wall thickness was measured and correlated with age, sex, and histologic findings from biopsy specimens by using Spearman rank correlation and Mann-Whitney U tests.\n\nIn 100 patients, roof patterns 1-4 were identified in 16 (16%), seven (7%), 33 (33%), and 44 (44%); posterior and lateral wall patterns 1-3 were identified in 20 (20%), 55 (55%), and 25 (25%) patients. Symmetry was identified in 95 (95%) patients, cysts in 41 (41%) patients, and pharyngeal recess patency was identified in 24 (12%) of 200 sides. Roof including adenoid thickness was higher in men (P = .05) and correlated inversely with age (P <.01). In 62 (62%) of 100 patients, biopsy specimens contained lymphoid follicles. Roof including adenoid (P = .01) and posterior wall (P = .03) thickness at MR imaging was higher if follicles were identified in biopsy specimens.\n\nNasopharyngeal hyperplasia has typical MR imaging appearances, including stripes in adenoid bulges and symmetry, which may be useful to differentiate this condition from nasopharyngeal malignancy.",

The objective of this study was to clarify the role of BTLA in the language network in an epileptic patient who displayed jargonaphasia.\n\nIntracerebral evoked related potentials to verbal and non-verbal stimuli in auditory and visual modalities were recorded from BTLA. Time-frequency analysis was performed during ictal events.\n\nEvoked potentials and induced gamma-band activity provided direct evidence that BTLA is sensitive to language stimuli in both modalities, 350 ms after stimulation.

In the context of transient dysfunction, the patient's lexical semantic processing network is disrupted, reducing spoken output to meaningless phoneme combinations.\n\nThis rare opportunity to study the BTLA \"in vivo\" demonstrates its pivotal role in lexico-semantic processing for speech production and its multimodal nature in speech perception.",

We report here biochemical evidence for a DNA repair deficiency that correlates with the cytogenetic studies. In the alkaline elution technique, after a pulse label with radioactive thymidine in the presence of 3-acetylaminobenzamide (a G2-phase blocker) and X irradiation, DNA from tumor or cancer-prone cells elutes more rapidly during the postirradiation period than that from normal cells. These results indicate that the DNA of tumor and cancer-prone cells either repairs more slowly or acquires more breaks than that of normal cells; breaks can accumulate during incomplete or deficient repair processes. The kinetic difference between normal and tumor or cancer-prone cells in DNA strand-break repair reaches a maximum within 2 h, and this maximum corresponds to the kinetic difference in chromatid aberration incidence following X irradiation reported previously. These findings support the concept that cells showing enhanced G2 chromatid radiosensitivity are deficient in DNA repair. The findings could also lead to a biochemical assay for cancer susceptibility.",

    "originalString": "An intended consequence of the significant investment to characterize the mammalian genome, and its alterations in neoplastic diseases, has been the discovery and commercialization of new approaches to anticancer therapy. As a result, the list of available targets, formerly directed against the processes of DNA replication and mitosis, or in hormonal regulation of growth of tissue, has been dramatically extended. Many of the newer targets represent normal or aberrant signaling pathways, and are present within the cancer cell as second messengers, on its surface (as receptors), or in the external milieu (as ligands). These targets are, therefore, important to the cancer cell phenotype, and affect proliferation, differentiation, and death options for the cell. Another group of targets encompass the cancer cell's relationship to the tissue environment (both stroma and nonneoplastic cells). These targets involve interactions with blood supply (angiogenesis), immune function (evasion), and matrix (invasion and metastasis). Thus, most targets are directly or indirectly critical to some aspect of cancer cell physiology, although a few additional targets are being approached as localization signals for the delivery of otherwise less specific chemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic agents. The development of new therapeutic approaches has expanded the scope of research required to characterize the mechanism of action for anticancer agents in preclinical models and in clinical trials. In preclinical research, mechanism of action studies have supported the selection of therapeutic agents, appropriate models of efficacy, and experimental design, as well as rational characterization and prediction of nontumor (host) effects. In clinical research, mechanism of action studies have supported the identification of surrogate markers of efficacy (critical for determining adequacy of dose and latency of response), and the selection of patient subpopulations and tumor subtypes most likely to exhibit clinical responses. Finally, information on mechanism of action may suggest strategies for combination therapies and predict potential mechanisms of disease resistance to therapy.",

However, EGF receptor (EGFR) dimerization per se does not require ligand binding. Instead, its cytoplasmic kinase domains have to form characteristic head-to-tail asymmetric dimers to become active, where one 'activator' domain activates the other 'receiver' domain. The non-catalytic, cytoplasmic regions of RTKs, namely the juxtamembrane and carboxy terminal portions, also regulate kinase activity. For instance, the juxtamembrane region of the RTK MuSK inhibits the kinase domain probably together with a cellular factor(s). These findings suggest that RTKs could be activated by cytoplasmic proteins. Indeed, Dok-7 and cytohesin have recently been identified as such activators of MuSK and EGFR, respectively. Given that failure of Dok-7 signaling causes myasthenia, and inhibition of cytohesin signaling reduces the proliferation of EGFR-dependent cancer cells, cytoplasmic activators of RTKs may provide new therapeutic targets.",

Clinicopathological factors and postoperative outcomes were compared between high and low subgroups of MCs or Tregs. Compared to low denstiy, higher peritumoral MCs were associated with poorer clinical outcomes, and independently related to elevated 5-year recurrence incidence (54.1%vs 39.2%, P = 0.026). High-dense MCs were especially related to increased probability of early recurrence (within 2 years) (P = 0.004). We also found that peritumoral Tregs were positively correlated with MCs in density (r = 0.353, P < 0.001) and reversely related to HCC outcomes. Notably, MCs in combination with Tregs displayed better prognostic performances than MCs alone (area under curve [AUC](survival) = 0.629 vs 0.589, AUC(recurrence) = 0.632 vs 0.591). Moreover, MCs were positively correlated to alanine aminotransferase, a serum inflammatory marker (P = 0.014).

Here, we report that a tumor- or embryonic stem cell-specific Ras gene ERas, which encodes a constitutively active form of GTPase, and its downstream Phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway are important facilitators for the somatic reprogramming process. We found that overexpression of ERas retrovirally enhanced mouse iPSC induction while ERas knockdown repressed it. Modulation of Akt signaling by genetic or chemical means greatly impacted the reprogramming efficiency. Forced expression of a constitutively active Akt1 gene could rescue the reduced efficiency resulting from ERas knockdown, and point-mutation analyses further revealed that ERas is tightly coupled with Akt signaling to enhance reprogramming. Mechanistically, the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 can function as a barrier to the iPSC induction, and the inactivation of FoxO1 by Akt-dependent phosphorylation largely accounts for the enhancing effect of ERas-Akt signaling on reprogramming. Collectively, these results unravel the significance of the ERas-Akt-FoxO1 signaling axis in iPSC generation, suggesting a possibly shared molecular basis for both somatic reprogramming and cancer initiation.",

In fact, the likelihood of the data under complex stochastic models is often analytically or numerically intractable in many areas of sciences. This makes it even more important to simultaneously investigate the adequacy of these models-in absolute terms, against the data, rather than relative to the performance of other models-but no such procedure has been formally discussed when the likelihood is intractable. We provide a statistical interpretation to current developments in likelihood-free Bayesian inference that explicitly accounts for discrepancies between the model and the data, termed Approximate Bayesian Computation under model uncertainty (ABCmicro). We augment the likelihood of the data with unknown error terms that correspond to freely chosen checking functions, and provide Monte Carlo strategies for sampling from the associated joint posterior distribution without the need of evaluating the likelihood. We discuss the benefit of incorporating model diagnostics within an ABC framework, and demonstrate how this method diagnoses model mismatch and guides model refinement by contrasting three qualitative models of protein network evolution to the protein interaction datasets of Helicobacter pylori and Treponema pallidum. Our results make a number of model deficiencies explicit, and suggest that the T. pallidum network topology is inconsistent with evolution dominated by link turnover or lateral gene transfer alone.",

The analog of ray diagrams, but for electrons, are constructed to help the visualization of the process of compressing electron packets. It is shown that such temporal lenses not only compensate for electron pulse broadening due to velocity dispersion but also allow compression of the packets to durations much shorter than their initial widths.

VES and, to a greater extent, its truncated derivative TS-1 mediated transcriptional repression of AR in prostate cancer cells but not in normal prostate epithelial cells; a finding that underscores the differential susceptibility of normal versus malignant cells to the antiproliferative effect of these agents. This AR repression was attributable to the ability of VES and TS-1 to facilitate the proteasomal degradation of the transcription factor Sp1. This mechanistic link was corroborated by the finding that proteasome inhibitors or ectopic expression of Sp1 protected cells against drug-induced AR ablation. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the destabilization of Sp1 by VES and TS-1 resulted from the inactivation of Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) as a consequence of increased phosphatase activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Stable transfection of LNCaP cells with the dominant-negative JNK1 plasmid mimicked drug-induced Sp1 repression, whereas constitutive activation of JNK kinase activity or inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid protected Sp1 from VES- and TS-1-induced degradation. From a mechanistic perspective, the ability of VES and TS-1 to activate PP2A activity underscores their broad spectrum of effects on multiple signaling mechanisms, including those mediated by Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear factor kappaB, Sp1 and AR. This pleiotropic effect in conjunction with low toxicity suggests the translational potential for developing TS-1 into potent PP2A-activating agents for cancer therapy.",

Experimental identification of APC/C substrates is largely dependent on the discovery of APC/C recognition motifs, e.g., the D-box and KEN-box. Although a number of either stringent or loosely defined motifs proposed, these motif patterns are only of limited use due to their insufficient powers of prediction. We report the development of a novel GPS-ARM software package which is useful for the prediction of D-boxes and KEN-boxes in proteins. Using experimentally identified D-boxes and KEN-boxes as the training data sets, a previously developed GPS (Group-based Prediction System) algorithm was adopted. By extensive evaluation and comparison, the GPS-ARM performance was found to be much better than the one using simple motifs. With this powerful tool, we predicted 4,841 potential D-boxes in 3,832 proteins and 1,632 potential KEN-boxes in 1,403 proteins from H. sapiens, while further statistical analysis suggested that both the D-box and KEN-box proteins are involved in a broad spectrum of biological processes beyond the cell cycle. In addition, with the co-localization information, we predicted hundreds of mitosis-specific APC/C substrates with high confidence. As the first computational tool for the prediction of APC/C-mediated degradation, GPS-ARM is a useful tool for information to be used in further experimental investigations.

As reference for the disc size, the same eyes were examined by HRT II (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the agreement between measurements obtained by indirect ophthalmoscopy and HRT.\n\nThe results of the disc estimate compared with the HRT measurements were as follows: 0.119+/-0.51 mm(2) (60D lens), 0.224+/-0.57 mm(2) (78D lens), 0.10+/-0.51 mm(2) (90D lens), and -0.07 s+/-0.47 mm(2) (Super Field lens).

However, most existing methods show poor performance for well-connected and differentiated neuronal networks, which may serve as valuable models for inter alia synaptogenesis. Here, we present a fully automated method for quantifying the morphology of neurons and the density of neurite networks, in dense neuronal cultures, which are grown for more than 10 days. MorphoNeuroNet, written as a script for ImageJ, Java based freeware, automatically determines various morphological parameters of the soma and the neurites (size, shape, starting points, and fractional occupation). The image analysis pipeline consists of a multi-tier approach in which the somas are segmented by adaptive region growing using nuclei as seeds, and the neurites are delineated by a combination of various intensity and edge detection algorithms. Quantitative comparison showed a superior performance of MorphoNeuroNet to existing analysis tools, especially for revealing subtle changes in thin neurites, which have weak fluorescence intensity compared to the rest of the network. The proposed method will help determining the effects of compounds on cultures with dense neurite networks, thereby boosting physiological relevance of cell-based assays in the context of neuronal diseases.",

However, an exact algorithm was presented only for the case in which we have insertions alone and no deletion (or vice versa), while a heuristic was provided for the symmetric case, that allows both insertions and deletions and is called the inversion-indel distance. In 2005, Yancopoulos, Attie and Friedberg started a new branch of research by introducing the generic double cut and join (DCJ) operation, that can represent several genome rearrangements (including inversions). Among others, the DCJ model gave rise to two important results. First, it has been shown that the inversion distance can be computed in a simpler way with the help of the DCJ operation. Second, the DCJ operation originated the DCJ-indel distance, that allows the comparison of genomes with unequal contents, considering DCJ, insertions and deletions, and can be computed in linear time.\n\nIn the present work we put these two results together to solve an open problem, showing that, when the graph that represents the relation between the two compared genomes has no bad components, the inversion-indel distance is equal to the DCJ-indel distance.

We have determined that 11 normal subjects had a MBC for T3 of 1.20 +/- 0.20 pmol/mg DNA (+/- SE) and a Kd of 3.4 +/- 0.2 X 10(-10) M; the T4 MBC was 8.44 +/- 1.22 pmol/mg DNA and the Kd was 2.7 +/- 0.3 X 10(-10) M. Hypothyroid patients had a mean T3 MBC of 7.32 +/- 2.28 pmol/mg DNA and a mean T4 MBC of 40.04 +/- 21.36 pmol/mg DNA (P less than 0.05 compared to normal). Obese subjects (n = 12) had a basal fed MBC that was 0.66 +/- 0.13 pmol/mg DNA for T3 (P less than 0.05 compared to normal) and was 3.58 +/- 0.56 pmol/mg DNA for T4 (P less than 0.01 compared to normal). During fasting, the average T3 MBC increased to 1.43 +/- 0.31 pmol/mg DNA and the average T4 MBC increased to 9.63 +/- 2.46 pmol/mg DNA, values that are both significantly higher than those in the fed period; the dissociation constants were unaltered in obese subjects (compared to normals) in fed and fasting states. Gel filtration with 0.5 M agarose was employed to ascertain if the physicochemical properties of the solubilized mononuclear human cell receptor were similar to those previously observed in rat and human liver and kidney receptors. The elution profile obtained was similar to that reported earlier. The major binding activity has an estimated Stokes radius of 35 A and a molecular weight ratio of approximately 50,000 daltons. These studies indicate that: 1) high affinity T3 and T4 receptors exist in human mononuclear cells and have properties similar to those for T3 and T4 described previously in rat liver; 2) T3 and T4 receptor number tends to increase in hypothyroid subjects and tend to be lower in obese patients than in normal weight control subjects; 3) fasting is associated with an increase in both T3 and T4 MBC; and 4) despite their apparent physicochemical similarity, T3 receptors in rat liver and human mononuclear cells may be regulated differently, at least during fasting since hepatic T3 receptors decrease in the fasted rat. Collectively, these observations support the concept that human white cell T3 nuclear receptor binding is capable of rapid fluctuations, suggesting a mechanism for homeostatic regulation of T3 action.",

A digit coding test was performed before, and at the end of the treatment period and a third 15 days later. The improvement of performance from the first to the third test (learning effect) was significantly better in the placebo group than in the B6 treated groups. This could be attributed to memorization of skills. Trial II was performed in obese patients starting a low calorie diet in whom vitamins are routinely prescribed. Performance in a work recognition test and in a visual retention test was lower for the group receiving 1 g of pyridoxine a day. Thus, high doses of oral pyridoxine are likely to impair memorization in man. Disturbances of neuro-transmitter metabolism such as increase of GABA production might explain the effect. As the benefit of high doses of pyridoxine has not been well-documented and as the study has suggested that undesired effects may indeed exist, the widespread use of such doses is questionable.",

This study examines whether individuals' beliefs about the causes of obesity affect their support for policies aimed at stemming obesity rates.

The study examines how respondents' demographic and health characteristics, political attitudes, and agreement with seven obesity metaphors affect support for sixteen policies to reduce obesity rates.\n\nIncluding obesity metaphors in regression models helps explain public support for policies to curb obesity beyond levels attributable solely to demographic, health, and political characteristics. The metaphors that people use to understand rising obesity rates are strong predictors of support for public policy, and their influence varies across different types of policy interventions.\n\nOver the last five years, the United States has begun to grapple with the implications of dramatically escalating rates of obesity. Individuals use metaphors to better understand increasing rates of obesity, and obesity metaphors are independent and powerful predictors of support for public policies to curb obesity.

We have previously observed in obesity-prone, obese rats that weight reduction is accompanied by a suppression in resting metabolic rate beyond what would be predicted for the change in metabolic mass. In the present study, we examine if this adjustment in metabolic efficiency is affected by the length of time in weight maintenance and if it contributes to the propensity to regain after weight loss. Twenty-four-hour, nonresting, and resting energy expenditure (REE) were obtained by indirect calorimetry and normalized to metabolic mass estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A 10% loss in body weight in weight-reduced rats was accompanied by a 15% suppression in adjusted REE. This enhancement in metabolic efficiency was not altered with either 8 or 16 wk of weight maintenance, but it did resolve when the forced control of intake was removed and the weight was regained. The rate of weight regain increased with the time in weight maintenance and was exceptionally high early during the relapse period. During this high rate of weight gain, the suppression in REE persists while consumption increases to a level that is higher than when they were obese. In summary, an enhanced metabolic efficiency and an elevated appetite both contribute (60% and 40%, respectively) to a large potential energy imbalance that, when the forcible control of energy intake is relieved, becomes actualized and results in an exceptionally high rate of weight regain.",

Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated through a diet score (0 to 55) that assessed the inherent characteristics of the diet. Compared with those with low CRP levels, subjects with high CRP levels (ie,&>3.0 mg/L) were physically inactive (P = .01), were less likely to adopt the Mediterranean diet (P = .008), had higher glucose levels, had a higher prevalence of hypertension, had a lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and had increased smoking habits and higher anthropometric indices (all P &<.05). Moreover, adoption of the Mediterranean diet in combination with medium physical activity seems to reduce the likelihood of having high CRP levels by 72% (P = .018), irrespective of smoking and various clinical and biological characteristics.

Most importantly, antiangiogenic monoclonal antibody DC101 potentiated single-dose 9ACG antitumor activity and prolonged survival of mice bearing resistant human colon tumor xenografts by providing strong beta-glucuronidase activity and prodrug delivery through enhancing inflammatory cell infiltration and normalizing tumor vessels in the tumor microenvironment.

This effect was independent of hypoxia-induced contractility which was ROCK-dependent rather than HSP27-dependent. Results described here show that increased HSP27 phosphorylation not only does not underlie hypoxia-induced permeability, but may actually augment the endothelial barrier. Hypoxia causes gap formation between RPMEC and increases MLC2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of MYPT1, which inhibits MLC2 phosphatase, is also increased in hypoxia. In addition, FAK phosphorylation, which alters focal adhesion signaling, is increased in hypoxia. Overexpressing phosphomimicking HSP27 (pmHSP27), which induces significant actin stress fiber formation, surprisingly renders RPMEC resistant to hypoxia- or TGFbeta-induced permeability. siRNA against pmHSP27 reverses the increased actin stress fiber formation in pmHSP27-overexpressing cells, and disrupting actin stress fibers in pmHSP27-overexpressing RPMEC renders them more susceptible to hypoxia. Finally, hypoxia-induced gap formation, as well as phosphorylation of MLC2, MYPT1 and FAK are almost abolished by overexpressing pmHSP27 in RPMEC. These effects of pmHSP27 overexpression might represent decreased cytoskeletal plasticity and increased tethering which counteracts permeability-inducing contractility. Thus hypoxia activates two pathways one leading to contractility and increased permeability, the other leading to actin stress fibers, stronger adhesion, and reduced permeability. Altering HSP27 phosphorylation, which tips the balance towards decreased permeability, might be targeted in managing endothelial barrier dysfunction.",

Although CXCL10 could be induced by IFN-gamma depending on cell type, the mechanisms regulating CXCL10 production following treatment with combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha have not been adequately elucidated in human monocytes. In this study, we showed that TNF-alpha had more potential than IFN-gamma to induce CXCL10 production in THP-1 monocytes. Furthermore, IFN-gamma synergistically enhanced the production of CXCL10 in parallel with the activation of NF-kappaB in TNF-alpha-stimulated THP-1 cells. Blockage of STAT1 or NF-kappaB suppressed CXCL10 production. JAKs inhibitors suppressed IFN-gamma plus TNF-alpha-induced production of CXCL10 in parallel with activation of STAT1 and NF-kappaB, while ERK inhibitor suppressed production of CXCL10 as well as activation of NF-kappaB, but not that of STAT1. IFN-gamma-induced phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2, whereas TNF-alpha induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Interestingly, IFN-gamma alone had no effect on phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha, whereas it significantly promoted TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha. These results suggest that TNF-alpha induces CXCL10 production by activating NF-kappaB through ERK and that IFN-gamma induces CXCL10 production by increasing the activation of STAT1 through JAKs pathways. Of note, TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB may be the primary pathway contributing to CXCL10 production in THP-1 cells. IFN-gamma potentiates TNF-alpha-induced CXCL10 production in THP-1 cells by increasing the activation of STAT1 and NF-kappaB through JAK1 and JAK2.",

DjIA possesses a J-domain at its extreme C-terminus but shares no additional homology with DnaJ. Our genetic analysis suggests that DjIA acts in concert with the RcsB/C two-component signal transduction system to augment induction of the cps (capsular polysaccharide) operon and synthesis of colanic acid mucoid capsule. The DjIA J-domain is essential for the observed stimulation of this pathway as deletion, or introduction of the mutation H233Q, within the highly conserved HPD tripeptide abolished all inducing activity. Deletion of the transmembrane anchor sequence also abolished all inducing activity. djIA is not an essential gene under all conditions tested, nor is it essential for mucoid capsule biosynthesis; however, strong overexpression leads to rapid loss of cell viability suggesting that the gene is normally tightly regulated. Northern analysis revealed that djIA message was extremely unstable but could be induced or stabilized in response to cold shock. The activation of the cps operon by DjIA is dependent upon both DnaK(Hsp70) and GrpE, and therefore we propose a role for DjIA, together with this chaperone machine, as a novel regulator of a two-component histidine kinase signal transduction pathway.",

CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) treatment had no effect on cell growth in quiescent CHO-CCK-B cells but inhibited DNA synthesis, proliferation, and colony formation when the cells were grown in fetal bovine serum (FBS). In contrast, CCK-8 stimulated DNA synthesis in quiescent Swiss 3T3-CCK-B cells and had no effect when the cells were grown in FBS. These differences in growth responses were not due to differences in the level of receptor expression, as similar numbers of receptors were present in both cell types. To determine whether the different growth effects were due to differences in receptor coupling to common second messenger pathways, we investigated the effects of CCK-8 on several known intracellular signals. In both cell types, CCK-8 stimulated increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis with similar potencies and efficacies. CCK-8 also stimulated arachidonate release from both cell types, although the potency was higher in the CHO cells. Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate generation was observed at high agonist concentrations in both cell types and was much greater in cells with higher receptor density. In summary, receptor activation had opposite effects on growth parameters in CHO and Swiss 3T3 cells, but only minor differences were observed in the characteristics of CCK-B receptor coupling to specific second messengers in the two cell types. Thus cellular context is a principal determinant of the biological effects of CCK-B receptor activation, and differences in biological responses may occur independently of major differences in receptor coupling.",

Concomitantly, insulin provoked increases in 32P labeling of PKC-zeta both in intact adipocytes and during in vitro assay of immunoprecipitated PKC-zeta; the latter probably reflected autophosphorylation, as it was inhibited by the PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate. Insulin-induced activation of immunoprecipitable PKC-zeta was inhibited by LY294002 and wortmannin; this suggested dependence upon phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. Accordingly, activation of PI 3-kinase by a pYXXM-containing peptide in vitro resulted in a wortmannin-inhibitable increase in immunoprecipitable PKC-zeta enzyme activity. Also, PI-3,4-(PO4)2, PI-3,4,5-(PO4)3, and PI-4,5-(PO4)2 directly stimulated enzyme activity and autophosphoralytion in control PKC-zeta immunoprecipitates to levels observed in insulin-treated PKC-zeta immunoprecipitates. In studies of glucose transport, inhibition of immunoprecipitated PKC-zeta enzyme activity in vitro by both the PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate and RO 31-8220 correlated well with inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in intact adipocytes. Also, in adipocytes transiently expressing hemagglutinin antigen-tagged GLUT4, co-transfection of wild-type or constitutive PKC-zeta stimulated hemagglutinin antigen-GLUT4 translocation, whereas dominant-negative PKC-zeta partially inhibited it. Our findings suggest that insulin activates PKC-zeta through PI 3-kinase, and PKC-zeta may act as a downstream effector of PI 3-kinase and contribute to the activation of GLUT4 translocation.",

The relationship between p38 MAPK and renal fibrosis in NPHP2 is unknown.\n\nWe administered a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor, FR167653, in a NPHP2 mouse model (inv/inv, invΔC mice) from 3 to 6 weeks old, and the kidneys were examined at 6 weeks of age. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK) protein levels, the degree of renal fibrosis, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for extracellular matrix genes and mRNA levels for transforming growth factor in the kidneys were studied. Effect of an extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor on renal fibrosis was also evaluated.\n\nExpression of extracellular matrix genes and p-p38 MAPK were increased in the NPHP2 mouse model kidney. FR167653 successfully decreased p-p38 MAPK levels, the degree of fibrosis and extracellular matrix gene expressions. However, the FR167653 did not prevent cyst expansion, abnormal cell proliferation and acceleration of apoptosis and did not influence ERK activation. In contrast, MEK inhibition reduced both cyst expansion and fibrosis without affecting p38 MAPK activation.\n\nThese results suggest that inhibition of p38 MAPK reduced renal fibrosis but not cyst expansion, cell proliferation and apoptosis in NPHP2 model mice.

Interestingly, only αA and not αB-crystallin (αB), a closely related small heat shock protein works, pointing to molecular specificity in the observed retinal protection. The possible involvement of αA in retinal protection through immune modulation is corroborated by adaptive transfer experiments, (employing αA-/- and wild type mice with EAU as donors and Rag2-/- as the recipient mice), which indicate that αA protects against the autoimmune challenge by modulating the systemic B and T cell immunity. We show that αA administration causes marked reduction in Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IL-12 and IFN-γ), both in the retina and in the spleen; notably, IL-17 was only reduced in the retina suggesting local intervention. Importantly, expression of Toll-like receptors and their associated adaptors is also inhibited suggesting that αA protection, against photoreceptor loss in EAU, is associated with systemic suppression of both the adaptive and innate immune responses.",

    "originalString": "The Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are emerging as molecules that guide the migration of cells and growth cones during embryonic development. Based on their concentration in embryonic regions containing growing neuronal processes, the Eph receptors were suspected early on to have a role in regulating aspects of axon growth. The most distinctive role of the Eph receptors appears to be their ability to mediate cell-cell repulsion through the binding of a ligand on an adjacent cell surface. The repulsive interactions are presumably mediated by transient receptor activation at the boundaries of complementary regions of high ligand or receptor expression. In contrast, overlapping expression patterns may regulate cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization with possible consequences on the overall growth and fasciculation of neuronal processes. A notable feature of Eph receptor signaling is that, upon receptor binding, responses may also be elicited in the ligand-expressing cells. A better understanding of Eph receptor function requires the elucidation of their signaling properties. Recent evidence suggests a functional interaction between the Eph receptor EphB2 and neural cell adhesion molecules of the L1 family, which have well-recognized roles in the formation of neuronal projections. Only a few cytoplasmic signaling molecules that bind to the activated Eph receptors have been identified. Several of these molecules are known to transduce signals regulating cytoskeletal organization and neurite outgrowth. It is currently unclear why there is a need for fourteen distinct Eph receptor genes, many of which appear to encode several variant forms with distinct functional properties, but it is tempting to speculate that such diversity is necessary to refine the spatial organization of embryonic structures.",

Three of the tumour lines, all from immunodeficient mice, completely failed to respond to IFN-gamma by up-regulating MHC class I expression. The same three also displayed absence of IFN-gamma-induced Stat1 beta tyrosine phosphorylation and low Stat1 alpha tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating a defect in the signal transduction pathway affecting phosphorylation of Stat1.

Its amino acid sequence displays the structural features typical for all sarcomeric MHCs, i.e. an amino-terminal \"globular\" head region and a carboxy-terminal alpha-helical rod portion that shows the characteristics of a coiled coil with a superimposed 28-residue repeat pattern interrupted at only four positions by \"skip\" residues. The complex structure of the rat embryonic MHC gene and the conservation of intron locations in this and other MHC genes are indicative of a highly split ancestral sarcomeric MHC gene. Introns in the rat embryonic gene interrupt the coding sequence at the boundaries separating the proteolytic subfragments of the head, but not at the head/rod junction or between the 28-residue repeats present within the rod. Therefore, there is little evidence for exon shuffling and intron-dependent evolution by gene duplication as a mechanism for the generation of the ancestral MHC gene. Rather, intron insertion into a previously non-split ancestral MHC rod gene consisting of multiple tandemly arranged 28-residue-encoding repeats, or convergent evolution of an originally non-repetitive ancestral MHC rod gene must account for the observed structure of the rod-encoding portion of present-day MHC genes.",

NbRae1 was mainly associated with the nuclear envelope during interphase, and NbRae1 deficiency caused accumulation of poly(A) RNA in the nuclei of leaf cells, suggesting defective mRNA export. In the shoot apex, depletion of NbRae1 led to reduced mitotic activities, accompanied by reduced cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity and decreased expression of cyclin B1, CDKB1-1, and histones H3 and H4. The secondary growth of stem vasculature was also inhibited, indicating reduced cambial activities. Differentiated leaf cells of NbRae1-silenced plants exhibited elevated ploidy levels. Immunolabeling in BY-2 cells showed that NbRae1 protein localized to mitotic microtubules and the cell plate-forming zone during mitosis, and recombinant NbRae1 directly bound to microtubules in vitro. Inhibition of NbRae1 expression in BY-2 cells using a beta-estradiol-inducible RNAi system resulted in severe defects in spindle organization and chromosome alignment and segregation, which correlated with delays in cell cycle progression. Together, these results suggest that NbRae1 plays a dual role in mRNA export in interphase and in spindle assembly in mitosis.",

Treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells with 8-Br-PET-cGMP resulted in a concentration-dependent cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, whereas neither PKGIα nor PKGII activators had any effect on the cell growth. The role of PKGIβ in the inhibition of cell growth was confirmed using PKGI and PKGII inhibitors. The present study is the first to demonstrate the involvement of PKGIβ in the inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells.",

    "originalString": "Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domains occur in proteins of either the epsin or epsin-related (epsinR) form. They principally function in clathrin-mediated trafficking and membrane deformation. Both epsin and epsinR possess clathrin-binding motifs, but only epsin incorporates a ubiquitin-interaction motif (UIM). To better understand the origins of ENTH-domain proteins and their functions, we performed detailed comparative genomics and phylogenetics on the epsin family. The epsin ENTH-UIM configuration is an architecture restricted to yeast and animals. Further, we undertook functional analysis in Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a divergent organism possessing a single ENTH-domain protein (TbEpsinR). TbEpsinR has a cellular location similar to both epsin and epsinR at plasma membrane clathrin budding sites and endosomal compartments, and associates with clathrin, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation. Knockdown of TbEpsinR leads to a significant decrease in the intracellular pools of multiple surface antigens, without affecting bulk membrane internalization. Therefore, despite lacking the UIM, TbEpsinR maintains a similar role to metazoan epsin in endocytosis and participates as a clathrin-associated adaptor. We suggest that recruitment of a UIM to the ENTH-domain proteins was not essential for participation in endocytosis of ubiquitylated molecules, and is presumably a specific innovation restricted to higher eukaryotes.",

The yeast FLP/FRT site-specific recombination system was used to excise and transiently activate the previously integrated yeast I-SceI homing endonuclease in maize zygotes and/or developing embryos. An artificial I-SceI recognition sequence integrated into genomic DNA was analyzed for mutations to indicate the I-SceI endonuclease activity. Targeted mutagenesis of the I-SceI site occurred in about 1% of analyzed F1 plants. Short deletions centered on the I-SceI-produced double-strand break were the predominant genetic lesions observed in the F1 plants. The I-SceI expression cassette was not detected in the mutant F1 plants and their progeny. However, the original mutations were faithfully transmitted to the next generation indicating that the mutations occurred early during the F1 plant development. The procedure offers simultaneous production of double-strand breaks and delivery of DNA template combined with a large number of progeny plants for future gene targeting experiments.",

    "originalString": "The torI gene has been identified by using a genetic multicopy approach as a negative regulator of the torCAD operon that encodes the trimethylamine N-oxide reductase respiratory system in Escherichia coli. The negative effect was due to a previously unidentified small ORF (66 aa) of phage origin that we called torI for Tor inhibition. Overexpression of torI led to an 8-fold decrease of the torCAD operon transcription. This operon is positively regulated, in the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide, by a four-step phosphorelay involving the TorS sensor and the TorR response regulator. Epistatic experiments showed that TorI acts downstream of TorS and needs the presence of TorR. In vitro experiments showed that it is neither a TorR phosphatase nor a histidine kinase inhibitor and that it binds to the effector domain of TorR. Unexpectedly, TorI did not impede TorR DNA binding, and we propose that it may prevent RNA polymerase recruitment to the torC promoter. This study thus reveals a previously uncharacterized class of response regulator inhibitors.",

The calculations are based on the AMBER force field with particle mesh Ewald treatment for long-range electrostatics. The Tat structure exhibits a large flexibility, consistent with its absence of secondary structure elements. From an analysis of the correlation matrix and of electrostatic interactions we suggest that segments expressed by the two exons (amino acids 1-72 and 73-86, respectively) exhibit rather separated dynamic and energetic properties. We also identify intramolecular interactions of importance for structure stabilization. In particular, significant electrostatic interactions are recognized between the N-terminus and the basic domain of the protein, consistent with site-directed mutagenesis performed in this work.",

Secondary structure models constrained by the experimental data were made by varying the distance (along the mRNA) over which base pairing was allowed. Four prominent secondary structures were seen with restrictions of 165, 330, or 659 nucleotides suggesting that such structures from via local interactions over distances of 50-120 nucleotides. Predicted long range interactions involve only 2-3 base pairs while local interactions involve helices of 4-10 base pairs. Predicted helices of greater than or equal to 4 base pairs occur primarily within exons, raising the possibility that prominent secondary structures in mRNAs may be largely due to intraexonic base pairing. Tests of single- and double-stranded domains by oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage and primer extension were in accord with the structure model and with nuclease and chemical modification data. The model predicting base pairing between the coding and the 3' noncoding regions was tested by RNase H cleavage followed by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography to separate 5' and 3' mRNA fragments. Most (82%) of the 5' fragment remained associated with the 3' noncoding region in a structure with a tm = 50 degrees C in 0.2 M Na+ suggesting that this stem could be stable in vivo. This stem may be stable in the isolated mRNA, but would likely occur transiently in polyribosomal apolipoprotein II mRNA due to ribosome transit through the 5' side of the stem. Alternate structures may occur in this region during ribosome transit and play a role in translation termination or in determining the susceptibility of the mRNA to degradation.",

These motifs were named D2 (for DSE; U2). Both the octamer sequence and the SpI site bound nuclear factors in vitro, but no factor binding to the D2 motifs was detected. All four elements were independently capable of enhancing transcription of the U2 gene to some extent.

    "originalString": "The biosynthesis of the 2'-(5\"-phosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-coenzyme A (CoA) prosthetic group of citrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.6), a key enzyme of citrate fermentation, proceeds via the initial formation of the precursor 2'-(5\"-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA and subsequent transfer to apo-citrate lyase with removal of pyrophosphate. In Escherichia coli, the two steps are catalyzed by CitG and CitX, respectively, and the corresponding genes are part of the citrate lyase gene cluster, citCDEFXG. In the homologous citCDEFG operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae, citX is missing. A search for K. pneumoniae citX led to the identification of a second genome region involved in citrate fermentation which comprised the citWX genes and the divergent citYZ genes. The citX gene was confirmed to encode holo-citrate lyase synthase, whereas citW was shown to encode a citrate carrier, the third one identified in this species. The citYZ genes were found to encode a two-component system consisting of the sensor kinase CitY and the response regulator CitZ. Remarkably, both proteins showed >or=40% sequence identity to the citrate-sensing CitA-CitB two-component system, which is essential for the induction of the citrate fermentation genes in K. pneumoniae. A citZ insertion mutant was able to grow anaerobically with citrate, indicating that CitZ is not essential for expression of citrate fermentation genes. CitX synthesis was induced to a basal level under anaerobic conditions, independent of citrate, CitB, and CitZ, and to maximal levels during anaerobic growth with citrate as the sole carbon source. Similar to the other citrate fermentation enzymes, CitX synthesis was apparently subject to catabolite repression.",

An unrelated peptide was identified as a mimotope for one of the anti-MUC1 antibodies using phage display technologies and this was also evaluated as a potential ligand in an affinity matrix. Epitope affinity chromatographic purification of an anti-MUC1 antibody was performed using hybridoma tissue culture supernatants as sample. Following sample application and column washing, antibody was desorbed from the matrix by gradient elution with increasing concentrations of NaSCN. The procedure has proved efficient for the purification of anti-MUC1 antibodies and the concentration of NaSCN required for antibody desorption gives a measure of the relative binding affinity of the antibody for the peptide epitope matrix so that separation strategies may be optimised.",

The ffs36 phenotype results from a single base change in one of the non-conserved stems of the mature RNA, and is completely rescued by a compensating mutation in the opposite strand, providing confirmation of the predicted secondary structure of the 4.5 S RNA. The Caulobacter ffs gene was shown to be functionally comparable to the Escherichia coli ffs gene by complementation. Comparison of the ffs36 strain to a ts secA strain of Caulobacter, also having cell-cycle and DNA replication phenotypes, showed that both exhibit a permanent induction of a heat shock response at the restrictive temperature.
