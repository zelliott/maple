Seventeen plant species were collected and extracted in Costa Rica.

Six of the plant extracts bound to the ERs. Four of the six extracts stimulated reporter gene expression in the ER-beta-Chemically Activated Luciferase Expression assay. All six extracts modulated expression of endogenous genes in MCF-7 cells, with <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> extracts acting as estrogen agonists and two extracts, Pimenta dioica and Smilax domingensis, acting as partial agonist/antagonists by enhancing estradiol-stimulated pS2 mRNA expression but reducing estradiol-stimulated PR and PTGES mRNA expression.

In studies of glucose transport, inhibition of immunoprecipitated PKC-zeta enzyme activity in vitro by both the PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate and RO 31-8220 correlated well with inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in intact adipocytes.

This effect was <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> of hypoxia-induced contractility which was ROCK-dependent rather than HSP27-dependent. Results described here show that increased HSP27 phosphorylation not only does not underlie hypoxia-induced permeability, but may actually augment the endothelial barrier. Hypoxia causes gap formation between RPMEC and increases MLC2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of MYPT1, which inhibits MLC2 phosphatase, is also increased in hypoxia. In addition, FAK phosphorylation, which alters focal adhesion signaling, is increased in hypoxia. Overexpressing phosphomimicking HSP27 (pmHSP27), which induces significant actin stress fiber formation, surprisingly <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> RPMEC resistant to hypoxia- or TGFbeta-induced permeability. siRNA against pmHSP27 reverses the increased actin stress fiber formation in pmHSP27-overexpressing cells, and disrupting actin stress fibers in pmHSP27-overexpressing RPMEC renders them more susceptible to hypoxia. Finally, hypoxia-induced gap formation, as well as phosphorylation of MLC2, MYPT1 and FAK are almost abolished by <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> pmHSP27 in RPMEC. These effects of pmHSP27 overexpression might represent decreased cytoskeletal plasticity and increased tethering which counteracts permeability-inducing contractility. Thus hypoxia activates two pathways one leading to contractility and increased permeability, the other leading to actin stress fibers, stronger adhesion, and reduced permeability. Altering HSP27 phosphorylation, which tips the balance towards decreased permeability, might be targeted in managing endothelial barrier dysfunction.",

In this study, we showed that TNF-alpha had more potential than IFN-gamma to induce CXCL10 <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">2</button> in THP-1 monocytes. Furthermore, IFN-gamma synergistically enhanced the production of CXCL10 in parallel with the activation of NF-kappaB in TNF-alpha-stimulated THP-1 cells. Blockage of STAT1 or NF-kappaB suppressed CXCL10 production. JAKs inhibitors suppressed IFN-gamma plus TNF-alpha-induced production of CXCL10 in parallel with activation of STAT1 and NF-kappaB, while ERK inhibitor suppressed production of CXCL10 as well as activation of NF-kappaB, but not that of STAT1.

VES and, to a greater extent, its truncated derivative TS-1 mediated transcriptional repression of AR in prostate cancer cells but not in normal prostate epithelial cells; a finding that underscores the differential susceptibility of normal versus malignant cells to the antiproliferative effect of these agents. This AR repression was attributable to the <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> of VES and TS-1 to facilitate the proteasomal degradation of the transcription factor Sp1. This mechanistic link was corroborated by the finding that proteasome inhibitors or ectopic expression of Sp1 protected cells against drug-induced AR ablation. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the destabilization of Sp1 by VES and TS-1 resulted from the inactivation of Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) as a consequence of increased phosphatase <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Stable transfection of LNCaP cells with the dominant-negative JNK1 plasmid mimicked drug-induced Sp1 repression, whereas constitutive activation of JNK kinase <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> or inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid protected Sp1 from VES- and TS-1-induced degradation. From a mechanistic perspective, the ability of VES and TS-1 to activate PP2A activity underscores their broad spectrum of effects on multiple signaling mechanisms, including those mediated by Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear factor kappaB, Sp1 and AR. This pleiotropic effect in conjunction with low toxicity suggests the translational potential for developing TS-1 into potent PP2A-activating agents for cancer therapy.",

In both cell types, CCK-8 stimulated increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis with similar potencies and efficacies. CCK-8 also stimulated arachidonate release from both cell types, although the potency was higher in the CHO cells. Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate generation was observed at high agonist concentrations in both cell types and was much greater in cells with higher receptor density. In summary, receptor activation had opposite effects on growth parameters in CHO and Swiss 3T3 cells, but only minor differences were observed in the characteristics of CCK-B receptor coupling to specific second messengers in the two cell types. Thus cellular context is a principal determinant of the biological effects of CCK-B receptor activation, and differences in biological responses may occur independently of major differences in receptor coupling.",

A 10% loss in body weight in weight-reduced rats was accompanied by a 15% suppression in adjusted REE. This enhancement in metabolic efficiency was not altered with either 8 or 16 wk of weight maintenance, but it did resolve when the forced control of intake was removed and the weight was regained. The rate of weight regain increased with the time in weight maintenance and was exceptionally high early during the relapse period. During this high rate of weight gain, the suppression in REE persists while consumption increases to a level that is <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> than when they were obese. In summary, an enhanced metabolic efficiency and an elevated appetite both contribute (60% and 40%, respectively) to a large potential energy imbalance that, when the forcible control of energy intake is relieved, becomes actualized and results in an exceptionally high rate of weight regain.",

This article used the Yale Rudd Center Public Opinion on Obesity Survey, a nationally representative web sample surveyed from the Knowledge Networks panel in 2006/07 (N = 1,009). The study examines how respondents' demographic and health characteristics, political attitudes, and agreement with seven obesity metaphors affect support for sixteen policies to reduce obesity rates. Including obesity metaphors in regression models helps explain public support for policies to curb obesity beyond levels attributable solely to demographic, health, and political characteristics. The metaphors that people <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> to <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> rising obesity rates are strong predictors of support for public policy, and their influence varies across different types of policy interventions.

This assay utilizes the technique of salt solubilization to isolate nuclear receptors and employs standard saturation analysis for T3 and T4 to determine maximal binding capacity (MBC) and equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd). We have determined that 11 normal subjects had a MBC for T3 of 1.20 +/- 0.20 pmol/mg DNA (+/- SE) and a Kd of 3.4 +/- 0.2 X 10(-10) M; the T4 MBC was 8.44 +/- 1.22 pmol/mg DNA and the Kd was 2.7 +/- 0.3 X 10(-10) M. Hypothyroid patients had a mean T3 MBC of 7.32 +/- 2.28 pmol/mg DNA and a mean T4 MBC of 40.04 +/- 21.36 pmol/mg DNA (P less than 0.05 compared to normal). Obese subjects (n = 12) had a basal <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">2</button> MBC that was 0.66 +/- 0.13 pmol/mg DNA for T3 (P less than 0.05 compared to normal) and was 3.58 +/- 0.56 pmol/mg DNA for T4 (P less than 0.01 compared to normal). During fasting, the average T3 MBC increased to 1.43 +/- 0.31 pmol/mg DNA and the average T4 MBC increased to 9.63 +/- 2.46 pmol/mg DNA, values that are both significantly higher than those in the fed period; the dissociation constants were unaltered in obese subjects (compared to normals) in fed and fasting states. Gel filtration with 0.5 M agarose was employed to ascertain if the physicochemical <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> of the solubilized mononuclear human cell receptor were <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> to those previously observed in rat and human liver and kidney receptors. The elution profile obtained was similar to that reported earlier. The major binding activity has an estimated Stokes radius of 35 A and a molecular weight ratio of approximately 50,000 daltons. These studies indicate that: 1) high affinity T3 and T4 receptors exist in human mononuclear cells and have properties similar to those for T3 and T4 described previously in rat liver; 2) T3 and T4 receptor number tends to increase in <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> subjects and tend to be lower in obese patients than in normal weight control subjects; 3) fasting is associated with an increase in both T3 and T4 MBC; and 4) despite their apparent physicochemical similarity, T3 receptors in rat liver and human mononuclear cells may be regulated differently, at least during fasting since hepatic T3 receptors decrease in the fasted rat. Collectively, these observations support the concept that human white cell T3 nuclear receptor binding is capable of rapid fluctuations, suggesting a mechanism for homeostatic regulation of T3 action.",

Experimental identification of APC/C substrates is largely dependent on the discovery of APC/C recognition motifs, e.g., the D-box and KEN-box. Although a number of either stringent or loosely defined motifs proposed, these motif patterns are only of limited use due to their insufficient powers of prediction. We report the development of a novel GPS-ARM software package which is useful for the prediction of D-boxes and KEN-boxes in proteins. Using experimentally identified D-boxes and KEN-boxes as the training data sets, a previously developed GPS (Group-based Prediction System) algorithm was adopted. By extensive evaluation and comparison, the GPS-ARM performance was found to be much better than the one using simple motifs. With this powerful tool, we predicted 4,841 potential D-boxes in 3,832 proteins and 1,632 potential KEN-boxes in 1,403 proteins from H. sapiens, while further statistical analysis suggested that both the D-box and KEN-box proteins are involved in a broad spectrum of biological <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">2</button> beyond the cell cycle.

Quantitative comparison showed a superior performance of MorphoNeuroNet to existing analysis tools, especially for revealing subtle changes in thin neurites, which have weak fluorescence intensity compared to the rest of the network. The proposed method will help determining the effects of compounds on cultures with dense neurite networks, thereby boosting physiological relevance of cell-based assays in the context of neuronal diseases.",

Thus, this study indicates that the major determinants of the persistently low frequency of oral contraceptive use in this Northern Italian population are social rather than reproductive or medical factors. These findings have important implications for epidemiological research on oral contraceptive and disease in this population, and underline the importance of selection and screening of oral contraceptive users on the basis of knowledge of medical factors and lifestyle habits. Socio-demographic characteristics, general lifestyle habits, and reproductive and medical histories were compared of 328 women who had ever used oral contraceptives (OCs) and 2306 never users from a case-control surveillance conducted in Northern Italy.

The rate ratio of ever use (adjusted for age and diagnostic category) was 3.3 for women with 12 years of education or more compared with less than 7 years, and 3.0 for women of highest compared with lowest social class. The frequency of pill use was lower among never married women, and significantly elevated among smokers. In contrast, no relation was evident between alcohol or coffee consumption and pill use. Likewise, ever users of OCs were not significantly different from women who had never used the pill with regard to major reproductive factors (parity and age at 1st pregnancy) or several medical variables of potential interest (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), with the only possible exclusion of obesity which was less frequent among pill users. Thus, this study indicates that the major determinants of the persistently low frequency of OC use in the Northern Italian population are social rather than reproductive or medical factors. These findings have important implications for epidemiological research on OCs and disease in this population, and underline the importance of selection and screening of OC users on the basis of knowledge of medical factors and lifestyle habits.",

Here, we report that a tumor- or embryonic stem cell-specific Ras gene ERas, which encodes a constitutively active form of GTPase, and its <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">2</button> Phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway are important facilitators for the somatic <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> process. We found that overexpression of ERas retrovirally <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> mouse iPSC induction while ERas knockdown repressed it. Modulation of Akt signaling by genetic or chemical means greatly impacted the reprogramming efficiency. Forced expression of a constitutively active Akt1 gene could rescue the reduced efficiency resulting from ERas knockdown, and point-mutation analyses further revealed that ERas is <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> coupled with Akt signaling to enhance reprogramming. Mechanistically, the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 can function as a barrier to the iPSC induction, and the inactivation of FoxO1 by Akt-dependent phosphorylation largely accounts for the enhancing effect of ERas-Akt signaling on reprogramming. Collectively, these results unravel the significance of the ERas-Akt-FoxO1 signaling axis in iPSC generation, suggesting a possibly shared molecular basis for both somatic reprogramming and cancer initiation.",

    "abstract": "Regions involved in language processing have been observed in the inferior part of the left temporal lobe. Although collectively labelled 'the Basal Temporal Language Area' (BTLA), these territories are functionally heterogeneous and are involved in language perception (i.e. reading or semantic task) or language production (speech arrest after stimulation). The objective of this study was to clarify the role of BTLA in the language network in an epileptic patient who displayed jargonaphasia. Intracerebral evoked related potentials to verbal and non-verbal stimuli in auditory and visual modalities were recorded from BTLA. Time-frequency analysis was performed during ictal events. Evoked potentials and induced gamma-band activity provided direct evidence that BTLA is sensitive to language stimuli in both modalities, 350 ms after stimulation. In addition, <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">1</button> gamma-band discharges were recorded from this region during which we observed phonological jargon.

MR imaging studies and nasopharyngeal biopsy specimens were analyzed retrospectively in 100 adults (51 men, 49 women) with benign histologic findings; local institutional review board approval and informed consent had been obtained as part of a previous imaging study. At T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging, the nasopharyngeal roof and adenoid was classified as follows: 1, pencil thin, less than 3 mm; 2, smooth thickening, 3 mm or larger; 3, small tags or stripes; or 4, focal adenoid mass with a vertical striped appearance.

Three children with myxopapillary ependymomas of the conus medullaris and filum terminale were treated by the author over a 2-year period with an at least 24-month follow-up. These children, ages 7, 8 and 13 years, included 1 male and 2 females. Their salient presentation was an acute exacerbation of chronic lower back pain. The duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis ranged from 16 to 18 months. A preoperative MRI, with and without contrast, was available for every case. All children underwent replacement laminoplasty with gross total tumor resection.

Here, RNA <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">1</button> has been used to down-regulate truncated APC in several colorectal cancer cell lines expressing truncated APCs of different lengths, thereby performing an analysis covering most of the mutation cluster region (MCR). The consequences on proliferation in vitro, tumour formation in vivo and the level and transcriptional activity of β-catenin have been investigated. Down-regulation of truncated APC results in an inhibition of tumour cell population expansion in vitro in 6 cell lines out of 6 and inhibition of tumour outgrowth in vivo as analysed in one of these cell lines, HT29. This provides a general rule explaining the retention of truncated APC in colorectal tumours and defines it as a suitable target for therapeutic intervention. Actually, we also show that it is <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">2</button> to design a shRNA that targets a specific truncated <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> of APC without <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> the <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> of wild-type APC. Down-regulation of truncated APC is accompanied by an up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in 5 out of 6 cell lines. Surprisingly, the increased signalling is associated in most cases (4 out of 5) with an up-regulation of β-catenin levels, indicating that truncated APC can still modulate wnt signalling through controlling the level of β-catenin. This control can happen even when truncated APC lacks the β-catenin inhibiting domain (CiD) involved in targeting β-catenin for proteasomal degradation. Thus, truncated APC is an essential component of colorectal cancer cells, required for cell proliferation, possibly by adjusting β-catenin signalling to the \"just right\" level.",

Knockdown of TbEpsinR leads to a significant decrease in the intracellular pools of multiple surface antigens, without affecting bulk membrane internalization. Therefore, despite lacking the UIM, TbEpsinR maintains a similar role to metazoan epsin in endocytosis and participates as a clathrin-associated adaptor. We suggest that recruitment of a UIM to the ENTH-domain proteins was not essential for participation in endocytosis of ubiquitylated molecules, and is presumably a specific <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> restricted to higher eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "The RHO1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a homolog of the mammalian <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">1</button> small GTP-binding protein, which is implicated in various actin cytoskeleton-dependent cell functions. In yeast, Rho1p is involved in bud formation. A yeast strain in which RHO1 is replaced with RhoA shows a recessive temperature-sensitive growth phenotype. A dominant suppressor mutant was isolated from this strain. Molecular cloning of the suppressor gene revealed that the mutation occurred at the pseuodosubstrate site of PKC1, a yeast homolog of mammalian protein kinase C. Two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that GTP-Rho1p, but not GDP-Rho1p, interacted with the region of Pkc1p containing the pseudosubstrate site and the C1 domain. MKK1 and MPK1 encode MAP kinase kinase and MAP kinase homologs, respectively, and function downstream of PKC1. A dominant active MKK1-6 mutation or overexpression of MPK1 suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the RhoA mutant. The dominant activating mutation of PKC1 suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the RhoA mutant. The dominant activating mutation of PKC1 suppressed the temperature sensitivity of two effector mutants of RHO1, rho1(F44Y) and rho1(E451), but not that of rho1(V43T).

The tumour cell lines varied greatly in their MHC class I expression before as well as after IFN-gamma stimulation. There was a tendency towards a higher MHC expression after IFN-gamma stimulation in tumour lines from immunocompetent mice compared to immunodeficient mice, but no common maximum MHC class I expression level was found for the 78 tumour cell lines. Three of the tumour lines, all from immunodeficient mice, completely failed to respond to IFN-gamma by up-regulating MHC class I expression. The same three also displayed absence of IFN-gamma-induced Stat1 beta tyrosine phosphorylation and low Stat1 alpha tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating a defect in the signal transduction pathway affecting phosphorylation of Stat1. These findings strongly suggest a link between defects in Stat1 phosphorylation and the failure to up-regulate MHC class I.

    "abstract": "The Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are emerging as molecules that guide the migration of cells and growth cones during embryonic development. Based on their concentration in embryonic regions containing growing neuronal processes, the Eph receptors were suspected early on to have a role in regulating aspects of axon growth. The most distinctive role of the Eph receptors <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">1</button> to be their ability to mediate cell-cell repulsion through the binding of a ligand on an adjacent cell surface. The repulsive interactions are presumably mediated by transient receptor activation at the boundaries of complementary regions of high ligand or receptor expression. In contrast, overlapping expression patterns may regulate cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization with possible consequences on the overall growth and fasciculation of neuronal processes. A notable feature of Eph receptor signaling is that, upon receptor binding, responses may also be elicited in the ligand-expressing cells. A <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">2</button> understanding of Eph receptor function requires the <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> of their signaling properties. Recent evidence suggests a functional interaction between the Eph receptor EphB2 and neural cell adhesion molecules of the L1 family, which have well-recognized roles in the formation of neuronal projections. Only a few cytoplasmic signaling molecules that bind to the activated Eph receptors have been identified. Several of these molecules are known to transduce signals regulating cytoskeletal organization and neurite outgrowth. It is currently unclear why there is a need for fourteen distinct Eph receptor genes, many of which appear to encode several variant <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> with distinct functional properties, but it is tempting to speculate that such diversity is necessary to <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> the spatial organization of embryonic structures.",

In this report we demonstrate that intravenous administration of αA preserves retinal architecture and prevents photoreceptor damage in EAU. Interestingly, only αA and not αB-crystallin (αB), a closely related small heat shock protein works, pointing to molecular specificity in the observed retinal protection. The possible involvement of αA in retinal protection through immune modulation is corroborated by adaptive transfer experiments, (employing αA-/- and wild type mice with EAU as donors and Rag2-/- as the recipient mice), which indicate that αA protects against the <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> challenge by modulating the systemic B and T cell immunity. We show that αA administration causes marked reduction in Th1 <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> (TNF-α, IL-12 and IFN-γ), both in the retina and in the spleen; notably, IL-17 was only reduced in the retina suggesting local intervention.

In this study we characterized multiple functions of Rae1 in plants. Virus-induced gene silencing of Nicotiana benthamiana Rae1, NbRae1, which encodes a protein with four WD40 repeats, resulted in growth arrest and abnormal leaf development. NbRae1 was mainly associated with the nuclear envelope during interphase, and NbRae1 deficiency caused accumulation of poly(A) RNA in the nuclei of leaf cells, suggesting <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">2</button> mRNA export. In the shoot apex, depletion of NbRae1 led to reduced mitotic activities, accompanied by reduced cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity and decreased expression of cyclin B1, CDKB1-1, and <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">3</button> H3 and H4. The secondary growth of stem vasculature was also inhibited, indicating reduced cambial activities. Differentiated leaf cells of NbRae1-silenced plants exhibited elevated ploidy levels. Immunolabeling in BY-2 cells showed that NbRae1 protein localized to mitotic microtubules and the cell plate-forming zone during mitosis, and recombinant NbRae1 directly bound to microtubules in vitro. Inhibition of NbRae1 expression in BY-2 cells using a beta-estradiol-inducible RNAi system resulted in <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">4</button> defects in spindle organization and chromosome alignment and segregation, which correlated with delays in cell cycle progression. Together, these <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> suggest that NbRae1 plays a dual role in mRNA export in interphase and in spindle assembly in mitosis.",

This gene comprises 24 X 10(3) bases of DNA and is split into 41 exons. The exons encode a 6035 nucleotide (nt) long mRNA consisting of 90 nt of 5' untranslated, 5820 nt of protein coding and 125 nt of 3' untranslated sequence.

The complex structure of the rat embryonic MHC gene and the conservation of intron locations in this and other MHC genes are indicative of a highly split ancestral sarcomeric MHC gene. Introns in the rat embryonic gene interrupt the coding sequence at the boundaries separating the proteolytic subfragments of the head, but not at the head/rod junction or between the 28-residue repeats present within the rod. Therefore, there is <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-sm blank\">5</button> evidence for exon shuffling and intron-dependent evolution by gene duplication as a mechanism for the generation of the ancestral MHC gene.
