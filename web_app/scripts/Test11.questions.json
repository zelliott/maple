Previous studies have reported that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulate mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) production via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in human airway cells. Moreover, this production was shown to depend on the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), which is increased in COPD patients' serum. In the present study we investigated the signaling pathway mediating LPS-stimulated secretion and activation of MMP-9, and the regulatory effects of this pathway on the production of MUC5AC in the human airway cells NCI-H292. Using specific inhibitors, we found that LPS-stimulated cells secreted and activated MMP-9 via EGFR. Our results also indicate that signaling events downstream of EGFR involved PI3K-dependent activation of Rac1, which mediated the NADPH-generated reactive oxygen species responsible for MMP-9 secretion and activation. Finally, we observed that EGFR/PI3K/Rac1/NADPH/ROS/MMP-9 regulate MUC5AC production in LPS-challenged NCI-H292 cells.",

    "originalString": "Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer cells are probably more aggressive with larger metastatic potential than ER-positive cells. Loss of ER in recurrent breast cancer is associated with poor response to endocrine therapy. G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) is expressed in half of ER-negative breast cancers. Tumor cell-derived heregulin-β1 (HRG-β1) is also found mainly in ER-negative cancer. In SkBr3 breast cancer cells that lack ER but express GPR30, HRG-β1 upregulates mRNA and protein levels of GPR30 by promoting ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimerization and activating the downstream MAPK-ERK signaling pathway. Moreover, GPR30 boosts HRG-β1-induced migration and invasion of SkBr3 cells after combinative treatment with E2, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen or the specific GPR30 agonist G-1, which are blocked by the specific GPR30 antagonist G-15 or the transfection with the small interfering RNA for GPR30. The ErbB2 inhibitor AG825 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 also partly inhibit the enhanced migration and invasion. Therefore, HRG-β1-induced migration and invasion partly depend on the upregulation of GPR30 expression through activation of the ErbB2-ERK pathway in SkBr3 cells. The results of this study indicate that the crosstalk between GPR30 and HRGs signaling is important for endocrine therapy resistance and may provide a new therapeutic way to treat breast cancer.",

The gdh gene comprises an open reading frame of 1,335 base pairs that encodes a 49,000-M(r) protein of 445 amino acids. The gdh gene showed high homology (78.3%) with that of Clostridium symbiosum. Optimal codons accounted for 35.9% of the total codon usage, indicating high expression of this enzyme. These data are currently being used to carry out targeted mutagenesis, which was established here for gingivain. Conditions for targeted mutagenesis within the histidine domain of the catalytic site of gingivain using Tn 4351 was successfully achieved. Consequently, the catalytic functions, such as gingivain's capacity to hydrolyze the synthetic substrate alpha-benzoyl-arginine-4-nitroanilide, were disrupted.",

As such, it should exhibit the classic hallmarks of nonlinearity, multistability, and \"nondiffusivity\" (large coherent fluctuations). Surprisingly, at least at the very large scale of neocortical dynamics, there is little empirical evidence to support this, and hence most computational and methodological frameworks for healthy brain activity have proceeded very reasonably from a purely linear and diffusive perspective. By studying the temporal fluctuations of power in human resting-state electroencephalograms, we show that, although these simple properties may hold true at some temporal scales, there is strong evidence for bistability and nondiffusivity in key brain rhythms. Bistability is manifest as nonclassic bursting between high- and low-amplitude modes in the alpha rhythm. Nondiffusivity is expressed through the irregular appearance of high amplitude \"extremal\" events in beta rhythm power fluctuations. The statistical robustness of these observations was confirmed through comparison with Gaussian-rendered phase-randomized surrogate data. Although there is a good conceptual framework for understanding bistability in cortical dynamics, the implications of the extremal events challenge existing frameworks for understanding large-scale brain systems.",

In humans, neuronal populations tuned to movement direction have recently been described using multivoxel pattern analysis and functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation. It is unclear, however, to what extent directionally tuned neuronal populations are sensitive to movement amplitude. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation to determine whether directionally tuned neuronal populations are modulated by movement amplitude. In different blocks, participants were adapted to small- or large-amplitude hand-reaching movements. On occasional test trials, we parametrically varied the angular difference between adaptation and test direction and the congruency between adapted and tested amplitude (same or different). We predicted that the blood oxygen level-dependent signal in directionally tuned regions should be adapted in proportion to the angular difference between adaptation and test direction. Directionally tuned regions insensitive to movement amplitude should show a transfer of adaptation from the adapted to the nonadapted amplitude. In contrast, regions sensitive to the specific combination of movement direction and amplitude should show directional tuning only for the adapted amplitude. We identified a network of parietal and frontal regions tuned to movement direction. We found that parietal areas contain neuronal populations sensitive to specific combinations of movement direction and amplitude, while frontal areas show transfer from the adapted to the nonadapted amplitude during small-amplitude movements after adaptation to large amplitude, but not vice versa. Our results thus imply different processing of movement amplitude in directionally tuned frontal and parietal areas.",

Hence, percentage of men under active surveillance for insignificant prostate cancer and reclassified as significant cancer at 2 years is 20-30%. It is mainly because of anterior cancer underdiagnosis by systematic posterior biopsies. mp-MRI is accurate for significant cancer detection and staging, including anterior cancers, which represent 20% of cancers in an unselected population of men with suspicious prostate-specific antigen elevation. One way to reduce the risk of underestimation is to target the needle on significant cancer identified at prebiopsy anatomical and functional imaging, so that detection and personalized risk stratification can be improved. MRI reveals greater volume of cancers and higher grade than systematic 12-core biopsies. MRI 95% negative predictive value has the potential to avoid biopsy series for monitoring patients under active surveillance.\n\nUpon confirmation of these results, MRI may be used to better select patients for active surveillance inclusion. Incorporation of mp-MRI into active surveillance selection criterias for patients with low-risk prostate cancer can reduce the number of patients reclassified at subsequent biopsies because of better initial prognosis evaluation. In addition to additional cost, MRI requires a highly skilled team to obtain information adequate to drive clinical decisions.",

Temporal information can indicate whether stimuli in different senses are related or not. A recent human fMRI study (Noesselt et al. [2007]: J Neurosci 27:11431-11441) used auditory and visual trains of beeps and flashes with erratic timing, manipulating whether auditory and visual trains were synchronous or unrelated in temporal pattern. A region of superior temporal sulcus (STS) showed higher BOLD signal for the synchronous condition. But this could not be related to performance, and it remained unclear if the erratic, unpredictable nature of the stimulus trains was important. Here we compared synchronous audiovisual trains to asynchronous trains, while using a behavioral task requiring detection of higher-intensity target events in either modality. We further varied whether the stimulus trains had predictable temporal pattern or not. Synchrony (versus lag) between auditory and visual trains enhanced behavioral sensitivity (d') to intensity targets in either modality, regardless of predictable versus unpredictable patterning. The analogous contrast in fMRI revealed BOLD increases in several brain areas, including the left STS region reported by Noesselt et al. [2007: J Neurosci 27:11431-11441]. The synchrony effect on BOLD here correlated with the subject-by-subject impact on performance. Predictability of temporal pattern did not affect target detection performance or STS activity, but did lead to an interaction with audiovisual synchrony for BOLD in inferior parietal cortex.",

Because the posterior portion of the pituitary was located in the sella turcica and the hypothalamo-pituitary stalk was intact, the diabetes insipidus was presumed to have been caused by hypothalamic osmoreceptor dysfunction. MRI findings were compatible with alobar holoprosencephaly. In addition, heterotopic gray matter was recognized as a continuous band over a single ventricle.

Since it is well established that clinical impairments and brain atrophy can be detected decades prior to receiving a clinical diagnosis, functional neuroimaging efforts have gained momentum in HD research. In most brain disorders, there is accumulating evidence that the clinical manifestations of disease do not simply depend on the extent of tissue loss, but represent a complex balance among neuronal dysfunction, tissue repair, and circuitry reorganization. Based upon this premise, functional neuroimaging modalities may be more sensitive to the earliest changes in HD than are structural imaging approaches. For this review, PET and fMRI studies conducted in HD samples were summarized. Strengths and limitations of the utilization of functional imaging in HD are discussed and recommendations are offered to facilitate future research endeavors.",

However, EEG recordings that permit the assessment of synchronized neuronal activities at much higher levels of temporal resolution have not yet been simultaneously assessed in multiple individuals and analyzed in the time-frequency domain. In this study, we simultaneously recorded EEG from the brains of each of eight pairs of guitarists playing a short melody together to explore the extent and the functional significance of synchronized cortical activity in the course of interpersonally coordinated actions.\n\nBy applying synchronization algorithms to intra- and interbrain analyses, we found that phase synchronization both within and between brains increased significantly during the periods of (i) preparatory metronome tempo setting and (ii) coordinated play onset. Phase alignment extracted from within-brain dynamics was related to behavioral play onset asynchrony between guitarists.\n\nOur findings show that interpersonally coordinated actions are preceded and accompanied by between-brain oscillatory couplings. Presumably, these couplings reflect similarities in the temporal properties of the individuals' percepts and actions. Whether between-brain oscillatory couplings play a causal role in initiating and maintaining interpersonal action coordination needs to be clarified by further research.",

We report here biochemical evidence for a DNA repair deficiency that correlates with the cytogenetic studies. In the alkaline elution technique, after a pulse label with radioactive thymidine in the presence of 3-acetylaminobenzamide (a G2-phase blocker) and X irradiation, DNA from tumor or cancer-prone cells elutes more rapidly during the postirradiation period than that from normal cells. These results indicate that the DNA of tumor and cancer-prone cells either repairs more slowly or acquires more breaks than that of normal cells; breaks can accumulate during incomplete or deficient repair processes. The kinetic difference between normal and tumor or cancer-prone cells in DNA strand-break repair reaches a maximum within 2 h, and this maximum corresponds to the kinetic difference in chromatid aberration incidence following X irradiation reported previously. These findings support the concept that cells showing enhanced G2 chromatid radiosensitivity are deficient in DNA repair.

Our study aims are to test the hypotheses that using the SIPP (a) may contribute to adequate referral to relevant psychosocial caregivers, (b) should facilitate communication between radiotherapists and cancer patients about psychosocial distress and (c) may prevent underdiagnosis of early symptoms reflecting psychosocial problems. This paper presents the design of a cluster randomised controlled trial (CRCT) evaluating the effectiveness of using the SIPP in cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.\n\nA CRCT is developed using a Solomon four-group design (two intervention and two control groups) to evaluate the effects of using the SIPP. Radiotherapists, instead of cancer patients, are randomly allocated to the experimental or control groups. Within these groups, all included cancer patients are randomised into two subgroups: with and without pre-measurement. Self-reported assessments are conducted at four times: a pre-test at baseline before the first consultation and a post-test directly following the first consultation, and three and 12 months after baseline measurement. The primary outcome measures are the number and types of referrals of cancer patients with psychosocial problems to relevant (psychosocial) caregivers. The secondary outcome measures are patients' satisfaction with the radiotherapist-patient communication, psychosocial distress and quality of life. Furthermore, a process evaluation will be carried out. Data of the effect-evaluation will be analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle and data regarding the types of referrals to health care providers and patient satisfaction about the with radiotherapists will be analysed by means of descriptive techniques. The process evaluation data will also be analysed by means of descriptive techniques.\n\nUsing the SIPP may prevent underdiagnosis of early symptoms reflecting psychosocial problems, should facilitate communication between physicians and patients about psychosocial distress and may contribute to adequate referral to relevant (psychosocial) caregivers.\n\nNCT00859768.",

Models of admission variables predicting log length of stay and log charges were developed using multiple linear regression. The \"smearing\" technique of Duan adjusted for logarithmic retransformation was used in calculating each subject's predicted length of stay and charges. R2 values were calculated. There were two secondary analyses. In one, the result of admission blood culture was entered as a potential covariate. In the second, to evaluate the appropriateness of basing models on automated case-finding without discharge summary review, the authors rederived the models using all of the encounters (n = 160) identified by the algorithm, which had included three false-positive cases.\n\nMean length of stay was 6.45 days. Mean charges were $11,967. Absolute monocyte count at admission was a significant, independent negative predictor of length of stay and charges. Underlying cancer diagnosis also was significant. Charges were highest for acute myeloid leukemia, followed by central nervous system tumors, other solid tumors, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphomas. Length of stay was highest for acute myeloid leukemia, followed by central nervous system tumors, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphomas, and other solid tumors. Absolute monocyte count and tumor type were the major components of the model, but admission temperature (for both administrative outcomes) and the presence of localized infection (for length of stay) also were significant predictors. R2 values were 35.3% (charges) and 38.5% (length of stay), with validation R2 values of 26.6% and 29.2%, respectively. Entering bacteremia as a covariate improved the models. Inclusion of the three false-positive cases generated models with only a modest loss of accuracy; it introduced over-and underreporting of some of the less significant predictors but did not disrupt the ability to identify the major predictors, absolute monocyte count and tumor type.\n\nThe clinical variables that were significant in this study account, in validation R2 estimates, for more than 25% of the variability in administrative outcomes for encounters of fever and neutropenia. Adjusting length of stay and charges for these clinical variables would allow for a fairer comparison of institutions and individual providers. The electronic case-finding algorithm served as an efficient way to identify absolute monocyte count and tumor type as the major predictors and provided a conservative estimate of R2.",

Clinicopathological factors and postoperative outcomes were compared between high and low subgroups of MCs or Tregs. Compared to low denstiy, higher peritumoral MCs were associated with poorer clinical outcomes, and independently related to elevated 5-year recurrence incidence (54.1%vs 39.2%, P = 0.026). High-dense MCs were especially related to increased probability of early recurrence (within 2 years) (P = 0.004). We also found that peritumoral Tregs were positively correlated with MCs in density (r = 0.353, P < 0.001) and reversely related to HCC outcomes. Notably, MCs in combination with Tregs displayed better prognostic performances than MCs alone (area under curve [AUC](survival) = 0.629 vs 0.589, AUC(recurrence) = 0.632 vs 0.591). Moreover, MCs were positively correlated to alanine aminotransferase, a serum inflammatory marker (P = 0.014).

The final, optimized process consisted of: a red cell lysis step, immunomagnetically staining leukocytes with an anti-CD45 PE, anti- MACS sandwich, immunomagnetic sorting using a flow-through system (QMS), and a final cell analysis step using either an automated cell counter, filtration, and visual counting or a cytospin analysis.\n\nThe final, optimized process produced a final enrichment of the rare cancer cells of 5.17 log(10) and an average, final recovery of 46%. It should be noted that a negative depletion protocol was used (i.e., no labeling of the rare cancer cells was used).\n\nTo the authors' knowledge, no examples in the literature exist of a 5.17 log(10) enrichment of cancer cells in human blood using a negative depletion protocol. The closest example is a 4 log(10) enrichment in which two positive magnetic cell separation steps were used (none were used in this study).

However, it is unknown how various acquisition parameters that determine k-space sampling affect the accuracy of motion correction in PROPELLER and Turboprop MRI. The goal of this work was to evaluate the accuracy of motion correction in both techniques, to identify an optimal rotation correction approach, and determine acquisition strategies for optimal motion correction. It was demonstrated that blades with multiple lines allow more accurate estimation of motion than blades with fewer lines. Also, it was shown that Turboprop MRI is less sensitive to motion than PROPELLER. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the number of blades does not significantly affect motion correction.

In fact, the likelihood of the data under complex stochastic models is often analytically or numerically intractable in many areas of sciences. This makes it even more important to simultaneously investigate the adequacy of these models-in absolute terms, against the data, rather than relative to the performance of other models-but no such procedure has been formally discussed when the likelihood is intractable. We provide a statistical interpretation to current developments in likelihood-free Bayesian inference that explicitly accounts for discrepancies between the model and the data, termed Approximate Bayesian Computation under model uncertainty (ABCmicro). We augment the likelihood of the data with unknown error terms that correspond to freely chosen checking functions, and provide Monte Carlo strategies for sampling from the associated joint posterior distribution without the need of evaluating the likelihood. We discuss the benefit of incorporating model diagnostics within an ABC framework, and demonstrate how this method diagnoses model mismatch and guides model refinement by contrasting three qualitative models of protein network evolution to the protein interaction datasets of Helicobacter pylori and Treponema pallidum. Our results make a number of model deficiencies explicit, and suggest that the T. pallidum network topology is inconsistent with evolution dominated by link turnover or lateral gene transfer alone.",

The analog of ray diagrams, but for electrons, are constructed to help the visualization of the process of compressing electron packets. It is shown that such temporal lenses not only compensate for electron pulse broadening due to velocity dispersion but also allow compression of the packets to durations much shorter than their initial widths.

The autofluorescence measurement at four different excitation wavelengths 320, 370, 410, and 470 nm, were carried out for five different brain tumor types: glioma, astrocytoma, meningioma, pituitary adenoma, and schwannoma.\n\nThe fluorescence spectra of tumor tissues showed significant differences, both in intensity and in spectral profile, from those of adjacent normal brain tissues at all four excitation wavelengths. The data were then subjected to multivariate statistical analysis and the sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each group. Of the four excitation wavelengths being considered, 470 nm appeared to be the optimal wavelength for detecting tissue fluorescence of brain tumor tissues.\n\nIn conclusion, the spectroscopic luminescence measurements carried out in this study revealed significant differences between tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue of human brains for all the tumor types tested, except for pituitary adenoma. From the results of this study we conclude that excitation wavelengths ranging from 410-470 nm are most suitable for the detection of brain tumor tissue.

This model encompasses the classical radial distortion model [5], fisheyes, and most central or noncentral catadioptric cameras. Calibration consists in the estimation of the distortion center, the opening angles of all viewing cones, and their optical centers. We present two approaches of computing a full calibration from dense correspondences of a single or multiple planes with known euclidean structure. The first one is based on a geometric constraint linking viewing cones and their intersections with the calibration plane (conic sections). The second approach is a homography-based method.

Transfection of expression vector pcDNA3.1-TAp63gamma into EC9706 resulted in TAp63gamma expression, and peak level apoptosis was observed 24 h after the transfection disclosed by DNA fragmentation assay. In addition, it was found with Western blot that AIF and Bit1 were released into cytosol from mitochondria, and AIF was further translocated into nucleus, during the stage of TAp63gamma-induced cell apoptosis. Down-regulation of either AIF or Bit1 by RNA interference could, however, alleviate TAp63gamma-induced cell apoptosis. In conclusion, TAp63gamma could induce apoptosis in human esophageal squamous cancer EC9706 cells, through at least releasing AIF and Bit1 from mitochindria into cytosol and nucleus, where apoptotic cascade takes place.

For average RNFL, there was also a highly significant linear relationship between Stratus minus Cirrus difference and RNFL thickness (P<0.001). Bland-Altman plots showed that the systematic difference of Stratus measurements are smaller than Cirrus at thinner RNFL values but larger at thicker RNFL values.\n\nRNFL thickness measurements between Stratus OCT and Cirrus OCT cannot be directly compared.

Based on the feature vectors, the texture are then recursively merged, giving rise to larger and more complex textures, which appear at different scales of observation: accordingly, the model is named Hierarchical Multiple Markov Chain (H-MMC). The Texture Fragmentation and Reconstruction (TFR) algorithm, addresses the unsupervised segmentation problem based on the H-MMC model. The \"fragmentation\" step allows one to find the elementary textures of the model, while the \"reconstruction\" step defines the hierarchical image segmentation based on a probabilistic measure (texture score) which takes into account both region scale and inter-region interactions.

These oligonucleotides are pre-synthesized and sequence-optimized to represent specific genes with minimal cross-hybridization to homologous genes. Probe length and concentration are critical factors for signal sensitivity, particularly when genes with various expression levels are being tested. We evaluated the effects of oligonucleotide probe length and concentration on signal intensity measurements of the expression levels of genes in a target sample.\n\nSelected genes of various expression levels in a single cell line were hybridized to oligonucleotide arrays of four lengths and four concentrations of probes to determine how these critical parameters affected the intensity of the signal representing their expression. We found that oligonucleotides of longer length significantly increased the signals of genes with low-expression in the target. High-expressing gene signals were also boosted but to a lesser degree. Increasing the probe concentration, however, did not linearly increase the signal intensity for either low- or high-expressing genes.\n\nWe conclude that the longer the oligonuclotide probe the better the signal intensities of low expressing genes on oligonucleotide arrays.",

This assay utilizes the technique of salt solubilization to isolate nuclear receptors and employs standard saturation analysis for T3 and T4 to determine maximal binding capacity (MBC) and equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd). We have determined that 11 normal subjects had a MBC for T3 of 1.20 +/- 0.20 pmol/mg DNA (+/- SE) and a Kd of 3.4 +/- 0.2 X 10(-10) M; the T4 MBC was 8.44 +/- 1.22 pmol/mg DNA and the Kd was 2.7 +/- 0.3 X 10(-10) M. Hypothyroid patients had a mean T3 MBC of 7.32 +/- 2.28 pmol/mg DNA and a mean T4 MBC of 40.04 +/- 21.36 pmol/mg DNA (P less than 0.05 compared to normal). Obese subjects (n = 12) had a basal fed MBC that was 0.66 +/- 0.13 pmol/mg DNA for T3 (P less than 0.05 compared to normal) and was 3.58 +/- 0.56 pmol/mg DNA for T4 (P less than 0.01 compared to normal). During fasting, the average T3 MBC increased to 1.43 +/- 0.31 pmol/mg DNA and the average T4 MBC increased to 9.63 +/- 2.46 pmol/mg DNA, values that are both significantly higher than those in the fed period; the dissociation constants were unaltered in obese subjects (compared to normals) in fed and fasting states. Gel filtration with 0.5 M agarose was employed to ascertain if the physicochemical properties of the solubilized mononuclear human cell receptor were similar to those previously observed in rat and human liver and kidney receptors. The elution profile obtained was similar to that reported earlier. The major binding activity has an estimated Stokes radius of 35 A and a molecular weight ratio of approximately 50,000 daltons. These studies indicate that: 1) high affinity T3 and T4 receptors exist in human mononuclear cells and have properties similar to those for T3 and T4 described previously in rat liver; 2) T3 and T4 receptor number tends to increase in hypothyroid subjects and tend to be lower in obese patients than in normal weight control subjects; 3) fasting is associated with an increase in both T3 and T4 MBC; and 4) despite their apparent physicochemical similarity, T3 receptors in rat liver and human mononuclear cells may be regulated differently, at least during fasting since hepatic T3 receptors decrease in the fasted rat. Collectively, these observations support the concept that human white cell T3 nuclear receptor binding is capable of rapid fluctuations, suggesting a mechanism for homeostatic regulation of T3 action.",

In trial I, medical students volunteered to take 100 mg, 500 mg of pyridoxine a day or placebo for 10 days. A digit coding test was performed before, and at the end of the treatment period and a third 15 days later. The improvement of performance from the first to the third test (learning effect) was significantly better in the placebo group than in the B6 treated groups. This could be attributed to memorization of skills. Trial II was performed in obese patients starting a low calorie diet in whom vitamins are routinely prescribed. Performance in a work recognition test and in a visual retention test was lower for the group receiving 1 g of pyridoxine a day. Thus, high doses of oral pyridoxine are likely to impair memorization in man. Disturbances of neuro-transmitter metabolism such as increase of GABA production might explain the effect. As the benefit of high doses of pyridoxine has not been well-documented and as the study has suggested that undesired effects may indeed exist, the widespread use of such doses is questionable.",

We find that the induction of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cytokines is suppressed in mice with DIO and in bone marrow macrophages (BMMPhi) from mice with DIO exposed to an oral pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis. BMMPhi from lean mice pre-treated with free fatty acids (FFAs) and exposed to P. gingivalis also exhibit a diminished induction of iNOS and cytokines. BMMPhi from lean and obese mice exposed to P. gingivalis and analyzed by a phosphorylation protein array show a reduction of Akt only in BMMPhi from mice with DIO. This reduction is responsible for diminished NF-kappaB activation and diminished induction of iNOS and cytokines. We next observed that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is suppressed in BMMPhi from DIO mice whereas carboxy-terminal modulator protein (CTMP), a known suppressor of Akt phosphorylation, is elevated. This elevation stems from defective TLR2 signaling. In BMMPhi from lean mice, both FFAs and TNF-alpha--via separate pathways--induce an increase in CMTP. However, in BMMPhi from DIO mice, TLR2 can no longer inhibit the TNF-alpha-induced increase in CTMP caused by P. gingivalis challenge. This defect can then be restored by transfecting WT TLR2 into BMMPhi from DIO mice. Thus, feeding mice a high-fat diet over time elevates the CTMP intracellular pool, initially via FFAs activating TLR2 and later when the defective TLR2 is unable to inhibit TNF-alpha-induced CTMP. These findings unveil a link between obesity and innate immunity.",

Here, we compare the concordance between %fat from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and BAI, and between %fat and BMI, in European-American adults (n = 623). Agreement between BAI, BMI, and %fat was assessed using Lin's concordance coefficients (ρ(c)), where values &<.90 are considered poor. In the sample as a whole, the agreement between BAI and %fat (ρ(c) = 0.752) was far better than that between BMI and %fat (ρ(c) = 0.445) but was nonetheless relatively poor. There were large mean differences in %fat between the BAI and DXA %fat, particularly at lower levels of adiposity (&<0%), and further the BAI overestimated %fat in males and underestimated %fat in females. Optimizing the BAI formula for our sample only marginally improved performance. Results of the present study show that BAI provides a better indicator of adiposity in European-American adults than does BMI, but does not provide valid estimates of %fat, particularly at lower levels of body fatness. Further research is warranted to investigate the predictive ability of BAI for various health outcomes.",

    "originalString": "This manuscript describes how the permeability of pulmonary artery microvascular endothelial cell (RPMEC) monolayer is elevated by hypoxia and the role played by HSP27 phosphorylation. p38 MAP kinase activation leading to HSP27 phosphorylation was previously shown by our laboratory to alter the actin cytoskeleton and tethering properties of RPMEC. This effect was independent of hypoxia-induced contractility which was ROCK-dependent rather than HSP27-dependent. Results described here show that increased HSP27 phosphorylation not only does not underlie hypoxia-induced permeability, but may actually augment the endothelial barrier. Hypoxia causes gap formation between RPMEC and increases MLC2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of MYPT1, which inhibits MLC2 phosphatase, is also increased in hypoxia. In addition, FAK phosphorylation, which alters focal adhesion signaling, is increased in hypoxia. Overexpressing phosphomimicking HSP27 (pmHSP27), which induces significant actin stress fiber formation, surprisingly renders RPMEC resistant to hypoxia- or TGFbeta-induced permeability. siRNA against pmHSP27 reverses the increased actin stress fiber formation in pmHSP27-overexpressing cells, and disrupting actin stress fibers in pmHSP27-overexpressing RPMEC renders them more susceptible to hypoxia. Finally, hypoxia-induced gap formation, as well as phosphorylation of MLC2, MYPT1 and FAK are almost abolished by overexpressing pmHSP27 in RPMEC. These effects of pmHSP27 overexpression might represent decreased cytoskeletal plasticity and increased tethering which counteracts permeability-inducing contractility. Thus hypoxia activates two pathways one leading to contractility and increased permeability, the other leading to actin stress fibers, stronger adhesion, and reduced permeability. Altering HSP27 phosphorylation, which tips the balance towards decreased permeability, might be targeted in managing endothelial barrier dysfunction.",

Although CXCL10 could be induced by IFN-gamma depending on cell type, the mechanisms regulating CXCL10 production following treatment with combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha have not been adequately elucidated in human monocytes. In this study, we showed that TNF-alpha had more potential than IFN-gamma to induce CXCL10 production in THP-1 monocytes. Furthermore, IFN-gamma synergistically enhanced the production of CXCL10 in parallel with the activation of NF-kappaB in TNF-alpha-stimulated THP-1 cells. Blockage of STAT1 or NF-kappaB suppressed CXCL10 production. JAKs inhibitors suppressed IFN-gamma plus TNF-alpha-induced production of CXCL10 in parallel with activation of STAT1 and NF-kappaB, while ERK inhibitor suppressed production of CXCL10 as well as activation of NF-kappaB, but not that of STAT1. IFN-gamma-induced phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2, whereas TNF-alpha induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Interestingly, IFN-gamma alone had no effect on phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha, whereas it significantly promoted TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha. These results suggest that TNF-alpha induces CXCL10 production by activating NF-kappaB through ERK and that IFN-gamma induces CXCL10 production by increasing the activation of STAT1 through JAKs pathways. Of note, TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB may be the primary pathway contributing to CXCL10 production in THP-1 cells. IFN-gamma potentiates TNF-alpha-induced CXCL10 production in THP-1 cells by increasing the activation of STAT1 and NF-kappaB through JAK1 and JAK2.",

Here, we provide genetic evidence that 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) signaling in oocytes preserves reproductive lifespan by maintaining the survival of ovarian primordial follicles. In mice lacking the PDK1-encoding gene Pdk1 in oocytes, the majority of primordial follicles are depleted around the onset of sexual maturity, causing premature ovarian failure (POF) during early adulthood. We further showed that suppressed PDK1-Akt-p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)-ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) signaling in oocytes appears to be responsible for the loss of primordial follicles, and mice lacking the Rps6 gene in oocytes show POF similar to that in Pdk1-deficient mice. In combination with our earlier finding that phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in oocytes suppresses follicular activation, we have now pinpointed the molecular network involving phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/PTEN-PDK1 signaling in oocytes that controls the survival, loss and activation of primordial follicles, which together determine reproductive aging and the length of reproductive life in females. Underactivation or overactivation of this signaling pathway in oocytes is shown to cause pathological conditions in the ovary, including POF and infertility.",

The alpha 6A beta 1 and alpha 6B beta 1 receptors induced marked quantitative differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins after binding to laminin. Specifically, the alpha 6A cytoplasmic domain was more effective than the alpha 6B cytoplasmic domain in inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of three major proteins (molecular mass, 120, 110, and 76 kDa). In addition to these proteins, we also observed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein paxillin was increased significantly more by alpha 6A beta 1 integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin than by that of alpha 6B beta 1. This differential pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation induction does not appear to be a secondary event initiated by cell shape changes.

We compare the antitumor efficacy of anti-HER2/neu pH-triggered lipid vesicles encapsulating doxorubicin to the anti-HER2/neu form of an FDA approved liposomal doxorubicin of DSPC/cholesterol-based vesicles. The HER2/neu receptor is chosen due to its abundance in human breast cancers and its connection to low prognosis. On a subcutaneous murine BT474 xenograft model, superior control of tumor growth is demonstrated by targeted pH-triggered vesicles relative to targeted DSPC/cholesterol-based vesicles (35% vs. 19% decrease in tumor volume after 32 days upon initiation of treatment). Superior tumor control is also confirmed on SKBR3 subcutaneous xenografts of lower HER2/neu expression. The non-targeted form of pH-triggered vesicles encapsulating doxorubicin results also in better tumor control relative to the non-targeted DSPC/cholesterol-based vesicles (34% vs. 41% increase in tumor volume). Studies in BT474 multicellular spheroids suggest that the observed efficacy could be attributed to release of doxorubicin directly into the acidic tumor interstitium from pH-triggered vesicles extravasated into the tumor but not internalized by cancer cells. pH-triggered liposome carriers engineered from gel-phase bilayers that reversibly phase-separate with lowering pH, form transiently defective interfacial boundaries resulting in fast release of encapsulated doxorubicin.

Prompted by this hypothesis, we undertook this study to determine whether CENP-B interacts with chemokine receptors on the surface of human PASMCs, to explore the relevant signaling pathways, and to characterize the effects of anti-CENP-B binding on SMC stimulation.\n\nTo demonstrate the expression of specific chemokine receptors by human PASMCs at both the messenger RNA and protein levels, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry analyses were performed.

Transactivation of the EGFR through CCR3 was found to be a critical pathway that elicits MAP kinase activation and secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-8.

The rat embryonic MHC polypeptide is encoded by exons 3 to 41 and contains 1939 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 223,900. Its amino acid sequence displays the structural features typical for all sarcomeric MHCs, i.e. an amino-terminal \"globular\" head region and a carboxy-terminal alpha-helical rod portion that shows the characteristics of a coiled coil with a superimposed 28-residue repeat pattern interrupted at only four positions by \"skip\" residues. The complex structure of the rat embryonic MHC gene and the conservation of intron locations in this and other MHC genes are indicative of a highly split ancestral sarcomeric MHC gene. Introns in the rat embryonic gene interrupt the coding sequence at the boundaries separating the proteolytic subfragments of the head, but not at the head/rod junction or between the 28-residue repeats present within the rod. Therefore, there is little evidence for exon shuffling and intron-dependent evolution by gene duplication as a mechanism for the generation of the ancestral MHC gene. Rather, intron insertion into a previously non-split ancestral MHC rod gene consisting of multiple tandemly arranged 28-residue-encoding repeats, or convergent evolution of an originally non-repetitive ancestral MHC rod gene must account for the observed structure of the rod-encoding portion of present-day MHC genes.",

NbRae1 was mainly associated with the nuclear envelope during interphase, and NbRae1 deficiency caused accumulation of poly(A) RNA in the nuclei of leaf cells, suggesting defective mRNA export. In the shoot apex, depletion of NbRae1 led to reduced mitotic activities, accompanied by reduced cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity and decreased expression of cyclin B1, CDKB1-1, and histones H3 and H4. The secondary growth of stem vasculature was also inhibited, indicating reduced cambial activities. Differentiated leaf cells of NbRae1-silenced plants exhibited elevated ploidy levels. Immunolabeling in BY-2 cells showed that NbRae1 protein localized to mitotic microtubules and the cell plate-forming zone during mitosis, and recombinant NbRae1 directly bound to microtubules in vitro. Inhibition of NbRae1 expression in BY-2 cells using a beta-estradiol-inducible RNAi system resulted in severe defects in spindle organization and chromosome alignment and segregation, which correlated with delays in cell cycle progression. Together, these results suggest that NbRae1 plays a dual role in mRNA export in interphase and in spindle assembly in mitosis.",

In this study, we identifed miRNAs associated with the differentiation status of liposarcoma to gain insight into the basis for its progression. miRNA expression profiles determined in human tumors and normal fat specimens identified a dedifferentiated tumor expression signature consisting of 35 miRNAs. Deregulated miRNA expression was confirmed in a second independent sample cohort. The miR-155 was the most overexpressed miRNA and functional investigations assigned an important role in the growth of dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell lines. Transient or stable knockdown of miR-155 retarded tumor cell growth, decreased colony formation, and induced G(1)-S cell-cycle arrest in vitro and blocked tumor growth in murine xenografts in vivo. We identified casein kinase 1α (CK1α) as a direct target of miR-155 control which enhanced β-catenin signaling and cyclin D1 expression, promoting tumor cell growth. In summary, our results point to important functions for miR-155 and β-catenin signaling in progression of liposarcoma, revealing mechanistic vulnerabilities that might be exploited for both prognostic and therapeutic purposes.",

    "originalString": "Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domains occur in proteins of either the epsin or epsin-related (epsinR) form. They principally function in clathrin-mediated trafficking and membrane deformation. Both epsin and epsinR possess clathrin-binding motifs, but only epsin incorporates a ubiquitin-interaction motif (UIM). To better understand the origins of ENTH-domain proteins and their functions, we performed detailed comparative genomics and phylogenetics on the epsin family. The epsin ENTH-UIM configuration is an architecture restricted to yeast and animals. Further, we undertook functional analysis in Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a divergent organism possessing a single ENTH-domain protein (TbEpsinR). TbEpsinR has a cellular location similar to both epsin and epsinR at plasma membrane clathrin budding sites and endosomal compartments, and associates with clathrin, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation. Knockdown of TbEpsinR leads to a significant decrease in the intracellular pools of multiple surface antigens, without affecting bulk membrane internalization. Therefore, despite lacking the UIM, TbEpsinR maintains a similar role to metazoan epsin in endocytosis and participates as a clathrin-associated adaptor. We suggest that recruitment of a UIM to the ENTH-domain proteins was not essential for participation in endocytosis of ubiquitylated molecules, and is presumably a specific innovation restricted to higher eukaryotes.",

Substitutions in brevinin-1VLd (Lys(11) --> Asn) and brevinin-1VLe (Lys(11) --> Ser) that decrease cationicity result in loss of activity against E. coli.

EST gene discovery efforts utilizing desiccated gametophytes have identified two cDNAs designated Elipa and Elipb with significant similarity to early light-inducible proteins (ELIPs). Elipa is 1006 bp in length, encoding a 212 amino acid deduced polypeptide (ELIPa) with a predicted molecular mass of 23.3 kDa and pI of 5.57. Elipb is 997 bp in length, encoding a 224 amino acid deduced polypeptide (ELIPb) with a predicted molecular mass of 24.4 kDa and pI of 9.27. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that ELIPa and ELIPb are reproducibly grouped with ELIP sequences derived from desiccation-tolerance tissues. RNA blot hybridization was used to analyse Elipa and Elipb mRNA abundance in response to a variety of stresses. Elipa steady-state transcript levels increased in response to slow desiccation, rapid desiccation/rehydration, salinity, ABA, and rehydration in high light. The Elipb transcript was only detectable in response to ABA or rehydration in high light. It is postulated that ELIPa and ELIPb are an adaptive response to stress-induced photodamage within the moss chloroplast, and play a key role in the protection and/or repair of the photosynthetic apparatus.",

Viral regulatory regions in PCR-amplified urine and the lung samples were identical to the archetypal structure, WWT. In the brain and CSF, a rearranged sequence predominated, however. A 94-bp deletion preceded a 71-bp tandem duplication because the same 94-bp segment was deleted from both copies. PCR-amplified regulatory region products were cloned and sequenced to define further the extent of the rearranged structures. Two kidney clones were archetypal, whereas two others were rearranged differently from the brain and from each other. In contrast to the brain clones, the kidney rearrangements seemed to involve deletion after duplication. Three of four brain clones sequenced were identical to the rearrangement found to dominate in the PCR product. A fourth clone showed two short deletions without any duplication. The four CSF clones all showed rearrangements identical to that which was amplified by PCR from CSF and brain. This represents the first molecular analysis of a BKV strain obtained from a central nervous system infection, and it reveals regulatory region rearrangements reminiscent of those described in JC virus from brains with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. We suggest that the presence in the CSF of BKV with a dominant rearranged regulatory region may be useful in the diagnosis of BKV meningoencephalitis secondary to BKV nephritis.",

To study the possibility of an autocrine growth mechanism in bladder carcinoma, we investigated the ability of various bladder carcinoma cell lines to proliferate in serum-free medium. A rat bladder carcinoma cell line, BC47, demonstrated exponential and density-dependent growth in serum-free medium. Furthermore, conditioned medium from BC47 cells induced growth-stimulating activity for BC47 cells themselves. Purification and further characterization of this activity was performed by chromatographic methods, SDS-PAGE and N-terminal amino acid analysis. Finally, we have identified that a transferrin-like 70-kDa protein is found to be the main growth-promoting factor in this conditioned medium. In addition, specific antibodies against transferrin and the transferrin-receptor inhibit the in vitro growth of this cell line. Our data suggest that this transferrin-like factor possibly acts as an autocrine growth factor for cancer cells.",

This instability of c-Fos may be important in regulation of the normal cell cycle. Here we report a mechanism for degradation of c-Fos. Coexpression of c-Fos and c-Jun in HeLa cells caused marked increase in the instability of c-Fos, whereas v-Fos, the retroviral counterpart of c-Fos, was stable irrespective of the coexpression of c-Jun. Interestingly, deletion of the C-terminal PEST region of c-Fos, which is altered in v-Fos by a frameshift mutation, greatly enhanced its stability, with loss of the effect of c-Jun on its stability. c-Fos synthesized in vitro was degraded by the 26S proteasome in a ubiquitin-dependent fashion. Simple association with c-Jun had no effect on the degradation of c-Fos, but the additions of three protein kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase, casein kinase II, and CDC2 kinase, resulted in marked acceleration of its degradation by the proteasome-ubiquitin system, though only in the presence of c-Jun. In contrast, v-Fos and c-Fos with a truncated PEST motif were not degraded, suggesting that they escaped from down-regulation by breakdown. These findings indicate a new oncogenic pathway induced by acquisition of intracellular stability of a cell cycle modulatory factor.",

Cells of a gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase-overproducing transformant of E. coli K-12 were fractionated and the localization of the enzyme was examined by Western blot analysis. The periplasmic fraction only contained the mature form of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, membrane fraction only contained the precursor of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, and no precursor of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction. Amino acid residues at the cleavage site for processing into the large and small subunits were substituted by site-directed mutagenesis. The processing phenotypes of six mutants were examined by Western blot analysis, and their gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activities were measured. Mutations at the N-terminal amino acid residues of the small subunit (Thr-391, Thr-392, and His-393) prevented the maturation of the enzyme and the immature mutants exhibited no enzymatic activity. A mutation at the C-terminal residue of the large subunit (Gln-390) had less effect on the processing and enzymatic activity. These results suggest that the sequence of threonyl-threonyl-histidinyl residues at the N-terminal of the small subunit is very important for the processing of E. coli K-12 gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and this processing is essential to the expression of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity of E. coli K-12.",

We recently used recombinant adenovirus vectors that transiently expressed urokinase from mouse hepatocytes to induce hepatocellular regeneration in place of a partial hepatectomy. The adenovirus method allowed for five-fold more efficient retrovirus transduction in vivo compared to the conventional partial hepatectomy approach. The major problem with the urokinase-mediated hepatic regeneration was the transient secretion of urokinase into the bloodstream that led to hypocoagulation. To circumvent this side-effect, the urokinase protein was modified by adding amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal endoplasmic reticulum retention signals. The recombinant urokinase molecules expressed from adenoviral vectors remained in hepatocytes, were enzymatically active, and resulted in similar rates of hepatic regeneration as found with the secreted urokinase. Modified urokinase-mediated liver regeneration was equally capable of allowing retrovirus-mediated gene transfer in vivo. Thus, the method of direct retrovirus transduction of hepatocytes becomes clinically relevant as the technology becomes safer.",
